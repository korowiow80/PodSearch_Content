            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Hello everyone, this is Steve here and welcome to GopherHaul. If you haven&apos;t started your business yet, what are you waiting for, if you don&apos;t start your business this year, you&apos;ll be at least one year older when you do, so get started today.

Today we have a great topic to talk about. We&apos;re going to be talking about how lawn care marketing can help you replace bad customers.

Before we dive into that, I want to point out a few tools to help your business grow. I have just released my latest book and ebook entitled How To Get Commercial Lawn Care And Snow Plow Customers. It&apos;s available online at book stores like amazon. This book and ebook will walk you through the process of getting and dealing with commercial customers. It can be very difficult to make the jump from residential customers to commercial ones if you don&apos;t know the process. But this book will help make it easy for you to take that jump. 

Also if you have an Android phone, visit the android store and search for the GopherHaul Lawn Care Estimators. There are six different ones that cover different types of jobs you may be bidding on. Such as lawn mowing, snow plowing, pressure washing and mulch jobs. Take the guesstimate out of your estimate with these lawn care business calculators.

Now back to our topic. One of the many benefits of always doing some sort of lawn care marketing is you gain new customers. Now that is a good thing, but there is an even better benefit than that. You can get to the point where you donâ??t have to take every customer that calls. Instead you can be picky and find the ones that work best for you. As we will see in this discussion from the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum, having the power to choose who you service can make all the difference in world.

If you are in need of free lawn care marketing material for your lawn care business, please visit our site at http://www.gophersoftware.com. We have hundreds of free lawn care logo, flyer, door hanger and web templates you can download and use for your lawn care business. We also have free lawn care business contracts, estimate and proposal forms. Download our trial version of Gopher Lawn Care Business Software.

            <description>Most people tend to have a fear of public speaking and trying to sell to new people is right behind it. So if you have a fear of public speaking and donâ??t feel comfortable selling, what is the best way for you to utilize door to door marketing in your lawn care business? That is the question asked on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum and quite a few responses came from it which surely will help you improve your lawn care marketing techniques.

One lawn care business owner wrote â??how many of you guys market door to door as in ringing the doorbell and talking to people one on one, not just leave a flyer and leave? How effective is this method of marketing as opposed to just leaving a flyer? If you donâ??t go door to door, why not? Are you afraid of disturbing them? That is my biggest reason for not doing it. Any insight?â??

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - A big mistake new lawn care business owners make early on is not knowing what their hourly operating costs are. You need to know this figure to accurately bid jobs and make a profit on each and every job. To calculate this figure, you need to add up all your operating costs for the year and divide that by the total amount of man hours you work during that year. As we will see in this discussion from the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum, there are many ways you can go off track when calculating these costs, so letâ??s look at an example to clear up the common errors.

Today we have a great topic to talk about. We&apos;re going to be talking about lawn care marketing tips.

Ok so before we dive into that, I want to point out a few tools to help your business grow. I have just released my latest updated ebook entitled How To Get Customers For Your Landscaping And Lawn Care Business All Year Long. Vol. 1. It&apos;s available online at book stores like amazon and apple&apos;s itunes store. This ebook is chock full of lawn care marketing tips I learned throughout the years that will most certainly help you grow. It&apos;s also available in a paperback version.

We can learn a lot from a professional marketeer. They see a lot of marketing concepts all day long and experiment with more marketing in a week than most of us will experiment with in our career. So when they have something to say, I like to pay attention to them. Here a member of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum shared with us his views on what it takes to succeed and what to avoid so as not to fail with your marketing and running your business.</description>

One lawn care business owner wrote â??I live in New York state and we just got over a lot of snow storms this winter. The snow is probably about 2 feet high on the grass right now as I write this. My question is, when is the best time to advertise my spring clean ups and regular weekly lawn maintenance? Keep in mind there is still 2 feet of snow on the ground. So does it matter when I do it?â??

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - The right way to price mowing or a yard cleanup seems to be the most popular question asked on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum. Many new lawn care business owners simply don&apos;t understand how to correctly do this. The process of proper bidding concepts can be very difficult to wrap your mind around.

To help shed more light on this topic, a lawn care business owner shared with us how he comes up with the prices he charges. As you will see here, there is a method to it and it is scientific. If you find yourself on a job site guessing what you should charge, you need to rethink your bidding procedures.

A member of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum had an interesting question along these lines when he asked â??if you are providing lawn care for a customer and a storm occurs that causes sticks and leaves to fall on the lawn, you obviously canâ??t cut the lawn with out moving the debris first. How do you go about charging extra for yard clean up? Or do you even charge them?

I guess I am stuck on at what point do you start charging extra for picking up and blowing leaves.â??

But what leaf removal methods are the fastest? That is what one lawn care business owner questioned on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum when he wrote Ã¢??What is the best and most efficient way to pick up leaves?

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Hello everyone and welcome to GopherHaul. If you haven&apos;t started your business yet, what are you waiting for. If you don&apos;t start your business this year, you&apos;ll be at least one year older when you do so get started today.
Today we have a great topic to talk about. Lawn care marketing ideas you can use in the fall to promote your leaf clean up services. I have a couple of low cost tips that will really give you a chance to stand out from your competitors.

Before I get into that, I just wanted to say, if you are interested in learning more about running your lawn care or landscaping business, you have to get on my Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum at www.gopherforum.com and also read my lawn care business marketing blog at www.lawnchat.com. Both sites are chock full of free information on how to successfully run your business. 

While you are at it, you can continue your research with my lawn care business books available on my sites and at amazon. Check out The GopherHaul Guide on How to get customers for your lawn care business. The big lawn care marketing book. The GopherHaul Extreme lawn care business tips book and The Landscaping &amp; Lawn Care Business Plan Startup Guide. All of these books will help your business grow. 

Now let&apos;s look at a couple of great lawn care marketing ideas that came up on the Gopher Forum for Fall. 

If you are out in your area raking up leaves and you want to promote the service further to neighbors in the area, why not try this. Get some pumpkin leaf bags and on the blank side of the bag, use a stencil to spray in your lawn care business phone number and maybe the words leaf cleanup. Use one of these bags per job. When you leave them out on the curb, they will really attract attention. Fill a couple of these up and leave them at the corner of heavily traveled intersections as well. 

You could even take this idea one step further and put up an inflatable halloween display on your property and maybe at the home of your family or friends in town as well to help promote your services further. 
Use a stencil on the inflatable display and spray paint on it Leaf Clean up and your contact info. Or you could use some vinyl lettering as well. This display would help you attract customer day and night. 

Keep these ideas in mind the next time you have some time on your hands and are looking to attract more customers. So until the next time we meet, always remember to dream it, build it, gopher it.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - What would you do if you received a phone call from a local landscaping company and they offered to give you all their lawn care customers? Would you find this to be a curse or a blessing? At first glance it may seem like a fantastic opportunity to jump on, however there are many issues to consider. This is a situation a member of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum was facing when he wrote us about it. How much growth is helpful and how much is too much?

He wrote â??I just got a call from another landscaping company in town who has been doing yard care as well as landscaping. He wanted to know if I would be interested in taking on his yard care clients as he has decided to concentrate on landscaping only. He is willing to turn them over to me, however I am not in the position of being able to handle them all. It would increase my client base by 200%, which would require hiring guys. The extra work would be awesome, but here are my issues.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - A great way to get jobs is to keep your eyes open when you are out driving around town. If you see a site that seems like it could use your services, donâ??t wait for the land owner to come to you, go to them. That is exactly what this lawn care business owner did and as soon as he decided to be proactive, he found a lot more work. He shared his story with us on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

He wrote â??I have a huge cemetery right next to my house. It is also right next to a school. Well in the winter months, I noticed that the sidewalks were not taken care of at all and the kids were walking in the street to avoid the sidewalk. The sidewalk is long too, about 1 mile if you add it up the total length.

Since I offer snow removal services in the winter, I thought this would be a great bid to land so I politely called them to ask if my company could take care of the sidewalk for them. They initially told me they were not responsible for the sidewalks and therefore did not need for me to remove the snow. I thought they were mistaken and decided investigate this further. I then called the city to see who is responsible for these sidewalks and they told me the cemetery was!

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Itâ??s fascinating the lessons learned by new lawn care business owners who leave their full time jobs to go off on their own and start their own business. A member of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum shared with us some of the issues he ran into when he got started. He wrote Itâ??s one thing to manage a business for someone but itâ??s definitely another to own a business. I thought that because I was a great landscaper people would just call. I thought wrong. I now have an interactive website and advertise locally in the community papers. I am trying to make the community aware of the services that I offer.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - We all like to know what lawn care marketing works and what doesnâ??t. By reading such stories on the topic, we hope to cut out those lawn care marketing ideas that are ineffective. What amazes me about all the stories we see on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum, is how one theme seems to ring true time and time again. Letâ??s take a look at some marketing ideas a lawn care business owner shared with us.

He wrote â??As far as what has worked or hasnâ??t in gaining new lawn care customers:

1. Leaving flyers on cars at Home Depot - hasnâ??t worked.
2. Leaving flyers at businessâ??s on Sunday, when they are closed - no.
3. Direct contact with businessâ??s when they are open - not so much.
4. Newspaper ads in the local paper alongside the other bazillion lawncare companys out there doing the same thing - nope ( and Iâ??m $40.00 poorer ).
5. E-mailing local Real Estate Agents with my company info - a waste of time.
6. Providing excellent service and going the extra mile for existing customers and getting referrals from them - JACKPOT !
( itâ??s a slow process, but itâ??s effective )â??

Although there will always be some wealthy clients that will nickle and dime you to death, the majority of them want top notch lawn care service and are willing to pay for it. But how do you get these high end lawn care customers? Whatâ??s the best way to initially make contact with them? That was the question posted on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum by a lawn care business owner when he wrote â??My question is, what is your strategy for getting very wealthy customers with massive lawns? Do you offer free minor services just to get the job to maintain the lawn? It seems, these are the kind of people that would take too kindly to you walking up to their front door to drop off a brochure. So what else could I do?â??

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - This is a very interesting topic. Lawn care business owners are always looking for ways to land commercial lawn care bids. But whatâ??s the best way to do it? There are many ways to go about getting close with property managers to win bids but there is nothing like hearing the inside scoop straight from a property manager himself. That is what we were lucky enough to hear in this discussion. A lawn care business owner had asked on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum this, â??my question is how to get commercial properties? Everyone tells me I have to go to them, they wonâ??t come to me. Before we get into this I would like to tell you about my business.

I started my lawn care business four or five years ago with about four accounts my first season and second season I got up to about ten. Thatâ??s all I had for the next two seasons. So for this season I advertised with signs and that got me up to about twenty five accounts give or take. I now moved up from a 21 in push mower to a 36 in commercial walk behind. What my question is, is that I would like to expand into commercial businesses in my area because all Iâ??ve been doing is residential yards. Iâ??m wondering when to start looking for these commercial properties for next season and how to land them?â??

Great question and here is some insight shared with us from a property manager. He responded â??Hello, I am a property manager of 2 million sq ft. I was reading this and thought I would throw in a few thoughts.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - There are plenty of things you can do to market your lawn care business in the Fall. What if you decorated a local store that has high foot traffic.

You could really go all out and put a sign up in front to promote your lawn care business and your seasonal services. Maybe have a pick-a-card display on the sign so people can walk up and take one.

If you are doing this for a local pizzeria, why not get a bunch of fall menu flyers to promote your fall cleanup services on one side and the pizzeria menu on the other side that the store could hand out to each person who has an order.

You could also promote your Fall Halloween outdoor decoration services to other commercial establishments and homes.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - When the leaves fall and you are hired to clean them up, a lot of times you are not only fighting with trying to collect wet leaves but with wind! How do you collect the leaves when the wind is blowing them all over? That is a question asked on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum. A business owner wrote â??I was wondering if anyone could help me with a fall clean up problem. I bought and a little wonder high output blower 2 years ago and have learned all of the tricks to getting the best performance and power out of my blower, except when there is wind.

Some of my customers have very open properties that the wind can really blow across and I just have the toughest time blowing the leaves in any other direction than the direction the wind is blowing!! My buddy said there are â??techniquesâ?? he uses to be able to work on windy days, but he wont give up any of his techniques! Does anyone know of anything that might help so that the leaves donâ??t blow back over my head if I blow against the wind?â??

Another lawn care business owner shared his secret to collecting leaves on a windy day. He said â??I use a snow fence. Itâ??s cheap and you can reuse it again and again. Itâ??s like a tarp, but the wind blows right through it, catching more leaves.

This is how I do it. I go out and get a roll of snow fence and they have those push in fence post so I use about six or so. When I set them up Iâ??ll put them in a U shape and blow the leaves to the trap. That way if its windy I donâ??t lose them when I vacuum them or bag them up. The whole process take about an hour to complete in a small lawn with about 4 trees.

The snow fence comes in 25â?² rolls, I buy a lot for drive ways so I use whatâ??s left over.

I will put it in the lawn about 40 ft or so away from the tree. It gives me a chance to have a big work area. I use only one most of the time. Space the stakes out about 4- 5 ft apart then put the fence on the post.

I use a vac from the blower I have, itâ??s old. I vac them into garbage cans most all the time unless its windy.â??

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - With many small lawn care businesses, the owners tend to feel there is more money when you get in and get out fast. However as we will see in this discussion, offering more services than simply lawn mowing can help you be on the job site longer. The longer you are on the job site, the better your chances are of meeting neighbors and others driving by. These meetings can lead to adding new customers. One of the members of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum asked a question that kicked off this discussion â??I thought of a neat idea for all of us. Everyone will state what services we offer &amp; explain how you go about doing them if you want. This will give everyone a clear idea on what services they might add to their business. Iâ??ll start.

Services I Offered.

Gutter Cleaning
Weeding
Spring/Fall Cleanups
Topsoil/Fertilizer/Grass Seed
Hedge Trimming
Branch Cutting

THE SERVICES I WANT TO START:

Grub Eliminating
Aeration, $50.00 a yard is the cost around here.
Driveway Crack Sealing (iâ??d add dye to the sealant to create the aged color)

THE SERVICES I DONâ??T WANT TO START:
Gardening, plantingâ?¦
Tree Removal
Anything that keeps me in the same spot for the entire day.

I donâ??t like to stay in one spot doing a big job, which could bring me really nice income. I like lawn mowing because itâ??s quick &amp; keeps me moving, I tackle a lot more &amp; it feels great. I do weeding, but personally I hate at a job site for even more than 5 minutes. As for landscaping in general, even if Iâ??m good at something, I just donâ??t enjoy it. â??

A business owner then said â??I have to ask why you donâ??t want to offer those additional services? Personally I love jobs that keep the staff at one location for the day or hours at a time, your percentage of profit for the job will be far larger than moving around. Factor in down time (travel with no pay) gas, maintenance, insurance etc. I personally found the big jobs pay a significant profit margin.

It also gives time for people passing by to see the work, itâ??s free advertising and in our experience it pays big time.â??

            <itunes:subtitle>Being on site longer improves your chances of selling more. GopherHaul 44 L</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>http://www.gopherforum.com - With many small lawn care businesses, the owners tend to feel there is more money when you get in and get out fast. However as we will see in this discussion, offering more services than simply lawn mowing can help you be on the job site longer. The longer you are on the job site, the better your chances are of meeting neighbors and others driving by. These meetings can lead to adding new customers. One of the members of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum asked a question that kicked off this discussion â??I thought of a neat idea for all of us. Everyone will state what services we offer &amp; explain how you go about doing them if you want. This will give everyone a clear idea on what services they might add to their business. Iâ??ll start.

Services I Offered.

Gutter Cleaning
Weeding
Spring/Fall Cleanups
Topsoil/Fertilizer/Grass Seed
Hedge Trimming
Branch Cutting

THE SERVICES I WANT TO START:

Grub Eliminating
Aeration, $50.00 a yard is the cost around here.
Driveway Crack Sealing (iâ??d add dye to the sealant to create the aged color)

THE SERVICES I DONâ??T WANT TO START:
Gardening, plantingâ?¦
Tree Removal
Anything that keeps me in the same spot for the entire day.

I donâ??t like to stay in one spot doing a big job, which could bring me really nice income. I like lawn mowing because itâ??s quick &amp; keeps me moving, I tackle a lot more &amp; it feels great. I do weeding, but personally I hate at a job site for even more than 5 minutes. As for landscaping in general, even if Iâ??m good at something, I just donâ??t enjoy it. â??

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Buying used outdoor power equipment can be a great way to save money but it can also open a can of worms and end up costing if repairs are needed. How do you know if a used lawn mower is going to be a good deal? Thatâ??s what one of our forum memberâ??s asked when he wrote no the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum â??I have found a deal on a 2007 ExMark LZ25KC604 60â?³ with 25 HP Kohler with 240 Hours. I have been offered this for $3000.00. It appears to be in great shape.

This is my first zero turn and I have been looking at Scags and Exmarks. What should I look for before I decide? I think this is a good deal. Any comments or suggestions appreciated.â??

Thankfully one of our forum members is a outdoor power equipment dealer and he knows his stuff. He responded â??First, are you buying this from a Dealer or from an individual? If from a dealer, will they give you any warranty? Since you have been looking at new mowers of the same brand, how much would a similar one cost you new? Assuming it has no warranty and passes the test as follows below, I would pay no more than about 60-70% of the new price of a similar piece of equipment. Do you know if $3000 is the lowest price you can get on it? Have you tried to get a lower price?

Here are some questions you should ask the seller before you buy a used mower.
1. If you are buying from an individual, why are they selling it?
2. Was it used to mow their own yard only? or was it used for commercial use (to mow more than their own lawn).
3. Can you verify their answer to the first two questions without asking them directly or even indicating you are questioning their answer (they may answer â??I no longer need this big of a mowerâ??, or â??I decided to get out of the lawn care businessâ??, orâ?¦.. Just think, â??does their answer make sense?â??)
4. Do they have maintenance records? Will they provide these records to you to preview before the purchase? Will they provide these records to you with the purchase?
5. Can they tell you who serviced the equipment when it was serviced? Can you verify this?
6. If buying from a dealer, have they serviced the mower including sharpen the blades, check the belts, change spark plugs, Air Filter, Fuel Filter, and oil?
7. Have they ever serviced this mower before buying it?
8. Did they sell the mower new?
9. Why did the original owners sell it? (Again, think about their answer to see if it makes sense or not. Typically power equipment dealers are considerably more honest than car dealers but there are a few here and there that may still lie to youâ?¦.)

There are more questions to ask, review them here http://lawnchat.com/?p=640

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Are you afraid of hearing the word no? Is it keeping your lawn care business from growing? This fear afflicts more of us than we would probably care to admit. A new lawn care business owner shared with us his insights as to how fearing the word Ã¢Â?Â?noÃ¢Â?Â? had stifled his growth for some time.

He wrote us on the Gopher Lawn Care Business forum and said Ã¢Â?Â?I have been in the lawn care business since 1973 and it is still one of my passions of life. I have worked for large corporations and small landscapers and have taken every opportunity to learn as much as I can.

I now work for myself. I hope to continue learning from you folks and have no problems at all with sharing my experiences and knowledge with any of you. I have great customers and am looking to expand on services I offer and neighborhoods I service in my area. IÃ¢Â?Â?m going to do this a little at a time in steps so as not to scare people off.Ã¢Â?Â?

You have been in the business for quite some time! What do you feel about the differences between working for all those companies and running your own business? Any thoughts as to why you decided to make the jump and how you did it?

Ã¢Â?Â?I would suggest to all that I have NEVER been afraid to tell a lawn care customer or potential customer that I didnÃ¢Â?Â?t know the answer to something, but I always made it a point to get back to them with an honest, sensible solution to problems they presented to me. It took me a long time to accept that some people can have differing views of things that will not agree with what you are presenting.

For the longest time, I was scared to death to hear Ã¢Â?Â?NOÃ¢Â?Â?. I suffered economically, physically, and psychologically to keep from hearing that dreaded two-lettered word. I would suggest that we have to accept some failures in order to appreciate our successes. None of us wants to lose money in our daily endeavors, nor should we. I decided to go out and start my own because at a certain point, I figured out I can take my knowledge to the public and not be stuck or limited by my Ã¢Â?Â?bossÃ¢Â?Â?sÃ¢Â?Â? imagination. The freedom to be my own representative out there in the world was too strong to ignore. IÃ¢Â?Â?ve gone back to work for other people from time to time but have finally settled on my independence and am truly enjoying myself. Yeh, I think IÃ¢Â?Â?ll do this until IÃ¢Â?Â?m forced to retire.Ã¢Â?Â?

With all of your experiences, what advice do you have for the new lawn care business owner who is trying to attract customers? What have you found that works and what doesnÃ¢Â?Â?t?

Ã¢Â?Â?My advice to everyone would be to make up some fliers or have them made up for you. You can be as fancy as you can afford but be careful not to make it too long. Keep it short and sweet. Identify your services offered and maybe your service call policies, along with guarantees and licenses. We all have differing ideas about details but getting to the point is more a plus than a minus. You can always expand on what you are offering once you get in the door. Eyeball to eyeball is still the best way to sell yourself to anyone. I speak from experience, folks.Ã¢Â?Â?

So if we can learn from his year of experience, itÃ¢Â?Â?s that should constantly try to learn from others. DonÃ¢Â?Â?t be afraid to hear the word no and to really sell yourself, get out there and talk to people eyeball to eyeball.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Fear is an interesting topic. It is amazing how the fears we have can effect how we see the world and what we do in the world. A member of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum brought up a great topic that has popped up in the past, leading me to think many lawn care business owners may share this fear. He wrote Ã¢Â?Â?I had a nightmare about gaining 1,000 lawn care clients. The problem was, I couldnÃ¢Â?Â?t afford to serve them.

I didnÃ¢Â?Â?t have the equipment, or the crew.

In my dream I wanted to serve all of the lawn care clients, I didnÃ¢Â?Â?t want to lose any of them. I was afraid that theyÃ¢Â?Â?d never think of hiring me again if I said no this time, so what happens?

I wake upÃ¢Â?Â¦

Now imagine if the nightmare was true. In the Spring you send out 10,000 flyers and BAM, everyone calls you? WouldnÃ¢Â?Â?t that be worse than not having enough customers to fill your schedule?

I guess itÃ¢Â?Â?s good to know what your maximum number of clients is. You never know what kind of trouble youÃ¢Â?Â?ll have if you get too many. So you have to think, how many lawns can you mow (comfortably) in a day, multiplied by 5 days a week?

IÃ¢Â?Â?d say 11-12 customers a day, 5 days a week is good for ONE PERSON.

If you have a partner, 20 lawns a day, 5 days a week will be a walk in the park!

At first I did believe after my marketing, that everyone would call me. Though I simply said, Ã¢Â?Â?IÃ¢Â?Â?ll take what I can get, and leave the rest for other companies.Ã¢Â?Â?

The problem as you get bigger is, saying no to potential customers will fill me with regret. Saying no might effect me later. When you canÃ¢Â?Â?t take on more customers, they might remember you as Ã¢Â?Â?too busyÃ¢Â?Â? or the Ã¢Â?Â?no companyÃ¢Â?Â? or most likely move on to a company who COULD take them.

Advertising comes in steps I guess. I hardly got any lawn care customers from my first attempts. The real gains IÃ¢Â?Â?ve gotten were from people seeing me work &amp; walking up to me and asking for an estimate. Or referrals.Ã¢Â?Â?

You bring up a really good point when talking about this fear. I think many entrepreneurs have a similar fear. It concerns them when they are doing their marketing.

Many times I have seen forum members post things like, Ã¢Â?Â?I donÃ¢Â?Â?t want to do too much marketing because I donÃ¢Â?Â?t want to be swamped with customers.Ã¢Â?Â?

I think first off, if you can realize you wonÃ¢Â?Â?t be swamped with customers, you will be better off. Once you realize that, you will see you need to really overshoot your goals when you are marketing because no matter how many customers you think you will get out of what ever marketing campaign you are doing, ultimately you wonÃ¢Â?Â?t get anywhere near that amount.

This especially comes into play when a lawn care business owner is preparing to do some direct mail marketing to potential customers in their area. If you donÃ¢Â?Â?t send enough pieces of mail out, you might not get any responses. I donÃ¢Â?Â?t think it is possible to send out too many marketing pieces to your service area. At most we usually see a 1% to 2% response rate from direct mail or distributing door to door flyers.

Another lawn care business owner said Ã¢Â?Â?Seeing is believing for most people. If you are mowing in an area where people can see you do a good job, they will come up to you.

This has happened to me many times. A person will normally walk up to me and say Ã¢Â?Â?you mow my neighborÃ¢Â?Â?s lawn, can you come give me an estimate? IÃ¢Â?Â?m just down the street.Ã¢Â?Â?

Marketing in my opinion, can only build the base of whatÃ¢Â?Â?s to come in time. Everything will branch off from there.

One customer who initially got your flyer can refer you their neighbor. The neighbor can refer you to their friend, etc.
Here is a list of which lawn care marketing methods have worked for me. Ordered BEST to WORST:

 * People who have seen me work, who ask me for an estimate.
 * Customers who have referred my lawn care company to their friends.
 * Confronting people who look busy, and telling them I can mow your lawn for a price of $X.XX.
 * Business Cards
 * Flyers

            <itunes:subtitle>The fear of getting too many lawn care customers - GopherHaul 41 Lawn care</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>http://www.gopherforum.com - Fear is an interesting topic. It is amazing how the fears we have can effect how we see the world and what we do in the world. A member of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum brought up a great topic that has popped up in the past, leading me to think many lawn care business owners may share this fear. He wrote Ã¢Â?Â?I had a nightmare about gaining 1,000 lawn care clients. The problem was, I couldnÃ¢Â?Â?t afford to serve them.

I didnÃ¢Â?Â?t have the equipment, or the crew.

In my dream I wanted to serve all of the lawn care clients, I didnÃ¢Â?Â?t want to lose any of them. I was afraid that theyÃ¢Â?Â?d never think of hiring me again if I said no this time, so what happens?

I wake upÃ¢Â?Â¦

Now imagine if the nightmare was true. In the Spring you send out 10,000 flyers and BAM, everyone calls you? WouldnÃ¢Â?Â?t that be worse than not having enough customers to fill your schedule?

I guess itÃ¢Â?Â?s good to know what your maximum number of clients is. You never know what kind of trouble youÃ¢Â?Â?ll have if you get too many. So you have to think, how many lawns can you mow (comfortably) in a day, multiplied by 5 days a week?

IÃ¢Â?Â?d say 11-12 customers a day, 5 days a week is good for ONE PERSON.

If you have a partner, 20 lawns a day, 5 days a week will be a walk in the park!

At first I did believe after my marketing, that everyone would call me. Though I simply said, Ã¢Â?Â?IÃ¢Â?Â?ll take what I can get, and leave the rest for other companies.Ã¢Â?Â?

The problem as you get bigger is, saying no to potential customers will fill me with regret. Saying no might effect me later. When you canÃ¢Â?Â?t take on more customers, they might remember you as Ã¢Â?Â?too busyÃ¢Â?Â? or the Ã¢Â?Â?no companyÃ¢Â?Â? or most likely move on to a company who COULD take them.

Advertising comes in steps I guess. I hardly got any lawn care customers from my first attempts. The real gains IÃ¢Â?Â?ve gotten were from people seeing me work &amp; walking up to me and asking for an estimate. Or referrals.Ã¢Â?Â?

You bring up a really good point when talking about this fear. I think many entrepreneurs have a similar fear. It concerns them when they are doing their marketing.

Many times I have seen forum members post things like, Ã¢Â?Â?I donÃ¢Â?Â?t want to do too much marketing because I donÃ¢Â?Â?t want to be swamped with customers.Ã¢Â?Â?

I think first off, if you can realize you wonÃ¢Â?Â?t be swamped with customers, you will be better off. Once you realize that, you will see you need to really overshoot your goals when you are marketing because no matter how many customers you think you will get out of what ever marketing campaign you are doing, ultimately you wonÃ¢Â?Â?t get anywhere near that amount.

This especially comes into play when a lawn care business owner is preparing to do some direct mail marketing to potential customers in their area. If you donÃ¢Â?Â?t send enough pieces of mail out, you might not get any responses. I donÃ¢Â?Â?t think it is possible to send out too many marketing pieces to your service area. At most we usually see a 1% to 2% response rate from direct mail or distributing door to door flyers.

Another lawn care business owner said Ã¢Â?Â?Seeing is believing for most people. If you are mowing in an area where people can see you do a good job, they will come up to you.

This has happened to me many times. A person will normally walk up to me and say Ã¢Â?Â?you mow my neighborÃ¢Â?Â?s lawn, can you come give me an estimate? IÃ¢Â?Â?m just down the street.Ã¢Â?Â?

Marketing in my opinion, can only build the base of whatÃ¢Â?Â?s to come in time. Everything will branch off from there.

One customer who initially got your flyer can refer you their neighbor. The neighbor can refer you to their friend, etc.
Here is a list of which lawn care marketing methods have worked for me. Ordered BEST to WORST:

 * People who have seen me work, who ask me for an estimate.
 * Customers who have referred my lawn care company to their friends.
 * Confronting people who look busy, and telling them I can mow your lawn for a price of $X.XX.
 * Business Cards
 * Flyers
 * Craigslist.Ã¢Â?Â?

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Understanding what insurance you need when you are just starting your lawn care business can be quite overwhelming. I have been able to have a few discussions on landscape contractor insurance over the years to help you understand the topic better. In this most recent discussion I had an opportunity to talk with an insurance agent who sold insurance mainly to the lawn care industry. Here are some of the insights he shared on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum that I hope you find beneficial.

What kind of insurance does a lawn care contractor need?

Ã¢Â?Â?What insurance coverage a contractor needs is dependent on the type of work he or she engages in as well as the risks associated and protection desired. The general purpose of contractor insurance is to provide financial backing for a contractor who is liable to a client who hires the contractor to perform a certain job. The most purchased type of contractors insurance is general liability insurance. As with other types of insurance, contractor general liability offers the widest protection and is most useful to a company or individual engaged any many facets of contract work. There are maximum payouts on the insurance, generally $1 million to $2 million for each type of protection. Contractors protected by a good plan are usually secured against reasonable financial loss due to problems linked to the contractors work. The most complete protection can be found from adding some more specific types of coverage to the general liability protection.Ã¢Â?Â?

LetÃ¢Â?Â?s talk about those some of those more specific types of insurance. How about workerÃ¢Â?Â?s compensation. Can you tell us a little about that?

Ã¢Â?Â?WorkerÃ¢Â?Â?s compensation is a common contractor insurance purchased by many contracting companies for their employees. Workers comp insurance is a compulsory type of coverage. This protection helps the employer cover the financial burden of an employee who is injured on a job. The workers compensation insurance generally offers income, medical and rehabilitation benefits for injured employees involved in work related accidents. Some plans also include a death benefit payable to survivors. Business owners/principles may choose to exclude their payroll (and coverage) in some states, with coverage rated only on employee payroll.Ã¢Â?Â?

How about inland marine insurance? This isnÃ¢Â?Â?t one we hear about often but it is helpful to know about.

Ã¢Â?Â?Inland marine insurance is another specialized type of contractor insurance. This contractors insurance protects goods that are in transit over land. Many contractors move materials and goods routinely and this allows them to expect the high costs of those items. Tools, equipment and installation floaters are all considered inland marine insurance and are considered essential types of insurance for contractor.Ã¢Â?Â?

What about disability insurance?

Ã¢Â?Â?Disability insurance is another common type of contractors insurance used by contractors and many companies, for that matter. This provides for the income needs of people displaced from work for a period of time due to injury. It is commonly referred to Ã¢Â?Â?Accident and Health ProtectionÃ¢Â?Â?. Health and life insurance are other types of coverage purchased by contractors.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - One of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum members recently made a trade with a local publisher. He offered to do lawn care in return for ad space. In this discussion we learn how creating a Ã¢Â?Â?squeeze pageÃ¢Â?Â? on your website can help you collect potential customer contact information to allow you to market to these people later via email. We also learn what your advertising should say in order to get as many people as possible to want to click through your internet banner advertisement. If you would like to read more about this topic, check out my newest lawn care business book &apos;GopherHaul Extreme Lawn Care Business Tips.&apos; You can read more about it here http://www.gopherforum.com/showthread.php?p=56597#post56597

He wrote Ã¢Â?Â?I made a trade with a local advertising business a few weeks ago for them to do a magazine ad for me in return for me to do her yard for so a certain period of time.

I have been working on her yard off and on since the ad was published.

They want to put a banner with my business name on their website and have it linked to my website. They also want me to write an article in the (ask the expert section) of their website on the topic of fall/winter upkeep advice to help people. I will also be in the coupon section.Ã¢Â?Â?

Another member responded Ã¢Â?Â?In terms of the banner ad, your concept looks great but if you want MORE people to respond you need to give them a reason. Sure, some people will respond because they need something right now, but what about all the people just THINKING about a particular service you might offer? What about the people that have a service provider, but arenÃ¢Â?Â?t very happy with them and are considering getting someone else?

If you include some type of offer that gets people to at least click on the banner so you can take them to your website to continue or begin the relationship building process. And keep in mind that Ã¢Â?Â?FREE EstimatesÃ¢Â?Â? or some type of discount arenÃ¢Â?Â?t very effective anymore because EVERYONEÃ¢Â?Â?S doing them.&quot;

He then asked Ã¢Â?Â?do you have any ideas on what I could put in the banner ad to get them to click on it. The ad rotates with others so it only pauses on mine for 2-3 seconds. I currently have on the ad &apos;call for details&apos;, but i doubt that would get them to call. Any thing catchy up your sleeve?Ã¢Â?Â?

Ã¢Â?Â?Free mowing might attract a few people, but one thing to remember is that you want to get as many people as possible into your sales funnel as possible. Saying Ã¢Â?Â?Free MowingÃ¢Â?Â? will definitely get a few people to respond, but I bet youÃ¢Â?Â?d get even more if you offered a free report titled, Ã¢Â?Â?5 Secrets to a Thick, Green, Weed-Free LawnÃ¢Â?Â?, then include your call to action like, Ã¢Â?Â?Click HereÃ¢Â?Â?.

Then what IÃ¢Â?Â?d do is instead of sending them to your regular website IÃ¢Â?Â?d set up a special web page called a squeeze page. All it is is a web page whoÃ¢Â?Â?s only purpose is to get people to submit their name and email address in exchange for this free report. You donÃ¢Â?Â?t mention anything about the 15 different services you offer, or how youÃ¢Â?Â?ve been in business since 19XX, or howÃ¢Â?Â¦..well, you get the idea.

Then once they submit their information, THEN you could take them to your regular website because you now have their contact information and you can communicate with them via email for free.

Remember, marketing is a step-by-step process and if you try to take your prospects from A to Z in one giant leap, youÃ¢Â?Â?ll lose more than youÃ¢Â?Â?ll manage to keep!Ã¢Â?Â?

I asked Ã¢Â?Â?Can you give us a little more insight as what this squeeze page is?Ã¢Â?Â?

The other member said Ã¢Â?Â?you want to offer the free report BEFORE taking them to your regular web page. ItÃ¢Â?Â?s called a squeeze page and itÃ¢Â?Â?s only purpose is to capture visitors name and email.

On most websites there are WAYYYYY too many places someone could get lost. A confused mind doesnÃ¢Â?Â?t act/buy so the key is to create a web page whoÃ¢Â?Â?s ONLY OPTION is to submit their contact information.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - How often are you performing a service on a customerâ??s property when you see a problem that you feel you could fix? Do you mention this problem to the customer? If not, why not? Offering basic weekly mowing services is a great way to open the lines of communication with a customer that can lead to bigger profits if you know what to do. One of the members of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum shared with us some of his suggestions on how he makes big money with upsells to his current lawn care customers.

He wrote â??I have three crews that do the lawn mowing, pressure washing, clean up jobs and I worked with them this week just to see how things were going. I try to encourage them to look around, look for things we do and talk to the client. I realize itâ??s not in everyoneâ??s blood to simply hit up a conversation and say I happened to notice you could useâ?¦..this is something we offer if you like. Staff even ask me is it ok to talk to the customerâ?¦.I wonder whyâ?¦my response is always by all means they are the ones that sign your pay cheque.

I picked up 8 additional jobs from current jobs this week so far, I took various staff members to talk to the owner. A classic was yesterday, I checked in on a crew doing a mulching job and it looked excellent, I walked around the house and noticed it really needed a pressure washing, I asked staff if they noticed and they did, they said and they are right. Itâ??s clear on our lawn care marketing post cards that we do this. I knocked on the door and had an employee with me. I said Linda I stopped by to see how things were going and to me it looks excellent, what do you think so far? Then I said you know you have a beautiful home and location, I couldnâ??t help but notice the mold on the side and back of your siding which we see very often, if you are interested we provide this service and can give you a quote. Her response was I didnâ??t realize you did this and was going to look a company up in the yellow pages, what would it cost, I replied $425.00 and explained the process, she said do it please.

I see this on probably 60% of the places we visit, we have to be proactive and I believe based on my experience if we are, you will get additional work and some of this work is very high profit, besides that you already have the gear there and the longer on a site the more prople notice that are walking or driving by and as the property transforms, people stop and start asking questions, the neighbour feel slighted as his place no longer looks better and he wants it toâ?¦â?¦play into thatâ?¦.

Just a thought for the dayâ?¦..Today I am digging two fish ponds. I picked these up while with a mowing crew and talking to the customer, one is a day care and one is a home with a lot of those small water falls you buy at the big box storeâ?¦.it will be a very easy $600.00 job(s), I had simply walked the property with the owner and said, a fish pond would be an interesting additionâ?¦.â??You do thoseâ?????â??

So as you walk around and service a customerâ??s property, think to yourself, what other services could they use? Then offer the customer those services and you just might see a big boast to your bottom line.

            <itunes:subtitle>Making the most of lawn care business upsells? GopherHaul Lawn Care Busines</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>http://www.gopherforum.com - How often are you performing a service on a customerâ??s property when you see a problem that you feel you could fix? Do you mention this problem to the customer? If not, why not? Offering basic weekly mowing services is a great way to open the lines of communication with a customer that can lead to bigger profits if you know what to do. One of the members of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum shared with us some of his suggestions on how he makes big money with upsells to his current lawn care customers.

He wrote â??I have three crews that do the lawn mowing, pressure washing, clean up jobs and I worked with them this week just to see how things were going. I try to encourage them to look around, look for things we do and talk to the client. I realize itâ??s not in everyoneâ??s blood to simply hit up a conversation and say I happened to notice you could useâ?¦..this is something we offer if you like. Staff even ask me is it ok to talk to the customerâ?¦.I wonder whyâ?¦my response is always by all means they are the ones that sign your pay cheque.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Iâ??d like to first thank our friend Mike from the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum for sharing with us some of the pressure washing marketing material he successfully uses. I asked him some questions on the topic of marketing that I want to share with you.

Steve: â??What advice do you have for newer lawn care business owners when it comes to successfully distributing such marketing material? How should one go about using the postcards or door hangers to get the most effective results?â??

Mike: â??Just like in real estateâ?¦. Itâ??s all about location, location, location. In this case, itâ??s list, list, list! Who gets your marketing material is more important than how or what they get.

I donâ??t market to folks that canâ??t afford or shouldnâ??t be hiring out contractors. If they canâ??t afford it, then it is a waste of my efforts. If they shouldnâ??t be affording it, then it too will be a waste because they will want the work cheap.

As for what the marketing material should sayâ?¦. well, I like promoting what I sell. I stopped selling Pressure Washing once I found that is was only worth so much. I started selling something more valuableâ?¦ Time and convenience. Thatâ??s why the card doesnâ??t have a mower or pressure washer on it. It has what I propose hiring me will give themâ?¦ Time to enjoy their free time.â??

Steve: â??That is a really good point that I think a lot of new lawn care business owners miss. Do you have any advice on how a lawn care business owner can or should determine who canâ??t afford them?â??

Mike: â??As long as I was telling the customer about pressure washing, I was getting that look ofâ?¦ â??Itâ??s just pressure washing, why so much moneyâ??â?¦ When I started sending a different message to a different mindset client, I noticed more yeses, no matter the price. We went from charging $250 for house pressure washes to $450+ house washes in one season. And started selling more of them at the higher rate. Silly, how a different approach can sell the same pressure washing service for more $$.

As for determining the marketing target, I look for neighborhoods where there is lots of activity. Work vehicles coming and going. These folks out source this work. I target business owners. Their time is valuable and they also understand us. We have something in common. Hey, a lawyer that is billing $500/hr thinks I am a bargain at $300/hr. Also, donâ??t price based on YOUR numbersâ?¦ Base it on THEIR numbers. I sell house washes that would take the typical homeowner a whole weekend to do. I base pricing on that production rateâ?¦ Not my own. I can clean their home in an hour, but not going to price it at that rate. Iâ??m going to sell them that I am saving them money versus the time it would cost THEM to do it. Hell, even to have the local handyman do it. Not to knock the lawn guys, but I can wash 5-6 times faster than most of them, but I ainâ??t gonna price it for faster. Iâ??m gonna stay at same $50/hr that lawn/handyman is going to price at, but make more because Iâ??m faster. So Iâ??ll make the $300/hr.â??

These are great concepts to be considering when you are selling your pressure washing services. In fact you can use these marketing and selling concepts when you sell any of your lawn care business services.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - We can always learn more about sales. Without sales we would have no income and without an income we would have no business. So to boost your lawn care business sales letÃ¢Â?Â?s have a talk with Nick, a fellow Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum member. Nick used to be a car salesman before he moved on and decided to stop making others rich and start making himself rich. I got a chance to ask him to share with us some of his insight into how a lawn care business owner can improve their sales and here is what he had to say.

Most any business revolves around sales, and in most cases you will sell something at least once in your life. A simple sale can be broken down into steps. There are many different forms of the steps to the sale but here are the ones I use:

1. Meet and Greet

The meet and greet is the first and most important part of a sale. A lawn care customer is going to decide if they are going to buy something from you within the first 15 seconds of meeting you. During the meet and greet you should shake your prospective customers hand, look at them in the eyes and state your name and why you are on there door step(or where ever). Remember this customer could lead you to more sales so take them as they are your monthly salary, your childÃ¢Â?Â?s next meal, the new zero turn mower, etc.

2. Fact Find

When you fact find all you are basically doing is finding out the needs of your lawn care customer. Ask your questions and when they answer just sit back and listen. The best way to lose your credibility is to interrupt the customer when they are talking. The best way to build confidence is to listen and give an educated response to what ever they said.

3. Diagnose

I was always told in the car sales industry, what if a doctor gave medicine without finding out what is wrong with the patient? That would be bad right? Yes it would be awful. Giving a proper diagnosis with each customer can boost profit enourmously. This step is the most commonly misconstrued part of the sales process.

Ã¢Â?Â?Medicine with out prognosis is MALPRACTICE!Ã¢Â?Â?
John Walters

4. Present

This step is where you have to use those superior vocal tools, those sly words, basically you sell. you need to get the customer excited about the product now. With Ã¢Â?Â?diagnoseÃ¢Â?Â? you have selected the product or service with the customer, now concentrate on selling it. When the lawn care customer says that the service is over priced you need to overcome the objection, DO NOT SWITCH THE SERVICE OR PRODUCT!!! Switching is not forbidden but should be done only if you are about to lose the sale. Most people feel that they picked the product you are trying to sell them so when you try to switch it they feel that the swindler salesman you are is trying to screw them and rip them off. Do not switch unless necessary.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - I just love the creative marketing ideas that get posted on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum. There are so many ideas posted, you will never run out of ways to promote yourself. Letâ??s talk about the latest great idea. One of our members shared with us a story on how he uses napkin dispensers to promote his real estate business.

He wrote â??I advertise in about 25 to 30 restaurants right now. I went and bought these great Napkin Holders that you can put ads on both sides.

None of the restaurants charge me anything at all to put these dispensers in their location. When I recently bought the napkin holders, they where only $5 bucks each.

I not only sold a couple house from those ads, but people run into me and say they are sick of seeing my face all over the place. That is good!

I also bought a bunch of the large stand up napkin holder that have my advertising on the front of them. I have them in about 20 gas stations next the fountain drinks.

The good thing about gas stations, they get tons of traffic to see the advertising.

I put my outdoor business card holders on the top of these so people can Take A Card and the card holder does not fall open or go all over the place if someone knocks it over or when they put more napkins in the holder. They work great for me.

THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX!

You can see a picture of this display here http://lawnchat.com/?p=868

I do so many weird things because that is what works.â??

After seeing this I asked him how do you go about getting them in the stores?

Do you offer to pay for the napkins or do they refill them, themselves?

He replied â??For the gas stations I will supply the napkins for the first like 6 month or all year, They only use about a half case. Case of napkins are only $50 dollors.

With the restaurants, I just give them the holders and they get the napkins from their suppliers.

But when I bring the holders into the facilities just about everyone of them love the napkin holders and they say yes!

I put them in one gas stations and with in days I got calls from other gas stations asking for them. The owners are all family and are really great/smart business people. â??

I asked him how often does he go back to refill these dispensers and he said â??I go back to them as much as possible, I have to show my face because I always like to talk to them about whatâ??s new. They recommend people to me.â??

Consider this lawn care marketing idea the next time you find yourself walking around in a gas station or at a restaurant, you just might pick up more customers than you know what to do with!

            <itunes:subtitle>Napkin dispenser lawn care marketing idea. GopherHaul Lawn Care Business Sh</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>http://www.gopherforum.com - I just love the creative marketing ideas that get posted on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum. There are so many ideas posted, you will never run out of ways to promote yourself. Letâ??s talk about the latest great idea. One of our members shared with us a story on how he uses napkin dispensers to promote his real estate business.

He wrote â??I advertise in about 25 to 30 restaurants right now. I went and bought these great Napkin Holders that you can put ads on both sides.

None of the restaurants charge me anything at all to put these dispensers in their location. When I recently bought the napkin holders, they where only $5 bucks each.

I not only sold a couple house from those ads, but people run into me and say they are sick of seeing my face all over the place. That is good!

I also bought a bunch of the large stand up napkin holder that have my advertising on the front of them. I have them in about 20 gas stations next the fountain drinks.

The good thing about gas stations, they get tons of traffic to see the advertising.

I put my outdoor business card holders on the top of these so people can Take A Card and the card holder does not fall open or go all over the place if someone knocks it over or when they put more napkins in the holder. They work great for me.

THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX!

You can see a picture of this display here http://lawnchat.com/?p=868

I do so many weird things because that is what works.â??

After seeing this I asked him how do you go about getting them in the stores?

Do you offer to pay for the napkins or do they refill them, themselves?

He replied â??For the gas stations I will supply the napkins for the first like 6 month or all year, They only use about a half case. Case of napkins are only $50 dollors.

With the restaurants, I just give them the holders and they get the napkins from their suppliers.

But when I bring the holders into the facilities just about everyone of them love the napkin holders and they say yes!

I put them in one gas stations and with in days I got calls from other gas stations asking for them. The owners are all family and are really great/smart business people. â??

I asked him how often does he go back to refill these dispensers and he said â??I go back to them as much as possible, I have to show my face because I always like to talk to them about whatâ??s new. They recommend people to me.â??

Consider this lawn care marketing idea the next time you find yourself walking around in a gas station or at a restaurant, you just might pick up more customers than you know what to do with!

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - When a lawn care customer decides mid-season they want to save money and only have you mow their property every other week, how should you handle this or even bill this? This was a dilemma that was presented to the members of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum. The member wrote â??Iâ??ve had this weekly mowed lawn care customer since I started my business and now they want me to cut the grass every 2 weeks because they are â??seniorsâ?? and they are getting low on â??moneyâ?? (thatâ??s an excuse I think)

This yard I do, takes me 2 hrs with my tractor and another 15 to 20 minutes to trim all his stuff all over the yard.

I donâ??t want to lose this customer. I was talking to him about my possibly getting a ZTR and he was like, oh yeah that means you can lower your price. Why do old folks think this way ??? That when itâ??s mowed faster, you can charge less ???

He complains all the time my bill is too high and stuff.. and things like that

Not sure what to doâ?¦â?¦â?¦â?¦â??

One lawn care business owner wrote â??my bi-weekly lawn care customers get charged a premium. I usually charge them 1 1/2 times the price of a weekly mowing. So if a lawn costs $40.00 per cut weekly, Iâ??ll charge them$60.00 per cut bi-weekly. That way it allows me to clean up any extra mess or bag the lawn.

People need to understand that it is not a cost saving alternative. Weekly lawn mowing is best. Bi-weekly cuts usually take too much off the blade and can be detrimental for the turf.

If you are going past the customerâ??s home every week I would contact the client and let them know of the length of their lawn and let them know of concerns for their turf. If they care about how the lawn looks they should understand.â??

Another lawn care business owner agreed and shared â??cutting every other week makes it necessary to raise the price. I suppose it depends on how much you are making on the property but itâ??s always a bad idea to let the customer dictate when you can and canâ??t cut the lawn. It always turns out that they call you when itâ??s 28 inches high, takes 4 hours instead of 2 hours to mow. I was put in the same situation last week. A customer of mine decided they wanted their yard mowed every 2 weeks instead of weekly. Well I explained to them that the clippings will be left on the lawn and itâ??s gonna look terrible.

The only thing worse is sharing the job with the home owner. Theyâ??ll cut the lawn when itâ??s easy and call you when itâ??s 4 feet high.

I have an interesting technique when someone complains about my prices. I tell them that they can get someone else to come in and give them bid on cutting their lawn. Theyâ??ve never taken me up on the offer yet.â??

Lastly donâ??t forget cutting higher grass puts added wear on your lawn mower. You will be adding more wear and tear to your machine. This can lead to a shortened mower life which then will raise your operational costs. So keep all these things in mind the next time a weekly lawn care customer is looking to get you to cut their lawn every other week.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Have you spent much time thinking about your lawn care customer sales funnel? Many newer lawn care businesses donÃ¢Â?Â?t think about this so I thought it would be a good idea to bring it to their attention.

What is a sales funnel? Well think of it as a big scoop. You want to go out there and scoop up as many potential customers as you can when you broadcast your marketing message. Then you want to reel them in step by step. You want to offer something and then get something from the potential customer.

Then offer a little something more and then get something more from them. You keep this process going in your sales funnel until you have the customer signed up for services. Ultimately you want to take the customer from step A to step Z, one step at a time.

A lot of newer lawn care businesses donÃ¢Â?Â?t understand this and they tend to rush the sale with the end result of losing it. They want to take the potential customer from step A to step Z all in one step.

So how do you take the potential customer in step by step. Say for instance first off in your advertising, you say call my phone number 24 hours a day and listen to my voice recorded message on the 7 secret steps every homeowner needs to know to obtain a full and lush green lawn. What this then allows the potential customer to do is call your number knowing full well you wonÃ¢Â?Â?t pick up the phone. They can call and listen to your 7 secret steps and not have to be on the defensive from an sales pitch. The potential customer also can feel free to call 24 hours a day at any time.

At the end of the message you can say something to the effect of, Ã¢Â?Â?if youÃ¢Â?Â?d like further help or assistance in maintaining your lawn please leave your name and number at the beep and I will promptly return your call. I offer free estimates with no obligation and I am fully insured.Ã¢Â?Â? This then will prompt the potential customer to leave their contact information so you can take your interaction with them to the next step. You gave them a little helpful information and they give you a little helpful information. They will feel comfortable and you will feel good that they feel comfortable.

Another similar concept you can do even before the phone call is to have a business card distributor on your vehicle or trailer when you are out and about in town. Many potential customers will see your truck parked while you are working or at lunch and they may not feel they want to approach you at that time. They may or may not have a pen to write down your phone number from your truck, but if you have a business card holder on your vehicle they will feel more comfortable taking one.

This allows the potential customer to not have to feel like they are going to have to be on the defensive from a sales pitch. They can simply walk up to your truck, take a card and then call you later when they feel more comfortable. And remember the whole goal is to make the customer feel comfortable each step of the way.


Now to show you how helpful such devices can be, I am lucky enough to be able to give away 3 vehicle business card holders compliments of Artie at http://www.mytakeacard.com as well as 3 sets of 500 business cards compliments of Ely at http://www.bizcard.com

If you are interested in taking part in this giveaway, just make a reply in the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum here http://www.gopherforum.com/showthread.php?t=9362 and say you want in. I will pick 3 winners. I hope once you try this out you will see how important this whole lawn care customer funnel process is.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Nothing helps us learn how to be successful than to hear stories from those who have found success and then ask them how they did it. A new lawn care business owner shared with us his story on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum on how he went from 3 to 20 lawn care customers in all of 3 months. I was able to talk with him and get some insights as to how he did it. I hope this discussion really helps you grow your lawn care business.

He wrote Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?I just opened up my very own lawn business. I am very fortunate to have opened it when I did, because my first few months I have seen a jump in clientele. I first got started in the lawn care business by working with my father doing property maintenance at his home building company. My job included mowing all of his model homes and properties. I serviced 25 properties for 3 years. As I worked for him, together we set up a lawn trailer including a Toro 52Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â³ z-turn, John Deere 48Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â³ walk behind and assorted sticks edgers and trimmers, and back pack blowers. So having all of this equipment in my hands I decided to start my own company and expand it past his properties. At the same time I started leasing his equipment from him.

This made it very easy to start since I did not have to go out and purchase most of this equipment in one lump sum. I have the experience of cutting grass, but itÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?s with the buisness side I need to become an expert on to make lots of money. That is what has brought me to this forum. I have learned a lot just by reading others comments. I have a few ideas of my own and have a lot of motivation to make my company prosperous.Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?

You sound like you have a fantastic foundation and are off to a great start, can you tell us a little about your view on growing your lawn care business?

He responded Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?A lot of people have different philosophies about how to run there company and here are just some of mine.

1. My start up phase -
The first thing I did other than put numbers together and get my licensing and insurance was to start spreading the word. I told every person (and still do) about the services I provide (spelled out below). From my parents to the grocery store clerk, I told every person I came in contact with. The first month I opened with 3 accounts, now in my 3rd month I have 20. ALL WORD OF MOUTH.

I had a buddy of mine meet with me to go over logos and flyers and so forth, low budget marketing items, such as business cards. Business cards are probably the number one item ANY business person should never leave the shop without. I spread the word EVERYWHERE I GO. WORD OF MOUTH IS MY NUMBER 1 MARKETING TECHNIQUE. It goes much further than a piece of paper.

2. Professional Image -
This item I think gets over looked because of the common excuse that itÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?s a dirty job. My state is littered with lawn care companies and you canÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?t go down the road with out seeing at least 3 rigs. Even though 10 passed me, I remembered only 3 because they looked good. But I think itÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?s very important to BE and look professional.

I went to Target and bought these Champion duo dry shirts (one they are cheap, two they are pleasant to work in, and three they look very professional.) I got my logo and and phone number put on them, and you would be surprised how a property owner reacts (especially in high end neighborhoods) when they see a professional looking company making there lawn look PROFESSIONALLY done.

He shared with us some very fascinating insights. I hope these thoughts and concepts help you grow.

I serviced 25 properties for 3 years. As I worked for him, together we set up a lawn trailer including a Toro 52Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â³ z-turn, John Deere 48Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â³ walk behind and assorted sticks edgers and trimmers, and back pack blowers. So having all of this equipment in my hands I decided to start my own company and expand it past his properties. At the same time I started leasing his equipment from him.

This made it very easy to start since I did not have to go out and purchase most of this equipment in one lump sum. I have the experience of cutting grass, but itÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?s with the buisness side I need to become an expert on to make lots of money. That is what has brought me to this forum. I have learned a lot just by reading others comments. I have a few ideas of my own and have a lot of motivation to make my company prosperous.Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?

You sound like you have a fantastic foundation and are off to a great start, can you tell us a little about your view on growing your lawn care business?

He responded Ã?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?A lot of people have different philosophies about how to run there company and here are just some of mine.

1. My start up phase -
The first thing I did other than put numbers together and get my licensing and insurance was to start spreading the word. I told every person (and still do) about the services I provide (spelled out below). From my parents to the grocery store clerk, I told every person I came in contact with. The first month I opened with 3 accounts, now in my 3rd month I have 20. ALL WORD OF MOUTH.

I had a buddy of mine meet with me to go over logos and flyers and so forth, low budget marketing items, such as business cards. Business cards are probably the number one item ANY business person should never leave the shop without. I spread the word EVERYWHERE I GO. WORD OF MOUTH IS MY NUMBER 1 MARKETING TECHNIQUE. It goes much further than a piece of paper.

2. Professional Image -
This item I think gets over looked because of the common excuse that itÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?s a dirty job. My state is littered with lawn care companies and you canÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?t go down the road with out seeing at least 3 rigs. Even though 10 passed me, I remembered only 3 because they looked good. But I think itÃ?Â¢Ã?Â?Ã?Â?s very important to BE and look professional.

I went to Target and bought these Champion duo dry shirts (one they are cheap, two they are pleasant to work in, and three they look very professional.) I got my logo and and phone number put on them, and you would be surprised how a property owner reacts (especially in high end neighborhoods) when they see a professional looking company making there lawn look PROFESSIONALLY done.

He shared with us some very fascinating insights. I hope these thoughts and concepts help you grow.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com Here is a really interesting question that was posted on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum. One of our friends wrote in and he had this idea for his new lawn care business name. His name is Brian S. and he was asking â??What do you guys think about naming the business B.S. Lawn Care???? They happen to be my initials, do you think this would be a bad name or a good one cause people would remember it????â?? 

Another lawn care business owner responded by saying â??that is a good questionâ?¦it may be catchy at first. But if you mess up one lawn or upset someone it may backfire and become a joke. Here is a motto for you, B.S. Lawn Care - The only manure is in our Triple Mix!!!â??

Brian then wrote â??The marketing tag lines for B.S. Lawn care would make for a good marketing angle. I was thinking about putting something at the bottom of advertisements,signs and card â??Owned and Operated by Brian S.â?? Maybe they would put the to together and be like Ohhhhhhh.â??

You know self deprecating humor can really be funny. If you went this route I would probably play it up and use it to your advantage because it would catch peopleâ??s eye and get them talking which is so important.
You could say maybe B.S. Lawn Care
 In case you were wondering, The B.S. stands for Brian Smith.Then maybe work this image somewhere on your truck as a joke to make people smile and talk about you. Or maybe even use it on your shirt or in a logo. Oh my gosh that would be a riot.

Would this work? Who knows. But I gotta say it certainly would stand out and get people talking. You could go with other mottoâ??s as well like these.
Tired of all the bull?
Try the company thatâ??s No Bull!
or
B.S. Lawn Care.
(picture)
The company that is NO BULL!

Brian responded â??That t-shirt is great, I showed it to my wife and she loved it. Iâ??m really thinking of going with that name. I posted the same question on another site to see what people thought. Some thought it was good others thought it would be offensive, I donâ??t think they had a sense of humor. I think I might run with the idea of the no bull S*** sign as a logo. Thanks for the great idea if you or anyone else thinks of anything let me know.â??

My take is most people just donâ??t want to stand out. That is why most simply choose to work at a job. When you want to stand out a little, you might start your own business but it probably wonâ??t be that successful. So then what happens is the majority of businesses are trying to fit into the predefined roles and categories they see others are in.Then ultimately no one stands out.

Once in a while you will get a wildman out there who just goes for it and does something different but more often than not people are afraid to stand out and be different. To me this is different. I canâ??t say how the general public will handle this and thatâ??s why it just might work. Remember without risk, there is no reward.
It kind makes me think of how Wendyâ??s had created the â??whereâ??s the beefâ?? ad campaign and it really took them from behind a plain jane fast food restaurant to the a whole new level. It got people talking and got people thinking. There was huge buzz about it. There were t-shirts made of the old lady saying â??whereâ??s the beef?â??

I say go for it but keep in mind I like craziness and zaniness.
Another member wrote â??At first I thought B.S. In the name would be a bad idea! But the T-Shirt idea is great! The name at the bottom takes all negative aspects away.â??
So with all of this, what do you think? Do you like it or dislike it? Let me know or get on the forum and tell all of us.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com Back in the days when you were starting your lawn care business, did you encounter the â??Why would I hire you if youâ??re so new?â?? dilemma?

Iâ??d like to have some way of spinning that question into a positive if and when that should arise.

Thatâ??s the question asked to us by Scott, a new lawn care business owner on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

Without a doubt some lawn care customers, if they sense you are new, will try and screw with you. They will try and push you around on a lot of things such as price and how much work they want you to do. Just be wary of this.

How do you spin it? Well I would say two things off the top of my head. Reliability and affordability. You would be amazed at how many start up lawn care businesses are just not reliable. Show them you are reliable and you will win their trust.

Believe in yourself. You can do this.

Andy shared that he never had a lawn care customer ask. The key to starting out is to look and act big. If you do this, you will actually believe you are big and everything will fall into place. It does take some cash to get there however it pays off big time to have professional looking shirts &amp; pants as well as lettered vehicles and trailers. If something needs a little paint to look great then personally we do it. All the equipment is washed at the end of the day, no exception, even the mowers, they always look new and clients like that.

Keith added I think everyoneâ??s been in that situation. Many newbie lawn care business owners fall into the trap of lowering their prices to attract customers. In my opinion, lowering your price is a big mistake. Your customers will expect your prices to remain low and will resist when you try to raise them. Besides that, youâ??re simply selling yourself short when you should be making good money.

Instead, arm yourself with knowledge. Obtain the ability to discuss problems with their yards.

Now, youâ??re new and you donâ??t have the experience and knowledge to diagnose a wide range of problems. Instead, pick one or two problem areas that are common to all your prospects. If everyone in your area has shrubbery beds, become a source of information on proper pruning. Learn all you can about proper mulch application. If everyone has clover in their yards, learn proper mowing techniques which will reduce clover production and discuss those solutions with your prospects.

Never seek customers from a position of desperation (i.e. - Iâ??m new, please let me cut your lawn). Do the opposite by making them need you more than you need them. If you know more than just how to run a lawn mower over their grass, and you can demonstrate that knowledge to your customers, you will quickly build a roster of profitable customers.

Joe shared if you have ever cut the lawns for family and friends, I would suggest you should take pictures of the jobs you have done and made a small photo album, you could show potential lawn care customers the work you have already done and that can take away the tag that you have been a Professional Lawn Care Specialist for a short time. Use it to your advantage when this question comes up. Take some before and after shots. Be BIG and believe in Yourself. Walk the Walk.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com Lawn care business website search engine optimization tip.

Did you know you can appear on googleÃ¢Â?Â?s search engine even if you donÃ¢Â?Â?t have a website? And if you have a lawn care website, here is a tip that you really need to take advantage of. The best part about all of this, is that itÃ¢Â?Â?s FREE. ItÃ¢Â?Â?s amazing what you can learn when you read the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

Google has a section on their search engine called the Ã¢Â?Â?Local Business Center.Ã¢Â?Â? Do a quick search on google to find it.

Within that section you can add your business to their list and what that will do is bring your business listing to the top of the search engine result page where the map appears.

One of our forum members had added his lawn care business to this FREE listing and here is what he said Ã¢Â?Â?I just wanted to let you guys know iÃ¢Â?Â?m #3 on the first page of google and this is the third day after I filled out the information.Ã¢Â?Â? IsnÃ¢Â?Â?t that fantastic?

Another forum member tried this and wrote Hey everyone I just wanted to let everyone know that I logged onto the google local business center and put in all my info and it has been fantastic. I put in all the services I provide and almost everyone comes up first when you search for the service and my area.

I have only been on one week and received three calls for big jobs.

I think everyone should try it.

Now you might be wondering how do you add your information to this site? Here are some directions a forum member shared with us.

 * Go to googleÃ¢Â?Â?s main page and click MAPS at the top.
 * Next on the left hand side you will see put your business on Google maps. Click
 * Then create a new account.
 * Remember to put as many keywords as possible to promote yourself.
 * It should do the same for you as it has done for me.]

Try this out and you should see your lawn care business start to appear at the top of search engines.


Lawn care business postcard distribution tips.

When you are thinking about marketing your lawn care business, why not consider using postcards? ThatÃ¢Â?Â?s what one of our forum members did and he has been getting great results. He wrote Hey, I just wanted to share with you my new oversized postcards. I am very happy with them and have been getting great responses. The top is the front and back is the bottom.

I was really impressed with what he was doing so I asked How have you been distributing them? What made you decide to experiment with lawn care postcards?

He replied I have just been walking local neighborhoods and placing them at the doors. A few times I decided to write at the top in a red sharpie Ã¢Â?Â?Cut Your Lawn $60.00Ã¢Â?Â³ or whatever I had decided to charge for the area. I have picked up several lawn with that method.

As far as the design, I had my logo already in placeÃ¢Â?Â¦. I talked with with a professional graphics designer and he helped out a lot. I told him what we do and a few of my lines and then he got back to me with some ideas and Bam! This is what we got.

I was going to use door hangers, actually I had my heart set on that. BUT BUT BUT I decided to use the lawn care postcards because I can use them at the doors BUT also I can give them directly to people and hand them out at local business and so on. If I had tried to hand people door hangers that wouldnÃ¢Â?Â?t of looked that professional. Just this one lawn care postcard has given my company a much more professional look. People really like the high quality printing also. The price wasnÃ¢Â?Â?t that bad eitherÃ¢Â?Â¦.. So I feel that they were well worth the $$ spent.

I am working with the same graphics person again right now designing business cards as well. It is great to have these postcards with me ALL THE TIME. When people ask what I do I just say here, let me give you one of my advertisements and hand them one. Their first words are usually Ã¢Â?Â?wow, these look greatÃ¢Â?Â? Ã¢Â?Â¦. and then Ã¢Â?Â? I will keep you in mindÃ¢Â?Â¦ or let so and so know that you do this work.

Fantastic lawn care business marketing advice.

            <itunes:summary>http://www.gopherforum.com Lawn care business website search engine optimization tip.

Did you know you can appear on googleÃ¢Â?Â?s search engine even if you donÃ¢Â?Â?t have a website? And if you have a lawn care website, here is a tip that you really need to take advantage of. The best part about all of this, is that itÃ¢Â?Â?s FREE. ItÃ¢Â?Â?s amazing what you can learn when you read the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

Google has a section on their search engine called the Ã¢Â?Â?Local Business Center.Ã¢Â?Â? Do a quick search on google to find it.

Within that section you can add your business to their list and what that will do is bring your business listing to the top of the search engine result page where the map appears.

One of our forum members had added his lawn care business to this FREE listing and here is what he said Ã¢Â?Â?I just wanted to let you guys know iÃ¢Â?Â?m #3 on the first page of google and this is the third day after I filled out the information.Ã¢Â?Â? IsnÃ¢Â?Â?t that fantastic?

Another forum member tried this and wrote Hey everyone I just wanted to let everyone know that I logged onto the google local business center and put in all my info and it has been fantastic. I put in all the services I provide and almost everyone comes up first when you search for the service and my area.

I have only been on one week and received three calls for big jobs.

I think everyone should try it.

Now you might be wondering how do you add your information to this site? Here are some directions a forum member shared with us.

 * Go to googleÃ¢Â?Â?s main page and click MAPS at the top.
 * Next on the left hand side you will see put your business on Google maps. Click
 * Then create a new account.
 * Remember to put as many keywords as possible to promote yourself.
 * It should do the same for you as it has done for me.]

Try this out and you should see your lawn care business start to appear at the top of search engines.


Lawn care business postcard distribution tips.

When you are thinking about marketing your lawn care business, why not consider using postcards? ThatÃ¢Â?Â?s what one of our forum members did and he has been getting great results. He wrote Hey, I just wanted to share with you my new oversized postcards. I am very happy with them and have been getting great responses. The top is the front and back is the bottom.

I was really impressed with what he was doing so I asked How have you been distributing them? What made you decide to experiment with lawn care postcards?

He replied I have just been walking local neighborhoods and placing them at the doors. A few times I decided to write at the top in a red sharpie Ã¢Â?Â?Cut Your Lawn $60.00Ã¢Â?Â³ or whatever I had decided to charge for the area. I have picked up several lawn with that method.

As far as the design, I had my logo already in placeÃ¢Â?Â¦. I talked with with a professional graphics designer and he helped out a lot. I told him what we do and a few of my lines and then he got back to me with some ideas and Bam! This is what we got.

I was going to use door hangers, actually I had my heart set on that. BUT BUT BUT I decided to use the lawn care postcards because I can use them at the doors BUT also I can give them directly to people and hand them out at local business and so on. If I had tried to hand people door hangers that wouldnÃ¢Â?Â?t of looked that professional. Just this one lawn care postcard has given my company a much more professional look. People really like the high quality printing also. The price wasnÃ¢Â?Â?t that bad eitherÃ¢Â?Â¦.. So I feel that they were well worth the $$ spent.

I am working with the same graphics person again right now designing business cards as well. It is great to have these postcards with me ALL THE TIME. When people ask what I do I just say here, let me give you one of my advertisements and hand them one. Their first words are usually Ã¢Â?Â?wow, these look greatÃ¢Â?Â? Ã¢Â?Â¦. and then Ã¢Â?Â? I will keep you in mindÃ¢Â?Â¦ or let so and so know that you do this work.

Fantastic lawn care business marketing advice.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com A landscaping and lawn care debt collection letter that works.

Do you have a lawn care customer or customers that are telling you repeatedly that the check is in the mail? Maybe they have even go so far as to tell you they arenâ??t going to pay you. One of our Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum Members had to deal with this issue until she sent out a letter that got her dead beat lawn care customer to pay up.

Amy: Thanks for the sample collection letter in the Gopher Forum, because of it I was paid. Thatâ??s one deadbeat down and 1 to go! It was a small victory and a boost to my self esteem.

Steve: That is great news! Tell us what you did to get paid. I am sure a lot of new lawn care business owners are reading this, wondering what steps you took to get success.

Amy: First, I called the Small Claims Court in my County and gathered information on starting a small court claim. How much to file, how much for the Sheriff to serve papers, etc. Then, I gathered my information regarding my deadbeat client; like the dates we performed lawn &amp; garden maintenance and filled in the blanks. I stressed she had 5 days after the receipt of the letter to settle her bill. If not, then I will file a claim against her for theft of services.

I went to the post office and sent the letter registered mail. 3 days later, I received her payment in full. I ran to the bank and deposited the check; hoping she didnâ??t put a stop payment on it! Accompanying her check was a little nasty note stating that she was the one who fired us, but that doesnâ??t excuse her nonpayment.

Hereâ??s the lawn care business debt collection letter format that I used. I removed the personal information and others who use it can just fill in the blanks appropriately.

 Dear deadbeat:

 You had hired ABC Company on (insert date) to perform garden maintenance at 3 week intervals, starting this day. At the same time, you hired us for lawn maintenance at an agreed price of $$, starting this day. Since then, Iâ??ve performed garden maintenance per our contract on this day and lawn maintenance was performed on the following dates. Payment terms per our contract are due upon completion. Payments for the services listed above are now due immediately. Despite several phone calls to you to collect payment, you have stated on 3 seperate occasions that your payment is in the mail. Since I have not received payment to date, your services were terminated by ABC Company on said date, due to theft of services.

 As per our contract, I am requesting to be paid $$$ for our servicesâ?¦â?¦

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Where your phone number should appear in your lawn care website.

You would think by the title of this article, the story below would be so simple you didnâ??t even have to read it but that is certainly not the case. Most lawn care business owners donâ??t put much time into where their phone number should appear. Just ask yourself where does your phone number appear? One of our forum members had some great information to share in this post at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

He said You want your phone number PROMINENTLY displayed. You want to make sure you edit your html meta tag description to include your phone number first so your search engine listing will display your lawn care business like this.

http://www.your-lawn-care-business.com - 111-222-3333 Joeâ??s lawn care blah blah blah blah blah lawn care in Your City blah blah blah blah blah â?¦.

For those that donâ??t know, I asked him what is the importance of having your phone number in that location? Why is it so important?

He responded by saying Letâ??s say you lawn care services in Somewhere, Arkansas.

Your would want to make your web TITLE to read Somewhere Arkansas Lawn Care Service

Your DESCRIPTION would be (assuming this is your website name):

http://www.SomewhereLawnCare.com 111-222-3333 Somewhere Arkansas lawn care? We are the lawn service leaders in Somewhere Arkansas. We specialize in landscaping, lawn care, landscape lighting and sprinkler systems in the Somewhere Arkansas area.

The phone number will show up in the link desciption on the search engine (depending on the link.)

Meaning they may not even visit your site first, because they found what they want, a phone number.

The easier you make it to have people contact you, the more contacts you will get.

This is great information and I do hope this gets you thinking on how to alter your lawn care business website to display your phone number and contact information.

Marketing your lawn care business only with lawn care business cards?

Brandon wrote Well these last few weeks I have been completely covered with work. I have picked up several new yard accounts, plus 6 tree removal jobs at about $700 each (average). I have picked up 3 brush clearing jobs. One at $600, one at $1,900, and another at $4,250.

That is great news! Can you give us your advice on how you stay busy? What should other lawn care business owners be doing or thinking about in order to get back on track? Especially if they recently got started?

Brandon replied â??Well, Most of my work comes from repeat business and referrals. Most of my new business comes from craigslist. I have never spent any money on advertising, except business cards. I have a theory that once you start paying for advertising, you will need to keep paying to keep the work flow coming, so Iâ??ve tried to avoid it from day one.

I would suggest just putting yourself out there, and never turn down an opportunity to talk about work with someone. I have started up conversations with MANY people about what I do, and the next thing I knew I was giving a bid to them, or someone they knew.

So I guess, talk, talk, talk, and put yourself out there. Let everyone know what you are doing, and donâ??t be afraid to ask someone if they need something done. A lot of the same things you have been saying on the forum.</description>

            <description>GopherHaul 32 - Topsoil &amp; Mulch Calculator and improving your Lawn Care Business Sales Discussion

http://www.gopherforum.com - Why is my lawn care business marketing not working?

When you are getting your lawn care business started and you dont have many personal contacts, the situation can be rough. Letâ??s take a look at what our friend and fellow Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum member did to go from getting no return calls to many.

Scott wrote So my flyers &amp; business cards have been sent out all over, a lot of my cards need to be restocked in stores because they are almost all gone. Yet I have gotten no calls.

I only have a few days left, I can only do so much. Iâ??m mass producing flyers again &amp; plan to send them out to the other areas of my starter city.

I myself have walked door to door handing out 7000 flyers &amp; Im losing it! I dont wanna be out for weeks with these flyers so Im gonna just start a.s.a.p without stopping until they are all out! Ill give you guys some amateur shots of my flyer &amp; card, you can tell me what the hell Iâ??m doing wrong.

Steve: You are doing a fantastic job. What you are doing with your flyers and business cards is good, however, you will find more success selling people to people. Selling to those you know or those that know you.

Have you considered picking up the phone and try to sell to people who are existing customers or people you know?

The next what you can do is work the neighbors of your customers. Tell them you are services Mr. Jones lawn and you would like to service theirs too.

Scott: Alright, so I decided to confront my snow removal customers. They have all received my flyer, but once they knew it was me Scottâ?? its like they insisted on hiring me.

I told them, the starting price for lawn service is $420.00, but because your you, &amp; you helped me out during winter, it will only be $400.00

You canâ??t beat that price, but hey, they were my winter customers!

I now have tons of appointments next weekâ?¦

I guess I learned something, call people &amp; SELL yourself!

Do you find it difficult when looking at a mulch bed to know how much mulch or topsoil you will need to cover the area? Trying to figure out the math for it can be very difficult. Well stop worrying about buying too much mulch / topsoil or not enough and have to go back to the supply store to get more. Use this handy topsoil and mulch calculator. This online lawn care business tool is free to use online. Just click on the calculators link at the top of the Gopher Forum page. You can figure out the amount of mulch or topsoil needed for a rectangle, circular or even a triangle shaped mulch bed. Try this tool out and I bet you are going to love it.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Should I go with a signed or verbal lawn care agreement?

There are a lot of new lawn care business owners just getting started this year due to many economic factors. Because they are new, they dont know where they can get away with using a verbal agreement when providing lawn care services or when they need to use a signed agreement. I want to use these recent discussion as an example to help you expand your business knowledge base.

Dean wrote us and said Here is my situation: I posted an ad on craigslist to perform lawn care for any realtors who have vacant homes that need lawn care. I was contacted by one wanting mowing, seeding, plugging, fertilizing and pine straw put out. This job was for two homes, both on the same street. I came up with a price for labor and got prices for material. I was then contacted and told I could go ahead with job. The problem is I had no address to send the bill to and had not met anyone in person. I called back and asked for an address for which I could send an invoice to and guy said the work was for someone else and he would get back to me with an address. I have not heard from him as of yet. I am looking at spending $400.00 out of my pocket for materials to do this work. I think there should be a meeting and signing of a contract to ensure I am covered in getting paid for this work. Without any meeting or something signed if whoever decides not to pay, I have no recourse in recouping my expenses. I need to know from all of you if I am right and should not do any work until there is something signed to cover me and the lawn care customer so everyone gets what they paid for. All suggestions are welcomed.

Eli: You are correct. I think you have plenty of reason to be concerned. I would not perform any work until you have laid eyes on the lawn care customer and, especially in this strange case, until you have a signed contract in hand. I think I would make sure the contract included specifically who is responsible for payment. Then I would make sure that the person signing the contract also prints his name (I would probably have a spot for him to print and another spot for him to sign rather than just having him sign and print his name below the signature.).

I think I would start out with drawing up the contract and then calling him to ask for a place to meet him or whoever is authorizing the work. Make it clear to him during your telephone conversation that no materials will be ordered and no work will be done until a contract is signed. Maybe even ask for some money upfront to purchase materials. This would help ensure they are willing to go through with the deal. I suspect someone is trying to pull a fast one on you. I would not lose a lot of sleep over the deal until you have met the customer and have that signed contract in hand.

Victor: We have had past problems with realtors and owners who are actively selling/managing foreclosure properties. We only do prepayments with signed agreements for these types of customers now. We either meet with them for signing or mail them an agreement. They can provide guaranteed full payment or a good faith deposit in cash, check or money order or via PayPal. Once payment and agreement is received/cleared then the work will start. And so it goes with ongoing service.

With renters, we asked that they provide their drivers license # on an agreement in the event of defaulted payments.

These are great responses from people who are in the know. Dont be so desperate to get your business started and do this kind of work only to find out when its completed that you cant find the person to pay you.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com Which lawn care business logo would you choose?

At first glance, you would think choosing a lawn care business logo would be easy. Just pick the one that for whatever reason, stands out to you. Maybe the color, maybe the boldness, maybe the way it looks on your truck. But as we will see in this discussion there is more to choosing a lawn care business logo than just those issues.

Lawn guy wrote on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum â??opinions please, there is one lawn care business logo I like the best but I want to get a general opinion on this thanks.â??

Tom wrote â??I like the smiley face logo one the best. The smiling face says Iâ??m confident and want to be a friend of the customer. You will be as happy with the results as I am producing them.â??

Lawn guy responded â??I like that one also. I live in a very rural country area were everyone is kind of scared/shy of big businesses so I think it kinda shows a home town feel too. I am not exactly sure why, but its just different. Itâ??s more personal and associated rather than an industrial or high tech style logo. Does that make any sense?â??

Tom: â??It does to me! Seek friendship and indicate your desire to help solve their problems.â??

I like the idea as well. I do feel it conveys friendliness and fun. It makes me think the owner would be approachable and easy to work with. You could have business cards that say Steve â??The Lawn Guy.â?? And then you could become known in your area as the lawn guy. You could make promotional videos that teach viewers about lawns and lawn care. The more you become the go to guy for lawns the more you will be able to sell your lawn care services!

Great points everyone and I am very glad to see how much thought goes into choosing the best lawn care business logo for your area. If you would like to join in on this discussion further, visit the post at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

Top voted lawn care equipment.

Spring is in the air and many lawn care businesses are looking to buy new lawn care equipment. But before you go out and buy it, check the Gopher Forum equipment review section. There you can review what equipment other lawn care business owners are using. What they recommend and what they wonâ??t buy again. You can also see a listing of deals on new and used lawn mowers, line trimmers, leaf blowers plus many other categories.

Letâ??s take a look at a pie chart that shows the voting for lawn mowers. As you can see, the top three lawn mowers voted by the members of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum are the Exmark Lazer Z, the Walker Model MT and Toroâ??s model 74901. Consider these mowers when you are looking to equip your lawn care business.

Next up is the most voted for line trimmers. The top models chosen are the Echo SRM 2305, the Stihl FS90R, and the Tanaka TBC 225. Make sure you get on the Gopher Forum to submit your vote and product reviews of your favorite lawn care equipment.

Last but not least is the most voted for back pack leaf blowers. The most voted for leaf blower is the Husqvarna 150BT. That model is followed up by the Stihl BR 550. Lastly the Troy Bilt 269580 blower wraps up the top 3 list.

Many reasons can effect why a leaf blower, line trimmer or mower make the top of the list. It could be price, durability or functionality. Each one of these products seem to have just what the members of the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum were looking for to help keep their lawn care businesses running at full speed.

Remember your vote counts, so get on the Gopher Forum today and tell us which equipment you liked and which you didnt!

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com We had a great conversation on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum that I wanted to share with you. Feel free to jump on it and offer your views as well.

Luna joined up on the forum and wrote Ã?Â?Hello! Just joined here and was looking to get opinions on a couple of truck magnets I designed for my significant others lawn care business. I pretty much handle his marketing/advertising and recently noticed some local business putting out specials/adverts using the down economy angle. My boyfriend is currently/interchangeably displaying one on the back of his tailgate above his website address and opposite his regular business magnet.

He just started the business in May 2008 after a layoff and is 30 accounts strong right now just by himself. Weve babystepped everything, pretty much in a methodical/grassroots/DIY level from the beginning.

I have attached the magnet layouts. Both can also be seen on the websites Main and Promo/Specials page. IÂ?d love to hear what you think.

Steve: Â?I can totally understand his point but you know, to me thats what marketing is all about. Its all about being different. If it can be controversial, even better. You want people to be talking about your marketing and if it isnt different, if it doesnt stand out, then you arenÃ?Â?Ã?Â?t going to get attention.

One of the things that I have been amazed with is that it takes soooo much energy to get a business started and running and you have to really be different from the average person to even attempt it. But why do the same people who are the adventurers, the crazy ones, those with enough energy to start a business then decide they have to keep things tame in their marketing? Why do they not want to stand out? What makes people so afraid to stand out? To be different? To gain attention? Especially when that attention can get you more work?

Take for instance, Richard Branson, owner of the Virgin empire, such as Virgin airways. Here he is promoting his airline dressed in drag. Guess what. He got media attention and here we are talking about it.

If you dont do something different, you can only at best expect the same results everyone else gets.

So for all this, I applaud you for being creative!

Luna: Thanks for your comments! Regarding the Obama marketing magnet angle, my boyfriend was uncomfortable with it on his truck and removed it about a week ago. I kept the picture of it on the website, however, but with the lead-in tag line above it that says:


We currently have about 6-7 solid prepaid accounts. It was a bit hard to do prepays in the beginning due to it not generating regular cash flow. However, the couple of ones that we had in the beginning did help to fund some start-up equipment purchases. Once we established over 20 accounts (and we hit 35 officially this week!), prepays have been a nice chunk of change when the payments comes due. A prepayment on a new account today just helped us purchase a new Echo backpack blower!

Anyhow, when my boyfriend goes out on an estimate call and meets with customers he often tells me about the positive feedback he gets regarding our doorhangers and website, most especially. We offer a lot on our promotions and specials page, all things we will honor in a heartbeat, but not as many people take advantage as youd think (so we Ã?Â?Ã?Â?re not losing our butts per se). The general consensus seems to be people do NOTICE our marketing attempts/specials and do respond positively without being prompted. My speculation is that they feel that they seem to be getting more with BladeMaster Mowing versus with the general competition and consider us a more value-added option, if only Ã?Â?Ã?Â?psychologically.

Again, thank you so much for your comments! I love this website! Ill keep posting on successes and misses.

Steve: Why not prompt them though?

For instance, why not come up with a special say spring flowers planted in your yard for $X9.95, but hurry and contact us by XX/XX/XX date. We need to get your order into our supplier to be able to offer you that discounted price.

Then a week before the date, send one last reminder email maybe upping the ante. Offer some additional option if they call you by that date.

The world goes by pretty fast and I like getting updates on sales when its something I am interested in. I think others do as well. Do you?

Luna: I like, and can see, your point about using more direct and active Ã?Â?Ã?Â?prompting with the way you presented that Spring flower special example. I just may try something like that and perhaps show a sample before and after picture pre/post-flowers, tree trimming or mulching via email or postcard to add a nice visual. Thanks for opening me up to the possibilities!

So keep all this in mind when you are experimenting with your lawn care business marketing and join in on the discussions at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.</description>

The general consensus seems to be people do NOTICE our marketing attempts/specials and do respond positively without being prompted. My speculation is that they feel that they seem to be getting more with BladeMaster Mowing versus with the general competition and consider us a more value-added option, if only Ã?Â?Ã?Â?psychologically.

Again, thank you so much for your comments! I love this website! Ill keep posting on successes and misses.

Steve: Why not prompt them though?

For instance, why not come up with a special say spring flowers planted in your yard for $X9.95, but hurry and contact us by XX/XX/XX date. We need to get your order into our supplier to be able to offer you that discounted price.

Then a week before the date, send one last reminder email maybe upping the ante. Offer some additional option if they call you by that date.

The world goes by pretty fast and I like getting updates on sales when its something I am interested in. I think others do as well. Do you?

Luna: I like, and can see, your point about using more direct and active Ã?Â?Ã?Â?prompting with the way you presented that Spring flower special example. I just may try something like that and perhaps show a sample before and after picture pre/post-flowers, tree trimming or mulching via email or postcard to add a nice visual. Thanks for opening me up to the possibilities!

So keep all this in mind when you are experimenting with your lawn care business marketing and join in on the discussions at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.</itunes:summary>

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com Welcome to the GopherHaul Lawn Care Business School.

This FREE course the &quot;Class 1 - Lawn Care Business Operator&apos;s Certificate&quot; is designed to give the new lawn care business owner a knowledge base to draw from and build a successful lawn care business. To sign up and enroll, visit the Gopher Forum.

There are a total of 69 lessons to this course with 193 multiple choice questions. Each lesson has on average 3 multiple choice questions for you to answer after reading. The total time to complete this course depends on how much you read per sitting. I would suggest pacing yourself and reading 3 lessons per sitting, which would take you 23 days to complete.

I do feel if you spend the time to focus and learn the content within this class, you will have a competitive advantage over other start up lawn care business owners. Don&apos;t re-create the wheel when you don&apos;t have too. The lessons in here pull from years of discussions with thousands of lawn care business owners on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

Now take an important step in the growth of your business and start your education today.

When you are finished, please click the apply for graduation button and if you pass the course requirements, you will receive a certificate to prove you have indeed graduated. I do look forwards to your feedback on this class. 


Lecture Title #1: Getting started.


Don&apos;t make it a big deal. How do you get started? Just by starting. Keep it simple. Get some business cards made or make them on your computer and start handing them out to your friends, neighbors and family. Let everyone know you are in business. Knock on your neighbors&apos; doors and offer them your lawn care business services. Do they need lawn cutting, yard cleanup, gutter cleaning or any other services? Ask them how you can help out and then do it.

You don&apos;t need any fancy equipment. A simple mower, trimmer and blower will probably do wonders for you. Don&apos;t go into debt to get started. Most new business owners I have talked to usually experiment with trying to find some business and cut some lawns before they go and register a business. A big problem most people face when looking to start a business is they put everything else in front of actually doing the simple things like cutting a lawn and making money. By worrying about everything else you can make a simple concept so complex that you get nothing done. So remember keep it simple. Start very simply. Take small steps and grow.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com Hello everyone and welcome to Gopherhaul. If you haven&apos;t started your lawn care business yet, what are you waiting? If you don&apos;t start your lawn car business this year, you&apos;ll be at least a year older when you do so get started today.

In today&apos;s discussion I want to talk about a couple of topics. First off, if you haven&apos;t seen all the new lawn care marketing design options on the Gopher Forum, you have to visit the site. When you get to the forum click on the link at the top that says &quot;Design It Yourself.&quot; You will see you can design lawn care logos, animated banner ads and now lawn care flyer and lawn care door hangers. This is just fantastic! You don&apos;t need to be artistic. You don&apos;t even need a graphics program. Just choose the background you want to use. Maybe the aeration flyer? Or the de-thatching door hanger? Then type in your lawn care company contact information, the services you offer and a few eye catching headlines and the online designer will create a pdf file for you. You can print that file out or save it or take it to a printer and have them print it out. With all these online designers, your lawn care business is going to look like a million bucks! Try them out today.

Next up is how to create a lawn care customer welcoming kit. Are you giving all of your new lawn care customers a Welcoming Kit? If you arenâ??t you should start doing it. This is something that can really help keep your customers from leaving you. You can join this discussion further at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

Things to include in your Lawn Care Customer Welcoming Kit folder.

 * Welcoming Letter.
 * Newsletter.
 * Business Card.
 * Mission statement.
 * A list of your Frequently Asked Questionâ??s.
 * List all the services you offer.
 * A brochure on each major program you offer, like plant health care and bug barricade.
 * Information on the supplementals you are currently promoting.
 * A referral card to pass on to friends or family.

Bob wrote on the forum, â??I started these welcome kits to help the new lawn care customers understand who we are and what we have to offer. When researching our cancellation history I found that most of the canceled lawn care accounts had been canceled within the first 3-4 months. If they had been more informed from the beginning, maybe we could have saved the sale.â??

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com If you are looking to submit some bids this season to clean leaves out of your customers gutters make sure you read this article first.

John got on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum and asked his gutter cleaning question. He wrote â??I have been asked by a neighbor to do a gutter cleanup. She has gutter shields in place but wants to make sure everything is cleaned out and down spouts are good. Her house is 2200sq. and about half of the home has gutters.

I do not think this job will take over 1.5 hours but have no idea what to charge her. I have never done this for money just on my own and folks house. Any help would be appreciated.â??

One of our forum members responded by saying â??I charge $1.00 per foot for a single story and $2.00 per foot on a 2 story. For people I have lawn contracts with I do it free Spring and Fall.

I found that a 2 liter soda bottle (cut down) works well for cleaning the gutters. Itâ??s pliable enough to get down into the gutter. Take a bucket with you to but the debris in. If you just dump it on the ground, the mess is harder to clean up than the gutters are.â??

I have been doing a national survey with those who provide gutter cleaning services and the charge of $1 to $2 per linear ft seems to be standard across the country. You would charge more for gutters that are higher up or more difficult to get to than lower ones.

Here are some common beginner pitfalls lawn care business owners find when offering gutter cleaning.

 * â??On my first job, I just emptied the gutters onto the ground. It took me about 25 minutes to clean the gutters and over an hour to clean the mess from dumping the debris. It was on the walls, the ground, the windows, etc. Since then I have taken a bucket to empty the debris in.â??
 * I used to charge by the hour for gutter cleaning, now I charge around $1 per linear foot.
 * If the gutters are easy to reach I charge $1.00 per foot. If the gutters have trees growing out of them, then its $2.00 per foot.
 * The first time I ever cleaned gutters, I brought a power washer and blew them all cleanâ?¦.When I went down the ladder, it was a mess, lawn, house windows, screens, everything!!! Lets just say that those people got a free home power-washing!!! Learn from mistakes, right?

Remember to review the job site before you create your estimate. Are the gutters on the first floor or the second? Do they have weeds growing out of them? Are you going to be able to reach them? Use a scoop to clean the gutters and empty the scoop into a bucket. Minimize your cleanup time. Charge between $1 and $2 a ft for gutter cleaning and you should be alright.

            <title>Lawn care business press release idea - GopherHaul Lawn Care Business</title>
            <guid>http://recordings.talkshoe.com/TC-15950/TS-193976.mp3</guid>

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com In general I don&apos;t think lawn care business owners utilize press releases as much as they should. The media, especially the local media, is always looking for a news story. Why not give them one? What does it cost to offer them a news idea? Nothing more than a little time to write up a press release and send it out to the local press.

Now I know that can be a little difficult and perhaps daunting of a challenge so I thought it would be a great experiment to put together a sample press release article idea that you could use and change the names in it and then send out to your local press. Then any lawn care business owner who used this idea and got an article written about them, could make a response to this post and tell us about how it happened and their experience. Plus they could tell us what kind of results came from being spotlighted in the local media.

Title: Local resident offers his own economic stimulus plan.

With our economy in a downward spiral and the federal government offering up what seems to be a new economic recovery plan every week, local resident John Smith, has an answer on how to fix this mess we are in.

In one word, he summed up his plan. &quot;Jobs. We need to create jobs.&quot; We can no longer rely on our current employer to protect us in an economic downturn. Businesses are going belly up all over the place. It&apos;s our duty to harness our energy and creativity and create jobs.&quot;

John Smith is the owner of Smith&apos;s Lawn Care which has operated in town for the past X years. &quot;If we each take a moment and think about what our skill set is, we could create a business and create jobs, today! Right now! We shouldn&apos;t be looking to the government to hand us out an unemployment check. We need to create jobs and hand out a paycheck. We need to make our township, county, state and country the best it can be by creating.

Each one of us can do something another person needs. Can you babysit? Can you cook? Can you cut lawns? Can you paint a house? Can you build a website. Figure out what you can do and do it. Then hire someone to help.&quot;

With this Spring just around the corner, John plans on hiring local residents to help perform lawn care and landscaping services. &quot;If we each do a little, together we can do a lot.&quot;

President John F. Kennedy&apos;s inaugural address concluded with this famous line. &quot;And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&quot; Now more than ever we need to do for our country. We need to fix this economic situation. We have the power to fix this situation and we will fix it if each one of us stands up, takes a step forward and reaches out to others to help them.

Create jobs!

Now you can either send this to your local paper as a press release to get them to call you and interview you or you can send this in as a letter to the editor. Take the text, change it around to fit your specific situation and send it in! It&apos;s free advertising and it&apos;s a positive message that will reflect positively on you and your business.

Try it out and let me know how it works.

            <itunes:subtitle>Lawn care business press release idea - GopherHaul Lawn Care Business</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>http://www.gopherforum.com In general I don&apos;t think lawn care business owners utilize press releases as much as they should. The media, especially the local media, is always looking for a news story. Why not give them one? What does it cost to offer them a news idea? Nothing more than a little time to write up a press release and send it out to the local press.

Now I know that can be a little difficult and perhaps daunting of a challenge so I thought it would be a great experiment to put together a sample press release article idea that you could use and change the names in it and then send out to your local press. Then any lawn care business owner who used this idea and got an article written about them, could make a response to this post and tell us about how it happened and their experience. Plus they could tell us what kind of results came from being spotlighted in the local media.

            <description>http://www.gopherforum.com - Are you finding it difficult to collect on your overdue lawn care business accounts? Are your lawn care customers holding off on paying? This article should help you with some tips and tricks on how to collect payments.

Gary got on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum and asked â?? last year was my first year running my lawn care business. I made it through the whole season with only one lawn care client failing to pay. Now that the end of the season is here, I have several (previously prompt paying) customers who have failed to pay their final bill. Is this something out of the ordinary or is it common around the holiday season?â??

Frank: â??This happens to me all the time. Last season I had a property manager owe me $1,500.00 and it took him until Feb to finally pay. And as of now I still have some past due accounts but it is just normal and I know that after a few mailings or a phone call it will finally trickle in. The holidays, the economy and peoples ignorance are most likely the causes. Just remember it and either donâ??t work for them next season or just accept the fact they are late payers and you definitely have to keep on them!â??

Steve: â??What kinds of things should a lawn care business owner do to get those bills paid that are lagging from last season and how long should they wait before they take further steps?â??

Frank: â??Well this is what I do. First send the lawn care customer a copy of your invoice with â??Past Dueâ?? stamped on it. If you hear nothing after a few weeks then you go to a letter and remember to include you â??Past Dueâ?? invoice (that â??Past Dueâ?? really scares people its very powerful so always remember to make that stamp BOLD). If this doesnâ??t work you go to a phone call or stop by the house. Be persistent, thatâ??s the key people will get so sick of seeing your face of seeing invoices in the mail that they will pay to get it over with. People are either forgetful or ignorant, sometimes the original gets lost in the mail and they pay by the second notice sometimes they donâ??t have the money and are embarrassed but eventually do get you the money.

            <description>haven&apos;t started your business yet, what are you waiting for? If you don&apos;t start your business this year, you&apos;ll be at least one year older when you do so get started today.

In today&apos;s episode of GOpherHaul I will be talking about, How much do you charge to perform lawn care service? This has got to be one of the most common questions I have seen appear on the GopherHaul Lawn Care Business Forum. It is a very important question too. If you donâ??t know how much the average lawn care business owner is charging for standard services like lawn mowing, gutter cleaning, leaf cleanup, or snow plowing, how will you know if your prices are competitive? How will you know if your lawn care prices are too low? Maybe they are too high and that is why you arenâ??t landing enough bids.


One of our forum members wrote â??Hey guys. I was wondering what everyone was charging. Your normal hourly rate and your minimum charge for cutting grass. Also what city and state your located in. I want to start a poll that way we can all compare and help each other out.â??

This got me thinking, hey why not set up a form where everyone can jump in and compare their prices and potentially with others even in your geographic area. So that is what I did. Check this out. Compare your lawn care prices at http://www.gopherforum.com

Now it is easier than ever before to compare what you are charging with other lawn care business owners in your area. This is a very powerful GopherHaul Lawn Care Business Web Tool so learn from it and let others know about it as well. Stop trying to compete with low-ballers. Show them they need to raise their prices so everyone makes more money.


I set up another new page to allow you to rate your lawn care equipment and see how others rate their lawn care equipment. This should help us all grow, especially when we are looking to upgrade and buy new mowers, trimmers or leaf blowers. Are you happy with your current outdoor power equipment or has it let you down? We want to know!


Often on discussions at the GopherHaul Lawn Care Business Forum, we talk about outdoor power equipment. Lawn care business owners are constantly looking to see how they can become more productive and profitable with their lawn care business. As we have seen, increasing your productivity is key to becoming more profitable but just which lawn mower, trimmers or leaf blowers are worth purchasing?

You can find all this information out now by using my Rate your lawn care equipment website. Enter your lawn care equipment and tell us what you like or donâ??t like about it and see what others have said about the lawn care equipment they are using.

            <description>If you miss reading the GopherHaul Lawn Care Business Forum for a single day, you could miss out on a lot. This idea is sure to make you a favorite amongst your customers and neighbors. To promote your snow plowing services why not use this marketing idea.

Tony wrote us and said â??Here is an example of some decals/stickers I made for a snow plow client we have. He wanted to give out buckets of ice melt to his snow plow customers but wanted his name and company info on them. I also made â??Please keep Coveredâ?? and â??Use Glovesâ?? stickers for the lids.

The great thing about this is you can re-use the buckets every year. You can fill the buckets with salt, ice melt, etc.â??

Steve: â??That is just fantastic. There are many things you could do with this. You could buy a bulk amount of buckets and get these stickers printed up, then fill each one. Stop by the homes in your area and drop them off on the front stairs possibly along with a door hanger explaining who you are and that you left this free gift. If the customer would need winter snow plowing services, they could contact you and also, donâ??t forget to promote your lawn care services as well for the spring. The cover of the bucket or the side could have a sticker that says something to the effect when it snows contact Joeâ??s snow removal.
You could also include a coupon to help give the homeowner an additional incentive to call you within a certain time frame.

Now if you wanted to give these to only your paying customers as a thank you for signing up, you could go with a larger bucket but if you wanted to use them as a marketing tool and distribute them more widely, you could go with a smaller size.â??

Mark: â??Those salt buckets worked extremely well!â??

Thanks Mark for keeping us posted on how using them worked out!

            <description>I was having a great discussion on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum with my friend Jeff and he was sharing with me some of his experiences trying to market his lawn care business. You can read more on this lawn care business discussion here on the GopherHaul Lawn Care Business Forum.

Jeff: â??When I worked with the previous lawn care business employer they did a lot of telephone soliciting and door hanger marketing. Here in our part of the state, almost all the towns limit door knocking and require that you go to the town hall or police station, pay for a background check, and wait for a permit until the background check comes back. Therefore, we didnâ??t do much of that. So we would hang door hangers saying things like, â??Check out your neighbors yard. Doesnâ??t it look great? Donâ??t you want your yard to look that good?â?? Then we would get their phone number out of a reverse directory and call them until they threatened to call the police.

Now I go out and hang lawn care door hangers marketing my materials. I generally try to do that on weekends hoping that Iâ??ll catch someone working out in there yard. Again, I use the soft sell technique. Generally, something like, â??wouldnâ??t you rather be spending time doing something else right now?â?? If thereâ??s kids around I use that to my advantage. I have kids of my own and I say things like, â??they wonâ??t be this small for long, trust me. Quit spending your weekends working in your yard. I can free up your weekend for $XX.XX, but your son/daughters childhood is priceless.â?? In fact Iâ??m trying to figure out how to put that last statement into a door hanger. Kind of like the Mastercard commercial. Anyone with any ideas would be greatly appreciated.â??

So after playing around with a few ideas I came up with this lawn care business door hanger design. You can download it for free and try it out. Let me know what type of results you get.

Remember when you are out working, distribute your door hangers using the clover leaf lawn care marketing technique. Get your door hanger on a few houses to each side of the home you are mowing as well as hang the lawn care door hangers on a few houses across the street. This is the best way to maximize your time and add more lawn care customers to your route.

Next up, let&apos;s talk about the free lawn care business websiet design.


I was contacted by Matt on the GopherHaul Lawn Care Business Forum and we worked out this great deal to give away one free Lawn care business website makeover. I am really excited about this. Let me turn this over to Matt to tell us what he is offering.

            <description>How often have you had questions about business insurance but just didnâ??t get around to asking your insurance agent. Itâ??s possible you are just starting out and donâ??t have lawn care business insurance yet. As we have found through our investigation on this topic, no one knows better what your insurance needs are than your local insurance agent. Each companyâ??s needs are as unique as the services they provide. Each state will also have different insurance requirements of you.
Since these questions come up quite often, we decided to compile a list of the most common insurance questions asked by lawn care business owners and found a friendly insurance agent to give us answers.

1. Q: How does an LCO determine which liability policy should be purchased? What percentage of LCOâ??s have the following coverage? $500,000.00, $1,000,000.00 or $2,000,000.00

 Answer: Most all carry $2,000,000 the difference in premium is minimal between 1 &amp; 2 million worth of coverage.

2. Q: What is a reasonable rate for a $500,000.00 / $1,000,000 / $2,000,000 liability insurance policy?

 Answer: Rates are based either on number of employees or sales. For an operation with 4 employees an approximate premium would be $2500.

3. Q: How much more on average is a $10 million or $20 million dollar liability policy, what percentage of LCOâ??s have this coverage?

 Answer: Most lawn care companies donâ??t carry these high limits.

4. Q: What is the average LCO deductible for liability and theft?

 Answer: I recommend carrying deductibles of $1,000

            <description>Trying to figure out how much to charge for snow plowing can be pretty tough. If you charge too much, you wonâ??t get any jobs. If you charge too little you wonâ??t make any profit. Now it is important to keep in mind what the going rate for snow plowing services is in your area but you must know your operational costs because you might find, you canâ??t even make a profit at the market snow plow rate, if you arenâ??t careful.
So how do you go about coming up with a figure to charge per hour for snow plowing? I put together this great snow plowing bid calculator. It asks you a bunch of questions to take into consideration your truck, snowplow, salter, and other overhead costs. Then it takes into account how many snow storms you have on average and how many billable hours you have per storm. After crunching the numbers, it returns a $ figure per hour you must charge to cover your costs and adds a percentage profit for you and your business.

Try out the snow plow business calculator and see how it works for you. Play around with the different figures to see how changing them can change how much you should be charging per hour. If you have questions on how to use the snow plowing calculator, visit the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum http://www.gopherforum.com and ask away. Donâ??t forget to check out the free snow plowing flyer template here.

            <description>With the economy taking a down turn, there are going to be many new opportunities for entrepreneurs to get started with their own business. A lot of times people will think about starting their own business but if they have a full time job, the job will most likely take priority over starting a business. But if you get laid off, you then can jump on the opportunity to finally start the business you wanted. Here is a great question and a great example of an entrepreneur taking advantage of his resources and his knowledge to get his new business off the ground. In the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum he wrote Ã¢Â?Â?Hi I am totally new to all of this. I mowed lawns while I was younger and through high school in my neighborhood and can do just about anything there is. I was just recently laid off at a excavating business because people are not wanting to build new houses or buildings right now.
Right now as I am just starting it is frustrating trying to get new accounts. Beyond lawn care, I also am doing snow removal. I am not too good at this whole internet deal but I managed to start up my own website as well. I am trying to make a flyer right now with my plan to make around 1,000 flyers and just start going door to door. I do not know any other way to just get my name out there.

What are the best ways to go out there and get customers? Are there any suggestions out there to make my company look better than the others? I just want my company to stand out more than others so we look like we have been in business and so people would come to me more than other lawn care businesses
Thanks to everyone that helps!Ã¢Â?Â?

I think first off you should jump on promoting services you can offer now that can make you money now. If your new business doesnÃ¢Â?Â?t start making money quickly, you may lose interest in it or others around you may push you to consider other alternatives. There is nothing like making a profit to show the nay sayers they were wrong and you were right.

So how do you do this? Get on the Gopher Forum and download some of the winter snow plowing templates. I have a bunch of them for snow plowing and holiday light decorations. Edit the flyers as you need to and start handing them out to family members and friends. Get business cards made up and hand them out to everyone you know. In fact, give them a couple each. Tell them you are just getting started and you would appreciate any work you can get.

Review the concentric circle marketing chart I posted in the forum and on my blog. It gives you a graphical representation of what you should be doing. Market to your inner core first. That would be friends and family. Have them become spokespeople for your business and have them help get the word out about your business too by telling their friends, co-workers and community organization members. Hang up flyers where ever you can, such as in local stores. Go door to door and hand out flyers that promote your winter services. The more people you meet, the better your chances are of landing a new customer.

If you need a business logo, remember I have hundreds of free lawn care business logo templates you can download and use from the Gopher Forum. Thirdly answer your phone and always be friendly and approachable, this should help you win many people over.

Lastly if you have time, you should consider doing something that is both a good deed for your community and a publicity stunt of sorts to attract media attention. Since you will be offering snow plowing, why not consider starting a volunteer group that clears walkways and driveways of elder members of your community. Contact the local paper and tell them you are looking to form this group and you will be heading it. Have interested volunteers contact you at your business number or contact you through your website and ask for those senors in need of free service to contact you as well. Possibly offer it on a scale of the neediest first. This could be a great way to get your picture in the local paper and get the word out about your new snow plowing service. It will also build up goodwill within your community and free publicity. One simple article could really get your business launched.
So try these ideas out and let us know how they all work.

            <description>Once you are contacted by a potential client and meet with them to bid on their property, you arenâ??t done yet. Remember to always follow up. This applies to both commercial and residential lawn care customers.

Kim asked â??I was just wondering after someone calls you for a lawn care estimate and you go out meet with them, and then submit a bid, do most of them let you know if you didnâ??t get the job or just kinda blow you off.â??

Tom answered â??A few things will probably happen:
1. They will say something like â??Geez, that is higher than I thought it would be.â?? At this point you can either haggle with the price or tell them, â??sorry, that is the price,â?? and stick to your guns.
2. They will say something like â??when can you start.â?? They agree to the price and want you to do it.

3. Or they say â??I will have to talk it over with my husband/wife.â?? Nine times out of ten when someone says that, you probably will not get the bid. Now they will either call you back and tell you yes or no, or will not bother calling at all. I recommend that after a few days to give them a call up and ask them if they had any questions in regarding the bid. It helps get the ball rolling again.â??

Kim then asked â??Okay how about commercial accounts, when they are excepting bids and say were not deciding until the middle of March. Should I call them back then or just hope to hear from them and if I didnâ??t get it will they call and tell me. Or just let it go?â??

Tom said â??If you havenâ??t heard anything after a while, then I would follow up with a phone call and even perhaps a letter.â??

Steve followed up by saying â??Iâ??m with Tom, follow up. Sometimes they want to see how interested you are and that just might make the deal for you.â??

Following up with clients is a great way to improve your chances of landing the lawn care bid. Use your call as an opportunity to go over any questions they might have or any sticking points and close the sale.

            <description>With winter on its way, many new lawn care business owners are looking to add snow plowing to their list of winter services. Trying to come up with an idea on how to charge can be challenging, especially for new businesses.

A Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum member asked such a question regarding snow plow services. I have clients asking to have one payment for snow plowing their driveways for the winter season. Is there anywhere that one can get some sort of idea as to the expected snow for the season this year? I have searched everywhere, but found nothing. Realizing that predicting snowfall for any given year is about impossible, I am just wondering if anyone here has come up with an idea to supply this type of service. I did some last year, but lost each of them this year because we only had enough snow to plow 2 times, but they felt they paid a lot for just the 2 snow plows. 

Pete: I charge by the hour sometimes. My minimum for snow plowing small driveways is $35 under 6 inches of snow. Over 6 inches of snow I will charge 40% more. My hourly rate is $125/hr per truck. Salting or sanding the driveway or lot is 40% more. It is hard to price a job when you first get into snow removal. The actual removal is easy. If you have the right equipment you could make good money. I leave a invoice in their mailbox if they are not home, but I knock when Im done with the job to see if they have cash or a check for me. If not then they have 10 days to send me the money or they will get charge a late fee.

Tim: Here is how we charge for snow plowing:
$50 min for residential driveways every 2inches of snow fall. So if there is before we can get to them it would be $50 x 3 salt is $2.75 per pound spread.

$$$ per push on commercial every 2 in. of snow fall $3.00 per pound of salt spread.

For ex. we have a commercial customer that has 4 miles of street and 4 mail stations.

We charge them $175 per push every 2inches of snow fall this includes 2 passes (1 down &amp; 1 back) clearing cul-de-sacs and clearing mail stations, $3.00 per pound of salt used. Approx 1,000 lbs per application if we do all. We also stated in the contract we are not responsible to clear in front of or behind any cars/trucks street parked. Basically the contract states if the cars/truck get plowed in, we are not responsible to digging them 

Ken: Heres how we charge up here in the north east. The worst winter Ive had is 9 storms, the best, 27. We average 12-15 winter storms. So heres what I offer:

 * Per push - each time we come, we charge full time. I do my best to NOT allow any inch-limits (i.e. then we come out, or push every two inches, etc.) because truthfully, everyone has a different idea of what 2inches is and its just one more place for conflict. If I have a commercial acct, and they INSIST on that verbiage, I accept and hope for the best, but I would NOT accept any cut in pay if I missed the 2inches mark. We charge full price each push, $15 minimum - most of mine are $20-$25 per push. I charge $5-$10 to cleanup the end of the driveway if needed after the storm.
 * (NOTE: I do not offer per storm. If someone insisted on it, Id just charge 2-2.5 times my per push rate and hope for the best)
 * Per season - with insurance. I dont offer a blanket per season charge because there is WAY too much variance in the amount of snow we get. It would be like saying Ill build you a house for $125,000 and then hoping you decide on a 900 sf ranch and not a 2,000 sf colonial. What I do is figure 15 storms, 2 visits per storm. Lets say its $25 per push, their contract would be $25 x 2 x 15 or $750. This amount would cover them from a minimum of 11 storms to a maximum of 18 storms. If we had less than 11, they get some refund, if more than 18, they get a bill. THIS gives them a 90% probability, give or take, of meeting their budgeted amount, but also covers us from extremes.

$50 min for residential driveways every 2inches of snow fall. So if there is before we can get to them it would be $50 x 3 salt is $2.75 per pound spread.

$$$ per push on commercial every 2 in. of snow fall $3.00 per pound of salt spread.

For ex. we have a commercial customer that has 4 miles of street and 4 mail stations.

We charge them $175 per push every 2inches of snow fall this includes 2 passes (1 down &amp; 1 back) clearing cul-de-sacs and clearing mail stations, $3.00 per pound of salt used. Approx 1,000 lbs per application if we do all. We also stated in the contract we are not responsible to clear in front of or behind any cars/trucks street parked. Basically the contract states if the cars/truck get plowed in, we are not responsible to digging them 

Ken: Heres how we charge up here in the north east. The worst winter Ive had is 9 storms, the best, 27. We average 12-15 winter storms. So heres what I offer:

 * Per push - each time we come, we charge full time. I do my best to NOT allow any inch-limits (i.e. then we come out, or push every two inches, etc.) because truthfully, everyone has a different idea of what 2inches is and its just one more place for conflict. If I have a commercial acct, and they INSIST on that verbiage, I accept and hope for the best, but I would NOT accept any cut in pay if I missed the 2inches mark. We charge full price each push, $15 minimum - most of mine are $20-$25 per push. I charge $5-$10 to cleanup the end of the driveway if needed after the storm.
 * (NOTE: I do not offer per storm. If someone insisted on it, Id just charge 2-2.5 times my per push rate and hope for the best)
 * Per season - with insurance. I dont offer a blanket per season charge because there is WAY too much variance in the amount of snow we get. It would be like saying Ill build you a house for $125,000 and then hoping you decide on a 900 sf ranch and not a 2,000 sf colonial. What I do is figure 15 storms, 2 visits per storm. Lets say its $25 per push, their contract would be $25 x 2 x 15 or $750. This amount would cover them from a minimum of 11 storms to a maximum of 18 storms. If we had less than 11, they get some refund, if more than 18, they get a bill. THIS gives them a 90% probability, give or take, of meeting their budgeted amount, but also covers us from extremes.

            <description>We have been talking about how to start up different kinds of businesses on here lately and it got me thinking. What if you or your gf/wife always wanted to start a bakery kind of business but wanted to start small at first. Maybe you wanted to start with cookies. You could create a website and then promote it on the cookies somewhere. I bet you could also sell this holiday customer cookie idea to other small businesses in the area if you had extra time and things were slowing down. I bet it could be a great money maker.

What if you started baking holiday cookies that you gave as a gift to your lawn care customers to help build a better bond with them and increase your customer retention rates? You could get a bunch of holiday tins that could hold the cookies. Maybe you could get different sizes. Small tins for lawn care smaller customers and larger tins for lawn care customers who pay you a lot more than average. Possibly your commercial account customers could get a larger tin and maybe even a gift card in it for a local restaurant.

Especially with your bigger clients, you really want to keep these people happy.

Inside the tins at the bottom, you could include a holiday card and maybe 2 â??friends and familyâ?? referral coupons for a free lawn cut for new lawn care customers only. This would be a great gift your current customers could give to their friends and neighbors. Another benefit of putting the card at the bottom would be if the customer re-gifted the cookie tin to someone else, you would still be reaching out to a new customer who could use the coupons themselves.

If you are giving a large tin to a commercial client, you might want to individually wrap each cookie and place a sticker at the bottom of each one that could promote 1 free lawn mowing. For use by residents within your town and a yard no bigger than X sq ft. Cannot be combined and valid through a certain date. These could then be placed at the front desk of the facility for the employees or visitors to take.

Maybe you could even give a commercial facility two cookie tins. A smaller one for your contact there and a larger one for the front desk.

            <description>Search engine optimization 101 for lawn care businesses.

You can put together a great looking site but people need to find it when they are searching for lawn service. How do you get your site to appear when a potential customer is looking for lawn care service? You need to know what they are looking for and you need to give them what they want. The keyword here, is â??keywords!â??

What are your keywords? Well say for instance you lived in Denver, Co and offered lawn care. A potential customer is most likely going to be looking for Denver Lawn Care or Denver lawn maintenance. If you are unsure of what your keywords should be, ask your friends or family, what words they would search for to find a local lawn care business online and go with the words you hear most often in response. I would think you would want to keep the keyword count to a minimum, maybe 4 or so.
Your ideal keyword count should be between 10% and 20% of the total word count of your site, so ask yourself, where are you ranking?

To figure this out do the following.

 * Right click on your websites main page and then left click on select all.
 * Open up your word processor and then paste the text into a new document.
 * Use the word count feature of your word processor to show you the total word count of your webpage.
 * Then do a search and see how many times each of your keywords appear.
 * (total word count) divided by (keyword count) will give you the percentage.

Try this out and see how you are doing.

Now letâ??s see how it is put to use. A new forum member posted an introduction and asked a great question â??I used a Gopher lawn care business web template from this site to create my lawn care company website and just got it on the net earlier this morning. How can I attract potential customers to my website?â??

You are not going to believe this example I am about to show you but itâ??s real. Matt has done such a great job with key words and having other sites link to his lawn care website that he appears in 7 out of the top 10 search results. Thatâ??s right! You heard right! In fact, if you were competing with him in his area, the chances of a new customer finding you are next to nothing because most people will not go beyond the first 10 results to their search.
Matt: â??When people to a search for lawn service or lawn care in my area I am usually have all 7 slots out of 10 or sometimes 8 slots out of 10 on the search engine. Do a search for lawn care in dothan on google and you will see.

You will see a bunch of J &amp; M Lawn Care links. Also I am located in the local business directory.â??

This is just so outstanding! If you are going to have any chance at all attracting customers on the internet, you need to visit these sites that are linking to Mattâ??s site and then fill in your business information to have them direct to you in your area. Also review your key words and let us know how all this works out for you. Join in on the discussion at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum here.

            <description>When most landscapers start up their business, they tend to start with a truck only. Then later they may add an open trailer. At a certain point you may be asking yourself whatÃ¢??s better to have, an open or enclosed trailer and why?

ThatÃ¢??s the question one of our new forum members asked and he quite a few responses I think will help you make up your mind as well.

            <description>When you are looking to gain new landscaping or lawn care customers, consider reaching out to your local garden centers. Purchase your supplies from them and see if you can get a business card display at their registers. Then ask the staff who sell lawn and garden supplies to refer your lawn care business for any install projects.

One of my friends in the past had hooked up with a garden center and gave the store employees 10% cash of the job total when they referred a customer to him to do a job with material that were purchased at the garden center.

            <title>Marketing lessons to learn from a realtor turned lawn care business owner</title>

            <description>If there is one group of local business people I find are constantly hammering me with direct mail marketing material, itâ??s realtors. They really seem to have their act together when it comes to promoting their name and face out to the local community. So lucky me and lucky us when a new Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum member joined up to say hi to everyone and shared with us his story on how he got started with his lawn care business and some marketing secrets he learned as a realtor.
Jim: â??Hello Everyone, I just wanted to say hi and introduce myself. Iâ??m just starting my lawn care service and to be honest I am a little nervous. I got here on accident, after being a real estate agent for several years my business was killed with the housing crunch, so I went back to driving truck. I drove truck most of my life, I did network marketing, and then was offered a business cleaning up bank owned homes. Well after you clean them up you also have to provide lawn service. The banks want two cuts a month for $100.00. Right now I have 17 homes, so I decided to expand it to regular homes. I have allot to learn but we are excited and ready to roll.â??

Steve: â??You have a great history. What kinds of things do you feel you are able to bring to your lawn care business from your previous real estate and network marketing business? I am sure you learned a lot of great marketing concepts.â??

Jim: â??Thanks! I learned a lot about marketing in real estate, but the most important thing is you canâ??t beat a referrals from a happy customer!!! When my wife and I started out in real estate we had no budget, so we made up a flyerâ??s that we dropped off on door steps. We picked a good geographic area with 200 homes. We made the flyer with cool and interesting facts. We also included a recipe of the month and what the housing market was doing. People loved it, but you have to know that you must hit a person 6 to 9 times to be noticed and you have to stand out. The fridge magnet is great marketing tool. One of the best fridge magnets I have used is a fridge calender for clients, so your name is always on their mind. Constant contact is key, and follow up with this line:

OH BY THE WAYâ?¦
Iâ??m never too busy for your referrals!!
Talk to You soonâ??

Great advice from someone who knows what works. If you would like to join in on this discussion further, visit this post at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

            <itunes:subtitle>Marketing lessons to learn from a realtor turned lawn care business owner</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>If there is one group of local business people I find are constantly hammering me with direct mail marketing material, itâ??s realtors. They really seem to have their act together when it comes to promoting their name and face out to the local community. So lucky me and lucky us when a new Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum member joined up to say hi to everyone and shared with us his story on how he got started with his lawn care business and some marketing secrets he learned as a realtor.
Jim: â??Hello Everyone, I just wanted to say hi and introduce myself. Iâ??m just starting my lawn care service and to be honest I am a little nervous. I got here on accident, after being a real estate agent for several years my business was killed with the housing crunch, so I went back to driving truck. I drove truck most of my life, I did network marketing, and then was offered a business cleaning up bank owned homes. Well after you clean them up you also have to provide lawn service. The banks want two cuts a month for $100.00. Right now I have 17 homes, so I decided to expand it to regular homes. I have allot to learn but we are excited and ready to roll.â??

Steve: â??You have a great history. What kinds of things do you feel you are able to bring to your lawn care business from your previous real estate and network marketing business? I am sure you learned a lot of great marketing concepts.â??

Jim: â??Thanks! I learned a lot about marketing in real estate, but the most important thing is you canâ??t beat a referrals from a happy customer!!! When my wife and I started out in real estate we had no budget, so we made up a flyerâ??s that we dropped off on door steps. We picked a good geographic area with 200 homes. We made the flyer with cool and interesting facts. We also included a recipe of the month and what the housing market was doing. People loved it, but you have to know that you must hit a person 6 to 9 times to be noticed and you have to stand out. The fridge magnet is great marketing tool. One of the best fridge magnets I have used is a fridge calender for clients, so your name is always on their mind. Constant contact is key, and follow up with this line:

OH BY THE WAYâ?¦
Iâ??m never too busy for your referrals!!
Talk to You soonâ??

Great advice from someone who knows what works. If you would like to join in on this discussion further, visit this post at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.

            <description>Real estate agents are the first people to really make contact with new home owners in your area. The agent has already built up a bond with the new home owner and is in a great position to refer your services to them. Why not team up with one or many real estate agents in your area. Help them create a welcome to the neighborhood kit and give yourself a head start jump on your competitors.

Rob wrote us on how he got involved with a real estate agent to cross market his lawn care business to new home owners.

Rob: â??While I was working yesterday a real estate agent stopped to talk to me. He has built a great referral program and a service package that he gives home buyers when they buy a house. He told me he wanted to put me on his â??preferredâ?? service providers list that goes in these packages.

Right away he gave me a coffee cup with his all his information on it and a Thanksgiving card and small candle for my wife. The candle had all of his information on it as well. What a great idea!

He told me he would help me make a flyer like the one he gave me which was very professional and nice. Also told me he could help me grow my business. Based off of referrals. I only talked to him for about 10 min cuz it was getting dark and I had to load up and leave.

On the front there was a picture of a family around a thanksgiving table that says â??Happy Thanksgiving Thanks for making me part of your life.â?? On the inside is a recipe for pumpkin pie dip. It says his name and real estate office then â??A referal is sending someone you care about to someone you trust. Thank you for trusting me.â?? I think its a great idea with the recipe and all. It also came in a bag with the candle.

I thought the card with the recipe inside and the candle with info was pretty cool. Iâ??m going to do something like this with my Christmas cards. He seemed to be doing good with it.â??

Steve: â??I really like the idea. He positions himself to be the go to person in the community as he creates this network of contractors in the area with his referral group. This not only helps him build good will with the new home owner but he also builds awareness of his services through his contractor contacts. Both sides benefit.â??

Rob: â??He called me last night and gave me a customer to contact for some work. Iâ??m going to there house tomorrow for a bid. I was surprised. I have talked to a lot of agents and usually donâ??t here back from them. He said to let him know when I want to meet with him so he can help me make up some literature. He can probably give me some great ideas on a referral program since hes been so successful with his.â??

Steve: â??Does he want a referral fee for this? Or how does this work?â??

Rob: â??No fee, he just expects the same in return. I run into people about twice an month that are selling there houses so I will refer him. He had a very good presentation for his service package and referral program. A notebook full of colorful, laminated pages that he has spent some time on. Not just something he threw together.â??

Steve: â??That is fantastic. You should contact other real estate agents to do this with and get a hold of more contractors as well to work together on welcome packages.â??

Rob: â??I went out and gave them a bid and got a $650 job this weekend!â??

This is a great example of how networking with others in your area can really help you reach out to more potential customers with a minimal expense on your part. As we all know, keeping your expenses to a minimum is very important, especially when you are just starting out.

            <description>What if, instead of business cards, you had coupons printed up that were the size of dollar bills. You could hold them in your wallet and when you handed them to people, they could keep it in their wallet as well.

You could hand these out to current customers to give to their friends or to people you just meet around town.

You could add in a few conditions like they can not be combined and maybe have an expiration date, but I think it would sure beat just getting a business card. This is something, as a potential customer, you could use!
Here is a concept you can download and use. See how they work out. You could have your wife or husband give these out too. Maybe even your employees or your kids! Heck give your entire extended family some to hand out. Get everyone into the act of promoting your lawn care business.

            <description>I am constantly learning new things on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum www.gopherforum.com . The things that amaze me the most are the things that I just would have never thought of without the help of others. Take for example this simple topic. How many welcome letters should you send to each of your new lawn care customers? I would figure one would suffice. However, when we started talking about it, I learned that other lawn care business owners were sending up to FOUR! Four welcome letters at different times to a new customer! Who would have thunk!

Initially I was talking about a concept where each new lawn care customer would get a letter specific to their needs. However as we got into this the discussion grew and taught me as your lawn care business grows, so does your need to change your marketing. As your client list grows longer, you are probably going to be afforded less time to individually customize your marketing for each client. Instead you will find a need to create more generic material that can be used for all of the new customers.

Ed: â??Our company is a little to big to customize our marketing. With 15 lawn care technicians and an average of 25 lawns per technician, it would be difficult to keep track of.

I think making sure the customer is well informed on how your company handles different situations would help with the customer retention. In my welcome kit, I have tried to include answers to every question they may have.

I started my welcome kits in July. Next month I will do an analysis on the retention rate from the customers that received a welcome kit to see if it really has any affect.â??

Steve: â??Do you mean you include a general list of business frequently asked questions? Like who to contact. How you bill etc. Or do you mean more like lawn specific problem questions?â??

Ed: â??Both. It contains the frequently ask questions about how we do business &amp; answers about how much the lawn should be watered, mowed, etc. Also answers about what to do after the applications, and if they come across any problems with their lawns.â??

Chestin: â??I can see how sending a personalized letter with specifics about the property could be very beneficial, but at the same time itâ??s almost too much work.

I think Ed hit the nail on the head in the sense you want to create materials that are reusable and duplicatible. Instead of taking Before &amp; After shots of that particular customers lawn, using â??any lawnâ?? youâ??ve done previously should be enough to convey the story you want to get across.

Also, consider sending a few â??welcomeâ?? letters.

 * One immediately after they sign the contract.
 * Another before the first service visit, this could be your â??Welcome Kitâ??.
 * Another immediately after the first lawn care service visit.
 * And then maybe another one a week later.

Each one would contain something different that cements the relationship, reminds the customer of all the benefits theyâ??ll be receiving, and potentially even upsells or lets them know about additional services you offer as well.

Ultimately, it comes down to building a relationship with the customer and viewing them like a person, not a transaction. The instant they become simply a transaction is the instant theyâ??re on their way out the door as a customer. Especially in todayâ??s economy.â??
Ed: â??That is a good point. I think I will look into doing that also. Maybe by sending them a survey to see if we have met their expectations so far, or to see if they have any questions we may be able to answer.â??

Steve: â??How do you suggest coming up with a list of frequently asked questions, to answer?â??

Chestin: â??I always suggest sitting down and making a list of general questions. Ideally theyâ??re ones that come up frequently, but it could also include questions that we might think are extremely basic.

One thing to remember is that itâ??s easy to assume people know the basics about what you do. In most cases however, people donâ??t have the first idea so my rule of thumb is never assume anything.â??

So the next time you sign up a new lawn care customer, you will be well equipped to do the best you can to retain that customer for the long haul and make them feel appreciated and wanted.

            <description>Lawn care business owners are always looking for a way to keep their name and phone number in front of potential customers. Here is an idea to make sure you stick around. Why not get some magnets. But not just any old magnet, how about one that pays for itself and could even make you a profit. 
Here is what you can do.
Get a list of local important numbers in the area.
Town numbers like the mayor, police, library, water and sewer dept. You can find most of these on your towns websites.
Then list other numbers like local pizzerias, sub shops, and others.
Maybe get a local electrician, plumber, carpenter, roofer etc. They could potentially help you buy some of these magnets and hand them out themselves as well, to help offset the costs.
Then have a section for lawn care and list only your phone number.
Stick these on doors in your area and be sure that your number will stick around for quite some time.
You could also have different discounts for services through out the year.


One of our forum members&apos; Rob had such an easy time selling them. Why? Because he knew most of the people he was presenting the idea too and they trusted him.

http://gopherforum.com/showthread.php?t=7522
http://lawnchat.com/?p=224

This is a great lesson in how the more people you know, the more you can sell. So if you are looking for a wild way to get media attention, why not consider this idea. Run for president!

http://lawnchat.com/?p=239

http://gopherforum.com/showthread.php?t=7548


If you put up lawn signs along the road and they are for your lawn care business, they will get pulled by your local township. But what if you were running for president? Your lawn signs would stay up and the local media would want to know all about what you are doing.
Wouldnâ??t this be a great way to get noticed in your area?
Is it crazy? Yes it is. Crazy enough to get you attention.
Why not do this.
Register a domain bobforpresident.com 
Have that domain forwarded to a subfolder of your lawn care business
This will then allow you to get the people visiting your political website to then be forwarded to your business website where you would have a separate page for your political campaign. 
Create political signs with your picture on it. 
Create some kind of platform you are running for. 
The more quasi-serious you keep it, the better the chance it will get picked up by your local media. 
Ask people to write you in on the ballot. 
Create door hangers and flyers for this. Hand them out. 
Meet people in your area. 
When the election is over, everyone will still be talking about you. 
Create a video of you talking about your platform and upload it to youtube.

            <itunes:summary>Lawn care business owners are always looking for a way to keep their name and phone number in front of potential customers. Here is an idea to make sure you stick around. Why not get some magnets. But not just any old magnet, how about one that pays for itself and could even make you a profit. 
Here is what you can do.
Get a list of local important numbers in the area.
Town numbers like the mayor, police, library, water and sewer dept. You can find most of these on your towns websites.
Then list other numbers like local pizzerias, sub shops, and others.
Maybe get a local electrician, plumber, carpenter, roofer etc. They could potentially help you buy some of these magnets and hand them out themselves as well, to help offset the costs.
Then have a section for lawn care and list only your phone number.
Stick these on doors in your area and be sure that your number will stick around for quite some time.
You could also have different discounts for services through out the year.


One of our forum members&apos; Rob had such an easy time selling them. Why? Because he knew most of the people he was presenting the idea too and they trusted him.

This is a great lesson in how the more people you know, the more you can sell. So if you are looking for a wild way to get media attention, why not consider this idea. Run for president!

http://gopherforum.com/showthread.php?t=7548


If you put up lawn signs along the road and they are for your lawn care business, they will get pulled by your local township. But what if you were running for president? Your lawn signs would stay up and the local media would want to know all about what you are doing.
Wouldnâ??t this be a great way to get noticed in your area?
Is it crazy? Yes it is. Crazy enough to get you attention.
Why not do this.
Register a domain bobforpresident.com 
Have that domain forwarded to a subfolder of your lawn care business
This will then allow you to get the people visiting your political website to then be forwarded to your business website where you would have a separate page for your political campaign. 
Create political signs with your picture on it. 
Create some kind of platform you are running for. 
The more quasi-serious you keep it, the better the chance it will get picked up by your local media. 
Ask people to write you in on the ballot. 
Create door hangers and flyers for this. Hand them out. 
Meet people in your area. 
When the election is over, everyone will still be talking about you. 
Create a video of you talking about your platform and upload it to youtube. 
Get all your friends involved. 
Have them put signs on their car doors and trunks. 
Your political party could be the grass roots party.

Hello and welcome to GopherHaul 27 - Lawn Care Software Business Forum Show

Intro.

First off I&apos;d like to say hi to everyone after this summer&apos;s hiatus from producing the GopherHaul Show.

There has a lot that has been going on.

If you haven&apos;t noticed, the Gopher Forum has gotten a make over and a new website. Http://www.gopherforum.com

I have been busy trying to organize all the great lawn care business content on there to provide you with an easier way to read and learn.

Also I got a bunch of lawn care business and lawn care marketing books published. There are some on sale too so jump on this. Click on the link on the Gopher Lawn Care Business forum. Here are a listing of the new lawn care business books.

Stop Lowballing! A Lawn Care Business Owner&apos;s Guide To Success 
The GopherHaul Lawn Care Marketing &amp; Landscaping Business Show Episode Guide. 
How to get customers for your landscaping and lawn care business all year long. Volume #1 &amp; #2 
The Big Lawn Care Marketing Book 
How to use Gopher Lawn Care Business Billing &amp; Scheduling Software. 
The landscaping and lawn care business plan startup guide. This one is just about to be published.


Fall leaf clean up letter.

I want to thank Gary for sharing with us this fall lawn care business leaf clean up letter. Before fall comes along, why not send out this letter in your invoices to your lawn care customers. Ask them how you should handle their leaf clean up and also offer other additional fall services like gutter cleaning.
Gary also suggested when bidding out your gutter cleaning, he charges $60 per hour. This should help you when you are estimating your jobs.

How to get your lawn care business on commercial lawn care bid lists?

Ron wrote â??Hi me and my brother have mainly had residential accounts and a couple commercial accounts. We are trying to get 2 to3 town homes this next season. The only problem is that we are not sure how we get a meeting with the association. We are hoping that somebody could help us out on this, and maybe tell us how they came about getting townhomes. 

If you are looking to get commercial lawn care accounts next year, now is the time to get on their bid lists. This also applies to home owner associations and condos. There is a new free lawn care business letter for this in the letter section.

Lawn Care Marketing Idea

This fall when your lawn care business is looking for more services to offer, why not consider offering your lawn care customers, stump grinding services. Our friend Bob from plan-itgraphics.com put together this great flyer concept to help you sell your stump grinding services. Why not get some of these flyers printed up and then hand them out in your area. Try and schedule as many stump grinding services as closely together and then rent a stump grinder for a couple of days.
You could also consider placing an ad in a local paper and mentioning 10% off stump grinding services if you contact us by xx/xx/xx. Or you could use a catchy headline like GET RID OF THAT EYESORE STUMP.
Service your lawn care customerâ??s stumps and make some great money to get your through the winter!
If you are unsure about how to price your stump grinding services consider this and visit the post on this discussion at the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum.
Large stump grinding services range around $150-$300. Small stumps are about $75.

            <description>This is Steve with GopherHaul. Check out the GopherHaul video show on youtube and download Gopher Lawn Care Business Software at http://www.gophersoftware.com 
I am here today with Keith Harper of www.StartALawnCareBusiness.com A recent question on the Gopher Lawn Care Business forum had to do with bidding government mowing contract. Keith has experience bidding and winning large scale government contracts and he is willing to share some advice on the procedure.

GH: Keith, how does a lawn care company go about finding which contracts they might want to bid on?
 
SALCB: There are four primary avenues to finding contract on which to bid. 
 
1) Newspapers: Many local governments have a set schedule to place public notices in the newspaper classified section. Normally they are placed Mondays or Wednesdays. Keep an eye on your local newspaper in the classifieds section under the &quot;Public Notices&quot; heading.
 
2) Purchasing Departments: For anyone wishing to bid on a contract it is imperative for them to get their name known at their local purchasing department. Many smaller contracts are knows as &quot;no bid contracts.&quot; The threshold of when a contract is no-bid depends on the contracting agency. Often, any job under $250 can be a no-bid contract. The purchasing department is your primary source for this information.
 
3) Bidding Lists: Bidding list are handled through the purchasing department. A contractor requests being put on a bidding list. He will normally sign an acknowledgement that he has read a statement of conduct outlining the basic regulations of bidding jobs.
 
4) Agency Website: Most government agencies now put their contracts up for bid on their websites.
 
Do not rely on any one of these avenues. An LCO should follow through with each one.
 
GH: You mention Purchasing Departments. Where do you find the purchasing department?</description>

GopherHaul breaks the 1,000,000 view mark! Thank you everyone for watching us!



New 1-on-1 private lawn care business consulting forum added.

I just added a new section to the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum. This section will fill a gap that I have seen for quite some time. I have met a few very talented businessmen and lawn care business authors who are able to assist in answering questions on the forum. However they were not able to dedicate the amount of time that they could have because of other commitments. So I asked them, if we set up a private forum area where a reader paid a subscription fee of $19.95 a month to get 1-on-1 business consulting advice, would they be able to make time to assist the forum readers? They both agreed, so lucky for us, we now have access to tap into their insights and thoughts for business advice. If you are running a lawn care business and are in need of business advice that will put you ahead of your competition by leaps and bounds all for less than the price of mowing one lawn per month, we have a great service for you. To sign up, either visit the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum or visit Keith&apos;s site at http://www.startalawncarebusiness.com or visit Ken&apos;s website at http://www.lawnguru.net and you can sign up for a subscription from either lawn care business expert.



New Lawn Care Business Book

I just got our latest Gopher Lawn Care Business Book â??Stop Lowballing, A Lawn Care Business Owner&apos;s Guide To Successâ?? available online. It&apos;s 122 pages packed with great information we learned over the years on the forum. You should get this book and read it to help yourself grow and succeed. To order the book visit http://www.createspace.com/3342248 or check it out on amazon.com in the next few days.

Also I am putting together the GopherHaul Lawn Care Business Show Episode Guide and I want to include as many of the forum members as possible. So please send me your photos for the book cover and a short bio I can use to promote your business.

Lawn Care Business Question:

â??I need help selling my accounts.â?? 

Greenmind wrote us â??I am selling my accounts this week to a local landscaper. He wants to pay me in 3 payments. Over a 3 month period or 90 days as people stay with the new company. Also he does not want to pay the initial payment until all customers are contacted. Is he buying my business or my customers? Also is the 90 day period normal or am I being to generous, I have talked with several people and they seem to think that he is taking some risk by buying my accounts and thats part of the business and some suggest that I charge more for letting him pay over 90 days. 

What do you guys think? Any help with someone with experience in this area would be very helpful. I don&apos;t want to get taking on this transaction. I worked very hard to get and keep these customers.â??

Lawn Care Business Podcast Discussion:

I had a great podcast interview with Author Ken Lavoie. Of lawnguru.net


1. We talked about the pitfalls of buying too much new too soon, Ken calls this &apos;Iron Addiction.&apos;

2. How ego effects business decisions and how to control it.

3. Then we talked about what marketing ideas worked and what didn&apos;t.

4. When and how you should integrate your first employee into your business.

5. And this was a fantastic topic Finance, Debt and Growth - &quot;The 50/50 Rule and stay in the black with the 20% Rule!&quot; If you find yourself making a lot of money but at the end of the year wondering where it all went, it&apos;s very possible you are growing too fast. In Ken&apos;s 50/50 rule, he suggests not financing any more than 50% of the equipment price. If you need to finance more than that, you shouldn&apos;t be purchasing the equipment.

Lawn Care Marketing Material Review:

Business Question:

A member of our Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum, Michelle asked about buying a lawn care business. How much should she be paying?

In response a member wrote:
&quot;General rule of thumb for buying customers is that they are worth about 1 month revenue. If they are commercial you&apos;ll pay a little more and if there is a signed multi-year agreement in place ( which you said there is ) then this will push the price up too. So it could be worth as much as 2 or 3 months revenue depending on the situation.&quot;


Mike then joined the discussion and talked about how many customers would stay with him after he bought their accounts.

&quot;I did lose a few here and there, but I only paid 2.5 times the mowing price, and usually got at least 3 mows before they quit me.&quot;


&quot;Have you checked some of his accounts to make sure they are priced in accordance with what you would charge?

One of the lawn companies I bought out was considerably higher in pricing than mine, so I ended up raising all my original customers up to that standard.&quot;

Should you offer to buy lawn care accounts on craigslist?

http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/c...

Fernando joined the discussion and said he posts ads in free online sites in which he offers to buy lawn care customer accounts. Here is the ad he posted in craigslist. Check out the full ad on our forum.

&quot;-Too Tired over the Summer? ...or can&apos;t keep up during the hot season?
-Too Hard to work from Sunrise to Sundown?
-Too busy to take care of ALL of your accounts during the &quot;Crunch Time&quot;?
-Customers complaining about not cutting the lawn on time?

I am willing to buy Lawn Accounts&quot;

All this information is great if you are interested in knowing how to buy lawn care accounts but what about selling them? How do you sell lawn care accounts? This poster wants to sell his accounts. How much and how should he do it.

One Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum member made a post about how best to make the transition when you sell lawn care accounts to a new lawn care business. &quot;I bought out 3 lawn companies, and all we did was send a letter to the customers, describing what happened(a new lawn company would be taking care of your yard)

If you want to meet each and everyone of them, then do it.

The new lawn care business owner may want you to sign a non-compete clause so you can&apos;t compete to take the customers back.&quot;

Kenneth LaVoie III wrote a book and starting a lawn care business entitled &quot;How to start a lawn care business a whole NEW way.&quot; One of the many fascinating things he discusses in the book is about pruning customers once a year. If there are customers that you find yourself clashing with, he suggests not to raise their price but to simply cancel service for them and replace them with newer clients you do work well with.

Hello and welcome to GopherHaul 23 - Lawn Care Marketing Business Show

In this episode we will be talking about

GopherHaul breaks the 700,000 view mark! Thank you everyone for watching us!

Lawn Care Business Marketing Idea:

One of our new Gopher lawn care forum members Emerald Green Lawn Care was kind enough to post a sample letter they use to contact property managers. In the letter they ask the property manager to put their lawn care business on the bidding list. This is important because when the property comes up for bid, your business will then be contacted.

Business Question:

Are you keeping track of where your new customers initially heard of your business from? If you aren&apos;t you might be wasting a huge amount of advertising dollars. Let&apos;s jump to a post Chuck made in our lawn care forum. 

In his post Chuck said &quot;I keep track of everything, I write the source (newspaper, phone book, word of mouth, walk up, online) on the top of my copy of an estimate or proposal because I always keep those. 2 nights ago I sat down with my wife to crunch those numbers, My findings were surprising. about 65-70% of my business thus far has come from 1 source &amp; at an advertising cost of just over $10 per customer! Pretty cheap. I tracked how many from each source, What was the average amount spent by the customers from each source too. Sometimes an add in one place will bring several small spenders &amp; while another brings a few big money accounts. Different publications have a different type or class of readers!&quot;

As you can see, this is powerful information for your lawn care business! I asked Chuck, with the knowledge you gained from tracking your lawn care marketing, will this effect your advertising spending?

Chuck then said &quot;Of course it will affect future marketing, I have a new add going into affect there asap. I can&apos;t believe we did so well with an add I only ran for about a month &amp; a half. I kick myself in the butt for not realizing it earlier.&quot;

Our friend Justin also jumped into the discussion and posted an excel sheet template to help you track your lawn care business advertising dollar.

http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=8;t=7298;

How to make the jump from lawn care to landscaping and then what kind of profit potential will you see when you get into landscaping?


Do you need the lawn cutting customer base to transition to landscaping or can you simply start off as a landscaper? Which way is easier?

Which landscaping projects provide for the best profit margins with the least amount of work?

Or friend and forum member Matt brought up a question if you should give a % of the profits to a friend/employee. How should this be handled?

Lawn painting service. This is where you would actually paint a dried up lawn, green to make it look healthy. It could be done during times of drought. $465.00 for a single application. Good idea? Would you offer it?

Do you use a contract? Is it different from your residential to your commercial clients? How many pages is the contract?

Hello and welcome to GopherHaul 21 -- Lawn Care Marketing Business Show.

In this episode we will be talking about

GopherHaul breaks the 500,000 view mark! Thank you everyone for watching us!

For a more in depth reading of our show, make sure you download the latest GopherHaul episode guide in pdf format. You can download this and previous episode guides here.

Inspirational Story:

When you are having trouble envisioning yourself starting your own business and you just can&apos;t imagine it happening. Or you feel the odds are stacked against you, I want to share with you two stories that will inspire you to say yes you indeed can get your business started.
I was able to get a chance to meet two great entrepreneurs who run their own lawn care business. What&apos;s so unique about them? They are both 14 years old and don&apos;t even have a drivers license yet!

The first entrepreneur I want to talk about is Mitch. He wrote me a short time ago to say &quot;My name is Mitch, and I&apos;m fourteen years old, and own my own lawn care company, DreamScapes Landscaping. I started when i was ten, mowing my neighbors yard and things have grown a lot since then! Either my dad or my grandma tows me around with my dad&apos;s Jeep and this year I can drive with my permit with my new truck! I just bought a 1999 Chevy 2500.&quot;

Check out the post he made and see pictures of his fleet with includes his truck, trailer and several mowers and trimmers! Mitch is an inspiration to us all. Now let&apos;s also meet Luke.

What to do?

Next up. What do you do when you recently bought a lawn care business and your largest client leaves? Let&apos;s find out.

Our new friend Amy got on the Gopher Lawn Care Business Forum and told us how she bought a landscaping business and lost a big client and now might lose her house. Read the post she made here.

She wrote &quot;I bought a commercial lawn business a little over 2 years ago and it has been nothing but heartbreak ever since. Lost our biggest customer (about 40% of revenue) and we&apos;ve been going downhill ever since. I am desperate to hold onto this business since I am in debt up to my eyeballs. I&apos;ll lose my house if I don&apos;t since it was used as collateral for the SBA loan.&quot;

&quot;My big push right now is cold-calling, letter sending to commercial accounts, etc. Which do you think is more effective and does anyone have any tips on letters?&quot;

Tim jumped in and had offered these suggestions: He said &quot;You can crawl out of this,&quot; and had a list of things she should consider doing.

First thing is to contact your Accountant and do a complete audit on the business. Look for every possible expense cut you can make, this is restructure time.

DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT go out there looking for that one big job or contract to get you out of this, chances are greater you&apos;re not going to get it in a fast way, If you do great but most probably not going to happen.

Look for quantity, the more recurring you can generate the stronger your business will be, do not limit yourself to only commercial, get out there and hit up the res market just as hard as if you where just getting started in business, hit those res areas multi-times not just once.

Then slam those small businesses the same way with letters and mailers, cold call, and phone calls. Get in their face. Step it up a notch. The accounting dept. or GM of the larger commercial facilities are the ones to contact most generally for being put on the bidders list.

Amy then posted a sales letter she was considering sending out to commercial facilities in her area and asked for suggestions on editing it. Tim edited the commercial lawn care sales letter and posted it here, where you can read it and possibly edit it to fit your own needs.

If our show or forum has helped you, or if you have any business questions, please let us know and send an email or make a post about your experience! I hope all these ideas have helped you expand and grow your business and mind. So until the next time, always remember to Dream it, Build it, Gopher it!

            <description>Hello and welcome to GopherHaul 19 â?? Lawn Care Entrepreneur Business Show.

GopherHaul 19

In this episode we will be talking about

 *

 Please continue to submit your pictures for our outdoor holiday lighting contest. http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=8;t=6159;

 *

 Our lawn care business forum member of the month is Tim.
 *

 Tim has shared with us three new contracts including a lawn cutting contract, a full service lawn care maintenance and a snow plow contract. You can download them here

 http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&amp;f=1&amp;t=877&amp;st=30&amp;&amp;#entry30713
 *

 I added a new link on the left side of the forum for our lawn care business forum member to submit books they have read. I also added a new business book of the month to our list. The book is Guerrilla Marketing Success Secrets by Jay Levinson.
 *

 Our friend Tony submitted this great marketing idea to the forum. He prints out stickers that include your business logo and then puts them on buckets of ice melt. He suggests handing these buckets out to your current customer base to help promote your snow removal services or you could use them as a marketing tool to hand out to homeowners in your area who you would like to service with snow removal and lawn care services next spring. If you live in a warmer climate you could also offer potted plants instead of ice melt.

 Our lawn care forum member Tim suggested buying poinsettia plants in bulk and handing them out to your current customers along with a holiday card. You could also give these out to potential clients you would like to provide snow plow or lawn care services to. Tim said he also sells the plants at a farmerâ??s market booth. He purchases the flowers for $2 and resells them for $5. Great idea!

 Brian from Lawn &amp; Garden Web Vision sent us this promotional video to show off his new website http://www.lawnandgardenwv.com Check out his site. Itâ??s full of many on demand education and training videos for the lawn and garden industry.

 Forum member Tim posted that now is the time to send out letters to businesses asking them to put your company on their 2008 bid list. You can download the letter here http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&amp;f=1&amp;t=1541&amp;st=0&amp;&amp;#entry29810

 Bob from Plan-it Graphics has posted a design challenge http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&amp;f=23&amp;t=6434&amp;st=0&amp;&amp;#entry29599 There will be two winners chosen. Bob said â??You do not have to do anything graphic wise. You can simply submit your ideas in text. If your idea is to have a guy riding his motorcycle with the caption, â??This is much better better than lawn work!â?? then thatâ??s all you have to do. We are not looking for the best designer, we are looking for the best/unique way to market. Hopefully we can come up with ideas that are â??outside the boxâ?? of the traditional lawn/landscape marketing material. Itâ??s my job to convert your idea into print form.â??

 In the previous episode of GopherHaul 18, we talked about how you should stay off ladders as much as possible. One of our forum members posted a shop vac device that is a long extension pipe with a u bend at the end which allows you to suck leaves out of the gutter while safe and standing on the ground. Read this post for a product review http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=17;t=6603;st=0

 I hope all these ideas have helped you expand and grow your business and mind. So until the next time, always remember to Dream it, Build it, Gopher it!</description>

 Our lawn care business forum member of the month is Tim.

 Tim has shared with us three new contracts including a lawn cutting contract, a full service lawn care maintenance and a snow plow contract. You can download them here

 I added a new link on the left side of the forum for our lawn care business forum member to submit books they have read. I also added a new business book of the month to our list. The book is Guerrilla Marketing Success Secrets by Jay Levinson.
 *

 Our friend Tony submitted this great marketing idea to the forum. He prints out stickers that include your business logo and then puts them on buckets of ice melt. He suggests handing these buckets out to your current customer base to help promote your snow removal services or you could use them as a marketing tool to hand out to homeowners in your area who you would like to service with snow removal and lawn care services next spring. If you live in a warmer climate you could also offer potted plants instead of ice melt.

            <description>GopherHaul 18 - Winter Lawn Care Entrepreneur Business Ideas &amp; Customer Retention

In this episode of GopherHaul we discuss winter lawn care business marketing ideas.

Hello everyone and welcome to Gopherhaul!
If you haven&apos;t started your business yet, what are you waiting for. If you don&apos;t start your business this year, you&apos;ll be at least 1 year older when you do so get started today!

GopherHaul is a show for entrepreneurs and new business owners. In it we discuss business tips and tricks we have learned over the years and share with you some real world experiences on how to help your lawn care business or any other business grow.

In this episode we will be talking about:

- We added a new section on the forum called Women&apos;s business issues.

- One of our forum members and entrepreneurs, Sarah did two things this season to really make her business stand out. First off she got out there in the public eye and put herself in her marketing material and second off she has started a toy drive to help collect toys for underprivileged children and promote her business at the same time.

Read more at this post http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/c...

- Rodman and Justin are the winners of the lawn care business holiday cards compliments of www.CardsCheaper.com

- Barry sent us some pictures of his newly painted lawn care trailer.

You can see Barry&apos;s new trailer pics at this link.

http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/c...

- I am now signed up with Chestin&apos;s Lawn Care Champion&apos;s Circle. Now I don&apos;t want to give any of his secrets away because he makes his money on teaching but there was an interesting part in one of Chestin&apos;s marketing discussions I wanted to point out. Chestin was talking with one of our forum members Barry and he was telling Chestin how everytime he seems to sign up a new customer, another customer seems to leave so his net gain is zero. Do you ever find this happening as well? Well just to find the answer in this would be well worth you signing up for Chestin&apos;s program. Even if you sign up for a month to simply check it out. You will find an answer on how to deal with this and you might want to stay on for all the new information he posts.

cott from leisuretimellc found to deal with this

- Another forum member Scott from leisuretimellc advises business owners to talk to their clients. He had talked to an elderly customer and found out her mowing day is the day before her trash day so he puts out the garbage cans for her and she gives him and extra $25 tip each month to do that. This is how he keeps his customers.

- Our lawn care business forum member Keith, also made a great seasonal service tip. This tip is especially important for those in the Northern sections of the country. During rainy winter days it is important to keep gutters free of leaves. If gutters are clogged, rain will pool in the gutters. Then, at night when the temperature drops, the water will freeze and back up into the over hangs. This action will damage the overhang allowing more water to enter the woodwork. The wood will rot.

Once problems begin, repairs can be very expensive. It is important and beneficial for lawn care companies to warn their customers of this potentially damaging problem. A quick $100 gutter job can save the homeowner thousands of dollars down the road.

We also have created a free flyer for you to promote this service which you can download and edit.

- If you don&apos;t like heights, maybe consider getting this gutter cleaning robot!

http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/c...

- We also started our outdoor holiday decoration contest so start taking pictures. We have a bunch of prize to give away, check the forum for more info. http://www.gophergraphics.com/forum/c...

            <description>GopherHaul 16 Lawn Care Entrepreneur Business Show

Hello everyone and welcome to Gopherhaul!
If you haven&apos;t started your business yet, what are you waiting for. If you don&apos;t start your business this year, you&apos;ll be at least 1 year older when you do so get started today!

GopherHaul is a show for entrepreneurs and new business owners. In it we discuss business tips and tricks we have learned over the years and share with you some real world experiences on how to help your lawn care business or any other business grow.

In this episode we will be talking about some new free downloads we have added to our lawn care business forum.
One is a flyer and the other is a lawn care business bid proposal template.
Next we will be talking about a new section we have added to the lawn care business forum called &quot;Help me bid it.&quot; This is going to allow you to post specifics of a lawn care job you want to bid on and get feedback from other lawn care business owners as to what you should charge.
Then we talk about the concept of can you bid for too big of a job. Can such a job actually do more harm than good? Find out by watching the video.
Next we talk about how you can use a down turn in the real estate market to actually gain new customers. We added a new flyer on this marketing concept as well and you are welcome to download it from our lawn care business forum.
Lastly we discuss search engine optimization tips that will help you rank higher in searches. Why should you pay for internet advertising when we can tell you how to get in the top results of searches for lawn care businesses in your area!

In this episode we will be talking about some new free downloads we have added to our lawn care business forum.
One is a flyer and the other is a lawn care business bid proposal template.
Next we will be talking about a new section we have added to the lawn care business forum called &quot;Help me bid it.&quot; This is going to allow you to post specifics of a lawn care job you want to bid on and get feedback from other lawn care business owners as to what you should charge.
Then we talk about the concept of can you bid for too big of a job. Can such a job actually do more harm than good? Find out by watching the video.
Next we talk about how you can use a down turn in the real estate market to actually gain new customers. We added a new flyer on this marketing concept as well and you are welcome to download it from our lawn care business forum.
Lastly we discuss search engine optimization tips that will help you rank higher in searches. Why should you pay for internet advertising when we can tell you how to get in the top results of searches for lawn care businesses in your area!

            <description>Hello everyone and welcome to Gopherhaul!
If you haven&apos;t started your business yet, what are you waiting for. If you don&apos;t start your business this year, you&apos;ll be at least 1 year older when you do so get started today!

GopherHaul is a show for entrepreneurs and new business owners. In it we discuss business tips and tricks we have learned over the years and share with you some real world experiences on how to help your lawn care business or any other business grow.

Thanks for watching.
Our lawn care entrepreneur business forum has just been jam packed with amazing business and marketing ideas since our last show and I am in no way going to be able to cover it all now but I do hope to cover a bunch of it. If you want to read more get on the forum at www.getgopher.com

In this episode we will be talking about: * Our friend Teresa. She is the owner and operator of a lawn care business, a single mom and is going through a divorce. We get a chance to talk with her and come up with unique marketing ideas to help her push her business forwards and help her find continued success. * We talk about some more marketing techniques for Halloween. One idea includes setting up a Halloween scene in your front yard involving a mower and using it as an example to talk about mower safety. We also see how you can get custom printed m&amp;m&apos;s to promote your lawn care business. * I put up a couple new free lawn care flyer templates you can download and edit to fit your needs. This one is designed for you to use in the fall when business is slow and you want to offer mower winterization services. * We also announce the winners of our free lawn care business sign giveaway compliments of Tony from amw-graphics.com

            <description>Hello everyone and welcome to GopherHaul. GopherHaul is a show for entrepreneurs and new business owners. In it we discuss business tips and tricks we have learned over the years and share with you some real world experiences on how to help your lawn care business or any other business grow.


What&apos;s the big story of the month?
Our friend Lee Cathey of Tiger Time Lawn Care has really done it.
He has managed to attract international media coverage for his lawn care business.
I can&apos;t ever remember any lawn care business being able to get so much advertising for free.
How did he do it?
Bikinis.
He was mentioned in China, India, Australia.
On the front page of CNN&apos;s site, on Fox &amp; Friends, The New York Times and even in the monologue of the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
If you have been active in our business forum, you probably already know how just 3 months ago, Lee left his job and decided to start a lawn care business.
He posted on the Gopher lawn care business forum that he was looking for ways to attract customers.
After going through a few ideas, he decided to go with the bikini lawn care service.
Here is Lee giving a plug to us on Fox &amp; Friends

Lee is now franchising his Tiger Time Lawn Care business. 

What can we learn from the experience of GopherHauling Lee&apos;s lawn care business? If you are going to go into business, you need to stand out. Ask yourself, how do you differ from your competitors? What makes your business unique? What unique services can you offer that will generate media buzz about your company?

If your business could use a GopherHaul and you need new ideas how to make your business grow send us an email at support@gophersoftware.com

Who knows maybe some of the ideas will help your business grow as much if not more than the international media attention Tiger Time Lawn Care was able to achieve from the brain storming that went on for his GopherHaul.


We have a new sponsor for our lawn care business forum and GopherHaul show. It&apos;s Fluid Film.

We have 50 free samples of fluid film to send out. All you need to do to get your free sample is to visit our forum and click on the fluid film link. This is an amazing product. It keeps your green industry equipment lubricated and rust free. If you&apos;d like a free sample of this product while supplies last, send an email to Dan Williams at dwilliams@eurekafluidfilm.com and tell him you saw Fluid Film on the GopherHaul show and you would like a free sample sent to you.

Another neat thing we have recently added to our site was new bumper stickers and t-shirts. Visit our lawn care business forum where you can see the latest &quot;Honk if you watch GopherHaul.&quot; If you purchase a bumper sticker, please send us a photo of where you put it.

The GopherHaul business book of the month is L.L. Bean: The Making of an American Icon. In this book we see how L.L.&apos;s first attempt at getting into business was when he created a new hunting boot. He borrowed money from his family to send out ads to residents with hunting and fishing licenses. He was amazed to find that he sold 100 pairs of boots! Within a short period of time 90 boots were sent back because they were defective. This could have sunk his business and he might have never tried another business again. What did he do? He refunded those 90 sales and reengineered his boot and tried again.

What&apos;s the business lesson we can learn from LL Bean? NEVER GIVE UP! If you fail at one attempt, review what happened and learn from your mistakes. Then give it another go and try to make it better the second time and the third time and the forth! Everyone makes mistakes but not everyone learns from their mistakes and tries again.

If you are going to be in business, don&apos;t ever give up.

He borrowed money from his family to send out ads to residents with hunting and fishing licenses. He was amazed to find that he sold 100 pairs of boots! Within a short period of time 90 boots were sent back because they were defective. This could have sunk his business and he might have never tried another business again. What did he do? He refunded those 90 sales and reengineered his boot and tried again.

What&apos;s the business lesson we can learn from LL Bean? NEVER GIVE UP! If you fail at one attempt, review what happened and learn from your mistakes. Then give it another go and try to make it better the second time and the third time and the forth! Everyone makes mistakes but not everyone learns from their mistakes and tries again.

If you are going to be in business, don&apos;t ever give up.

            <description>Here is a great interview with Anthony of UnitedEnvironment.com. Anthony got his start in his father&apos;s business at the age of 6. As he grew into an adult, conflict arose between him and his father and he spun off his own landscape design and maintenance company. Nothing has been easy for him. He has run into many problems. Underbidding jobs, broken down snow plows, going into debt. But he has pulled it through and kept moving forwards. He also turns some of his landscape projects into a video show called The Landscaper which has been much talked about lately. I hope Anthony&apos;s story inspires you.

            <description>Here is a great interview with Troy Tiedeman of Tiedeman Lawn &amp; Landscaping. Troy has been through a lot in this business. Starting when he was a teen he built his business to a point where he had multiple employees. But then found he couldn&apos;t say no and bought too much equipment. He took on too many bad jobs. He then had to sell off most of it and get rid of his employees.
This year he is rebuilding and reshaping his business.
I learned a lot from Troy and I hope you can learn from him too.
