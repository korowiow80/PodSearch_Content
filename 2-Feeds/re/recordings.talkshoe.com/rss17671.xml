The million dollar question: Will you go to Heaven? Here&apos;s a quick test. Have you ever told a lie, stolen anything, or used God&apos;s name in vain? Jesus said, &quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery already with her in his heart.&quot; Have you looked with lust? Will you be guilty on Judgment Day? If you have done those things God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart. The Bible warns that if you are guilty you will end up in Hell. That&apos;s not God&apos;s will. He sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross for you. Jesus took your punishment upon Himself -&quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.&quot; Then He rose from the dead and defeated death. Please, repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus, and God will grant you everlasting life. Then read your Bible daily and obey it.
