        <description>Rebecca Withey (CMT) speaks with others on life: mind - body - spirit. Focusing on people&apos;s lives surrounding various subjects as food/nutrition, exercise, self maintenance, artistic expression, sleep, dreams, prayer/meditation, spirituality and relationships. 

Previous Episodes include a podcast created in 2006 called Sunday Morning Meditations (under her radio name of Rebecca Daye). 

Though Rebecca has much experience through her journey to loosing 125lbs and getting into the healing arts through massage therapy, the difference about this show is that the host wants to learn from the various speakers and the listeners. So stop by and share what you&apos;ve learned through life. Share your own Genesis Journey .
