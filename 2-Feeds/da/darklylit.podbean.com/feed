			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good evening everybody, and welcome to the Darkly Lit Podcast.  This evening, we&#8217;ll be reading Joseph: A Story, by Katherine Rickford.  Rickford appears to be a fairly obscure author, to the point where I can&#8217;t find any biographical information about her, but Joseph was first published back in 1920.  I picked this story for tonight not only because of its obvious ties to the Christmas ghost story tradition, but also in honor of the Walsh family, who have finally found out for certain that Otis Toole, who had previously recanted his confession to Adam Walsh&#8217;s murder, was indeed the man responsible, a fact supported by physical evidence as well as Toole&#8217;s confession.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have too much else to say tonight, except happy holidays, and keep your loved ones close to your heart in this season, whoever they may be.  Our music tonight is provided by Nox Arcana, at www.noxarcana.com, and the HPLHS, at www.cthulhu-lives.org.  Please visit the website at darklylit.wordpress.com, or send comments on the show to lit.darkly@yahoo.com, or our voicemail at 920-341-3065.  Until next time, when we celebrate the birthdays of both Edgar Allan Poe and Vincent Price, I wish you pleasant dreams.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good evening everybody, and welcome to Episode 52 of the Darkly Lit Podcast!  I know we&#8217;re running a little bit late this week, but that&#8217;s all the more reason to get down to business, <em>n&#8217;est-ce pas</em>?  Tonight&#8217;s story is M.R. James&#8217; &#8220;Two Doctors,&#8221; a story of queer revenge.  Tonight&#8217;s music is provided by Nox Arcana, at <a href="www.noxarcana.com">www.noxarcana.com</a>, and the HPLHS, at <a href="www.cthulhu-lives.org">www.cthulhu-lives.org</a>!</p>
<p>Special congratulations go out to Joe Hallett, whose story &#8220;Alone&#8221; took home our grand prize package for the Darkly Lit Story contest!  Your package should be arriving within the next week or two, depending on the vaguaries of the US Postal Service.  Our next show will be coming out on December 23rd, and feature a Christmas ghost story by somebody other than M.R. James!  After all, if I&#8217;m going to prove that this was a widespread tradition, there has to be more than one author out there who did it, right?</p>
<p>But, if you can&#8217;t wait that long, there&#8217;s one other place where you can hear your friendly neighborhood Wolfemann this month.  I co-hosted <a href="http://www.creepykitch.cadaverlab.com/CKFinished19.mp3">Episode 19 of Creepy Kitch</a> with Stacy and Cins, discussing the first two Paranormal Activity films with them.  You can find their show on iTunes, or at their blog, by searching for Creepy Kitch - and that&#8217;s K-I-T-C-H, as in witch.  Their show is a *smidge* more uncouth than this one, so be prepared for some instances of adult language and such if you do go over to listen.</p>
<p>If anybody would like to write in with their Christmas wishes, or feedback for the show, please contact us at <a href="http://darklylit.wordpress.com">darklylit.wordpress.com</a>, <a href="mailto:lit.darkly@yahoo.com">lit.darkly@yahoo.com</a>, or through our voicemail at 920-341-3065.  Until next time, I bring you M.R. James&#8217; &#8220;Two Doctors,&#8221; and wish you&#8230; pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I hope you&#8217;ll all enjoy a little early Christmas present.  This is the audio from my Ripperology 101 panel, held at Teslacon the evening of Saturday, November 19th.  Some interesting theories come up, as well as references to classic authors Lewis Carroll and Oscar Wilde!  What do they have to do with the Ripper?  You&#8217;ll have to listen to find out, won&#8217;t you?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there everybody!  Back from Teslacon, and I enjoyed myself greatly.  I held two panels this year, rather than just one!  First, I recorded today&#8217;s show, reading Casonetto&#8217;s Last Song and The Thing Invisible.  Then, the next day, I held Ripperology 101, and had myself a full house for the discussion!</p>
<p>Sadly, we didn&#8217;t have time to get into discussing Carnacki the Ghost Finder very much; the next panel needed to get going, so I had to be almost as abrupt as the good paranormal investigator himself at getting the house cleared out!  But there is some interesting discussion of Robert E. Howard and Casonetto&#8217;s Last Song in there, as well as the stories themselves.  And, as always when I do a live show, I give you the full experience by not editing a danged thing.  And I was using a brand new recorder too.  May the Lord God have mercy on your souls.</p>
<p>As always, please give us a call at the new voicemail line, at 920-341-3065.  Also, please check out the voting at <a href="http://darklylit.wordpress.com">darklylit.wordpress.com</a> to choose your favorite story from last time to win our fabulous prize package!  There&#8217;s only one more week to vote, folks, and things are LITERALLY neck and neck between <em>Alone</em> and <em>Stay in the Basement</em> at the time of this broadcast!  A 50/50 split!  So if you want to be sure your favorite wins, get in there and vote!  Because as always, if you don&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t have the right to complain about the results.</p>
<p>So, enjoy the show, and keep an eye out for a bonus Ripperology episode coming up soon!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good evening, and welcome to the Darkly Lit Podcast, September edition.  I&#8217;m sorry we&#8217;re a little late, but to be honest I just couldn&#8217;t think of a good theme until the last minute, and by then it was a little too late to record the show.  Tonight, we tell a tale of loss, love - and obsession.  Three of them, actually.  First, I&#8217;ll read Edgar Allan Poe&#8217;s Berenice, where a lady&#8217;s smile is perhaps the most delightful thing a man can imagine.  Then, we&#8217;ll be speaking briefly about another tale of unhealthy obsession and romantic dread - Twilight.  I&#8217;ve heard some people complain about the knee-jerk reaction to hating on the series, and I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;ve done it myself in the past.  But tonight, I&#8217;d like to explain my real concerns with the series - and, in the process, maybe cast a little light on the mythology of vampires, and the increasingly creepy way that love and romance is viewed these days.</p>
<p>We also have musical offerings from both Nox Arcana and a new artist, Tarby!  Tarby&#8217;s works can be found on SoundCloud, through the following links.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good evening, and welcome to Episode 44 of the Darkly Lit podcast!  We’ve finally made it to the end of The Island of Doctor Moreau, and that means it’s time to talk a bit about the book.</p>
<p>Island has long been one of my favorite novels of the era; partly because of the subject matter, and partly because of the complexity of what Wells was advancing in the story.  The first reading of The Island of Doctor Moreau typically focuses on Well’s views towards science, but it’s really a much more complex story than that.  Religion, its role in society, mankind’s status as the civilized creature – all of these are elements of the story that often get short shrift.  Equally important is the role of the novel in light of what had been happening in the era it was written; the ethical debates raging around the use of vivisection in medical research, the rapid rate of social change, and the increasing incidences of a terrifying new kind of crime.  We’ll be looking at all of these issues tonight, and more, after a few words from our sponsors.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Well everybody, aside from an ill-considered April Fool&#8217;s Day joke at the beginning, tonight&#8217;s show focuses mostly on Moreau explaining what&#8217;s up - and on Prendick becoming familiar with the Beast Men.  Things might be a little slow tonight, but come back next week for when things *really* start to heat up!

Wait, wait, don&#8217;t run away!  It&#8217;s not Stallone night!  It&#8217;s just&#8230; well, let&#8217;s face it, he *would* make a pretty decent Speaker of the Law.  Or, at least, voice actor for him.
Anywho, give the show a listen, and come back next time for the explanation of all this noise!
