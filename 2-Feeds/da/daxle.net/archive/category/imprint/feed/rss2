<p>When we think about our customers being always-connected, it means much more than just how the customer service department is organized. This book looks at how the product offerings take into account how we live today. How does your brand interact with that? Are you in their face or a silent partner? Customers consider not just the cost, but the time it will take to switch or sign up. Incorporate the customer&#8217;s time into your mix, and see what kind of home run you can create.</p>
<p>I talk to Adrian about how time affects how we do business, the difficulty of being a silent partner, the scoop on bundling, and more.</p>

<p>Getting a referral is one big huge complement for your business and we want them. Although rather than just wanting it, we have to go after it by making the business <em>referable</em>. A rote transaction, while better than a nightmare, won&#8217;t go far in having others talk about and recommend you to others. You&#8217;ve got to give them something to talk about.

I talk with Michael about the deterioration of trust, an example of how this works, his take on what JetBlue did in the midst of crisis, and more.

We spend a lot of money marketing to new customers. Wouldn&#8217;t it be wiser to focus on your existing base, and find ways to energize them?

<img title="The 1% Windfall" src="http://www.daxle.net/imprint/cover/072.jpg" alt="The 1% Windfall" hspace="2" width="119" height="181" /></p>
<p>If we aren&#8217;t careful, pricing can be like a pendulum with large across-the-board increases or discounts. There&#8217;s a line for every customer, and getting the right amount of profit for each is the thesis of this book. The beauty of this is, increased profits for your company may not be from the endless pursuit to cut costs or restructuring. Rafi lays out 50 different ways you can increase your profits a little at a time. Now 1% may not sound intriguing, but consider this: if Wal-mart increased it&#8217;s profit by 1%, it would mean billions more in profit.</p>
<p>I talk with Rafi about how this works, bringing dormant customers back into the fold, and how to compensate salespeople.</p>

<p>Stress attacks every aspect of our well-being. Gallwey explains how negative self-talk undermines us, making us believe that pressure is inevitable and that other people’s expectations are paramount–which leaves us feeling helpless and unhappy. But as Gallwey shows, we have the means to build a shield against stress with our abilities to take childlike pleasure in learning new skills, to properly and healthily rest and relax, and to trust in our own good judgment. With his trademark mix of case histories and interactive worksheets, Gallwey helps us to tap into these inner strengths, giving us invaluable tools.</p>

<img title="Getting to Plan B" src="http://www.daxle.net/imprint/cover/064.jpg" alt="Getting to Plan B" hspace="2" width="119" height="181" /></p>
<p>Behold the 5-year business plan worked through by sweat and toil. The entrepreneur begins the journey to see this vision become reality. Instead of marching through fire and ice to see it come true, realize that Plan A can&#8217;t be right, and that another plan will emerge. And another and another and another, until the vision becomes reality. The authors look at how to reduce your risk by gathering data on that &#8220;leap of faith&#8221; that your business model has.</p>
<p>I talk with Randy about reducing the risk, how Amazon did it, and how to keep cash king.</p>

He coached hundreds of leaders at every level and helped the company grow into a world-renowned brand. Now he reveals the ten principles that guided his leadership—and not one of them is about coffee.</p>

And in Greg&#8217;s case, he found he had to make a choice. He couldn&#8217;t do it all, and to do the things that really matter to him, he&#8217;d have to say &#8220;No&#8221; to other things. While this applies to business, it will obviously apply to the other parts of life, too.</p>
<p>I talk with <a href="http://gregcootsona.com">Greg</a> about what caused him to change, how to say no and not be negative, and the changes he&#8217;s made to be more effective.</p>

<p>For some, it seems out of place to think that a company is out to make a <em>difference</em> in the world. Rather it is looked on as a way to make and keep a customer and produce a profit at the end of the day. That perspective, however, looses the power that highly-valued brands have. Done correctly, a purpose rallies the employee, solidifies the brand, and makes customer crazy about you.</p>
<p>I talk with Haley about the fear that what you love to do won&#8217;t be sustained by the marketplace, the question of shouldn&#8217;t business be concerned first with profit, and some ideas on how to find your purpose. More on the book <a title="book website" href="http://itsnotwhatyousell.com/">here.</a>.

I talk with Haley about the fear that what you love to do won&#8217;t be sustained by the marketplace, the question of shouldn&#8217;t business be concerned first with profit, and some ideas on how to find your purpose. More on the book here.. Buy it at Amazon.com</itunes:summary>

<p>Playing to your strengths has many advantages, with the first in my mind being it definitely more fun! And in fact, trying to be good at everything makes you least effective. Continuing in the footsteps of <em>Now, Discover Your Strengths</em> and <em>StrengthsFinder 2.0</em>, this book looks at Leaders, Teams and Followers. All leaders have strengths, but not all the same strength.  What they are good at is assembling a team that have all the necessary strengths covered. With the book comes a code for an <a title="strengths assessment at gallup" href="http://strengths.gallup.com">assessment</a> to discover your strengths. After you take the assessment, if you&#8217;d send me an email with some of your strengths, I&#8217;d be curious to know what my audience is strong at.</p>
<p>I talk with Barry about the foundation laid in the previous books, how leaders are not exceptional at everything, what a team needs to be good at and more. More on the book at <a title="book website" href="http://strengths.gallup.com/110440/About-StrengthsFinder-2.aspx">Gallup.com</a>.

<img title="The Power of Who" src="http://www.daxle.net/imprint/cover/047.jpg" alt="The Power of Who" hspace="2" width="119" height="181" /></p>
<p>As an executive recruiter, Bob wants you to know that traditional networking is not the answer. Instead of going outside to connect, he wants you to look at who you already know. Instead of starting cold, start warm, where there are people who already know you and care about you. Unemployment is at a 16 year high in the U.S., and the release of this book couldn&#8217;t be more timely. If you fill your days sending resumes to &#8220;Dear Hiring Manager&#8221;, this book will give you a different approach designed to find the work you truly want to do.</p>
<p>I talk with <a href="http://thepowerofwho.com">Bob</a> about looking inward, what social networks are good for, and Bob explains what a recruiter is thinking when they talk to a candidate (as he puts it, it&#8217;s like knowing the questions on the test before the test).</p>

Being different or thinking different is a common theme in business growth and innovation. The approach in other books is looking at ways to be creative and generate new ideas. Greg&#8217;s approach is from science; he&#8217;s looking at what&#8217;s going on in the brain while all of this is going on. Come to find out, the brain wants to be efficient, so it takes shortcuts all the time. If you want innovation, you&#8217;ll have to take a different approach if you want to see things differently.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Iconoclast by Gregory Berns.

Being different or thinking different is a common theme in business growth and innovation. The approach in other books is looking at ways to be creative and generate new ideas. Greg&#8217;s approach is from science; he&#8217;s looking at what&#8217;s going on in the brain while all of this is going on. Come to find out, the brain wants to be efficient, so it takes shortcuts all the time. If you want innovation, you&#8217;ll have to take a different approach if you want to see things differently.
Greg discusses the characteristics of an iconoclast, what might help in uncovering a new idea, and advice for teams.</itunes:summary>

The more we build a personal brand and gain popularity within our respective areas of interest the better off we are, and the company we work for. When marketing yourself there are many avenues to use, and many tips to make it worthwhile.

From public speaking, and writing to better networking, Jeff details the things you can do to advance your name.</p>

<p>The people that rise through the ranks to the corner office come from all walks of life.

Being able to &#8216;woo&#8217; (win others over) is dissected between the covers of this book. Everything from assessing your style of communication to packaging your idea in the most effective way to removing the barriers that prevent you from getting your message across.

<p>I talk with Mario about how Woo-ing is different from selling a product or service, signs to know your idea is ready to go and how to prevent that awkward feeling that you&#8217;re not getting your message across to the person you&#8217;re talking to.</p>

<p>The qualities of a leader have changed along with everything else over the past 30 years. Integrity and trust are still essential, but not enough for leaders today. Investigating the psychology behind why people follow will allow you to be the right kind of leader because you must lead from not only your head but also your heart. The book looks at the leaders we need for knowledge work, health care, education and government. It considers the relationship between the leader and follower and how to understand the people you work with.</p>
<p>I talk with Michael about what followers look for in a leader, what a knowledge worker needs to know, and what leaders should be doing to improve themselves.</p>

<p>Are customers the center of your world? Of course we say they are, but are they treated that way? Jack wants you to treat them like kings and queens. Impress them by remembering their nicknames, favorite sports team and anniversary. Have their favorite beverage on hand when they stop by. Create a culture that appreciates and personally interacts with your customers. It not only creates a place that&#8217;s fun to work, but it creates loyal customers that come back time and again.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know a business owner who wouldn&#8217;t say the customer is the most important part of their business, so I asked Jack how he would know if an owner or CEO really believes that or is just kidding themselves. See if you pass the test.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you like to have every customer be your best customer? Isn&#8217;t it reassuring when you know they won&#8217;t flock to a competitor if it moves in next door. They won&#8217;t leave because there is more than just the exchange of products and services &#8211; there is a relationship involved. I know you&#8217;d like to think there is no business like yours but the reality is (with rare exception) the average consumer doesn&#8217;t see it that way &#8211; what you offer is duplicated by others in the marketplace. What isn&#8217;t duplicated is the relationships that you have with your customers. Strong customer relationships are the best marketing tool you have.</p>

<p>A company who has employees who show up and do their job and go home is no where near as effective as a company whose employees are connected to each other. From your perspective you may see that gap but you might not know <em>how</em> to change the culture to get your team fired up. This book isn&#8217;t about getting people hyped-up or about turning everyone into a lemming. It is about the nuts and bolts of having people work together and be engaged. And the stories about real-life leaders at the end of the book are fantastic.</p>
