Today we are showcasing a few tracks from my ”Experiments in sound” series... 
This is Volume 2 of a 4 part series and today’s featured tracks are 3rd Heaven and ElectroReel.
In the name of experimentation, I put my pro tools Digi002 to the test as well as incorporating a few new software plugins including “BFD drums” by fxpansion which is really a lot of fun to use.
I used many different electric and acoustic guitars during these sessions and had recorded direct using a BBE DI-100x Dirct Box w/the Sonic Maximizer and the many wonderful tones of the Line6 Flextone3 amp.

<description>Dan Sindel "Symphonic Guitars" Podcast #7 - Experiments In Sound Vol.4
Today we are finishing up the “Experiments In Sound” series. 
This is Volume 4 of a 4 part series and today’s featured tracks are “Miracle Mile” and “Into The Ether”
“Miracle Mile” started out as a conceptual idea of life in the roaring 20’s and how a certain portion of Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles came to be the epicenter of progress during the great depression. This track features my 68’ Gibson SG and the Line6 Flextone3 amp.
“Into The Ether” takes us into the stratosphere and was inspired by the amazing accomplishments by the good folks at NASA. This song features my custom ¾ scale size Fender Duosonic and all electric guitar tracks were recorded direct using the Line6 DM4 Distortion Modeler.
Both tracks make use of “BFD drums” by fxpansion and everything was recorded on a pro tools LE system!

<description>This episode features Pachelbel’s most famous “Canon in D Major” and the beloved traditional Irish Melody “Danny Boy.” 
For those of you not familiar with my “Symphonic Guitars” concept, what I like to do is transpose and transcribe Orchestral Scores to fit the guitars tonal range, layering guitar tracks creating a massive electric guitar "Wall of Sound". It’s a lot of work but a lot of fun..!
First up is Johann Pachelbel’s “Canon in D Major”!  
Pachelbel was a German Baroque composer and I have interpreted the string quartet instrumentation with more than 50 multi-track overdubs utilizing Acoustic and electric guitars... 
Closing today’s show is the traditional Irish Melody “Danny Boy”!  AKA Londonderry Air. 
In the second and third sections you will be hearing a culmination of at least 90 tracks of guitar..!
It has been a very busy past few months and I would like to persoanlly Thank GHS/Rocktron, Peterson Tuners, Visual Sound and Godin Guitars for all their wonderful product endorsements and for believing in me as an artist!"

<description>Welcome to “Symphonic Guitars” podcast#9 – The “Marching In” Sneak Preview Edition!
Today’s featured tracks are a brief introduction to my upcoming Independent CD release “Marching In - A tribute to the March King” John Philip Sousa.
In keeping with the spirit of the 4th of July, I thought it would be fun to share these tracks with you while they are still in their ‘rough mix’ status and give you a quick glimpse into my recording project which has a scheduled release date of Dec 07’!
For those of you not familiar with my “Symphonic Guitars” concept, what I like to do is transpose and transcribe Orchestral Scores to fit the guitars tonal range, layering guitar tracks creating a massive electric guitar "Wall of Sound".
First up is “The Stars and Stripes Forever”
This most famous march was composed by John Philip Sousa on Christmas Day, 1896. 
This was a grand undertaking in my development while learning about home recording. 4 weeks later and nearly 370 multi-track overdubs... I can proudly say "have a listen"!
Then after that is the John Philip Sousa arrangement of "The Star Spangled Banner" circa 1892 which was written and performed at the Chicago Worlds Fair....
At any given point in the song you will be hearing a culmination of at least 70 tracks of guitar..!
Both tracks feature Professional drummer extraordinaire "Rick Shlosser" who helped me along in the studio!
I am also proud to give a VERY SPECIAL Thank You to Visual Sound, GHS/Rocktron, Peterson Tuners and Godin Guitars for believing in me as an artist!! 
You can read more about this in detail at my Wordpress blog http://dansindel.wordpress.com. 
As always, Thank you for listening and be sure to visit www.dansindel.us for Symphonic Guitar Driven Classics - Mp3's, Videos and More…
