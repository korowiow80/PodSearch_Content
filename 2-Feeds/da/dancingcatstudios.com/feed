	<itunes:subtitle>Serve It Cold: A Jonny C Mystery. </itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Private Detective Jonny C. Speed`s life can`t get much better. He`s booked into the French Quarter`s most luxurious guesthouse, and his day job as convenience store manager is 104 miles behind him in Catherine, Mississippi. He has  taken care of his pro-bono missing persons case already, and his paying client`s cheating wife is a beautiful and very accommodating exhibitionist. Are things too good to be true? Of course they are. Jonny and his crack team of beauty queens, recovering addicts, professional athletes, computer hackers, and pampered dogs soon find themselves caught in a twisted scheme of revenge that threatens to turn the town of Catherine inside out. 
Serve It Cold--a story of sex, drugs and the cradle of Rock &#38; Roll.</itunes:summary>

<p>Yes, Serve it Cold, excellent work. If any one wants an example of a <a href="http://www.podiobooks.com">PodioBook</a> done right they should listen to it. Now I know the reason why Tee Morris is doing <a href="http://www.teemorris.com/morevipodcast/">Morevi Remastered</a>. You guys didn&#8217;t raise the bar you changed the game. Loved the use of small town gosip to give us a story so far. <a href="http://www.ronnieblackwell.com">Ronnie&#8217;s</a> discriptions took me there I could smell, coffee, spice and the river.</p>

Kimberly Steel&#8217;s awesome teen vampire novel, Forever Fifteen, came in at number 8. Way back in the dawn of Podcasting, in March 2005, we offered to help Kim get her audio cleaned up and on Podiobooks.com. It is gratifying to us that we have helped her make her mark on this new and exciting community.</p>
<p>We send out most sincere congratulations to all the PB authors and their teams in the top slots and we wish them the best for 2008.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">In addition to offering its listeners their regular story for the month of December,<br />
<a href="http://www.variantfrequencies.com">Variant Frequencies</a> has prepared a special holiday surprise for fans of the two-time Parsec-nominated <a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/the-failed-cities-monologues">FAILED CITIES MONOLOGUES</a>, as well as all those who&#8217;ve supported the podcast in the past year. We are proud to present THE FAILED CITIES: HATH A DARKNESS, an exclusive 10,000-word eChapbook written by Matt Wallace and produced by Variant Frequencies.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.variantfrequencies.com"><img src="http://www.variantfrequencies.com/images/art/FailedCities-cover-300x388.jpg" alt="Failed Cities Book Cover" align="middle" height="388" width="300" /></a></center><br />
<span id="more-55"></span><br />
For the first time since concluding his groundbreaking podcast fiction saga, Matt Wallace returns to the warped twin worlds he created with an all-new Failed Cities story. Featuring the characters that drove the original audio epic, and told, as always, in their own voices, THE FAILED CITIES: HATH A DARKNESS brings this unique storytelling style to the page for the first time, enhanced with original illustrations by Rick Stringer.About THE FAILED CITIES: HATH A DARKNESS . . .To some the number 99 represents the many names of God. But as a black snowfall blankets the Failed Cities on Christmas Eve, the arrival of 99 mysterious steel chambers is the catalyst that sets a series of far from blessed events in motion. From bullets and bata sticks to a life-and-death hostage situation to high-speed battles up switchback mountain roads, eight people become links in a deadly chain that will either tether innocent lives to safety or strangle any hope for their future. And as each part of the story unfolds, we learn that above all things, Christmas in the Failed Cities is a feverishly struck balance between the constant threat ofviolence and the briefest, most bittersweet moments of joy.THE FAILED CITIES: HATH A DARKNESS by Matt Wallace is a freely distributed .PDF produced and illustrated by Rick Stringer, and available exclusively from Variant Frequencies. We&#8217;d like to encourage all our listeners to download, print, enjoy, and pass along this unique piece of the Failed Cities universe as a thank you for your continued support and enthusiastic participation in our podcast. And don&#8217;t forget to revisit <a href="http://podiobooks.com/title/the-failed-cities-monologues">THE FAILED CITIES MONOLOGUES</a>, collected in its entirety on <a href="http://podiobooks.com/" target="_blank">Podiobooks.com</a></p>
<p>Happy Holidays from the entire crew of Variant Frequencies!</p>

So, we are taking a little extra time to do just that. We expect to publish on Sunday, December 9th. We hope you will think this episode is worth the wait.</p>
<p>Thank you for staying subscribed!</p>
<p>UPDATE: I guess I spoke too soon! My system has gone back to its old, random-shutdown ways. &lt;sigh&gt; We&#8217;re working with the slower, backup system but we are still doing our best to meet today&#8217;s publication schedule. Wish us luck!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Jonny and Narlene return to Catherine. Jonny calls everyone together to brainstorm what their next move should be.

Starring Eric Rowe and Beth Wojiski
Eric gives us a command performance as Jonny C, Go Joe Jackson, GG Castor, and Butch Ellis. Beth speaks up for Narlene Moore and Vera Hill.
With Rodger Johnson as Goat Johnson, Julia Holloway as Sister Cielee, and Paul Fischer as Sonny Richard and George.
 The Command Line delivers an informal review of the events of the so-called &#8220;Battle of Lake Catherine&#8221; for some unknown bureaucrat.
Theme song: “Where is the Love?” by Michelle Malone
And tendered as a kind of apology for our rough publication schedule last month, we include “Winter Muscadine&#8221; by Michelle Malone from the Sugarfoot album.

<p>It was warm weather indoors at <a href="http://jamminjava.com">Jammin&#8217; Java</a> this past Wednesday night and the new stage made the venue seem a little more formal than in the past but neither slowed down the rockin&#8217; <a href="http://www.michellemalone.com/">Michelle Malone</a>. The Michelle Malone Band pulled out all the stops to put on a smoking hot show.</p>
<p>And Paul and I had the very great pleasure of witnessing it all first hand.</p>
<p>Michelle&#8217;s music has been submitted this year for 2 Grammys: Best Contemporary Blues Album and Best Americana Album and it&#8217;s easy to see why. All you have to do is listen. My word, that woman can sing!  We were treated to some new old-fashioned blues rock songs that shook the paint off the walls, but, when the dust started coming off the rafters, Michelle scaled it back with an acoustic set that was just stunning.</p>
<p><img src="http://dancingcatstudios.com/images/MichelleMalone(02)20070711.JPG" title="Michelle Malone at Jammin' Java, 11 July 07" alt="Michelle Malone at Jammin' Java, 11 July 07" align="left" height="333" width="250" />But I shouldn&#8217;t slight her guitar work which was as much a pleasure to watch as to hear.  Words fail me, folks.</p>
<p>If you ever have the chance to hear Michelle Malone live, do not let that chance slide by you. Reach out and grab it with both hands and hold on for the ride. It&#8217;s worth waiting for! But while you&#8217;re waiting you might as well be listening to some really good music. So, show Michelle some love. Jump over to her site and pick up her latest album, <a href="http://michellemalone.com/newsite2/shop/">Sugarfoot</a>, and maybe a few of her earlier ones too. You&#8217;ll be glad you did.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The original cover for the book was taken from one of Ronnie&#8217;s photos. But we had the great good fortune to have two other beautiful pieces of art contributed by Georgia Godwin and Laura Mann. Georgia Godwin&#8217;s cover plays with the image of the Altoids box that features in the novel and Laura Mann&#8217;s cover really sets the mood for a murder mystery in small town Mississippi.</p>
<p>To honor Georgia and Laura&#8217;s work, we asked Ronnie if he would create special editions of Serve It Cold to showcase their art, and he went us, not one, but two better. Available now from Lulu are two collector&#8217;s editions of the novel. Each with a little something extra to make it even sweeter. Choose your favorite or get them both!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/924291">Serve It Cold (Georgia Godwin cover art)</a> includes the Jonny C short story,  Crossing. $12.95</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/941809">Serve It Cold (Laura Mann cover art)</a> includes the Jonny C short story,  Silver Hull. $12.95</p>
