			<itunes:author>Darin Epsilon</itunes:author>

			<description><![CDATA[Spring is in the air and you know what that means. Thousands upon thousands of party-goers from all over the world descend upon Miami for one week of networking and hedonistic partying. This is one of the most important times of year for the dance music industry, so naturally it feels appropriate to dedicate this month's program to Miami Music Week.  Our featured guest for the 50th episode of Perspectives is Kenneth Thomas, the official warmup DJ for many of Paul Oakenfold's world tours and artist on Perfecto, Armada, and Hope Recordings, among many others. In his own words, KT describes this mix as a slightly darker, moodier mix, exclusively made for Perspectives Episode 050.]]></description>

This dynamic combination has earned D:Fuse a slot in the top 35 DJs in America 3 years running (DJ Times Magazine).

Our guest this month, Chris Stock, comes from its largest city of Johannesburg. He is one of the most successful DJs in the area and considered a leader in the South African progressive and tech house scene.  Chris says his music cannot be described as one particular sound or direction and is not restricted to one genre; instead there are elements of many, drifting seamlessly in a contemporary cosmopolitan mashup of progressive house, blistering tech and minimal agendas.  In hour two, Darin Epsilon presents his opening set for Hernan Cattaneo at Avalon in Los Angeles.]]></description>
