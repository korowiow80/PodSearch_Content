<p>Friends,

<p>The time has come to tuck Dailysonic into bed. It has been fun. Actually... it has been amazing. A huge thanks goes out to our listeners for being more than just listeners. You asked us questions, told us stories, pushed us to do more, held our hands, and it's meant the world to us. So, goodnight... and don't be afraid to get down with the man breathing down your back.
