Keegan wants to know a few things.  First he wants to know how to tell the scamers from the legit marketers, Secondly, he wants to know how he can be sure that the systems I teach are not too hard for him to learn.   Honestly, the proof is in the pudding, and the best way he could learn is by implementing what I teach.  I could have told him that outright I suppose, but I was feeling the need to deliver a little Tough Love.
