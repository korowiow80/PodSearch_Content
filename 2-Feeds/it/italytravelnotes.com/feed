<p>Italys largest lake is Lake Garda and the most beautiful lake in all Europe. It stretches between the Alps and the Dolomites. The climate is warm in which lemon orchards and olive groves flourish.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.italytravelnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/Malcesine-allimbrunire-lago-di-Garda-Italy.jpg" alt="" title="Malcesine all&#039;imbrunire # lago di Garda Italy" width="450" height="307" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3111" /></p>
<p>Photograph by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/12708811@N07/">F. Mottironi</a></p>
<p>It was formed more than 10000 years ago. The lake lies between olive groves vineyards and high mountains. There are five islands on the lake Isola del Garda, Osola dei Conigli, Isola di Sogno, Isola di Trimelone and Isola dellOlivo.<br />
<span id="more-644"></span><br />
Lake Garda is easily reached whether you travel by train, plane or car. To travel around the lake the public bus covers the whole region. The motorway of northern Italy runs parallel to Lake Garda.</p>
<p>Gardaland is the biggest theme park, in Veneto Italy. The park opened in 1975 and is built on the eastern shore of Lake Garda at Castlenuovo del Garda.<br />
The Vittoriale Museum in the town of Maderno on the Gardone Riviera on the southern coast of Lake Garda was built by Italian nationalist Gabriele Annunzio, who lived from 1863 until 1938. A poet, novelist and librettist. During the war he fought as an infantry soldier, sailor and pilot. His career, which did include his role in the Fascist movement in Italy, is chronicled at the museum.</p>
<p>The towns of Punta San Vigilio and Torri are tourist centres and are medieval towns and therefore have villas, monasteries and castles.</p>
<p>Punta San Vigilio is the jewel in the crown of lake Garda, and is known as one of the most romantic places in the world. In fact, many illustrious visitors have stayed here over the years such as: Maria Luisa Napoleon&#8217;s wife, the Tsar Alexander, the King of Naples, Luigi Einaudi, Winston Churchill, Lawrence Olivier, Kin Juan Carlos and the English Royal family.</p>
<p>Like most of the towns around the lake Torri has a castle. Formerly the seat of government for Benaco. It is also used for civil functions. There are two churches in Torri de Benaco, which one can visit or attend services. They often host exhibitions and concerts free of charge.</p>
<p>The town of Garda is very picturesque and is a old town situated on the lake. There is a local bus which is free of charge and goes around the town every 30 minutes. Lots of restaurants which all sell pasta and ice cream. Windsurfing is hugely popular on the Lake and cover the whole lake at the Riva del Garda end.<br />

<p>The arrival of the New Year is a very good reason to sweep aside heartburns, toss out all regrets and make resolutions. Pretty much everyone sees the year that is about to start as full of new opportunities and hopes for the better. We are more determined to make our lives better, and improve the things or situations we havenÃ¢â¬â¢t been very pleased with up to that moment. But no matter what our state of mind regarding the year to come is, we all look forward to the celebration. The arrival of the New Year is not just a means for resolutions, hopes, and new ambitions; it is also an occasion for great celebration. This tradition of welcoming the New Year with a huge celebration has a long history. People have been doing it for many, many years now, and almost very year a new distinctive feature is being added to the way we celebrate the coming of the New Year.</p>
<p><img src='http://www.italytravelnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/119_1971_14.jpg' alt='119_1971_14.jpg' /></p>
<p>Since most other holidays are perfect occasions for getting together with your family, on New YearÃ¢â¬â¢s Eve people tend to look for less intimate ways of celebrating. The New YearÃ¢â¬â¢s Eve parties are therefore a little out of the ordinary. And if you are looking for something really special this year, try visiting Italy around New YearÃ¢â¬â¢s Eve, or Capodanno, as they call it.<br />
<span id="more-645"></span><br />
As you probably know, Italy is a famous tourist destination all year round. There are many reasons why people choose to visit or spend their holidays in Italy. The architecture, the popular cuisine, the amazing landscapes, the favourable climate, the water canals with gondolas, the emerging fashion trends, all these make Italy a unique destination. The way Italians celebrate the Capodanno is also spectacular, and some of the most grandiose celebrations will probably take part in the big Italian cities. Milan is a very good choice for the New YearÃ¢â¬â¢s Eve celebration. Capodanno Milano can be a truly unique experience.</p>
<p>Milan is Ã¢â¬Åfashion capital of the worldÃ¢â¬Â, and so you can imagine the glitz and glamour of this Italian city. In fact, Milan is one of the worldÃ¢â¬â¢s most stylish and elegant cities, and Capodanno Milano couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t be anything less. There will glamorous parties, dazzling firework displays, great music, great food, in other words, all the necessary ingredients for an unforgettable New YearÃ¢â¬â¢s Eve party, one that you should definitely not miss.</p>
<p>But Milan is a lot more than just the capital of fashion. The nightlife in Milan is also amazing. We are talking about hundreds of locali notturni, all part of a very wide night scene that undergoes continuous change. One thing is certain about the locali notturni in Milan, and in all Italy for that matter: there will always be something new and attractive to try if nightlife is your thing. Since Italians love variation, these locali notturni are so numerous and so diverse, that there will always be something for all tastes.</p>
<p>All in all, the nightlife in Italy, and especially in Milan is fabulous. And if youÃ¢â¬â¢re planning on going to Milan around the holidays, stick around for Capodanno Milano. You wonÃ¢â¬â¢t be sorry!<br />

<p>Among academies, libraries and museums, religious monuments, churches, civil architecture and buildings you will experience you really are in a treasure hunting. For this reason not only tourists, or backpackers but prevalently international students or even international volunteers are choosing this city for their academic courses, stages and studies.</p>
<p><img src='http://www.italytravelnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/florence-piazza-della-signoria.jpg' alt='florence-piazza-della-signoria.jpg' /></p>
<p>Well, to start, we mention an international place where students, travellers, journalists and actors usually meet: at Acqua al 2 you can get cannelloni, beef, selection of salads, pasta, cheese and excellent wines at average prices of Ã¢âÂ¬30. Acqual al 2 is a modern bistro that we suggest in Via Vigna Vecchia ,40; ph: +39 055 284 170; open daily from 7.30 pm-1am).<br />
<span id="more-647"></span><br />
If you are visiting Florence and you are on a budget and looking for cheap accommodation consider youth hostels, backpackers hostels or international students houses ( hostels as well) where a bed night average price start from 18 euros. The atmosphere is quite basic but somehow fascinating. Florence does not have a long tradition in modern hippie youth hostels as you might find in other top cities. Florence rather can offer old style hostels, kind of student residence, or pilgrim residence as it was in Medieval times. Monasteries are converted in new pilgrims hostels ( backpackers, students, international volunteers) sometimes still run by nuns or monks. You can find some more details in site for young travellers or backpackers as Flashboking.com.</p>
<p>For budget tips where to go shopping here we go!</p>
<p>It is possible to make excellent purchases in the narrow lanes and streets of Florence in particular around Santa Croce and Oltrarno you can easily find little authentic workshops of paper, leather, perfumes&#8230;</p>
<p>Some names: Il Papiro offers good quality hand-made paper in Piazza del Duomo, 24r (ph: +39 055 281 628). Officina Profumo Farmaceutica Shop an old fashioned chemist offers lotions, potions, and herbal remedies abound in elegant packaging in Via Scala, 16 (ph: +39 055 16276 )</p>
<p>Go to Piazza dei Ciompi if you are looking for second-hand and flea markets (last Sun. of the month), or to S. Lorenzo Market (northwest of the Duomo), or the colourful Central Market for food (Square of Mercato Centrale). Here you Ã¢â¬Ëll find olives, hams, cheeses and fresh vegetables. Try Via Maggio and Borgo Ognissanti for fine Florentine antique shops.</p>
<p>Of course for anything you need, ticket booking, accommodations booking, hotel reservations, budget trattorie, or simply to locate all this on a map you need a pc and an internet point ( as not all youth hostel will have pc free fro every guest!!). There are a few in Florence. Internet point (Borgo degli Albizi 66; ph:+39 055 24 0780; Ã¢âÂ¬3/hour); Internet Train: (Ã¢âÂ¬4/hour or Ã¢âÂ¬3/hour for students) with 12 point sin the city: Via dellÃ¢â¬â¢Oriuolo, 40, ph: +39 055 2345 322; Via del Parione 11b, ph:+39 055 264 5563; Borgo S. Jacopo, ph: +39 055 265 7935).</p>

<p>Florence! The heart of the art! Located in the middle of Tuscany, it has represented for centuries the cradle of art, in all its forms and expressions. This enormous and priceless heritage has attracted people from all over the world, making of Florence one of the most popular tourist destinations. This has not always been the case though, at least for some years.</p>
<p>Thousands of soldiers were sent to Europe, and Italy, during the Second World War and Florence became a land to conquer and then to defend. Museums, churches, cathedrals, piazzas and other beauties of Florence were no longer the aim of those who came from far away. Sadly, many would not make their way back home and thanks to their lives, Florence, Italy and Europe could find again its previous freedom.<br />
<span id="more-708"></span><br />
For those who want to pay homage to these lives, they can visit the Florence American Cemetery, located on the west side of Via Cassia, about 10 km south of Florence. The Rome-Milan motorway passes nearby and its Certosa-Florence exit is about 3 km from the cemetery. The &#8220;SITA&#8221; bus station provides a frequent bus service along Via Cassia. The bus stop is conveniently located just outside the cemetery gate.</p>
<p>The site covers seventy acres and is duly kept in perfect order, with a variety of beautiful trees and bushes around immaculate lawns, on the west side of the Greve River. Between the two entrance buildings, a bridge leads to the burial area where the headstones of 4.402 American military are arrayed in symmetrical curved rows upon the hillside. Most of them died in the fighting occurred after the capture of Rome in 1944, including casualties of the heavy fighting in the Apennines shortly before the end of the war. Above the burial area on the topmost of three broad terraces stands the memorial marked by a tall pylon surmounted by a large sculptured figure depicting the spirit of peace. The memorial has two open atria joined by the Tablets of the Missing upon which are inscribed the names of 1.409 Americans who gave their lives in the service of their country and who rest in unknown graves. The architects of the cemetery and monument were McKim, Mead and White. The landscape architects were Clarke and Rapuano.</p>
<p>The cemetery is open to visitors all year round. In Summer (16th April- 30th September) from 8.00 am to 6.00 pm, every day, and in Winter (1st October &#8211; 15th April) from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm, again every day.</p>

<p>It does not happen that often these days that airlines surprise you with their innovation and efficiency. And that is why I wanted to share an experience I recently had, flying with Lufthansa, which totally amazed me.</p>
<p>Having a connecting flight can be tricky sometimes, especially when you have a short connecting time between flights and even more so when your first flight is being delayed. </p>
<p><img src='http://www.italytravelnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/logo_lufthansa.gif'/></p>
<p>On my way home via Munich, I had a 50 min of connecting time between flights and the first flight took off with a 35 min delay. And it did very much look like a lost battle and I was already preparing myself to bolt through the airport to reach the next flightÃ¢â¬â¢s gate, totally giving up on my luggage arriving together with me or even worse, I was also thinking that if I do not make it, being an evening flight, I would probably have to spend the night in Munich.</p>
<p>And then, upon arrival, and while still in the airplane, the airhostess made an announcement for passengers with a connecting flight to my final destination, that they will be expected at the foot of the airplane.</p>
<p>And here came the Wow! experience:<br />
<span id="more-717"></span><br />
A Lufthansa representative with  a separate vehicle, first checked all of our boarding cards, before letting us in the small bus, then the bus bolted through the runway, we went through an express passport control and then bolted back  to the foot steps of our next connecting airplane Ã¢â¬â and all of this happened in 15 min.</p>
<p>And to my shy question: Ã¢â¬ÅWould the luggage make it?Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬â the answer was: Ã¢â¬ÅBut of course, there is one vehicle for you and another one for all your luggage, which goes strait to your next airplane.Ã¢â¬Â</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Travelling a lot you might sometimes get cynical, being used to airports, connecting flights, the service offered Ã¢â¬Â¦ and yet, when an airline company manages to surprise you with their innovation and efficiency, I guess oneÃ¢â¬â¢s only response can be that of loyalty.</p>
<p>Thank you Lufthansa Ã¢â¬â keep on surprising us! : )</p>
<p>Lufthansa operates 5 flights a day from Munich to <a href="http://www.italytravelnotes.com/category/lazio/rome/">Rome</a>,  and 8 flights to <a href="http://www.italytravelnotes.com/category/lombardia/milan/">Milan</a>. From Frankfurt it operated 9 flights daily to <a href="http://www.italytravelnotes.com/category/lombardia/milan/">Milan</a> and 6 daily flights to <a href="http://www.italytravelnotes.com/category/lazio/rome/">Rome</a>.</p>

Pitigliano is situated on the top of a steep tuff of a volcanic magma.</p>
<p>Pitigliano was considered the home of Jews. They shared the habitat with the gentile population of the town in a harmonious manner and together contributed for the cultural and social development of both communities. The village landscape reminds you of the Jerusalem city. The tuff rock bears unison with the medieval structures. The picturesque of the emerging grayish cluster of buildings from the dark woods brings the memory of the days of the Jewish community in this small religious city. Its culture and civilization is a tribute to the enduring devotion of the minority Jewish community towards this city.</p>
<p>The natural attractions of Pitigliano are the wild forest surrounding the cliff and the creeks that are developed into deep valleys. The largest Italian lake, Lake Bolsena is situated near Pitigliano. The landscape of Pitigliano is beautified with Mount Amiata, a 1738-meter high volcano that was separated from it long time ago. The Maremma coast extends 50 kilometers from Pitigliano with beautiful beaches that are not invaded by the human activities.<br />
<span id="more-712"></span><br />
The city`s cultural establishments prove the dedication of the Jewish community towards the development of the culture. The Jewish University of Pitigliano was established during the flourishing days of the community in this small city.</p>
<p>Other attractions of Pitigliano are the following.</p>
<p>The Orsini-Castle- This medieval castle is situated at the entrance of the town. There is an archeological museum inside the Orsini Castle that recollects the ancient Jewish culture and activities.</p>
<p>The Orsini Park: Situated on the road to Sorano is the park that was created towards the end of 16th century. The notable features of the park are the statues and stone seats that are carved from the tuff stones.</p>
<p>Museum of the Giubbonaia, This unique museum is characterized by its collection of agricultural and household tools that were used in the ancient days. There is a labyrinth that takes you to the underground through the foundation of the museum. The labyrinth showcases the architectural talents that the Jews possessed in those days.</p>
<p>Piazza: There is a chapel inside the Piazza that had a collection of frescos. As time and history changed, the Piazza was modified, and now its highlights are the two bars, Bar Centrale and the Bar Italia that rise to the vicinity leaving the chapel underneath.</p>
<p>Synagogue: It is one of the historical remnants of the Jewish culture. It is located under the cathedral in the former entrance to the city via Zuccarelli.</p>
<p>The medieval painters were deeply influenced by the city of Pitigliano, especially its deep and winding streets that lead the city towards the valley. These streets are dug out from the steep tuff, with their walls more than 10 meters high.</p>
<p>Pitigliano bears a romantic tone with lots of memories of its ancestors, who made it a castle of hope. So if you are a connoisseur of medieval culture and art, come and join the league of those famous artists who were deeply influenced by this city.</p>

<p>Naples</p>
<p>Naples is a city with a reputation, and not a very good reputation. For many some words that come to mind when thinking about Naples include unmentionables like dirty and crime infested. While these descriptions may be true, it is also true that Naples is a very colorful city. Yes crime is a problem, but you will be fine if you employ just a little common sense.</p>
<p><img src='http://www.italytravelnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/naples-caffe-in-the-evening.jpg' alt='naples-caffe-in-the-evening.jpg' /></p>
<p>Photograph by <a target="_blank" href="www.stuckincustoms.com">Trey Ratcliff</a> </p>
<p>Naples is all about truth. When in Naples you won&#8217;t get that odd tourist feeling like you get in some of Italy&#8217;s other cities. Naples is about living. It&#8217;s people can be a bit gruff, but are also a heck of lot more colorful than you find elsewhere throughout the country. It&#8217;s also been said you get in trouble in Naples, all you need do is bring up the subject of soccer and youÃ¢â¬â¢ll suddenly have friends for life.<br />
<span id="more-714"></span><br />
The best way to experience Naples is just to explore it. The action is on the street, not in museums. If youÃ¢â¬â¢re hankering for picture opportunities, the glass dome over the Galleria Umberto I is a good spot. You can also climb above the city to take scenic pictures of the coast and madness of Naples.</p>
<p>If you are really pining for a tourist fix, Pompeii and the looming Mount Vesuvius are close by. Pompeii, of course, was buried in a Mount Vesuvius explosion, literally freezing everything in place. Ah, you already know the story.</p>
<p>Sorrento</p>
<p>If Naples overpowers you, you should make your way around the bay in Sorrento. Sorrento is quite similar to Naples only with one very notable exception. That being where Naples is not, it is all about tourism. It&#8217;s a city that works to make tourist comfortable. Frankly, it is difficult to see how Naples and Sorrento can coexist but they certainly do. In Sorrento, you can stay at ancient resorts where service is the name of the game. The beaches arenÃ¢â¬â¢t so hot, but you can rent jet skis and such to invoke your inner tourist.</p>
<p>Southern Italy often gets a bad rap as a rough place riddled with crime and to some extent this probably true, but seeing this region of Italy is worth it.</p>
