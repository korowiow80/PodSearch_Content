      <title>EPISODE:NINE - The One With: Boobies, lady wee's &amp;amp; haircuts</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/12460/600x600_630875.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La, La, La...

So episode 8 was a slight bit rubbish, so we decided to put some extra strong editing into this episode.

In this episode:

We start off with an introduction, we then talk crap for a bit, then we talk about boobies for a while, followed by some other crap, then we say goodbye and plug our website - incedentally: himynameisbainsy.co.uk - I'm sure you'll love it, like a mother loves their own child.

      <title>EPISODE:FIVE - the one with Pansexualism, feminism and transexualism</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/12460/600x600_630879.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things are worth the wait. This podcast is an excellent example of that trite phrase. I know we are two weeks late delivering you the podcast, but guess what?! We have our reasons, and once you hear the reasons for the delay in delivery, you will take back your harsh words of &quot;where is the crappy podcast?&quot; and change them to &quot;Well alright Bainsy, you cool so and so!&quot;

Anyway the first reason we're a bit behind is that for some reason our academic careers includes nasty things like coursework and exams, something I feel they failed to mention during the sign up process.

Secondly, we've been having a bit of trouble getting our wenches into the booth to push our knobs and buttons! - seriously the skiving cows!

But now, here we are, back on track, ready to go. So here is your boring ass podcast. enjoy it.
