Today&#039;s main report looks ahead to this summer&#039;s European Championships in Poland and Ukraine and focuses on World and European holders Spain&#039;s chances. You can listen to the report by clicking on the link below, while vocabulary support (in bold) appears at the foot of the report. There is also a worksheet (see left) for learners who wish to improve their English.

Qualifying
(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/PA-11813332-500x340-300x204.jpg)
Teams sometimes suffer a dip in form after winning a major tournament but Spain followed up their World Cup 2010 victory with a flawless European qualifying campaign. They easily topped their group with a 100% record - they won all 8 of their matches against Scotland, Lithuania, Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic.


Key Players

Where to begin? The Spanish national team almost picks itself such is the consistency of its high-performing players. The Barca quintet of Xavi, Busquets, Pedro and Iniesta will of course be there, while Madrid&#039;s Casilas, Ramos, and Albiol will bolster the defence but in this tournament they will be missing two key players: David Villa and Carles Puyol. Puyol is an inspirational figure at the back and will be sorely missed but goalscorer Villa is probably a greater loss. He has scored 10 goals in 11 games at the previous two major tournaments - 4 in Euro 2008 and 6 more in 2010 - and though Spain do have Bilbao&#039;s Llorente and the 2008 winning goalscorer Torres in their team they will miss Villa.
The Manager
(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/787405-13422665-640-360-300x168.jpg)
Taking over from Euro 2008 winning manager Luis Aragones could seem like a poisoned chalice - surely the only way is down after such a wonderful victory? Step forward Vicente del Bosque regarded by many as a safe pair of hands, someone who lets the players play as he trusts in their ability. After winning his first ten games in charge of La SelecciÃ³n - a national record - del Bosque oversaw the World Cup win in South Africa with his side refusing to change their passing style throughout the tournament.
Their Chances
They are the favourites to win Euro 2012 though injuries and the fact that no team has ever retained the European Championship or won three major tournaments in a row means that this competition could be their hardest challenge yet. Though their group is not a group of death it will be tricky enough with powerhouses Italy, dark horses Croatia and well-organised Ireland all ready to stop the Spanish. The first match is vital and if they can get something from that game against Italy then they should easily progress to the knock-out stages. After that, depending on injuries and luck, they should be there or thereabouts again.

The Good
Liverpool won a trophy, there is some silverware in the cabinet, and that hasn&#039;t happened since the FA Cup win in 2007. OK, it is the least important cup in the English top flight, the Carling Cup, but it was a welcome victory. On the way, Liverpool beat Chelsea and Manchester City, so they did it the hard way, too. Liverpool also had another good cup run, this time in the FA Cup, and they weren&#039;t far off winning it either only losing 2-1 in the final to Chelsea. On the way to the final they claimed the scalps of Manchester United, their huge rivals, and Everton, their local rivals. So again, that was cause to feel pleased with their performance. Andy Carroll scored in the semi finals against Everton and in the final against Chelsea, too - signs of hope for next year for the big centre forward.
The Bad
19 games, six wins, nine draws, four losses: Quite simply, the Reds&#039; home form was dreadful. The club have been quite rightly proud of the famous sign in the players&#039; tunnel whhich simply reads &#039;This is Anfield&#039;. The sign used to be a symbol for the fact that playing at Liverpool was always a difficult proposition - most clubs were happy to come away with a draw and not many expected to win. The 2011-2012 season saw that turned on its head. Some of the league&#039;s less successful clubs came and beat Liverpool in their own backyard: Wigan, Fulham and West Bromwich Albion all beat Kenny Dalglish&#039;s side.Â Very bad.
The Ugly
The whole Suarez affair was handled very poorly by Liverpool and their manager Kenny Dalglish. By being so public in their support of their player against charges of racism, the club appeared in many peoples&#039; eyes to be soft on racism. It was a very bad own goal indeed and didn&#039;t help the player involved either: he was still given an eight match ban and is now booed wherever he plays. The club should have accepted the FA&#039;s decision and shut up. Let&#039;s hope for better next year!

Vocabulary
silverware in the cabinet: when a club wins a title or a competition, they win &#039;silverware - cups and trophies. These are displayed in the club&#039;s trophy cabinet

did it the hard way: had to play well and beat some dificult teams or come back from losing positions to win

claimed the scalps: beat; defeated; especially win against a big team - it something to be proud of

dreadful: awful; terrible; very bad

a difficult proposition: a challenge; a hard game; a difficult opponent

turned on its head: reversed; change something completely

own backyard: at home; in your territory

be soft on: to not be serious about; to not be tough with

own goal: when you score against your own team - in this context it means to give bad publicity to your own club

booed: jeered; heckled; shouted at</itunes:summary>

On this week&#039;s main listening report we preview the FA Cup final between Chelsea and Liverpool by taking a look at the oldest competition in the world through numbers. You can listen to the report by clicking on the link below, while vocabulary support (in bold) appears at the foot of the report. There is also a worksheet (see right) for learners who wish to improve their English.

(../wp-content/uploads/worksheet-213x300.png)
(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/qnmbk6-245x300.jpg)
1872
1872 is the year of the first ever Cup final (http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1872WanderersRoyalEngineers) which took place at the Oval in Kennington in South London in front of 2.000 fans. Wanderers beat the Royal Engineers 1-0 to become the first ever winners of a competition that had invited all 15 members of the Football Association. The Wanderers went on to win the trophy on four more occasions. Other major cup competition founding years include the Scottish Cup which was inaugurated in 1874, the Spanish Cup - Copa del Rey - was first played for in 1902, while the Coppa Italia was started in 1922.

11
(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/Manchester+United+v+Liverpool+FA+Cup+final+1996-300x151.png)
This is the number of times that Manchester United have won the competition and though they last won it in 2004, this is a record. They also hold the record of most appearances in the final: 18, while poor old Leicester City have appeared most times in a final without ever winning on four occasions. Arsenal are second on the list with 10 victories and their North-London rivals, Tottenham are in third place with nine wins - though they have not won the FA Cup since 1991. United are way behind the teams with most domestic cup titles: Linfield have 41 Northern Irish cup wins, while Celtic have 35 Scottish victories.
7
Ashley Cole has won the FA Cup on seven occasions - three times with his former club Arsenal and 4 times with his current club Chelsea, though he does not hold the record of Cup final appearances - that belongs to Arthur Kinnaird of the Wanderes with nine visits to the final. Cole&#039;s Chelsea colleague Didier Drogba holds the record for scoring in most finals - four matches, though he does not have the record for most goals in finals; that belongs to Liverpool legend Ian rush with 5 final goals.
1923
(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/220px-Whitehorsefinal.jpg)
This was the year that the final first took place at Wembley Stadium after nine other venues had been used to host the final. These included Kennington and Stamford Bridge in London as well as Goodison Park in Liverpool, Bramall Lane in Sheffield and Burnden Park in Bolton. Bolton beat West Ham in that first Wembley final - 2-0 - in front of 127.000 fans though some suggest there may have been closer to 200.000 inside the new stadium. When Wembley was being re-built in the early part of the millenium (2001-06) the finals were played at the Millenium Stadium in Cardiff; Manchester United and Chelsea playing the first final at the &#039;new&#039; Wembley in 2007, with Chelsea winning 1-0.
Vocabulary
founding: Starting, beginning

was inaugurated : Begun first

are way behind: A long way from

the millenium: Here it refers to the 2000s</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>| (../wp-content/uploads/2009/02/feed-icon-28x281.png) Subscribe: Main Listening Report 
On this week&#039;s main listening report we interview a Manchester United fan and a Manchester City fan and ask them what they think will happen next Monday when their teams clash in the Manchester Derby. It is also probably going to decide which of them wins the title - City need to win it, United need a draw or a win. You can listen to the report by clicking on the link above, while vocabulary support (in bold) appears at the foot of the report.


(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/Manchester-Derby1-300x197.jpg)Dave - A Manchester City fan
What does your team have to do to win it?

I think City have to play with confidence. Very simply. They have a much better team than United. The forwards should be able to take, well Evans and the other one... (Ferdinand) Ferdinand! Well neither of those are particularly good at the moment and I think basically the City front four should run rings around them. And maybe should get four possibly.

OK, so you&#039;re predicting a 4-0 win.

Um, I&#039;m not predicting a win. I&#039;m saying City should win. The problem is when it gets to these big games City tend to be slightly hesitant, right. And because of the build up before this game which inevitably happens the game may well be a big disappointment. So, I think in reality I&#039;d have to say no score, but I like that because I like to think low... low expectations. We&#039;ll win 4-0!

Alright, and who&#039;s going to win the title?

I think the title is... the main problem is not the game against United, it&#039;s the game against Newcastle away because they&#039;re the form team. And because of that, I can&#039;t really see City winning too. And I can&#039;t really see United losing theirsÂ  too. So it&#039;s going to be very tight one point, but I think probably... Citeh!

And if you don&#039;t win it, will that be a successful season coming second?

I think the season has been very very successful. Even though there have been obviously highlights... big big problems involving Tevez and Balotelli, and Mancini obviously needs to be a better man manager in the future. But, you know, if you consider the number of points they&#039;ve made this year compared to last year it&#039;s better; they&#039;ve scored more goals. If they don&#039;t get it this year, I&#039;m fairly sure they&#039;ll get it next.
Simon - A Manchester United fan
The big game is coming up. What does Manchester United have to do to win it?

It&#039;s a difficult one isn&#039;t it. They&#039;ve given away the initiative. They&#039;ve just got to forget everything. Just go out there. Play the game. That&#039;s it.

OK. And do you think they will be victorious. Do you think they&#039;ll win it?

The thing is, they don&#039;t have to win. A win or a draw is fine. But they have to go out and try to win. Really take the game to them. It&#039;s the kind of game when they really could have done with Fletcher in the middle I think. It&#039;s going to be difficult.

And beyond that game, do you think Manchester United will win be winning their 20th title?

Well, they have to, don&#039;t they!

OK. If they don&#039;t, do you think it will have been a successful season coming second?

They have to win it, don&#039;t they!
Vocabulary
run rings around: give your opponent a hard time; beat your opponent easily; take the ball past the opposing player several times

the build up: before big games the media often has a lot of coverage - news reports, interviews, features etc. This is called a big build up

the form team: the team with the best recent record; the team that is winning a lot of games recently

a man manager: someone good at dealing with people; a manager that can deal with players&#039; egos

the initiative:if a team has the initiative they are in the stronger position

take the game to: attack the opposition; play an aggressive game; not defensive

On this week&#039;s main listening report we preview the Champions League Semi-final second legs that are both delicately poised: Real Madrid face Bayern Munich while on Tuesday Barcelona host Chelsea. You can listen to the report by clicking on the link below, while vocabulary support (in bold) appears at the foot of the report. There is also a worksheet (see right) for learners who wish to improve their English.

Barcelona vs Chelsea
(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/Ramires-008-300x180.jpg)
No team has retained the Champions League trophy since Milan did so in 1994, meaning the already difficult task for holders Barcelona became even more so after their 0-1 defeat in London against Chelsea. It is true that the Catalan side created far more chances than the home team: 13 shots to 1 (with 6 of those on target), while Barca enjoyed 72% possession - a remarkable statistic for an away side - yet Didier Drogba&#039;s first half-goal has given Chelsea a real possibility of exacting revenge on Barcelona for their semi-final defeat four years ago. Chelsea defended very well, were brave and maintained their concentration throughout the whole game - the question is can they do it again away in the Nou Camp next week? Many pundits would say that The Blues can not get away with another performance like the first leg but like Inter Milan two years ago they will know that when Barca have to come from behind the pressure will be on.

Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich
(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/Mario-Gomez-pokes-the-bal-008-300x180.jpg)
The second semi-final also saw a Spanish side defeated - this time Madrid were beaten by a late goal from German international Mario Gomez to give Bayern Munch a deserved 2-1 lead (http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/apr/17/bayern-munich-real-madrid-champions-league). Madrid boss Jose Mourinho was not too downbeat after the game as his side has a valuable away goal meaning that a 1-0 victory in Madrid next week would be enough to secure a place in the final but the Madrid coach also knows that if his side fails to progress to the final then his tenure in Madrid could be over. The fact that this season&#039;s final will take place in Bayern&#039;s home stadium is an added incentive for the Bavarian side and they will be quietly confident of scoring an away goal which would mean that Real would need at least three goals to win.

Before the first leg matches most football fans were predicting an all-Spanish final, a clasico, but after the first legs it is the underdogs - a strange term to describe Chelsea or Bayern - who have the upper hand. Will that still be the case by next week?
Vocabulary
has retained: Has won the title again, two years in a row

to come from behind: To win a match after going down (losing)

exacting revenge: To gain revenge

the Nou Camp: The home stadium of Barcelona

pundits: Experts about football

downbeat: Disheartened, disappointed

his tenure: His reign, his time as manager

an added incentive: More motivation

the Bavarian side: Bayern Munich</itunes:summary>

Everton vs Liverpool
History
(http://languagecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/59647016_kenny_dalglish_getty-300x168.jpg)
So Everton meet derby rivals Liverpool in the first semi-final of the FA Cup this weekend. Everton, the oldest of the two clubs, also won the FA Cup before their bigger neighbours way back in 1906. Since then, they have won it four more times, most recently with a 1-0 win over Manchester United in 1995 thanks to a goal by Paul Rideout. Since then, the trophy room has not been added to, although they did come close in 2009 but were beaten at the final hurdle by Chelsea in the final. Five wins is nothing to be sniffed at, but Liverpool have seven. Interestingly they have won an FA Cup at least once in every decade since the 1960s. Could that be an omen? Their last victory in 2006 is up there with one of the most dramatic of all FA Cup finals. Liverpool needed an injury-time equaliser, a pile driver by Gerrard, to force extra time and penalties against West Ham. Liverpool have also beaten Everton twice in FA Cup finals: in 1986 and most famously in 1989. The last win was five weeks after the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool, fans died in a stadium crush.

The Road to the Semis
Both teams will believe they deserve their place in the semis. Everton have beaten two Premier League sides on the way - Fulham and Sunderland - and also had a potential banana skin when they faced Blackpool in the fifth round. Liverpool also beat Premier League opposition in Manchester United in the fourth round and Stoke in the sixth. The Reds scored 15 goals and conceded 4 on their way to the semis, while Everton netted nine times and let in 4. They did need a replay to overcome Sunderland, but both teams have looked good so far in the competition.

Chances
Let&#039;s look at the form of the teams. In the last 10 games in all competitions, Everton have won 5, drawn 3 and lost 2, while Liverpool have won just twice and lost six. They&#039;ve been beaten by teams in the relegation zone, such as QPR and Wigan as well as to their bitter rivals Manchester United. Everton, on the other hand, have put a great run of form together, and they have just hammered Sunderland 4-0. But head-to-head Liverpool have the advantage. In the last five meetings, the Reds have won 3 and Everton just 1. Liverpool have also done the double over the Blues this season. The game is a day before the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster and is bound to be an emotional affair.

So Everton have the best league form, but Liverpool edge it on history and head to head, but as everyone knows, the form book goes out of the window in derbies!
Chelsea vs Tottenham

History
The second semi-final features another local derby, this time a London rivalry involving West London side Chelsea and North London&#039;s Tottenham. This will be the 146th time the two sides will have met and they have played each other in the FA Cup on seven previous occasions. Chelsea won 2-1 the last time they met in the Cup in 2007, though Spurs have managed to defeat their rivals in the final way back in 1967. Tottenham have a proud Cup tradition having won the trophy on nine occasions though they have not won it since 1991.</itunes:summary>
