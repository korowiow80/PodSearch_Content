<p>As the financial world accelerates into a brick wall, Guy Euden returns for a 2 hour conversation on life lived in Lawful Rebellion. Guy has spent years studying various law forms and has developed a formidable level of experience and knowledge, as you will find out here. Having known Guy for several years, we have both trodden our paths and formed our own conclusions about the uncertainties presented to the individual when attempting to parry statute &#8216;law&#8217;, rebut assumptions of liability, or even just see to it our babies are not considered property of the state. Please see timings below for the large variety of topics that were discussed, plus links to hundreds of audio files for in-depth study of topics.</p>

<p><strong>20th February &#8211; Constitution Halts Sheriff</strong></p>
<p>On Feb 20th 2012 <a title="Irish Constitution halts Sheriff" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=PpUjl4LvQM8" target="_blank">this video</a> of Ben Gilroy turning away the  attentions of a Sheriff from his attempt to execute a warrant to evict  an Irish family from their home was aired on youtube. This video went  viral; it  received 40,000 views in less than 48 hours. In the video,  Documents were presented by the Sheriff and lawfully refused. A very significant moment indeed for Ireland and the wider world.</p>
<p><strong> 5th March &#8211; Kony 2012 Global Viral Mega Movement meme implodes</strong> </p>
<p>In the early days of March 2012 the Invisible Children / Kony 2012 global viral mega movement <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2012/03/globalists-pull-plug-on-kony-2012-with.html" target="blank">imploded</a>. Days after meteoric <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17295078" target="_blank">rise to global consciousness</a>. Why? because upon mass critical examination a seemingly benevolent charity pledging to bring the arrest of a child-army directing dictator was actually a <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/kony-2012-state-propaganda-for-a-new-generation/" target="_blank">thinly veiled intelligence agency / n.w.o propaganda ploy</a> to bring the US into Africa. The spectacular implosion of the world record setting awareness campaign was underscored by the man behind the campaign being detained after masturating in public amongst other bizarre actions. Notably, this is the first true global attention acquisition campaign with shady backers and a equally shady hidden plan in a classic bait and switch ruse. It goes to demonstrate what is possible from the alternative media to attain the same level of attention to a message which is integral and moral, and focussed solely on the freedom of all from would-be dictatorial, ruling generational autocrats bent on the mental enslavement of us all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/2012-judgement-year2.gif"><img title="2012 Judgement Day White Rabbit &#038; Lawful Rebellion" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/2012-judgement-year2.gif" alt="What will 2012 bring?" width="640" height="250" /></a>Like it or lump it, there is now and has been throughout time an entrenched power which compels humanity to err both collectively and individually. Whatever the purpose, there has been a massive, almost incomprehensible amount of energy invested by the controllers in the promotion of the importance of the year 2012, which is now upon us. &#8216;Officially&#8217;, if there is such a word, the date for end times is set as 21/12/2012. Unofficially, the end of the world has come for many people already, seeing their livelihood taken from them by the financial, political &amp; judicial engine which operates using a logic set no longer fit for our time. However, as the majority of the western world is still operating with a veneer of &#8216;business-as-usual&#8217;, so the masses continue their weary trudge to the cube farms of cities across the world to collect their monthly credit units of varying denomination. The entrenched powers are very intelligent; having been around for a long time, they have learned well how to manipulate humanity and &#8216;herd&#8217; them primarily using money and the lack thereof to shape behavior and habit. However, as the systemic error in using debt as the basis for money comes closer to being fully expressed, so we hurtle into the unknown of a world in which the idea of money as we presently know it may cease, albeit temporarily, to exist.</p>
<p>The forces controlling the controllers must be dark; for the amount of fraud, robbery, bloodshed, and countless acts of unspeakable atrocities are now blasted out of alternative information channels on an hourly basis. The counter-forces of light however are growing brighter and stronger by the moment; throughout the world, people have become wise to the international game of risk being played out by bankers and various globalists scrapping out for what they perceive to be the &#8216;top spot&#8217;. Where the majority of &#8216;normal&#8217; people will face difficulty is likely with the hangers-on who still believe that they can carve out a life of comparative comfort and stability by perpetuation of the system which is slowly crushing to death those on &#8216;the other side&#8217;. The broken robots of the police, the rabid tax collectors of the In-land re-venue service, dysfunctional nationalists bent on attributing blame to brown skinned people, and of course, this reporters&#8217; personal favourite: Die-hard government protectionists&#8230; those that believe without authority we would surely just destroy our neighbors as soon as smile at them, that we would eat the seeds rather than plant them.</p>
<p>Of course, a myriad of prophecies exist regarding the events that may or may not be about to befall us and our beautiful planet. But, saving sudden access to super technology on an individual level, there is probably not too much that you or I can do about financial Armageddon, or a supernova from the sun, or a fleet of invading ancient aliens returning to claim kingship over us, or a shy and retiring man with a beard and white robes championing the plight of a chosen race. Hoi, I tell you, there&#8217;s a lot of reputations at stake over 2012. Despite the uncertainties, how about we find a little common ground &#8211; some things we can all agree on. If there is a world wide currency collapse you can bet there won&#8217;t be a whole lot left down at Asda by the time you get there. You can bet that the financial machine will not stop in it&#8217;s pursuit to drain you and everyone you know until you are destitute and homeless, for that is the plan. You can bet that the people around you are going to be pretty shook up about all of this, as those that haven&#8217;t quite got it suddenly realize we are locked inside a societal train that just shot off the end of a rather large bridge, in flames, with psychotic smiling-depressive drivers bellowing &#8220;EVERYTHING IS OK, PAY MORE TAXES&#8221; as we plunge.</p>
<p>With that happy image in mind, the question arises &#8216;if there is a world-wide calamity just around the corner, what CAN we do about it?&#8217;. Well, getting very, very rich is one answer; that way you can buy a couple of years of storable food, and perhaps a pleasant heavily fortified, underground, radiation-free bunker. We wouldn&#8217;t be thinking that far outside the box if we left it there though; so what about the idea that the answer to your personal armageddon can only ever come from&#8230; you.Â  Within your heart is the answer to your problems, and like so many others who know this website and many hundreds of thousands like it, the call to action has been heard and now the people are fashioning their own solutions. We can be there for one another, we can give away what we do not need, we can show support and encouragement for one anothers&#8217; efforts, and we can overcome the challenges of our own time.</p>
<p>Across the UK and the world, the people have awoken and continue to wake at an astonishing rate. The network of people who have attained knowledge and a level of expertise in dealing with the faltering control grid is flourishing.</p>
<p>Si Spaniard from the White Rabbit Education group returns to discuss life as a lawful rebel with richy, and dispenses valuable tools for those battling the legal dragons. Si is an inspiration for everyone as to what can be achieved by remaining calm, asking questions, and knowing who he really is.</p>
<p>Lawful Rebellion is here, the Controllers are here, and finally, 2012 is here. Set your VCR now.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2442" title="Mortgage fraud" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/mortgage-fraud-lawful-rebellion1.jpg" alt="That's right.. mortgages are a biiiiig fraud too." width="630" height="250" /></p>
<p>Most people who have one will spend the vast majority of their life paying off the debt accrued via their Mortgage. What most people don&#8217;t know regarding that debt is that<strong> it does not actually exist. </strong>In reality, the borrower actually creates the line of credit which the alleged lender lends back to them, usually over 25 years and at an extortionate rate of interest.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>This multi-national fraud by non-disclosure, misrepresentation and abuse of position appears to be committed under an unconscionable and irrevocable Power of Attorney granted to the bankster in every Mortgage Deed. This allows the Mortgagee to create a Promissory Note in the name of the Mortgagor, for the purposes of securing and maintaining the legal charge registered against the property. The Mortgagor has no knowledge of the scope of this provision, which is used by the bankster to discharge the original debt before a single dayâs interest is charged.</p>

<p>In this Lawful Rebellion podcast, Richy talks with <strong>Freeman Michael of Freetheplanet.net</strong>. Michael exposes the most enormous yet provable fraud for the millions of mortgage payers in the United Kingdom PLC and countless more overseas.</p>
<p>To inspire a great awakening we must first have the time to do so. To have the time to do so we must stop worrying about the mortgage &#8211; it is the &#8216;death grip&#8217; which holds so many in a trance-like, debt-driven, money-grubbing rampage.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/LAWFULRE_REBELLION_DARREN_DEOJEE_PEOPLES_PUBLIC_TRUST.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2386 alignnone" title="Darren Deojee, The Peoples Public Trust" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/LAWFULRE_REBELLION_DARREN_DEOJEE_PEOPLES_PUBLIC_TRUST.png" alt="Darren Deojee, The Peoples Public Trust" width="630" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes down to it, having enough to eat and place to live in comfort is nothing less than everyone deserves. The earth is our home. It was entrusted to you, and as much as it is yours, it is mine. I trust you to look after our home, but if you do not where you have pledged to, then you have broken that trust and you must account for it.</p>
<p>These are the sentiments of a trusting individual who acts upon his beliefs in a positive fashion; they are shared by myself and many others in lawful rebellion. It is apparent that corruption lies everywhere. It is apparent that we have a choice to act upon that corruption in the right way &#8211; non-violently and with compassion. What has not emerged as yet is a coherent method to change our systems of government for the better. We all need a means of seeking remedy, accountability, and justice.Â  We struggle to find a reliable interface with the courtroom, which is where (some) of the levers of power rest.</p>
<p>With the court effectively under the presumptive control of the banks and the commercial construct, goal posts can be changed and victories can really just be delays. <strong>Darren Deojee</strong> of the <strong>Peoples&#8217; Public Trust</strong>, giving a talk at a recent White Rabbit seminar, has taken the concepts of trust law and applied it in a positive fashion to our crumbling nation.</p>
<p>The methods suggested by Darren and the People&#8217;s Public Trust say core chargesÂ  can be brought against public servants using trust and common law and, with associations of trusts, the people can act as one to challenge jurisdiction and hold to account civil servants and dispel the power of corporations. During the talk Darren covered a wide range of topics regarding trusts and his story so far with the project as per approximate timings below.</p>

<p>I have been a keen reader of the White Rabbit Education emails for some time now, and was pleased when The Spaniard (the charismatic gladiator personified) agreed to a chat. He is part of the White Rabbit Education Trust &#8211; a growing network of study groups across the country and they are here to help with Lawful Remedies to your problems. We get so many emails from people asking for help and advice and as lowly admins we just can&#8217;t be dishing out exact steps &#8211; after all we are talking about a game which has consequences as many of our readers well know about. The Spaniard is a very knowledgable lawful warrior who struck me immediately as being alike to the mighty Guy Euden, who by now has most likely gained the jedi ability to disappear at will.</p>

<p>Or indeed any commercial construct youâre part of at this time, is it emotional, physical or time-based? Is the system youâre part of right? Do you ignore injustices or have done in the past to avoid conflict or you simply feared your job and livelihood? Even if there is no direct correlation you can find with these questions, we have been indirectly involved in terrible things against others and the Earth itself. Itâs drilled into us that the vicious wars across the world are for a just cause and that your sweat equity is required to build the machines to punish others into submitting to the authority of the Holy See and Crown. And that the Gulf Oil disaster is all part of the motions of corporate domination of the Earthâs resources, and that if you want to freely move around, accept the consequences on a land in which you cannot see. On an everyday level, we now accept Police battering people both verbally and physically on TV as entertainment; ignore managers of corporations regularly bullying people into submission of control; and pretend to believe that the pandemonium, called British Politics, actually has any benefit to our lives.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1501" title="face-transplant-private-eye-lawful-rebellion" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/face-transplant-private-eye-lawful-rebellion.jpg" alt="" width="315" height="385" /></p>
<p>People will cling onto what they already have invested into these corporatised systems, but in order to fully appreciate this vision, my experience and Neil Kramerâs is that all investment in these systems needs to be suspended in order to see it for what it really is. This is indeed where we begin to see the cracks and your Serf classing changes overnight. Maybe to counteract this increasing shift in consciousness, the System is making it harder for people to sit around on benefits by getting them out to 9-5 slavery, as itâs these kinds of people who quickly become disenfranchised with the system, if not already.Â By studying advertising and government research, it is not hard to see correlations of âcompetencyâ and âintelligenceâ between the âUnderclassesâ and the Upperclasses. The only difference is that one learns from life and the other learns in grand institutions â this is the magic of humanity in action and gives a vivid illustration that no matter your authority, youâre still no better than anyone else.</p>
<p><em>âWhether youâre a Teacher, Marxist, Politician, Cleaner, whatever, we all need to think how we can suspend what weâre doing to catch up with the reality from looking at the bigger picture. Everyone is guessing, even the people moving the chess pieces, its mad to think weâre all guessing.â</em></p>
<p>Retrospectively, Neil Kramer conjures up a definitive picture that most of the things weâre taught in schools and teach our kids now is total rubbish and itâs part of the âold wayâ. For instance, science is a religion because itâs based on a belief system and itâs this beliefÂ system, which is being fused with the corporate socialist ideology to create the future âStateâ weâre in today.Â  John Harris asked me the other day, âwhere does electricity come from?â Good question, I have no idea past the notion that itâs produced in giantÂ complexes and pushed down wire to us. Without swallowing a whole load of scientific jargon for years on end, I would have no clue of their belief on this question. They talk about how a Photon (basis of the physical world we see) can only be observed and cannot be predicted, and that light is both a wave and particle â what was there is no more and what could be can happen, all in less than a millisecond. Science has gone from a factually based belief system to skewing itself more and more into metaphysics. Simply, we rely on guessing, our whole civilisation is based on a bunch of people all running around not really knowing what theyâre doing â this can now be proven with scienceâ¦ HA! Does the universe allow us to observe the minuet details of part of itself in an attempt to help us realise something?</p>
<p><strong>You get what you&#8217;re given&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Where does the metaphysical belief within science leave control mechanisms? Does this answer the fact that when we try to control, things start to move out of phase from the plan? We literally cannot plan anything because as soon as itâs observed, it changes because we never get what we imagined â we get a reflection. The reflection is produced by our intent, investment and programmed lives â this is why there is an attempt made to regulate every part of our lives with policy and insane fictional law. So that when we make the decision to do something, it will be within the realms of policy, so the system can keep control by predicting the most likely outcome â this is inhumane.</p>
<p>Neil Kramer talks in this podcast and in his new work about his antidote, the <a href="http://thecleaver.blogspot.com/2010/06/from-britain-to-brazil-owning-dystopian.html" target="_blank">âDisavowal of the Shadowâ</a>:</p>
<p><em>âWhen we perceive our own inauthentic actions and continue to do nothing about them. This is exasperated by surrender to the dominion of the ego, me-centric thinking and self-absorbed pleasure hunting or escape. This principle is vital to the conscious evolutionary shift that is required to overturn the old hierarchy.</em></p>
<p><em>The core teaching is simple: we are the shadow. Each and every polarised negative entity that manifests in this world is our responsibility, our creation. The immutable flow from mind to matter, from consciousness to creation, does not allow us to disregard a given challenge. We cannot just let things go unresolved, try as we might. Negative energy patterns &#8211; destructive impulses concealed in dysfunction, fear and pain &#8211; cannot simply be abandoned. They must be faced and understood in order for their patterning to dissolve.â</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twstedlogic.co.uk" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1514" title="twstedlogic-lawful-rebellion" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/twstedlogic-lawful-rebellion2-221x300.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="300" /></a>Lawful Rebellion for me is as Iâve said before is only where it starts. It is just another way to realise that we create everything around us, and there is no other way for complete domination of us all without utter compliance from our minds, bodies and souls. There has been a steady increase through my life of a distortion between my mind, body and soul. This is partly achieved by creating the tick-a-box society whereby people subscribe to corporate hierarchy shrouded as âmarketing tribesâ, which is slowly replacing the class system. There is not one god anymore, there are 100s of demigods, and our minds and souls are being confused with our egos in fake portrayals of human behaviour. But the thing that physically keeps us controlled is the use of our bodies through 9-5 slavery, and the constant reiteration that our bodies are walking-talking fictional pieces of paper, which is the basis of our Serfdom and torture on this Earth.</p>
<p><strong>A way to make a change&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Both Neil and I along with many others talk about how to be creative, stop what youâre doing and consider your actions. Your journey to <a href="http://lawfulrebellion.org" target="_blank">lawfulrebellion.org</a> and <a href="http://tpuc.org" target="_blank">TPUC.org</a> is a result of you beginning your journey of realisation because you sense something isnât quite right. Everything is you and you are everything. Try something out, the next time you question something in your daily life maybe at work or on the move, do something about it, this action could completely change the direction not just of your life, but of others, especially if you make the right choice guided by your heart, no matter what the cost is to your physical world. I can promise you from my experience and Neil Kramerâs, the universe around you will reward you in some way. But you need to be open to feel the experience, as it can quickly be shattered by the ego within you, itâs happened to me many times â it is a learning curve and it gets better with time, so be patient. There are nasty people out there who we have created through not dealing with our fears that need our emotions to make things happen, which throw us collectively into more isolation from humanity. In order for our fears to stay real, we need to abide by the policy and laws of the System in order to safeguard the foundation of our construct. Why? We all have some real investment in disguising our fears and shifting blame onto scapegoats such as the Government and BP. This is quintessentially where <a href="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/Photo-Op-2005-by-Kennard-006.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1518 alignright" title="Tony Blair Photo-Op-2005-by-Kennard--006" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/Photo-Op-2005-by-Kennard-006-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a>Lawful Rebellion can become a stepping-stone or just another investment into the System. As if you continue to send out negativity through pieces of paper; avoid the systemâs policy; borrow knowledge without full comprehension; and scapegoat the system youâre part of, you will only get back a reflection of your fears and you end up back where you started.</p>
<p>The question was asked to Neil in the podcast, how can people who have investment in the System and other commercial constructs stop what theyâre doing without their families going hungry and them loosing their way of life? As this is the thing which people always resort to as an excuse or the ultimate argument to disembowel real change. Here it is, based on the podcast with Neil Kramer, his past articles and some ideas from Deep Ecology and lawfulrebellion.org:</p>
<ol>
<li>Neil says, âThere is a distinct difference between I would like to stop doing this and Iâm stopping what Iâm doing.â Please contemplate this, as you will feel what investments you have within the system and begin to sense the control mechanisms deep in your everyday life â this will either make you more fearful or make you stop after an individual process of realisation.</li>
<li>âZoom outâ, go away for a weekend with a notepad and pen and write down everything you think you need to do to sustain your existence and maybe your families if you have one. Do this with your partner if you feel itâs required. Look at the list and make up two piles, one ârequiredâ one âconsumptionâ putting each âneedâ into one or the other. To help you work this list out, maybe look at evidence of people who donât use money for things in your list or use alternatives. We have a great <a href="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/2010/05/09/beyond-lawful-rebellion-with-deep-ecology/" target="_blank">podcast with Deep Ecology</a> that goes into how people live outside of a corportised world. Do your own research.</li>
<li>Once youâve worked out what you need to live, whether itâs an amount of money for a long space of free time or ways in which you can share your skills to provide an existence. âYou will begin to see itâs not as bad as you previously thought because your intent is real and resonates with your heart.â Individual events will unfold that will help you on your way and you need to try and not stick to anything written down, see how things can work another way. You will begin to make new friends and feel their energy, which will help guide you on your way. This is not something that happens overnight or even in one month, you need least two months realisation and then the journey mentioned in this pointer can take a few years. I myself am only halfway through the process and Iâve been at this for around 2 years now. So be patient and stick to it if you want this, you can have it. If you fail, you will go back to the System at least with a new perspective on things and hopefully will try again or help others do the same, then come back and do it again yourself. There is no rush, you have all your life ahead of you. Becoming a Sovereign human is both an insane (from a corporate perspective) and a beautiful universal opportunity to do what you feel is right for yourself. I now see so many unique people and how others help me on my way with gifts and charity in return for my goodwill. This is something that can never be achieved in a corporate and hierarchal order.</li>

<p><span style="color: #888888;"><em>By David Ophalus</em></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/doss3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1174" title="Department of  Social Scrutiny - Lawful Rebellion" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/doss3-300x231.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="139" /></a>From the title I bet most of you are expecting some kind of humdrum Daily Mail interpretation of how weâre getting buggered more than you previously thought, like the recent offering by Heather Brooke called, The Silent State. Well, I thought it would be nice to offer a brief antidote from serious rebellious activity, by presenting a review and podcast with the author, Ian Vince, of a brilliant book and PDF, called Britain: What a State.</p>
<p>I first came across <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Department-of-Social-Scrutiny/33519891088" target="_blank">The Department of Social Scrutiny on Facebook</a> last year ending up in fits of laughter reading through some of the pastiches of Authorities forms, such as the P45, HMRCâs Application for Mercy and the National ID Card forms. I still chuckle at the P45 form, it perfectly resonates the insensitivity of management and how real people invariably end up in a horrible work place. For instance on the P45, there is a treated area to âPlace Employee teardrop onto treated stripâ and a tickbox area for why the employee left including the option, âTested positive for human Soul.â</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/P45-lawful-rebellion.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1162" title="P45-lawful-rebellion" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/P45-lawful-rebellion-211x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="300" /></a>The 2010 PDF edition of the book is just massive and the more I read it, the more I find myself finding things that previously only rattled my subconscious, coming to bear the 3rd time over. I love the way Ian takes the noodle out of what Britishness really is:</p>
<p>âIâm proud of everything British. To me, Britain is the smell of a two-stroke petrol mower, the orderly stripe of a lawn and the snout of a mole twitching nervously from its burrow, catching the last precious drops of dew on a late Spring morning before it is dispatched with one blow of a spade manufactured in Sheffield.â</p>
<p>It reminds me of people who donât really know anything about Britain and think we&#8217;re all members of Alice in Wonderland, riding on Pennyfarthings, drinking tea in the afternoon and all behaving like that twat actor out of that oh so British filmâ¦ thatâs it, Hugh Grant.</p>
<p>Something that stands out from the new PDF edition is that itâs stood the test of time because Ian quite cleverly saw where everything was going and satirised a lot of where the Government were about to crack down on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Magna Carta 2006, which he saw as the taking away of peopleâs right to a fair trial</li>
<li>An assessment gag about what kind of Serf you are definitely resonates with the Police advertising campaigns trying to get us to look inside each others bins and report our neighbours</li>
<li>Vaccines and the RFID chip conspiracy theory</li>
<li>A Timetable for Change which is something we heard alot from the people behind Obama and the Conservatives</li>
<li>Great Britain PLC and the relentless increase of new ways to rob people blind</li>
<li>Robbing of the elderly and their pensions</li>
<li>The economic crash; and much much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>As Ian said in the podcast,</p>
<p><em>âThe thing with the Government now is that now itâs all come to pass, thereâs nothing left to satirise, itâs all far too real today.â</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the more time passes, the more we see divid<a href="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/tax-revenue-lawful-rebellion.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1166" title="tax-revenue-lawful-rebellion" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/tax-revenue-lawful-rebellion-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300" /></a>es and differences of opinion shutting down all around us. Ian&#8217;s book is a reminder that Britain is actually an absolutely amazing Island with some of the most ancient history in the world, just down the road. And it is this modern human appetite for the âharmonisationâ of culture through Globalisation that&#8217;s killing all the eccentric traditions of British Culture.</p>
<p>This book is an absolute marvel and I cannot recommend it enough for a good chuckle to help put things into perspective that we are all still human and we all need to laugh and love to get alongâ¦ everythingâs all too serious now or is it just me?</p>
<p>I will leave you with one of my favourite excerpts of the PDF:</p>
<p><em>âYour forms lead an interesting life the moment they enter the system. A good example is your P45 â the form you receive after youâve pissed your job against a wall. While you worry about your mortgage and the scowling, unsymmetrical faces of staff at the local Jobcentrehassleplus, your P45 begins the kind of exotic journey only pre-packaged Oriental snacks can dream of. All P45 data is first inputted into an underground computer silo for processing, dispersal and retrieval. After sorting, the original is sent to Rangoon for I-Ching interpretation by accountants at the As Above, So Below Institute of Tax. After three full moons have elapsed, the original form is burnt in a sealed bell jar and the ashes collected for auditing and mass-spectrometry. The jar is broken against the hull of a ship bearing your tax data, which is then sailed into the Bermuda Triangle. The last five steps of the process have only ever been attained by computer modelling. You can find a fuller description of all these processes in the tax office leaflet âWhat the Fuck Have You Done With My Tax Records?â, which is freely available at your local office inside a large, erratically rotating jar of wasps.â</em></p>

<p>Iâm sitting here with the latest election babble in the background and itâs making me sick to my stomach listening to the utter rubbish coming out of the potential âleadersâ mouths. Itâs drilled into us night and day about the benefits of being a cog in the Corporate machine, yet the negative aspects which are slowly draining our humanity are driven deeper by everyone who accepts status and property on any level. It seems that the signing of the Treaty of Verona in 1213 that sealed this Islandâs fate, but there is much evidence that the worship of hierarchy has been going on since Sumerian times. What we call civilisation is nothing more than a plague on the human heart, out to fulfil the prophecy of a certain book, which coincidently uses content from the infamous Sumerian tablets dating back 15,000 years.</p>
<p>Iâm concerned about Lawful Rebellion being pigeonholed as being the study of 10s of 1000s of Acts, legislation, PDFs and books to âlawfullyâ fight the âSystemâ. Trust me when I say all the research, learning and experiments can end up taking over your life sometimes for the worse, which will need particular attention.Â The other thing is that I know people donât have much spare time. To spend it on something that could make you more stressed through finding out youâre getting buggered over more than you previously thought, can be the tipping point into a darkness that hurtles you into places you never thought youâd end up. I really donât blame the people who keep a low profile just keeping abreast of the developments of such a young movement, as reality from our perspectives is vivid to say the least. So this is the perfect opportunity for me to begin a process of opening Lawful Rebellion up to other possibilities of imagination and attempt to get more people involved who are looking for progression within the movement in other ways.</p>
<p>All of us who have gone through the Lawful Rebellion revolution know that itâs a viable means to a natural end of the System thatâs become a burden for all of us â even if some of you donât think youâre part of it, you are. Iâm not talking about revolution in the System or smoking out all the corruption, Iâm talking about no ruler of the many, no monarchy, no elite and NO rights to take the land away from nature. We must live on this earth how we need to in order to keep it&#8217;s beauty for all to share.</p>
<p>What Lawful Rebellion is doing is producing a glitch in the System by showing people how theyâve sleepwalked into the invisible shackles of corporate slavery. But unfortunately itâs happening to Lawful Rebellion. We are now seeing politically motivated groups take the sentiment of Lawful Rebellion and repackaging it as a new frequency of the political spectrum, which is dangerous if people start accepting it. This is something none of us want, as our collective voice will end up on a phoney ballot paper one day, as part of the Free Market economy. But this occurrence is the quintessential element to the Free Market and Democracy â The freedom to create anything you like and turn it into a commodity. Even if donât have any plans to turn your honest manifestation into a product of the Free Market, somebody else will if itâs good enough to steal. None of this will change unless we decide it needs to change.</p>
<p>Thomas from Deep Ecology has been exploring the different ways man has lived past and present and asserts that Tribalism is the natural way man lives even today, making the point that it&#8217;s a possible future for us. Luckily, even in the present corporate hierarchy itâs still completely impossible for the instincts of human nature to be erased from our collective consciousness. This is obviously where the money is on utilising media propaganda, corporations, schooling and institutions protected by a corrupt law system attempting to keep relative status quo and a stable hierarchy. I think we all have seen this System evolving at incredible speeds over the last 20 years. This is exactly why every year new ways to extract information from us are invented, the latest ones being Terrorism and Social Networks to gleam what you had for breakfast this morning.</p>
<p>Maybe whatâs beyond Lawful Rebellion is the prospect of us all merging from every single group in the world and setting up examples of how we can all co-exist together in a community void of hierarchy and domination. It is a fact that if every anti-EU group just in the East Anglia region got together during the EU elections, there would have been a majority of like-minded people. It is a fact that if we all at the same time said &#8216;NO&#8217; to any form of authority in Britain, there wouldn&#8217;t be any chance of the hierarchy maintaining their form of order without using force. You name, we can do it! But the problem is that most people, even if you&#8217;re broke, you&#8217;re broke because you&#8217;re attempting to maintain your lifestyle and comfort within this System. For this realistic exchange, the British are paying for it through being told what to do, how and when. But who likes being told what to do? It goes against human nature. We need to be free in manifesting our thoughts into experiences and sharing them with one another without judgement or fear of reprisal or there will always be unhappiness.</p>
<p>Who knows how everything will begin again, but thatâs what this podcast is all about, finding new ideas and connections!</p>
<p>Thanks again Thomas for your time!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/lawful-rebellion-john-harris.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1071" title="Fragments of British past, present and future" src="http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-content/uploads/lawful-rebellion-john-harris.jpg" alt="Fragments of British past, present and future" width="630" height="250" /></a><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/jenymtcw2kn/john-harris-david-opahlus-fragments-of-history.mp3" target="_blank">Download podcast here</a></p>
<p>You know the feeling when you think youâve pieced together another part of the truth, then along comes something new that opens up another chapter, just as you think youâve closed the last one? When does it end? Should it end? What is fulfilment? What is the real truth? Is there any truth? Who is telling the truth? For me researching the history of the British Isles is never-ending, as itâs been so well hidden! <a href="http://www.tpuc.org/" target="_blank">John Harris</a> and I talk about British History and try to cover some ground on the truth.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" src="http://www.deanread.net/weblog/images/hitchhikers_guide_heartofgold.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="191" />Douglas Adams explains in the book, Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy, how eons ago a hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional race of people built the most intelligent computer to answer,</p>
<p>âWhat is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everythingâ.</p>
<p>The computer answered, 42. This race of beings were furious at the answer and asked the computer to show how it came to the conclusion. The computer sulked and saidÂ theyâd have to wait 10 million years for it to answer that question! So it designed andÂ built Earth to collate the tangible data over the next 10 million years for the race to <img class="alignright" title="Vogons" src="http://www.class-tv.co.uk/the-hitchikers-guide-to-the-galaxy/imgs/vogon-constructor-fleets.png" alt="" width="242" height="194" />observe, proving the answer is actually 42. Doesnât this story reflect how little faith they had in themselves, even though they had perfect technology to answer even the most impossible questions of infinity?</p>
<p>Why is there such a struggle in finding the truth? Maybe the truth is as absurd as the number 42 or we are in fact the question and the answer? I think itâs how we reach the truth where we find the answers to life. Granted thereâs a definitive hindrance for some of us who are seeking particular parts of the truth out there through outside forces. But ultimately, itâs only when I looked at the melting pot of history, where the future becomes present, the present becomes the past, and the past becomes history. Suddenly I saw a pattern emerging of something rather sinister that has stifled our destiny to share the one universal truth, love. And there are some powerful forces at work, tricking minds, emotions and bodies, dictating external reality â making sure that everything material around us is the only truth.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Child Labour Great Britain" src="http://www.michellehenry.fr/childlabour.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="415" />At some stage in this cold externalised world, most settle and begin their life-long servitude to the System, avoiding all eye contact with the Establishment. Luckily for me, my parents always encouraged me to question everything or I may not be writing this memoir now. The moment I started School, I was labelled a rebel because the System and Establishment presented so many questions â it just didnât feel right being told what to think, how to think, what is right and wrong and who is in control of the World around me and beyond. And how Iâve made sense of schools is subjective, but I know my truth will resonate with many of you reading thisâ¦</p>
<p>If you look at written history, school rose from the smog of the Industrial Revolution in 1870 with the Education Act. Itâs said that National education was put into place to try and combat child slavery in the factories of Britain; and to reduce the amount of infections and disease causing death within the industrialised cities. Nothing has really changed today, except we are on the opposite polarity: A corporate regime called the National Curriculum starting on the programming of kids to be good âcitizensâ from 3 years old! The following extract is from the Department for Children, Schools and Families dictating what 3-5 years will be taught:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore, develop and represent learning experiences that help them make sense of the world</li>
<li>Practice and build up ideas, concepts and skills</li>
<li>Learn how to control impulses and understand the need for rules</li>
<li>Be alone, be alongside others, or cooperate as they talk or rehearse their feelings</li>
<li>Take risks and make mistakes</li>
<li>Think creatively and imaginatively</li>
<li>Communicate with others as they investigate or solve problems</li>
<li>Express fears or relive anxious experiences in controlled and safe situations</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright" title="I hate school!" src="http://astro.swarthmore.edu/~burns/images/hate_school.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="272" />Just with the information Iâve presented, itâs clear schools were invented for the âcitizensâ (economic slaves) who couldnât look after their kids because they were busy trying to earn enough to live. So whatâs changed today? NOTHING. Parents then as they do now continue to let the Establishment take over their lives through the invention of time and money and renaming them as Legal Guardians through the Birth Certificate. Itâs so clear how the corporate mindset becomes indoctrinated into kids now more than ever, yet itâs left undone by the majority of people.</p>
<p>Why do nursery-aged kids need to control impulses; understand the need for rules; rehearse their feelings; understand risk taking and relive anxious experiences? Simply because the very thing in which enslaved their great great grandparents in the 1800s, still exists today, just in a more subtle scientific form called âPsychologyâ â the enslavement of the mind, spellbound to the Establishmentâs rule of law.</p>
<p>So now I know the truth about schooling, I can look back and chuckle thinking of the time when I walked out of class telling Mrs Easton to âfuck offâ when she spouted,</p>
<p>âIf you donât get good grades, you wonât get anywhere in lifeâ.</p>
<p>I say, life IS what you make it and you cannot live out other peopleâs truth!</p>
<p>For me, the subjects surrounding Lawful Rebellion have opened up the World even further by illustrating more of what is real and illusionary. Freedom of expression and knowing that the Establishment is built on us is all the empowerment any of us need to stop the bombardment of bollox and finding the truth.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Don't mess with God" src="http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/badass4.jpg" alt="Don't mess with God" width="167" height="218" />Just on the off chance, has the answer to the ultimate question thatâs been pondered since the beginning of mankind been answered yet from my scribbling? Thought not, but hereâs an idea for youâ¦</p>
<p>Just imagine for a moment, the very âthingâ thatâs been the most prevalent in the last 5,000 years is the answer to fulfilment through its power to unite peoplesâ hearts. In knowing this truth, the corrupt few created an elaborate decoy in order to feed off endless energy, channelling it through hierarchal control of the mind and dominance of the body to the point of rupture, nearly causing Armageddon. Iâve not read the entire Bible, but isnât this little insight the most popular story of mankind, some even calling it prophecy? Maybe itâs because mankind has been playing the leading role of the plan to destroy the very thing needed to surviveâ¦ faith in mankind?</p>
<p>This podcast represents a big up-yours to the Establishment and the Church through Johnâs, mine and other peopleâs own research into how mankind has been destroying itself through this incredible decoy of knowledge and power throughout British history. John and I talk about some of the things that the Establishment and Church consider to be heresy, anarchy, rebellion, corruption, conspiracy, militia, secret, revolutionary and above all anti-social. We need more of this, as we know it really makes them anxious!</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>After we got to know Rob a little, we went into greater depth with him a few days later, which was a pleasantly informative experience. As Matt says in the podcast, Rob is simply a peaceful man who really knows who he is and where he needs to be.</p>
<p>There are many people out there who look to and accept external influence from the media, web and porn to fulfil their lives. And it is the casting of this spell, externalisation, where a few nutjobs have found power, greed and money, resulting in the procurement of the Westâs modern belief system. This is why figures like Michael Jackson, Beyonce, Tony Blair, David Koresh and much earlier Jesus Christ have always been manifested to peddle preconceived truths and instructions that misdirect the love and direction of mankind. So when we look at whatâs happening in the World, it makes sense to ask the question, if we are the ones who desire these manifestations, then is it actually us who pulls the strings? Rob says his first epiphany was when he realised,</p>
<p>âThe people who I thought were the enemy, were not my enemies, it was only in my heart. And once I got rid of my fear, anger and shame, they had no hold on me, as itâs only these feelings the people who seek to control can use on us all. Once we stop accepting the stimulus that harms, the healing begins. The catalyst for change is the friendships people find along their own paths.â</p>
<p>Rob agrees that Authorities have the upper hand with most people whilst the threat of taking possessions away exists, as most of us spend most of our energy and lives in the external. When more people can understand this truth, it will become common-sense to know why mortgages, loans and credit exist. So how have people over time let de-facto governments operate through threats and scaremongering? Who knows, maybe the excuse their end is that they continue to serve us and theyâre merely giving us what we want? Rob recited the metaphor,</p>
<p>âThe Nanny needs to appreciate that weâre responsible and that we wonât trail crap everywhere. A lot of people think that because we have a right to engage in an action, that itâs sometimes OK to engage in that action, this is what could lead to them treating you like a child.â</p>
<p>He is right, we as people have let Government not just be stewards of our Sovereignty, we have let them, through the most oppressive methods, take control of the most precise thing and the only defence we have to make things right, our hearts.</p>
<p>Rob firmly believes the Freeman Society is one of the remedies to taking the control away from the ignorant and powerful âthemâ. He indicates,</p>
<p>âThese psychopaths are way behind schedule and that âtheyâ didnât account for the rise of the web and now itâs working against them.â</p>
<p>One of the ways âtheyâ try to stop the flow of information across the web is to generate disinfo and admittedly all of us sometimes have difficulty in deciding what is the truth in this cold landscape. Robâs web philosophy is simply this: everything on the web is bollox until he looks into the subject matter himself and decides how it affects his heart.</p>
<p>One of the founding principles of the Freeman Society is the concept:</p>
<p>âOf that which exists in equity cannot latch onto what only exists in Law. And to drag it into equity to operate its equity rules onto it cannot be, if there has not been consent.â</p>
<p>Rob can confidently talk about his remarkable successes, through Claim of Right and Notices of Understanding and Intent. One thing stood out in his words, it pays to get to know the Authoritiesâ administration procedures better than they do, so youâre always one step ahead or at least on even ground.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Robâs Cunning Plan 2.0 and the World Freeman Congress is the manifestation of their vision. The plan is to get the Freeman Society established in Canada and then focus on Britain, Ireland and other places. And when the Freeman Society grows, Rob declares he wants to be surrounded by groupiesâ¦ so please email him for details. But most likely, heâll be doing just as he does now, helping others, chilling with his friends and having a lovely life within his Community. Robâs vision is a futuristic concept of people living together in harmony, much like Buckminster Fullerâs, Starship Earth and the Venus Project. Rob asserts;</p>
<p>âWe simply need land, protection of the land, peace officers, a resourceful bunch of shops, funky cabins people could rent and lots of different sustainable homes.â</p>
<p>But most importantly he says that there is a need for lots of people and families with real creative skills.</p>
<p>One of the most frequent questions asked by people is how to claim land as a Freeman. The Freemen will claim the land they choose by putting a Notice up on the Land and there has been a team appointed to get it right. So sit tight on how it goes, as it could end up being a blueprint for the rest of the World to use and starting building new communities. Another question on the tips of peoplesâ tongues is about how to travel around the world without a Passport. Rob describes a laissez-passer will work in most cases, but he says that a Country can refuse entry â They will be setting up their own laissez-passer working with other Countries. Rob admits travelling outside the Community will be one of their greatest hurdles, as they will need to not just make agreements with Canada but also other countries where they will want to visit in the future.</p>
<p>Some will say that Robâs concept has been unsuccessful in the past, perhaps attributed to and likely why there is alot of hardship in the world today, the fair flow of currency. The communityâs infrastructure will be funded using outside investment. But the Freemen will be establishing their own currency;</p>
<p>âEveryone who trades will have their own faces on the notes (probably IOUs); they will say how much work they will be doing in the following year and then they advance say $50,000 [of notes with their face on]. So that trader will have to pay back $50,000 to the Society with other peoplesâ faces on it. But you canât ask for more than you can monetise. If people donât manage to meet their goals, they have to pay back 10% interest on what they borrowed.â</p>
<p>Itâs a very bold plan to create not just a community, but also a micro-economy. Weâre 100% behind it because we need more people like Rob to show the difference it can make if respect and love is brought back into the equation of us living together! But if Rob defines his spiritual paradigm as chasing butterflies and making mud pies, then we hope heâs got a good team behind him! <img src='http://www.lawfulrebellion.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
