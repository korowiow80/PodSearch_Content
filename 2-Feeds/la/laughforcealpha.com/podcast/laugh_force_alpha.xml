        <description>In space, no one can hear you scream but can they hear you laugh? That's what the scientific community now intends to find out. Either that, or they want to be rid of a band of miscreants. Exiled to orbit the Moon in a decrepit space station, these cretins are tasked to research the Universal Origins of Comedy and transmit their findings back to Earth.</description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Something’s wrong.  There has been a significant decline in anger-based activity aboard the Fortress of Laughitude.  The crew hasn’t been this mellow since the time the runoff from Rainbow Sunflower’s hydroponics garden mixed with the drinking water.  Heck, D.I.E. hasn’t even locked you in the Depressurizer lately.  Not that you mind this, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to find out if this recent good behavior isn’t just to lull you into a false sense of security…</p>

<p>Note: As a holiday present to us, celebrities lent their voices!  No wait, that's a lie.  They were impersonated, as usual.</p>]]></description>
