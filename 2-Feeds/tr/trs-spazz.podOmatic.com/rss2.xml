      <title>THE ROCK SHOW - Vampires are taking over the world!!!!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1201542/600x600_4731176.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the words of the great Jerry Sienfeld, &quot;What's the deal with all these vampires?&quot;  Who are these vampires?

Vampires are everywhere!  No literally.....everywhere.  Some are scary, some cheesy, some are even sparkly.  What's up with all this love for the undead lately?  What does it say about the world?  Have we all lost our minds?  There are 4 different vampire series in the top ten of all books sold.

That and a gooey jump into &quot;The Nosh Pit&quot; 

Enjoy this older episode of The Rock show that never made the Podcast. (Simply because I never got around to it.)

      <title>The Rock Show - Civic Pride (Should we put a Robo Cop Statue in Detroit?)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1201542/600x600_4743967.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you just can't make this stuff up folks.

Mayor Dave Bing's plan for a New Detroit does not include a RoboCop statue.

In an attempt to engage the community, Bing and his communications team have been responding to queries on the mayor's official Twitter account.

Monday, one Twitter user humorously asked Bing to consider erecting a statue of RoboCop to recognize the city's relationship to to the 1987 sci-fi film.

&quot;Philadelphia has a statue of Rocky &amp; Robocop would kick Rocky's butt,&quot; one person tweeted &quot;He's a GREAT ambassador for Detroit.&quot;

Whether he was in on the joke or not, @mayordavebing responded: &quot;There are not any plans to erect a statue to Robocop. Thank you for the suggestion.&quot;

Local residents and fans of the film retweeted the exchange and now an organization has been set up to raise over $50,000 to build the statue without the city's official help.

How do you help your City? What instills pride in you in where you live? How has history made your hometown what it is today. Should be a fun one.

      <title>The &quot;Rock&quot; Show - The End of the World!!!!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1201542/600x600_4731176.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For centuries there have been people and organizations predicting the return of Jesus and the end of the world.  That tradition has continued even until now where we have well published groups that predicted that the world would end in May.

Long story short..... It didn't happen.   What is the facination with this topic?  Even when proven wrong the familyradio.org people still don't admit defeat, no they just change the date.  Then there's all the predictions that next year, &quot;2012&quot; will be the end.

We had something to say about this, so we did a show about it. Enjoy!

Slight warning:  JRock our original host joined us for this show.  He dropped a &quot;B&quot; word bomb on Mike.  It was just once.  It is what it is.</description>

      <title>The &quot;Rock&quot; Show - Would you vote for a woman for President?</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1201542/600x600_4731176.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world has changed tremendously over the last few decades.  America used to be a mostly male dominated society where men ruled business, and politics and women took care of the children and the house.

Women have made huge strides to change these opinions over the years.  One way this has changed is women's role in government.  There has been an increasing number of women who have run for President or vice President.  

The question remains, when you go into that voting booth, are you more likely to vote for a man or a woman?  Does it matter to you?  What are some of the questions we would have for a women candidate as opposed to her male competition?    A fun episode for sure with new members of the show James McCoy and Tiffanie &quot;Tifftastic&quot; Austin providing a female perspective.

      <title>Christians in Show business. What makes a Christian a Christian?</title>

Insane Clown Posse have this entire time secretly been evangelical Christians. They've only been pretending to be brutal and sadistic to trick their fans into believing in God.
uh.......ok?

Many people in Entertainment claim to be Christians. So when we see things from them that don't line up up with the Bible it can give us an occaision for pause. However, they are no different than us. Do our lives match up to what we proclaim as Christians? Do we dismiss our shortcomings because it's easier for us to conceal them?</description>
