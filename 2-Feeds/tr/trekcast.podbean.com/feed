This game is really the next generation of Star Trek (I had to do it) with an all new storyline as well as new characters ships and the ability to set your own course and explore the galaxy we all know and love.

<p>Then of course we also have our other great sections of  the show Subspace Signals, where David, Alicia, and myself answer all your burning Star Trek questions. We also have Trivia with Damon or D&#8217;Mun if your playing STO and an all new Hey Star Trek form our friend Jerad so check it all out and enjoy this latest episode of  Trekcast.</p>
<p>Once again I would also like to thank all of our listeners and subscribers for making Trekcast the number 1 Star Trek podcast we really appreciate all the donations and 5 star reviews on iTunes, and of course all your great emails. Also remember you can drop anyone of us an email with your thought via <a href="mailto:trekcast@gmail.com">trekcast@gmail.com</a>and you can also follow us on twitter, you can follow me @quarksbartender, David is @trekcast Jerad is @super_spock, and you can also follow Damon @DamonS23 and give him some trivia suggestions.</p>

<p>Hello Trekcasters and welcome to our 53rd episode of Trekcast the Star Trek podcast. Well the holidays are swiftly approaching so we thought we would try and spread some holiday cheer by giving all of you out there an early Christmas present this fine episode of Trekcast, so grab a glass of Eggnog or Raktajino whatever it is you enjoy, sit back and enjoy this weeks episode.</p>
<p>This week we have an episode full of contributions from some of our great listeners. Romulan Ale brings us up to date on the forums from his winter home on Ferenginar. Speaking of the Ferengi we also have a very special update from everyones favorite Nagus, no not Nog, ex Grand Nagus Zek he gives us his take on all things finance here in this century. We also have a fine Christmas tune composed by the guys over at <a href="http://s2.webstarts.com/babblingbrothers/" target="_blank">Babbling Brothers</a>. We&#8217;d also like to thank David Kleparek for that intro from Denise Crosby.</p>
<p>Then of course we move onto our topic which is a new one for Trekcast where we will be discussing some of our favorite characters from the Star Trek universe all about them what we like, dislike you name it. So we decided our first subject would be Lwaxana Troi as played by Majel Barrett-Roddenberry (one of my favorite Trek personalities).</p>

So we have chosen Duet as our first best episode of DS9, we do have lots of love for <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Tosk" target="_blank">Tosk</a> in Captive Pursuit but we felt this episode was a little stronger. Joining us for this episode of Trekcast and to help us out for Best of Trek is former Star Trek: The Experience cast member and Las Vegas&#8217;s Sci-Fi Examiner,  <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-14415-Las-Vegas-SciFi-Examiner" target="_blank">Kerstan Szczepanski</a>.</p>
<p>This episode of Trekcast is also followed by some more of the great audio Hey Star Trek presented by our blogger Jerad Formby, and his take on Captain Janeway and the starship Voyager (or was that Cowgirl Janeway).</p>

This week on Trekast its Spocktober Fest so kick back with a nice cold Romulan Ale, or Klingon Warnog or just grab whatever it is you humans enjoy while listening to Trekcast.</p>
<p>So of course you have probably noticed that we have combined the supplemental and the regular episodes into one super sized episode of Trekcast and now we are getting back to doing the Subspace Signals (emails) more regularly so enjoy our answers to your thoughts and questions. Also this week since it is close to Halloween we talk a bit about some comparisons between Star Trek aliens to modern Hollywood and literary monsters (I think the Borg are like zombies).</p>

<p>This weeks our friend Jerad joins us and if you haven&#8217;t already read Hey Star Trek its awesome get over there and read it now. This weeks topic we delve deeply into the world of Star Trek makeup where we discuss our favorite alien makeup and of course our favorite forehead of the week. If you would like to see some great videos of how to apply makeup by <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Michael_Westmore" target="_blank">Michael Westmore</a> check out Vernon Wilmers documentary <a href="http://vernonwilmervideo.blip.tv/file/2063390/" target="_blank">Star Trek: My Experience</a>, and Jerad even gives us the lowdown on how those aliens from the Star Trek: Experience applied there makeup as well.</p>

So some of you may have noticed we missed the regular episode last week well we just wanted to let everyone know we just took the weekend off to celebrate the 4th of July and have some fun with family, friends, and fellow Trekkies of course (I launched a couple Photon Torpedoes myself).
Thanks again for joining us for the Supplemental and remember keep sending us those Subspace Signals (emails) and Hailing Frequencies (Skype calls) we LOVE to hear what you guys think and want to discuss so keep on living, long, and prospering.</p>
