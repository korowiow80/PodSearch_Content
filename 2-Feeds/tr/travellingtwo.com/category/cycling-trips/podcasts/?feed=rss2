		<itunes:summary>A successful cargo ship voyage (no rough seas and a wonderful crew) brought us to Napier, New Zealand this morning.

There&#039;s so much to tell but as we get our thoughts together, here&#039;s our latest podcast.



It includes a few reflections on Australia, an interview with Chris Roach as he sets off on a huge bicycle trip. We also have a tip or two on how to travel by cargo ship... if you&#039;re tempted! It&#039;s far less stressful than airport travel, if our first experience is anything to go by.

We&#039;ve put some handy information on travelling by freighter in our Bike Touring Resources section.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>It&#039;s that time of year again, although it&#039;s hard to feel that Christmas spirit when there&#039;s no snow on the ground.

The Christmas lights are up and Santa is on every lawn here in Australia but for us, it just seems like April, when the weather is warming up, the grass is turning green and you realise you still haven&#039;t taken down the decorations!

Still, we did get into the swing of things in the last couple of days when we visited Andrew &amp; Joanne Hooker, two Aussies who have ridden their recumbent tricycles all around Australia and through North America. 

Here&#039;s their story, along with a quick update on what we&#039;re up to over the festive season. Merry Christmas everyone!</itunes:summary>

When we were on Langkawi Island, we met 43-year-old Alan Bate, a British cyclist who&#039;s planning to race around the world in 170 days. If he succeeds, Alan would beat the record recently set by Mark Beaumont.

Alan is hoping to start his trip in summer 2009 but first he&#039;s looking for a sponsor - not the easiest of tasks in the current financial climate. So, if anyone out there has $20,000 to spare, get in touch. Here&#039;s our interview with Alan, telling us about his dream to be the fastest man around the world on a bicycle.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>There&#039;s nothing like a rainy day to get a few things done. As the heavens opened, we realised cycling was going to be futile so instead we recorded our latest podcast. This time we share some of the highs and lows with you from our four months in Southeast Asia and a few tips for bike touring in the region. We also have two cycling stories from Adam, who we met in Bishkek. Adam, from Poland, was last spotted going up the Karakorum Highway with one gear so he&#039;s quite the adventurer! We think you&#039;ll enjoy hearing about his take on cycling in India and getting lost in Nepal.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>A few days ago we had the chance to take food to the kids living and working up at the Stung Meanchey garbage dump in Phnom Penh. They exist in appalling conditions, without access to enough food, money, medical care and so many other things most of us take for granted. The day we visited was a good day - the best the organisers had seen in quite some time - and we were still struck by the poverty, the flies, the smell and overall inhumane situation. This is a little bit of audio we recorded on that day to share with you.</itunes:summary>

This time we talk more about Central Asia - the amazing Lake Song Kol in Kyrgyzstan, our favourite and not-so-favourite parts of the region and what to bring. Plus we have an interview with Greg, a Hungarian cycling the Silk Road who made us a great vegetarian breakfast. And we tell you why it&#039;s important to know how to say &#039;I am a carrot&#039; in Russian.

		<itunes:summary>It&#039;s a whole new world. Just a few hours in a plane have zipped us away from remote Central Asia to lively Bangkok, where we&#039;re feasting on spicy Thai curries, power that stays on, water that&#039;s always running and truly high speed internet for the first time in months. At first we felt strange boarding the plane but, now that we&#039;re here, we&#039;ve no doubt that it was a good choice. After so long fighting red tape we were feeling a little worn down and Southeast Asia seems the perfect antidote.

Our good mood has been helped to no end by a flight that went smoother than we dared hope. Full marks to Air Astana, who only charged a modest fee for our 35kg of extra luggage. On the other side, we were astonished to see all our bags and both bikes in perfect condition as we emerged from immigration. When we lived in London it seemed every trip ended with an interminable delay before our bags appeared. We&#039;d forgotten airports could be so efficient.

A quick ride into the city centre by taxi (no point trying to brave public transport when you&#039;re as loaded down as we are) and we arrived at the home of Michael, a welcoming American we&#039;d met in Tashkent just a few weeks earlier. We&#039;re going to stay in his flat for a week or so, trading cat-sitting duties for a pad in Bangkok while we get our bikes fixed up and buy a few things for the next leg of the journey.

We&#039;ve done very little research on this part of the world but our inclinations are to head north from here, along the Burmese border, through at least two of Thailand&#039;s national parks and past some stunning waterfalls. It should be a good introduction to our first cycle trip in the tropics.

While you&#039;re waiting for us to start pedalling again, why not listen to our latest podcast. We put it together just a few days before leaving Bishkek and it features an interview with David Berghof, the owner of the Stantours travel agency. We&#039;ve used them a few times and always had great service. David has a wealth of information about Central Asia so his thoughts are a good starting point if you&#039;re considering a trip to the region.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>They tell us Samarqand is a beautiful city but it&#039;s pouring rain outside and how can you see all the ancient buildings when the heavens are open and water is falling from the skies with full force? There was nothing for it but to do a bit of spring cleaning instead and for us this meant digging out all those things we&#039;ve wanted to share with you but haven&#039;t. Why haven&#039;t we? Well, you know, it&#039;s complicated. So much to do on a world bicycle tour, so little time! Anyway, finally we found the time and here you are, a spring present from us.

Our interview with six German fellows (correction: five Germans and one Lebanese, listen to the show and you may understand) who we met carrying guitars at the Iranian-Turkmenistan border. They&#039;re hitching to Mongolia and singing along the way and they were kind enough to sing a song for us.

And as a bonus, take a look at the site of Michel, a French guy who&#039;s staying in our hotel in Samarqand. He&#039;s going around the world on a recumbent tricycle and his motto is one we can really identify with: don&#039;t dream about your life, live your dream.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Our first few days in Istanbul have been spent in a flurried rush between consulates, trying to organise visas for Iran, Syria and Pakistan. Photocopies, bank payments, letters of invitation, plastic sleeves for all the documents. It is an amazing array of paperwork that we have gone through and the difference in accomodation is fascinating. Britain sits in a grand mansion behind high spiked gates. Canada has a cozy flat on a trendy shopping street with fluffy white cats to greet you at the door. Syria&#039;s tiny office would almost fit in the average broom closet.

From the above paragraph, you may have already deduced our planned route for the next few months -- rather different than the result you suggested when we put a poll up on the site. You wanted us to go via Georgia, Armenia and the &#039;stans into China but the thought of going so far north in the winter... well, brrrrrrr. We have opted instead for the slightly warmer route but may take in a few of the &#039;stans in the late spring.

Now that we&#039;ve updated you on our route, we hope you&#039;ll be happy to know that between the consular shuffle, we worked our way down to the water&#039;s edge off the famous Golden Horn and recorded a radio show for you. This time it features a few thoughts on Istanbul -- mostly about eating well in the city -- our best ever bicycle horn and an interview with Peter and Marj, two Aussies we met on the road in Germany. Enjoy!</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>It&#039;s August and we are with the rest of Italy, sunning ourselves by the Adriatic Sea. The beaches here are beautiful; teal green water set against dark blue skies with hardly a cloud in sight. The other night we waded into the water and recorded our latest radio show, with just a few thoughts on our time in Italy as well as an interview with Marco and Manon, a Dutch couple we met in Bolzano. 



They were touring with their dog, a cute little beagle called Hunter. If you ever thought your panniers were too heavy, try carrying dog food for two weeks on top of all your regular gear! We&#039;ll let them tell the story....</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>After a long break, it&#039;s finally time for another radio show! This time we talk about our first few days in Slovenia (what a wonderful country, so many waterfalls and stunning rivers!!) and also feature an interview with Andrew and Eider, a couple we met in a French campground. They share tales and advice from their overland tour from Australia to Spain, not on bicycle but very interesting all the same, especially since they collected stories from locals as they travelled in a project that got funding and support from the UN. You can read more about Andrew and Eider&#039;s project Environmental Memoirs, and also take a look at their personal blog, which features some stories from their travels.</itunes:summary>
