Celebrate Right With World VideoEVAL 320 X 240
Here are my favorite insights from the film:
When you believe it, you’ll see it.
Get lost in the best you have to offer.
Hold a vision that fills you with energy,
gives you the courage to soar.
Celebrating what’s right with the world
gives you the energy to fix what’s wrong.”
Dewitt Jones, Photographer-Philosopher,
expresses in words and in his National Geographic photographs
the positive optimism we need to be a love magnet
and create great relationships.
Dewitt Jones is now an honorary Love Guide
for the positive, optimistic Tribe Of Blondes.
If you’d like to learn more about Dewitt Jones or find out how to participate in his trainings, please contact Richard Gaynor at Richard@starthrower.com or 866.236.3050
Love deeply and live your dreams now,
Hadley Finch

	<itunes:summary>Love at first sight or a powerful attraction might draw you to a potential love match. Yet that’s no guarantee you have what it takes to create a happy relationship with lasting love.
Before you commit to forever, take this Dating Chemistry Test to find out if you are compatible for long-term happiness as a couple.
Do you–
* Offer mutual support in who you are now, so that you can bring out the best in each other?
* See each other with your heart instead of through critical eyes, so that you maintain positive views of your partner?
* Embrace change as a catalyst for growth as a couple and as individuals when you learn the love lesson in each challenge?
* Maintain positive friendships outside of your primary relationship, and feel excited to meet new people?
* Trust your partner to act in the best interest of the relationship as you each take full responsibility for your happiness and stability?
* Seek mutual agreement in important decisions like managing finances and resolving conflict, and take a pass on choices that divide you?
* Enjoy sexual chemistry and make time for sex at least twice a week, which is how you benefit from sexual healing?
* Nurture intimacy in body, mind, emotions and in the spiritual realm, as you speak your truth with kind-hearted honesty?
* Treat each other with loving kindness in your actions, words and thoughts?
* Connect as a team to a greater cause, like raising a family, growing a business, solving community or world issues, so that petty annoyances seem less important?
How did you score?
If you answered YES to every question, then you and your partner could be Love Guides for other couples who hope to experience the enduring ecstasy of a passionate, committed relationship.
What if you answered NO to one or more of these questions?
You now know how you can improve your relationship by turning each NO into YES. This requires the dedicated efforts of both partners. If that’s not an option, then it might be time to get a relationship coach or move out of this relationship so that you honorably free yourself to meet a more compatible love match.
I encourage you and your partner to discuss each question on this Love Test and then use these smart Love Tips to enrich your relationship.
Or use this Love Test as a dating guide that leads you to your most compatible love match and helps you build a great relationship together.
And I’d like to give you the success tools you need to affair-proof your relationship and build better relationships with family, friends, clients, co-workers when you begin your exciting program at GreaterSuccessAndLove.com
Love deeply and live your dreams now,
Hadley Finch

	<itunes:summary>Are you involved in more than one sexual relationship at the same time? Discover the causes and risks of overlapping sexual relationships, and learn ways to step off the slippery slope for solid emotional ground.
See if you recognize your motives for overlapping sexual relationships in this Love Test:
Are you testing the viability of a new relationship before you leave the old one?
Are you dreading a painful break up?
Are you unwilling to be monogamous?
Do you feel vows or boundaries don’t apply to you?
Are you unwilling to deprive yourself of sexual novelty?
Are you placing your needs and desires ahead of your partners?
Are you afraid of being single and alone?
Are you unhappy and unsure of what you want or need in a relationship?
Are you driven by reasons you don’t understand and only a 12-step program or therapist could uncover?
How did you score?
If you answered yes to one or more of these questions, then you understand your motives in having sex with multiple partners concurrently. The question is whether you’d like to change that?
If you feel comfortable with your behavior and feel no need to change it or you don’t mind hiding it from your sexual partners, there’s no need to apply the love tips you’re about to discover.
If you feel concerned by this sexual behavior, you may want to weigh the risks of continuing it against the rewards of stopping.
What are the risks of being in two or more sexual relationships at once?
* Medical studies indicate that adolescents and adults of all ages who engage in sequential or concurrent sexual relationships have a significantly greater risk for Sexually Transmitted Diseases “STD’s” over and above the number of sexual partners.
This means that when you have sex with one person, it is akin to having sex with every one of their past or current sexual partners–in terms of your exposure to STD’s.
* You cause pain and risk the wrath of your current partner who inevitably finds out about your betrayal with other sexual partners.
* If you entered a committed relationship and vowed to be faithful at one time, you no longer are aligned with your values or vows while you are involved in other sexual relationships. Your resulting guilt or loss of honor whittles away your well being on many unseen levels.
* If you started a dating friendship that hasn’t grown into a sexual relationship yet, you may notice how other sexual affairs steal power and focus and prevent you from developing strong emotional bonds with any partner.
How do you step off that slippery slope of overlapping relationships for solid emotional ground?
- In physics, the dominant vibration wins. So rev up your best qualities.
- Strengthen your strengths so any weaknesses lose importance.
- Keep no secrets. If you are unwilling to practice monogamy, be honest and clear about this from now on.
- Either choose partners who accept your behavior, or ease the pain of your break up with a partner who will not tolerate or enable it.
- Make a commitment to love with honor and integrity in all of your relationships, including the one you have with yourself.

	<itunes:summary>Uncontrolled anger ruins many relationships. In challenging times, we  can feel stressed, angry and ready to blow like a pressure cooker.  Frequent angry conflicts can destroy respect and relationships at work  and home. People who manage anger well have better relationships, better  health and greater success in life than people who lose control of  anger.
Occasional angry blowups are normal in any relationship.  A healthy choice is to see them as a wake-up call to find the win-win remedy for an irritation.
If uncontrolled anger is ruining your relationships, you can learn to  manage anger and keep love alive.  Learn how to disarm the causes of anger and use 8 tools of anger control, as explained in this summary of Hadley Finch’s radio discussion with Dr. Anthony Fiore, a top anger control coach.
Why is it important to understand the cause of our anger?
Understanding the cause of anger can help you control it. People  often express anger for three reasons:
When they don’t get what they want
When they aren’t being heard or validated
When they feel disconnected and want to be closer in a relationship.
Is anger ever an effective communication tool?
The more anger you vent, the more you drive someone away. So anger  doesn’t help you get what you want unless it’s handled correctly by  anger venters, and also by anger stuffers who pretend they’re not angry  when they are angry deep inside.
If you feel you’re beyond anger because your partner is lesser than  you or you’ve given up trying to solve the anger problem, this is an  attitude of contempt. It’s the death blow of most relationships and the greatest predictor of divorce.
If you want to save a relationship and keep love alive, it is  essential to learn how to deal effectively with troubling issues as they  arise by practicing–
8 Tools To Control Anger and Keep Love Alive
1. Reduce stress in your life and in your relationship
When you’re stressed, you can react irrationally. Identify the issues  that cause stress and either avoid or resolve them. If caffeine revs up stress, you may have to give it up or switch to decaf. If anger boils up when your defenses are down under the influence of alcohol, then don’t do alcohol and conflict resolution at the same time.
2. Develop empathy for the other person
See through their eyes, walk in their shoes, think their thoughts, so  you understand what makes them angry. These insights will help you  resolve or avoid the anger triggers.
3. Respond instead of react
We react when we do things automatically with the certain triggers,  like a knee jerk reaction. Even though this doesn’t bring us the results  we want, we keep repeating the behavior.
We respond when we choose behaviors that lead to positive outcomes.  You can respond in new ways that decrease the probability that you’ll  trigger an angry reaction from your partner.
4. Change your self talk
It’s not as much about what someone did, as what we tell ourselves  about what they did that triggers our anger. You can retrain your self  talk about what you think of someone’s behavior to change your emotional  reaction to it.
Many times you over-react to things because of your previous life  experience or baggage. Once you’re aware of your negative self talk, you  can replace it with positives that lead to forward progress.
5. Assertive communication
Let someone know where you stand on an issue and set your boundaries  without offending them.
Speak calmly from your heart to their heart, so it isn’t experienced  as hostile criticism. Understand that you can’t change another person.  You only can change your reaction to behavior or character traits that  irritate you. When you start to change, you often pull different,  improved behavior from your partner.
6. Adjust your expectations
Anger is often generated not by what happened but because what  happened is so different from what you expected. It’s not that you  [...]</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>Dating Question:
In the past year, I’ve had two relationships with women I met on-line. Both women tried to dominate and outperform me in every aspect of life. They each asked me to loan them large sums of money. I told them to get lost and they did.
I know that single women want a subservient relationship where a man shoves money down her throat, caters to her every whim, and then he’s disposable like garbage. I’m sorry if I generalize here, but it is the truth.
I do not think women find men as necessary. Is there a woman in this town who wants a real man anymore?
Feeling neutralized in L.A.
Dating Answer:
So sorry you’re feeling neutralized by dating two gold rush girls in a row. When a date asks you to be their banker, it’s time to say, “Next”, with your wallet intact. You were smart to move on before you got emotionally involved.
Do you think it is wise to generalize about all women based on your experience with two women? Or is this is a sure-fire way to sabotage each future relationship?
You may discover the answer in a motto of our online community, which is inspired by the law of attraction:
“What you see will be.”
Do you see how you could be choosing the same type of woman to date again and again?
Or do you believe that each new date will treat you the same as a past relationship?
If you believe your past will become your future, you look for clues of bad (or good) things to come and you see failure (or success) before you ever get started in a relationship. In your case, if you paint the same negative portrait on each woman you meet, you stifle their freedom to be unique. And you destroy your own seeds of joy.
Fortunately, there is an antidote: If you don’t like the way you see women, you can choose to see them with new eyes.
Will you allow yourself to see how each woman’s behavior is different from a past relationship?
If like attracts like, will you lead with your best qualities so you attract a woman who values and shares these qualities?
Will you give a woman the chance to love you the way you desire and deserve to be loved?
If you change the way you see women, you will change your experience with women. And you will attract a woman who brings the wonderful qualities you’re looking for into your relationship.
And if you’d like to meet positive, commitment-minded singles, I invite you to enjoy a free membership in our social network and travel club. No more blind dates, since you meet in cozy video chats or in cooking school in Italy or while volunteering at a wild bear preserve in Northern Minnesota.

Love deeply and live your dreams now,

	<itunes:summary>Spring is the season for a rebirth of love and romance. You can rejuvenate your sex life and indulge your sexual fantasies all year long with a erotic secrets you’ll learn in my interview with Jeanne Ainslie, a best-selling erotica author whose new novel is titled, A Country Girl.
“Erotica gives women permission to indulge their sexual fantasies without guilt,” says Ainslie. She encourages women to read erotica in the presence of their mate because it breaks through emotional barriers and increases intimacy in your relationship.
Most erotica was written by men using a woman’s pen name. Jeanne Ainslie proudly writes under her real name from the point of view of a woman. Her erotic scenarios are inspired by her real-life fantasies, by her real crushes, and by her experiences being married to a doctor for many years in Vancouver.
Jeanne’s erotica is filled with romance, seduction, the intense longing for a lover and the deep intimate connection you create together. There are erotic scenes every few pages in Jeanne’s novel which give readers ideas how to explore your sexuality and keep your intimate relationship fresh and exciting.
Would you like Jeanne’s simple recipe for hot sex?
Blend together her top 5 ingredients which are an acronym for BLISS:
Baggage–drop your ties to past relationships so you are emotionally free to move forward with a new lover
Love–romantic love combined with sex is more powerful and hot than sex without love
Intimacy–great communication is essential, breaking down walls, fears, insecurities to take a risk with your heart
Sex–be adventurous, be open to sex toys, massage, role playing and create fun surprises for your partner often
Satisfaction–take time to savor whole-body sensuality of loving touch and kissing which produce endorphins that are 200 times more powerful than morphine
Want to discover the naughty treat that every man wants?
Look your lover in the eyes and place the pleasure focus on them by asking, “What can I do to make you feel good?”
Then listen to their request and fulfill it. You are offering yourself as a treat by sharing fantasies and sexual adventures with someone you trust.
What erotic exercise gets women in shape and increases sexual desire?
Belly dancing is an empowering exercise that helps women reclaim their sensuality. It’s another whole-body expression of your sexual power that will spark desire in you and your partner.
Ideally, you’ve learned a few new ways to create a blissful intimate relationship. Will you use these Love Tips to transform spring fever into hot sex tonight?
