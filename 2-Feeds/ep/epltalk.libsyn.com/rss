            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Stadium lights, flash lights, street lights, shiny lights. All of the lights in Warsaw are on and shining towards the stadium. Beautifully lit on any night after 9.30, the stadium will advertise the score and critical points in the game for all to see outside whilst the inside will be going crazy for the national team.</p>
<p class="p2">On this pod: Laurence steps out at night, Kristan picks a fight and Morgan gets it right. The pod look at Rio and Roy yet again; European transfers seem to be hotting up as players who aren't involved in the tournament get on with their lives; and Mario makes more headlines, but the pod think it's for the right reasons.</p>
<p class="p2">Managerial changes are still going on, so what's the deal? How much does it impact a team to lose their manager at this point?</p>

			<title>Euro 2012 Daily: Friendly Fire (EPL Talk Podcast)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/euro-2012-daily-friendly-fire-epl-talk-podcast]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There were some impressive 'friendly' results as we build up towards the tournament. So it's time to evaluate and report for the podcast. England's performance seemed to reinforce some of the conclusions that we've already made about England, elsewhere: no so much.</p>
<p class="p2">We discuss Paul Lambert, why people move around at times like this and which player follow (if they can.) Does it upset you or make you excited for next season? Is there a 'right time' to move on from any club? How many managers find it?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Group D is one of the most fascinating, from an English perspective. For the French it is a new start and a chance to prove themselves. Sweden have nothing to prove as a team, but as individuals they surround Ibra and make a lovely supply line.</p>
<p class="p2">Ukraine have a wonderful technical side and without a qualifying record it looks difficult to assess their chances, apart form the wonderful league form of many their players.</p>
<p class="p2">There is an extended section on England and Roy Hodgson, how well will they do at this tournament with no expectation on them? Kris and Kartik break it down as Morgan and Matt provide context. What do you think Group D will do?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It doesn't get much better than this. Period. Big names, big sides and under-dogs; well mixed in together and all with a point to prove. The difficulty for Group C is that they have been pitted against each other, so in that mix, what does it mean for each side?</p>
<p class="p2">Spain still remain the team to beat. That scalp may make them even more motivated to win in this tournament, but now they have proven themselves at two tournaments in a row it doesn't look like they want to slow down. Italy will be looking to stop that as will a motivated Croatia. Can Ireland shock the tournament and use their Lippi-element to take it to the Spanish?</p>
<p class="p2">The surprise factor lies with this group and that is what makes it so compelling. Shock Spain? Crush Croatia. Immunise Italy or rubbish the Rep.? Who can make it through in this group?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When it comes to Group B, we are in for a treat. History, heritage and 'hate' &ndash; of sorts. So how will the football be played? How much does that change for the new generations who are making their own narrative in this tournament?</p>
<p class="p2">With Germany, Holland, Denmark and Portugal mixing up the style and approach to football it is a clash of approach and style for Euro Talk as we look at the background and entry from each club. Super-stars from across Europe only line this group as the grit and determination of each side comes out.</p>
<p class="p2">Do you fancy anyone from this group? Could it really be that Denmark will get through with some draws and a 'surprise'? As squads are released and players make their bid to play in the tournament, how important is every person in the 23 man squad?</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[When it comes to Group B, we are in for a treat. History, heritage and 'hate' &ndash; of sorts. So how will the football be played? How much does that change for the new generations who are making their own narrative in this tournament?
With Germany, Holland, Denmark and Portugal mixing up the style and approach to football it is a clash of approach and style for Euro Talk as we look at the background and entry from each club. Super-stars from across Europe only line this group as the grit and determination of each side comes out.
Do you fancy anyone from this group? Could it really be that Denmark will get through with some draws and a 'surprise'? As squads are released and players make their bid to play in the tournament, how important is every person in the 23 man squad?

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It takes some time to review the season. So much to fit into one pod, which is why this podcast is almost the length of two EPL Talk podcasts&hellip;but worth the time and effort as the regular podders take on morality, money, moronic tweets and missing empty nets. Really?</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, looking back can be difficult so we look forward to more seasons and managers as sackings, cups and players move around europe. Kartik broadcasts from Florida where Roberto Martinez decided to 'divert' his 'holiday'. Coincidence&hellip;</p>
<p class="p2">City, United and Chelsea all get the analysis of our pod and Arsenal are praised for their positivity, Wenger's fore-sight paying off again. But teams just below that embarrassed themselves: Liverpool being the main candidate for humiliation: or are they? We look at how they can move forward.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, many teams are praised for their changing structure, player roster and mentality. Newcastle do well in these stakes, can they go on and build from here or is this season so anticipation one which sets them up for Bolton's destiny?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Manchester City win the title. Beating out Manchester United on goal difference. Sir Alex was gracious in defeat which Roberto seemed to be in dreamland. Manchester celebrates as neutrals ponder who to hate next season&hellip;either way City have caused a new kind of upset. The likely upset. And in such fashion.</p>
<p class="p2">To contrast their emotion: Bolton are relegated after making themselves so consistent in the league. Owen Coyle must be wondering what he did so wrong. Joey Barton won't sympathise, he doesn't sound capable, though maybe that is what makes it so frustrating: we know he knows better.</p>
<p class="p2">Overall, a wonderful season in the league. Stories from all sides of the table. As we look back, I hope you look forward. Plenty more to come from EPL Talk this season.</p>
<p class="p2">It doesn't get much more clear cut than the Premier League table at the end of the season. But that doesn't tell half the story. Let us know yours. Join our Twitter conversation:</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/probably-two-happy-robertos-epl-talk-review-podcast]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A weekend of literal and narrative cup finals for north and south. Though it was interesting to see where they took place. Liverpool visited London whilst United hosted and City went to "The Shore". All results lead to dejection and jubilance. Overall, London comes away as the happier City. So, what about the clubs left with defeat to ponder.</p>
<p class="p1">The pod takes a look at how defeat can shape a team and sum up a season so well. Section One focuses on Manchester whilst Two follows the agitation and adulation of a Wembley final. Both times, Roberto was the happier man both times. Scots left to consider the less obvious misgivings.</p>
<p class="p1">And of course there was relegation to consider. Are Aston Villa above the fight now? Did Cisse's heroics do it for QPR? It all builds up to a great final weekend. Join the Twitter conversation:</p>

<p class="p1">Manchester is United as a City by their title hopes, but divided when it comes to where the trophy will finish up. As United draw, City win and suddenly the Etihad has never looked so enticing. Next Monday there will be a raw of approval from both sets of fans as blue and red take to the pitch.</p>
<p class="p1">The second section is full of mediocrity and sadness, sugar-coated with Newcastle United and their lovely form. Kristan evaluates their 'Top 4' chances and The Gaffer looks into the lower half of the table.</p>
<p class="p1">Chelsea is section 3, how could we make it anything else? We assess their Arsenal clash and how they will do in Europe. Barcelona are formidable on paper and about as resilient as paper on current form. But their wider quality and pedigree for winning makes them outstanding favourites for this tie.

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The FA Cup final has two teams. It meant that thousands of people were left disappointed this weekend, as Chelsea and Liverpool progress to Wembley on the 5th of May. David Moyes and Harry Redknapp rue their missed chances, whilst an old cup competition rivalry is rekindled.</p>
<p class="p1">The league ran a reduced schedule, but still impressed with quality at both ends of the pitch, goalkeepers taking centre stage and midfielders showing their range. It doesn't stop Manchester from dominating the top of the league though: both City and United won which keeps the gap at 5 points and the title race ajar.</p>
<p class="p1">JFT96 is also particularly prevalent this weekend as the Hillsborough Service was held at Anfield to remember the 96 who lost their lives 23 years ago. We pay tribute, through the podcast. Our thoughts are with the friends and families.</p>
<p class="p1">There were controversial decisions to be made by the referees, not all went the right way. Should we be questioning referees more? Or do they have enough pressure already? Tweet along with the tweet along with the podcast and give us your views for the next show:</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[So much can happen in so little time. Between the weekend and Thursday: United have put one hand on the title and Chelsea have secured a two-legged tie against their bitter UCL rivals Barc&eacute;. Both teams in a confident mood, but how will that change the weekend's football.
The pod deconstructs the goings on and mid-week news as the four podders try to make sense of Pennant on Twitter, Pulis on Social-Networking and Liverpool on&hellip;anything right now.
There is a preview of the big game at the weekend between Arsenal and Man City. Tactics, tribalism and insight. Join the conversation. Tweet along with the tweet along with the podcast and give us your views for the next show.

<p class="p1">Anyway, in between all of the EPL action the SPL is suffering, Kartik joins the pod for one section to dissect the coming clashes in the Europa League and the fun of non-UCL competition. What can be achieved when the pressure is off?</p>
<p class="p1">Along with that, the FA Cup have 9 EPL teams still in there. Could it be an all EPL round of eight or will someone upset the applecart? With an easy route into Europe, the teams competing for fourth will have to look at their priorities and act fast to book their place next season. Liverpool lead the queue. Don't they?

			<title>What the? (EPL Talk Preview Podcast)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/what-the-epl-talk-preview-podcast-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">An incredible week in 'Football News' means that not much has happened on the pitch. Liverpool and Spurs played out a 0 &ndash; 0 whilst a cat became the highlight of Twitter on the night. On the news: Fabio gone and Harry should be in, but when and to what end? The pod discusses.</p>
<p class="p1">The money in the game keeps swirling around as Barc&eacute; and Real gain more monetarial ground in the international stakes. Does anyone care? Possibly about as much as we care for Mertesacker and his winter break...</p>
<p class="p1">Our featured match this week is Manchester United vs. Liverpool. Old Trafford will greet the Anfield Collective with a hostile welcome whilst Kenny swaddles Luis Suarez in praise and ambiguous comments. How will it change what happens on the pitch? Will there be a handshake? Will there be a moment of redemption for either player?</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/under-qualified-and-over-exposed-epl-talk-preview-podcast-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Manchester manage the double over London sides, but have they assured their place at the top of the tree with such assured performances? Both Spurs and Arsenal gave good accounts of themselves, but in very different ways. We assess the angles and angst felt in London whilst Manchester looks forward to another title.</p>
<p class="p1">Liverpool and Chelsea were also shaken, with poor away performances to opposition that both sides would expect to beat. Is that the problem?</p>
<p class="p1">The Midlands also experienced an epic derby and Everton garnered a disappointing point. Newcastle were soundly beaten out of London and Sunderland continued their impressive run, so much has changed in just a month.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Manchester manage the double over London sides, but have they assured their place at the top of the tree with such assured performances? Both Spurs and Arsenal gave good accounts of themselves, but in very different ways. We assess the angles and angst felt in London whilst Manchester looks forward to another title.
Liverpool and Chelsea were also shaken, with poor away performances to opposition that both sides would expect to beat. Is that the problem?
The Midlands also experienced an epic derby and Everton garnered a disappointing point. Newcastle were soundly beaten out of London and Sunderland continued their impressive run, so much has changed in just a month.

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Super Sunday comes but once/twice/thrice/quaice (delete as applicable) a season. So when it does come around we are all used to being very excited by it. But often it can let you down. Well, not this year &ndash;&nbsp;we're all interested in the intricate narrative which weaves itself throughout the season. Slicing through City and United.</p>
<p class="p1">Two teams challenging for the top: London clubs. Spurs and Arsenal. They are the pretenders to the Champion's throne as Manchester looks to retain it, as long as they can annoy the neighbours. Well, it is possible that parties in both London and Manchester will be happy this weekend if the results go the right way.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course we also review the latest transfer rumours; look at City in the league and QPR in the Cup. Beckham hits Google+ and 'Britain' in the Olympics. The rest of the league is also reviewed and renewed.</p>
<p class="p3">The league needs there to be wins in the top of the table clashes, so who do you think should win and why? Tweet along with the podcast and give us your views for the next show:</p>

<p class="p1">Apart from the news, the football has been excellent, delivering drama and class in equal amounts. We bring that together in section two as Kartik and Kristan get the opportunity to analyse all nine of the games. Annoyingly, it has almost become normal that Manchester rules the roost, so we take a look at the class and cheers being spread around the league.</p>
<p class="p1">Section three previews Spurs v. Chelsea, a huge derby in the context and a headache for both managers as they try to impose their will on the top four. With injuries in key positions for Harry and a selection headache for AVB who will be 3rd on Christmas day?</p>
<p class="p1">We also encourage you to listen to Richard Farley's audio documentary for EPL Talk. It is a little Christmas present from the Gaffer. Go to EPLTalk.com for the audio series.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The pod is small this week. We take time to look at Sunderland and their Brucelessness; Liverpool and their Luclessness; and the Carling Cup with it's significance. Cup competitions are a nice punctuation to a season, but what more can it do to boost an ego?</p>
<p class="p1">We dress this around the basis that the human side of sport is what makes it one of the most endearing sports when it comes to narrative, often without trying to be.</p>
<p class="p1">Looking forward to next weekend, what do you think is the most significant match? Whilst there are no stand out ties for a "Super-Sunday" it does seem that some teams are desperate to revive their waining season, a step which could be vital before the christmas glut of games. Sorting the boys from the babies: Jesse Chula and Kristan Heneage.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The pod is small this week. We take time to look at Sunderland and their Brucelessness; Liverpool and their Luclessness; and the Carling Cup with it's significance. Cup competitions are a nice punctuation to a season, but what more can it do to boost an ego?
We dress this around the basis that the human side of sport is what makes it one of the most endearing sports when it comes to narrative, often without trying to be.
Looking forward to next weekend, what do you think is the most significant match? Whilst there are no stand out ties for a "Super-Sunday" it does seem that some teams are desperate to revive their waining season, a step which could be vital before the christmas glut of games. Sorting the boys from the babies: Jesse Chula and Kristan Heneage.

			<title>Tribute to Gary Speed (EPL Talk Review) </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/tribute-to-gary-speed-epl-talk-review-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This EPL Talk podcast is in tribute and includes a tribute to Gary Speed, passing at the age of 42 most regard this as a tragedy in football and on a personal level. Many in and outside of the press were shocked and saddened by the news which broke on Sunday morning. We regard this as a time to mourn and celebrate Gary for his achievements and memories. Our thoughts are with his friends and family.</p>
<p class="p1">As mentioned in the podcast, here is the Craig Bellamy interview, in which he pays tribute to Gary Speed just a few months ago: http://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/epl-talk-soccer/id135061239#</p>
<p class="p1">In this weeks pod we also review the action, starting at Anfield where Roberto met Kenny and Liverpool "dominated" but looked lucky to come away with all eleven men and one point. Super Mario strikes again, but not in a good way&hellip;</p>
<p class="p1">What is wrong with United? Sir Alex can't say, but he can continue to fume about the penalty which gave Alan "Par-du" and his team a draw at Old Trafford.</p>
<p class="p1">And of course, we look around the rest of the action in the English Premier League.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Arsenal have turned it around! They are the only English club who consider this week a successful folly into the clouds of Europe. United and City both underwhelmed whilst Chelsea were nothing short of dumbfounding in their lack of cohesion.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">AVB demands that he can motivate his players, but the pod consider what it is like to break the Mourinho mould. Is it a step to far for the man who used to sit on Jose's back room staff?</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Sunday is already calling for Roberto and Kenny, but whilst the Manc has had to balance Europe with Euphoria Kenny has been focussing on 4pm on Sunday. Steve Clarke will be looking to utilise Liverpool's strengths again, but how will they line up? Kartik and Kristan compare lineups.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">This week Kevin Harris makes his debut on the podcast. Welcome him on and feedback on twitter. We take the opportunity to chat with him about issues in football and how we can approach them more aggressively. He also has a unique experience of Cyprus and we plug him for&nbsp;Cypriot&nbsp;inside knowledge.</p>

			<title>Transition for Chelsea, City, United, Arsenal…etc. (EPL Talk Weekend Review)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/transition-for-chelsea-city-united-arsenal-etc-epl-talk-weekend-review-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">After a week of controversy and covering-backsides the EPL got back to business and it was nice to see. It is hard to over-estimate the significance of these results in the season as teams still feel like there is so much ahead of them and still a mixed record behind them.</p>
<p class="p1">Christmas is the time to set things right and this weekend seems to have set that up quite nicely. Stamford Bridge saw our featured game please Johnson and co. as they walked away with a victory, but we assess how hollow that might feel in the long-term as Chelsea are still making progress and finding out more with each game.</p>
<p class="p1">Arsenal get their assessment too, can we compare their season to that of Liverpool or United? When we do are they actually compared quite favourably? Give us your feedback as RVP strikes again.</p>
<p class="p1">United plod on, but they don't look like the dynamic and inventive team who started the season. The strange thing is that no one seems to care; their neighbours are making far too much noise for that. Mancini is breaking out the scarf and City fans are cooling the Champagne as they seem to be the only team with a good history and a bright future in the league.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, the pod pays tribute to David Beckham and his achievements in the MLS, what has changed in football in that time? Was he lucky or significant in that change?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Premier League might not be playing right now, but that doesn't stop the players from representing their countries. Taking long flights, scoring or not...and generally making managers nervous about the state of their health. Not least Harry Redknapp.</p>
<p>The pod discuss international fixtures and the EPL players involved with a huge number flying aroundthe world to make appearances. Luckily for English representation they only had to make it to Wembley and so we start our analysis there.</p>
<p>We talk about Man City's players lining up alongside Englishmen and United's team looking relatively rested.</p>
<p>After moving around Europe the pod decides to look at the headlines and then ask for your feedback which will be compiled in a podcast later this week. if you have any views on the season so far then do let us know through:</p>

			<title>Don't Count Them Out (Review Podcast)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/don-t-count-them-out-review-podcast-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If this weekend has taught football anything&hellip;it is not to write anyone off. Lesson learnt as Chelsea underestimated their London counterparts and came away with more questions than answers. Arsenal fans should be proud of their team, but the pod ask if every week will be like this for Arsene Wenger and his Captain Vantastic.</p>
<p class="p2">John Terry has made a name for himself, what do you think of him? We discuss his actions and if they make him racist or merely part of a much wider network which makes up British football right now. Discrimination still exists but in what capacity and how do we confront that?</p>
<p class="p2">Northern teams also kicked a ball this weekend. We look at their progress. Noisy neighbours and discontented old men make comments which they shouldn't and end up offending us all as both United and City get a win.</p>
<p class="p2">The relegation candidates have also made a case for their salvation, but some monstrous sides have let them down in recent weeks. Have referees served Blackburn well or condemned them to relegation? Are Wigan strong enough up front to survive?</p>
<p class="p2">Tweet along with the pod as you hear it and let us know your views for midweek.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[If this weekend has taught football anything&hellip;it is not to write anyone off. Lesson learnt as Chelsea underestimated their London counterparts and came away with more questions than answers. Arsenal fans should be proud of their team, but the pod ask if every week will be like this for Arsene Wenger and his Captain Vantastic.
John Terry has made a name for himself, what do you think of him? We discuss his actions and if they make him racist or merely part of a much wider network which makes up British football right now. Discrimination still exists but in what capacity and how do we confront that?
Northern teams also kicked a ball this weekend. We look at their progress. Noisy neighbours and discontented old men make comments which they shouldn't and end up offending us all as both United and City get a win.
The relegation candidates have also made a case for their salvation, but some monstrous sides have let them down in recent weeks. Have referees served Blackburn well or condemned them to relegation? Are Wigan strong enough up front to survive?
Tweet along with the pod as you hear it and let us know your views for midweek.

            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/united-delighted-cities-impressed-epl-talk-podcast-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the pod this weekend there is discussion of racism, flopping and drawing. That's just at Anfield. Sitting in The Kop this week are Jesse Chula and Joseph Weathered, whilst Kartik Krishnaiyer offers his views from inside Starbucks.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">Up for review: Man City's longevity. Can Mancini's men make it through christmas and more importantly the Manchester Derby with their dignity and their sanity? Sir Alex will have a blunt answer, in the same way that Chicarito did for Liverpool's underwhelming dominance at Anfield as the biggest match in club football ended in a draw.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">But wait, the league isn't just about the 'Big Four' anymore. Norwich and Swansea make things interesting in the south whilst Newcastle are still punching above their weight. Bolton look buoyant too, but they don't promise half as much as Stoke do.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">We also look forward to the Champions League and what may come of our prized assets as they square up against the European heavyweights.

			<title>Fixture Luck? (EPL Talk Podcast)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/fixture-luck-epl-talk-podcast-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This weekend the pod focuses on the order of games. Does United's draw reflect anything in the league or is this just down to 'luck of the draw' at FA Head-Quarters? Either way, it makes for an interesting narrative-arc in this week's action.</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">Looking forward to the Champions League, Petr Cech claims that Chelsea are obsessed with winning a European Cup, but does the dominance of so many other teams make it yet more impossible for this side?</p>
<p class="p2"></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This weekend the pod focuses on the order of games. Does United's draw reflect anything in the league or is this just down to 'luck of the draw' at FA Head-Quarters? Either way, it makes for an interesting narrative-arc in this week's action.

Looking forward to the Champions League, Petr Cech claims that Chelsea are obsessed with winning a European Cup, but does the dominance of so many other teams make it yet more impossible for this side?

Torres talk continues as he managed to bag himself a goal and then get sent off. Referees had a lot to do with this week's results, but how much influence did they have on the overall flow and pace of play?

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Carling Cup has thrown up some interesting situations for our EPL our the past few years. But with so much significance put on the big competitions it can be forgotten. This week's podcast looks at why the League Cup still holds significance for so the league.</p>
<p class="p1">To start, we digest Owen Hargreaves comments about his rehabilitation at Manchester United. Was he right to speak out now or is this just press hype? Sir Alex will voice his opinion in the Friday press conference but hear what Jesse Chula and Kartik Krishnaiyer have to say before anyone else.</p>
<p class="p1">We also preview the action to come this weekend. Whilst it isn't a big weekend for 'top of the table' clashes there are going to be some challenges for the top teams in the league. The pod review the chances of an upset after the fairly convincing displays from all of our regular winners. The conclusion: the best clash of the weekend doesn't always involve a champion.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Despite a top of the table that's providing little reason for conversation, myself, Kartik Krishnaiyer and Laurence McKenna have plenty to discuss on this edition of the EPL Talk Podcast. In the hours before the show went to tape, Stan Kroenke's bid for controlling interest in Arsenal was reported.

They join Tottenham Hotspur, who beat Milan last week, by sending Marseille and Copenhagen home.</p>
<p>On this edition of the EPL Talk podcast, myself and my co-hosts - Laurence McKenna and Kartik Krishnaiyer - discuss the typical mix-bag from United and the underwhelming display from Chelsea, considering which of their fellow quarterfinalists United and Chelsea will want to avoid, want to draw. We also consider the potential of Spurs. Now that we've seen the knockout round performances of the eight surviving clubs, how far can Spurs go in their first Champions League?</p>
<p>We also discuss Jens Lehmann, Michael Jackson, Alex Ferguson and the Europa League fates of Manchester City and Liverpool before looking toward the weekend slate, 10 matches highlighted by the Citizens' trip to Stamford Bridge. Would Roberto Mancini be better served focusing on Sunday's match? Or does he have the squad to continue competing on three fronts?</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>If we learned anything in the wake of the Carling Cup Final, it's that six weeks is a long time. At least, that's what's implied every time Arsenal's silverware drought is evoked. But if six years really is so long in Premier League years, how long is nine, because that's how long it's been since Manchester United won at Stamford Bridge after Chelsea' 2-1 win Tuesday over the league-leaders.</p>
<p>To talk about that result, the FA Cup replays, and the upcoming weekend's action, I was joined by my co-hosts, Kartik Krishnaiyer and Laurence McKenna. We focus on what was Chelsea's best performance of 2011 while making our way to a look at this weekend, action that will be dominated by the season's third North West Derby, Manchester United visiting Anfield.</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/any-given-sunday-weekend-review-epl-talk-podcast]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Arsenal's six year drought without silverware persists while a  48-year dry spell ends for Birmingham City on what announcers called the  biggest day in the club's history. On Sunday, Brum got an 89th minute  goal from Obafemi Martins en route to a 2-1 win over the Gunners and the  Carling Cup. Arsenal, on the other hand, saw their defending fail them  at a crucial time, something that is sure to give new life to the  criticisms heard countless times by this squad.</p>
<p>On this edition of the EPL Talk Podcast, myself and co-hosts Kartik  Krishnaiyer and Laurence McKenna pay tribute to the Blues' achievement  while asking where the loss leaves Arsenal. We also talk about a  weekend's worth of action that saw strong results for who relegation  battlers while Manchester United restored their four point lead.</p>
<p>Then, we look forward to Tuesday, when Chelsea and United will meet  for the first time this season. Along the way, we get to your feedback  on this, the weekend review show.</p>]]></description>

			<title>The Preferred Side Of A Nil-Nil (Mid-Week Show): EPL Talk Podcast</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/the-preferred-side-of-a-nil-nil-mid-week-show-epl-talk-podcast]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Which side of a nil-nil would you rather be on? It's a serious question, because in Champions League, after one leg, it matters. Taking a 0-0 on the road has entirely different implications than coming back home with one. Yet there's still debate as to which situation is preferred. Jos&eacute; Mourinho has said that he doesn't mind the 0-0 at home to open a tie. Alex Ferguson clearly doesn't mind returning to Old Trafford with the same.</p>
<p>On this episode of the podcast, in the wake of Manchester United's 0-0 in Marseille, we talk about the strategies behind playing for the second leg. We also talk about Chelsea's performance, a 2-0 win in Copenhagen. Should the first win since Fernando Torres was bought be considered a step forward?</p>
<p>We also reflect back on mid-week Premier League action, look forward to this weekend's fixtures, and then shift our focus to Sunday's League Cup final, where Birmingham City has a chance to earn a spot in next year's Europa League. Should the Carling Cup grant entry into Europe? And how important is it that Arsenal's kids finally claim some silverware.</p>
<p>All that on this, the mid-week edition of the show.</p>]]></description>

			<title>FA Cup Break: EPL Talk Podcast</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/fa-cup-break-epl-talk-podcast]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the virtues of being a league-focused show is being able to use the FA Cup weekends as a time to reset, take inventory of what's happening around the league, and focus on topics we normally don't have time to address. On this weekend's edition of the show, Kartik Krishnaiyer and myself talk about this weekend's action, results that saw the holders leave the FA Cup, before shifting to looking at the league. We talk time to talk about the clubs jockeying for Europa League spots and ask which of the league's top teams will be the fifth of five, before taking a detailed look at the run-ins for Manchester United and Arsenal, seemingly the two remaining contenders in this season's league.</p>
<p>A programming note: The second segment of this show - on in which Kartik and I focused on Champions League - had to be cut from the show for technical reasons. For those looking for the take homes: we both patted ourselves on the back regardin Spurs but also noted the continued slide of Serie A; we both admitted we undersold Arsenal while noting they seemed too self-congratulatory for taking a lead out of the first half; we both feel Chelsea's match with Copenhagen will be an important confidence-boosting opportunity, and neither of us expect Manchester United to deviate from their typical, Champions League, opening leg approach: play conservatively and take the tie back to Old Trafford.</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/two-horse-race-weekend-review-epl-talk-podcast]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A spectacular Wayne Rooney goal capped a 2-1 Manchester United victory Saturday, but did the loss shove the Citizens out of the title race? On this edition of the EPL Talk Podcast, myself, Kartik Krishnaiyer and Laurence McKenna talk about Saturday's big match, one that keeps United five pionts clear at the top of the league.</p>
<p>But although we spend some time talking about this weekend's derby, we take time on this week's show to look at the bottom of the table - a relegation battle that few clubs have been able to escape. Where six of the seven bottom teams got points this weekend, today seemed a good day to catch-up on what's going on at the bottom of the table.</p>
<p>Finally, we look at the week's upcoming matches. Chelsea goes to Craven Cottage to take on Fulham on Monday, needing three points to keep pace with Tottenham, no in fourth place. Then, Champions League forces its way back onto the agenda. On Tuesday, Spurs are in Milan while Wednesday brings the Emirates a visit from Arsenal.</p>]]></description>

<p>Kevin and I talk about Spurs staying in North London, the parallels between Hughton and Roberto di Matteo, as well as the coming weekend's fixtures, a slate highlighted by the seasons' second Manchester derby.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On a historic weekend of football in the English Premier League - one that saw a record number of Saturday goals, Manchester United's first loss of the season, and a memorable capitulation from Arsenal - the story was Kenny Dalglish; or, the story was Carlo Ancelotti, depending on how you want to look at Sunday's match at Stamford Bridge, a 1-0 win by Liverpool in Fernando Torres's Blues debut. Rarely has their been a case where the difference between the managers mattered so much, but as Ancelotti failed to respond to Dalglish's three central defender set-up, Liverpool was registering what may be a season defining victory.</p>
<p>On this edition of the EPL Talk Podcast, myself, Laurence McKenna and Kartik Krishnaiyer talk about that, other stumbles by the league's title aspirants, and West Brom parting with Roberto di Matteo.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The fourth  round of the FA Cup saw the league's top four barely survive, though the  fifth of the Big Five (Tottenham) met their end at Craven Cottage. On  this edition of the EPL Talk Podcast, myself, Kartik Krishnaiyer, and  the returning Laurence McKenna discuss the weekend's results, outcomes  that failed to producing the type of captivating upset we've come to  hope for from our knock-out competitions. With a fifth round draw that  fails to pit any of the big boys against each other, is the FA Cup  destined to end up in the hands of one of the league's titans?</p>
<p>But for the bulk of this show, we'll be talking about the news that's  dominated the last day's headlines. As the transfer window closes, the  rumor to fact ratio increases. As it concerns Fernando Torres, the  stories surrounding his potential move to Chelsea have been confirmed as  more truth than lie. We discuss the deteriorating link between Torres  and Anfield and where the Reds go from here.</p>
<p>And finally, we look to mid-week, where a Tuesday fixture list sees  Manchester United, Arsenal, and Chelsea with difficult challenges to  their title quest.</p>

<p>In addition, we talk about Ronaldinho and Blackburn, David Beckham and Spurs, as well as Robbie Keane at Birmingham City. It's not our typical preview show. It's more of a long, less structure chat, something different for this week's edition of our lead-in show.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Only one of the English Premier League's top six clubs entering mid-week action came away with three points from Tuesday and Wednesday fixtures, and unfortunately for those looking for the title race to stay as close as possible, that club was league-leading Manchester United, winning 2-1 on Tuesday versus Stoke. While Manchester City enticed Arsenal to a 0-0, Wednesday draw at the Emirates, both Tottenham and Chelsea lost (to Everton and Wolves), with Bolton drawing at home to Wigan.</p>
<p>Making his return to the EPL Talk podcast, Kartik Krishnaiyer joins Laurence McKenna and myself to talk about those results, the title race, whether Chelsea is in it, and what of Liverpool after the Reds' 3-1 loss at Ewood Park.</p>
<p>This is the first of two shows we'll distribute to end the week. The second, released tomorrow, will look forward to the third round of FA Cup action as well as discuss some of the more eye-opening rumors from the early transfer window.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>There wasn't much to talk about around the Premier League this weekend.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea visit to Tottenham Hotspur highlighted a nine match weekend in the Premier League, with an erratic performance from Heurelho Gomes gifting the Blues an equalizer, denying a match winner in the 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane. That the reqult allowed Manchester City, 3-1 winners at Upton Park, to sit joint top of the table ahead of tomorrow's marquee match, Arsenal's visit to Manchester United, where the winner will gain first place in the English Premier League after 17 rounds.</p>
<p>On this edition of the EPL Talk Podcast, I am joined by Kartik Krishnaiyer to discuss those matches as well as the rest of the fixtures in weekend Premier League action. We take extra time to talk about Spurs-Chelsea, from Carlo Ancelotti's plan to stop Gareth Bale, John Terry's strong performance, to the overlooked Petr Cech. In addition, we talk about Carlos T&eacute;vez's attempt to leave Manchester City before moving on to Monday's match, breaking down the particulars of the season's first Manchester United-Arsenal meeting, looking back at the last two years to try and figure out what United's likely to due, asking if it even matters against an Arsenal site that has lacked the mentality to down the Devils.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For the second consecutive match day, the English Premier League has given us a slate full of close, exciting matches. Whether it be a back-and-forth affair at Villa Park, leads being given-up and reclaimed at the Britannia, gifted equalizers at White Hart Lane or dramatically salvaged points at Goodison, the league was full of compelling fixtures. And those don't even cover the match we were all looking at: a Manchester Derby at Eastlands that was both compelling (for the match-up, the tactics) and disappointing (negative tactics and a 0-0).</p>
<p>On this edition of the EPL Talk podcast, Laurenca McKenna and I not only go over the results of England's 13th match day but also cast a snark-laden gaze toward the weekend's action, trying to decide which is a more worthy Match of the Week: United's trip to Villa Park, or Arsenal's visit to Goodison.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[For the second consecutive match day, the English Premier League has given us a slate full of close, exciting matches. Whether it be a back-and-forth affair at Villa Park, leads being given-up and reclaimed at the Britannia, gifted equalizers at White Hart Lane or dramatically salvaged points at Goodison, the league was full of compelling fixtures. And those don't even cover the match we were all looking at: a Manchester Derby at Eastlands that was both compelling (for the match-up, the tactics) and disappointing (negative tactics and a 0-0).
On this edition of the EPL Talk podcast, Laurenca McKenna and I not only go over the results of England's 13th match day but also cast a snark-laden gaze toward the weekend's action, trying to decide which is a more worthy Match of the Week: United's trip to Villa Park, or Arsenal's visit to Goodison.

During the interview, I asked Jan several questions about topics including: Why Liverpool is in such poor and inconsistent form this season, What it was like to play alongside Johan Cruyff, His memories of the first Liverpool FC match he played, Whether he sees parallels between the way that Ajax played and how Arsenal play now, His memories of that wonderful goal for Liverpool against Manchester United in the 1985 Milk Cup, The rivalry between Denmark and Holland - who will be facing each other in World Cup 2010, Favorite memories of Kenny Dalglish, And much more.

Don&#8217;t forget that the EPL Talk Podcast is the only Premier League interview and analysis podcast available for free. In the past few weeks, we&#8217;ve interviewed legends of the game such as Steve McManaman, Efan Ekoku, Martin Chivers and Robbie Earle as well as experts such as Declan Hill, Simon Kuper, Misha Sher, Matt Dickinson and many others.

			<title>EPL Talk: Phil Cornwell</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/epl_talk_phil_cornwell]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I posted a tweet that if I was reborn, I would become a Tottenham Hotspur supporter simply because of <i>The Spurs Show</i>
podcast. And I meant it. Most of the readers here know me as a Swansea
City supporter, but there's something completely endearing, refreshing,
honest and depressing about being a regular listener to <i>The Spurs Show</i> that makes me feel closer to the pain one must feel supporting THFC.</p>
<p>I
don't typically recommend club podcasts. They tend to be too biased,
boring and lacking any real content. But The Spurs Show is different.
It pulls you in right from the get-go with host Phil Cornwell's
brilliant delivery of his Harry Redknapp impression, which is just as
good as his Martin Jol one.</p>
<p>Cornwell, you see, is an English
thespian, who has appeared on many British television shows over the
years as well as being a stand-up comedian. It's his mix of comedy and
deep passion for Tottenham Hotspur that is so refreshing, while co-host
Mike Leigh (also a well-known person on the British comedy circuit) is
the perfect balance to Cornwell, keeping him in line but carrying the
conversation forward with their obvious love and knowledge of the game
and, more importantly, their club.</p>
<p>So, it's with great pleasure
that we bring you an interview with Phil Cornwell on the latest episode
of the EPL Talk Podcast. The interview is special for many different
reasons, but it also marks the debut of Stephen Darwin, one of three
hosts of the EPL Talk Podcast (including me and Kartik Krishnaiyer).
Stephen, Kartik and I will continue bringing you interviews with some
of the biggest names in English football.</p>
<p>Enjoy the podcast
episode. And if you haven't had a chance to listen to The Spurs Show
yet, it's required listening whether you're a Tottenham supporter or
not. It's one of the highlights each week on my iPod, and is always
laugh-out loud funny. Check out The Spurs Show on iTunes.</p>

			<title>EPL Talk: Peter Lupson (Across The Park)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://epltalk.libsyn.com/epl_talk_peter_lupson_across_the_park_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[It isn't often that I interview personalities for the EPL Talk Podcast. In the past six months, I've interviewed two people. The first was Barney Ronay, the scholarly and humorous writer for The Guardian and author of a new book entitled The Manager. And the second is Peter Lupson, today's guest on the EPL Talk Podcast.

Trust me, I'd love to interview more guests but due to having four children and a wife, it's difficult to find quiet time, let alone any time. But for Ronay and Lupson I went out of my way to interview these two important figures from the world of English football. Both of them for very different reasons.

Peter Lupson's newest book is entitled Across The Park. But before you get turned off by hearing that it's a history of the formation and relationship between Everton and Liverpool football clubs, please realize that the book is much more than that. It is about the spirit and soul of football, which unfortunately has almost disappeared from the game.

If you care about football and the human spirit, the interview with Lupson is a must-listen. It's not often that I say that, but Lupson is a wonderful storyteller, a charming person and one of the most inspiring football historians I've come across. His previous book Thank God For Football was a critical success. His latest one is a perfect one to add to your holiday wish-list.

In the interview, Lupson updates listeners on the latest developments after Thank God For Football, as well as his appearances as a guest speaker for the Everton Collection, the greatest-ever collection of football memorabilia. I implore you to listen to the interview. Keep an open mind and prepare to be enthralled.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In episode 32 of the EPL Talk Podcast, we feature interviews with ESPN Soccernet columnist and famed author Phil Ball (pictured right), and BBC Sport interactive football editor Howard Nurse. Ball previews the upcoming Chelsea against Barcelona match, and shares his expertise on La Liga by discussing how different the game is in Spain versus England, his opinion regarding the David Beckham transfer saga and how popular the Spanish league is around the world, especially the USA. The interview with Howard Nurse focuses on what his role is like running the football section for BBC Sport, possibly the most visited soccer web site on earth. Nurse discusses all of the work that goes on behind the scenes, his recent acquisition of Kevin Nolan to write the weekly football column, whether the Panorama story has negatively impacted his journalist's access to managers, and how competitive it is between BBC Sport and SkySports. Plus we wrap up with a reflection of the past weekend's action from the Premiership and we give you a chance to win two soccer T-shirts.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMorbo-Philip-Ball%2Fdp%2F0954013468%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1189289328%26sr%3D1-1&tag=et00d-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Morbo</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=et00d-20&l=ur2&o=1"/>, written by Phil Ball, is available for purchase.<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>
