<title>Interview with Paul Harrington</title> 
<link>http://www.l4l.co.uk/mp3/L4L019.mp3</link> 
<description>Interview with Paul Harrington  -  This week's interview is with Paul Harrington from Cefn Fforest Primary school in Wales - audio and video blogger extraordinaire. He talks about his classes' use of David Warlick's Blogmeister watch him teach the time in Welsh using Flixn.com - completely transfixing and inspirationall! People like Paul trawl for Web 2.0 apps, find the most relevant and use them in a concrete and very practical way in the classroom - I wish the government and Local Authorities would wake up to this amazing innovative use of technology - if you want to see how embedding ICT in the curriculum is done then go to his sites and employ him in a wider capacity!</description>
