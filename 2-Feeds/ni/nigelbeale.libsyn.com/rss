			<title>Interview with Richard Stursberg on his book The Tower of Babble: Sins, Secrets and Successes Inside the CBC </title>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Unlike Britain, which opted to invest in public non-commercial broadcasting in the early &rsquo;60s, Canada chose a hybrid model that freed the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) </a>to augment its Parliamentary appropriation with advertising revenues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Canada&rsquo;s 1968 Broadcast Act prescribed a broadcasting system controlled by Canadians that &lsquo;safeguards and strengthens our cultural, political, social and economic fabric, promotes unity and national identity, and provides challenging, entertaining, informative programming that caters to a wide range of audiences.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">This conflicted mandate parked the CBC at a particularly congested intersection, one that today invites more collisions than ever before, what with the significant funding cuts just announced and profits from the Hockey Night in Canada franchise in jeopardy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">In addition to the impossible task of simultaneously promoting a single, nebulous national identity and culture, and providing programming for a wide variety of tastes and audiences, the CBC is also under pressure to produce &ldquo;popular&rdquo; shows that Canadians will watch and advertisers will support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">One solution is to abandon the old commercial hybrid model and fund the CBC not through Parliament, but directly from licence fees&nbsp; levied on consumers. This way the CBC could, similar to TVOntario, carve out a more distinctive, unique role for itself by eliminating advertising&nbsp; (and much of the glib, manipulative, audience-spinning crap one finds on commercial television)&nbsp; from most of its schedule, and delivering &lsquo;high&rsquo; quality Canadian alternative programming without regard for &lsquo;lowest-common-denominator&rsquo; audience share. Replacing a chubby old confused mongrel, with a lean, alert purebred puppy dog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Good idea. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why it stands little chance of seeing daylight.

<p><span style="font-size: large;">While &lsquo;Little Mosque on the Prairie&rsquo; is no &lsquo;Mad Men&rsquo;, it is watched by lots of Canadians.

&ldquo;PRINTING, ILLUSTRATION, TYPE DESIGN, typefounding, type engraving, bookbinding, graphic design, stone cutting and digital type design are things that have occupied me for over seventy years, and do to this day.&nbsp; Excepting the bit of letter cutting in stone, these occupations have all put dinner on the table; but it has been my good fortune to have loved the work.&rdquo;

This is how Jim Rimmer (1934-2010) starts off his Pie Tree Press, Memories from the Composing Room Floor (Gaspereau Press, 2008)
Rimmer was a mainstay of the letterpress/private press community in Vancouver for much of the past 50 years.

The love of a business that he was passionate about; and the love that he instilled in so many, for books, the printed word, and the letterpress printing process.
An archive of material from the last decade of Jim's work is held by the Special Collections Library at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C. I met there recently with Eric Swanick, Head of the Library, to talk about Jim Rimmer. ]]></itunes:subtitle>

The Alcuin Society&rsquo;s Awards for Excellence in Book Design in Canada have been recognizing achievement since 1981.
As Marlene Chan put it in the preface to the 2009 winners&rsquo;catalogue, 

&ldquo;The hallmark of the judging process in all of the Alcuin competitions is, and has always been, that each book is considered as a total entity. The discerning judges examine every aspect of each book, including the dust jacket, binding, endpapers, half-title page, copyright page, title page, page layout, typography, integration of illustrations, chapter openings, running heads, reproduction of illustrations, clarity of printing, choice of paper, footnotes and bibliographical references. The judges select books in eight categories to encourage the very best in Canadian design, only where they see exceptional merit.&rdquo;

I met recently with Leah Gordon, Chair of the Book Design Committee, at her home in Vancouver to talk about the history and goals of the society &ndash; and, in particular, its Awards program; about some of the books the society has published over the years, and about how, in addition to the judging criteria cited above,&nbsp; appropriateness and usefulness also factor into the judges&rsquo; decision making process.&nbsp; ]]></itunes:subtitle>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">It didn't win any prizes; no awards; didn't make many, if any, long or short lists; but David Gilmour's The Perfect Order of Things is a great novel. The best I read last year. In fact, I think it's one of the best Canadian novels ever written. Deceptively easy to read, the book's 300-odd pages are not only crowded with elegantly crafted sentences, they collectively capture and convey levels of insight and depths of experience one typically finds only in great Russian novels. Perfect Order leaves you invigorated; filled with admiration for the life fully lived. It makes you want to get out there and show the world who's boss.David Gilmour was in Ottawa recently to attend the Ottawa International Writers Festival.</span></p>]]></description>

Stories About Storytellers is Gibson's memoir. In a series of short profiles, he tells us tales about some of the authors he has worked with during an illustrious career.&nbsp; He himself is an impressive story teller. The book takes us on a coast to coast tour, through the lives and writings of, among others, Jack Hodgins, Harold Horwood, Alice Munro, James Houston, Mavis Gallant, Alistair McLeod, Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney. Gibson's journey through Canadian political and publishing history, &nbsp; eloquently documents the story of Canada.
We met recently in Ottawa. Please listen here as we talk, among other things, about his careers and roles as editor and publisher, about the best Canadian fiction, luck and a system that encourages Canadian writing, olympic gold, the difficulty of literary prizes, subjective judgement, and the most important paragraph in Canadian writing.&nbsp;]]></itunes:subtitle>

Over the years his small publishing house introduced the world to the early works of bpNichol, Michael Ondaatje, Margaret Atwood, George Bowering, Frank Davey, Ann-Marie MacDonald, Anne Michaels and many other important Canadian writers.
Known for its experimental production techniques and innovative designs, Coach House has published more than 500 titles of its own since 1965, and printed thousands more for other presses, libraries and art galleries. In addition to employing some of Canada's greatest type and book designers, Bevington also kept Coach House at the forefront of&nbsp; new printing and computer technology advancements, collaborating with artists, programmers and e&ndash;book designers.
He has lectured at York University and the Rochester Visual Studies Workshop, at the Banff Publishing workshop and Radcliffe at Harvard, and has received numerous grants, prizes, honourary degrees and life time achievement awards for his work in publishing and the Arts.
We met recently in Toronto, outside the Coach House premises, to talk about the history of the Press, and, more specifically, about those books, among the many it has published, that might be of greatest interest to the collector. Please listen here:
This interview is part of our&nbsp; Book Publisher Series  which focuses on the histories of important British, American and Canadian publishing houses, and how best to go about collecting their works.]]></itunes:subtitle>

Chapters-Indigo, Canada's dominant bookstore chain, claimed not to have any of the books in stock anywhere in Canada during the week the Giller was announced. One result was a significant increase in ebook sales; the novel quickly became the top-selling title in the Kobo ebookstore.

Knopf, Inc. archive, which includes books published under the Borzoi imprint and books from Alfred A. and Blanche Knopf&rsquo;s personal library. The Ransom Center&rsquo;s Associate Director for Exhibitions and Fleur Cowles Executive Curator, Cathy Henderson, and Associate Director and Hobby Foundation Librarian, Richard Oram, collaborated on The House of Knopf, a book that contains collected documents from the Knopf, Inc. archive and is part of the Dictionary of Literary Biography series. It goes for a paltry $547 on ebay...so, instead of buying the book, I decided to travel down to Austin, Texas to interview the authors. Listen here to the result

Gaspereau's core philosophy emphasizes a commitment to the importance of the book as a physical object, "reuniting publishing and the book arts". One of the few Canadian publishers that still prints and binds in-house, the firm's books usually sport letterpress-printed covers which feature original artwork, are printed on fine paper and are smyth-sewn. The result is "strong, flexible, attractive books" that are comfortable in the hand and durable. 
I met recently with Andrew Steeves to talk about his approach to printing and publishing, about his experience with Johanna Skibsrud's The Sentimentalists, and about what he hopes to acheive with his work and in his life.

			<title>Michael Gnarowski on the Contact Press</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://nigelbeale.libsyn.com/michael-gnarowski-on-the-contact-press]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Professor, poet, editor and critic, Michael Gnarowski was born in Shanghai, China in 1934. He received his Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Ottawa in 1967. While an undergraduate at McGill, he contributed to, and co-edited, <i>Yes</i> (1956-1970) magazine. He also wrote for and/or edited <i>Le Chien d'or/The Golden Dog</i> (1970-1972), <i>Delta</i>, <i>Golden Dog Press</i> (1971-1985), and <i>Tecumseh Press</i>, and was series editor for McGraw-Hill Ryerson's <i>Critical Views on Canadian Writers Series</i> (1969-1977) and co-edited <i>Canadian Poetry</i> (1977-&nbsp;) with David Bentley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In 1970 Gnarowski&nbsp; wrote a brief history and checklist of the Contact Press. Here's his entry on Contact in the Canadian Encyclopedia:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Contact Press (1952-67) was founded as a poets' co-operative by Louis DUDEK, Raymond SOUSTER and Irving LAYTON, who were generally dissatisfied with the slight opportunities for publication available to Canadian poets. Contact went on, in the course of its 15-year history, to become the most important small press of its time. Launched at the mid-century, it published all the major Canadian poets of the period, and transformed literary life and small-press activity in Canada by its openness to a variety of poetic styles and its assertiveness of the poet's role in the production of his own work. Beginning before subsidies and government aid to Canadian book publishing had become a mainstay of such activity, Contact was a self-financed act of faith on the part of its founders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">While its main thrust was in publishing the new work of individual poets, it produced a milestone anthology, <i>Canadian Poems 1850-1952</i>, co-edited by Dudek and Layton in 1952, and an avant-garde manifesto of young poets published as <i>New Wave Canada: The New Explosion in Canadian Poetry</i> (1966).

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Professor, poet, editor and critic, Michael Gnarowski was born in Shanghai, China in 1934. He received his Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Ottawa in 1967. While an undergraduate at McGill, he contributed to, and co-edited, Yes (1956-1970) magazine. He also wrote for and/or edited Le Chien d'or/The Golden Dog (1970-1972), Delta, Golden Dog Press (1971-1985), and Tecumseh Press, and was series editor for McGraw-Hill Ryerson's Critical Views on Canadian Writers Series (1969-1977) and co-edited Canadian Poetry (1977-&nbsp;) with David Bentley.
In 1970 Gnarowski&nbsp; wrote a brief history and checklist of the Contact Press. Here's his entry on Contact in the Canadian Encyclopedia:
"Contact Press (1952-67) was founded as a poets' co-operative by Louis DUDEK, Raymond SOUSTER and Irving LAYTON, who were generally dissatisfied with the slight opportunities for publication available to Canadian poets. Contact went on, in the course of its 15-year history, to become the most important small press of its time. Launched at the mid-century, it published all the major Canadian poets of the period, and transformed literary life and small-press activity in Canada by its openness to a variety of poetic styles and its assertiveness of the poet's role in the production of his own work. Beginning before subsidies and government aid to Canadian book publishing had become a mainstay of such activity, Contact was a self-financed act of faith on the part of its founders.
While its main thrust was in publishing the new work of individual poets, it produced a milestone anthology, Canadian Poems 1850-1952, co-edited by Dudek and Layton in 1952, and an avant-garde manifesto of young poets published as New Wave Canada: The New Explosion in Canadian Poetry (1966). This was a successor to Souster's Poets 56, which had featured young poets in response to Dudek's query "O&ugrave; sont les jeunes?"Essentially a "no-frills" press, Contact published handsome, workmanlike books with, on occasion, a mimeographed pamphlet. Its writers ranged from F.R. SCOTT, one of the early moderns, to the newest wave represented by Margaret Atwood, George Bowering and John Newlove."&nbsp;
I met with Gnarowski recently at his home in Kemptville, Ontario to talk about the history, and collecting of, Contact Press. Please listen here to our conversation:

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Porcupine&rsquo;s Quill; and why it wont do business with Heather Reisman 


Elke and Tim Inkster have made an important and enduring contribution to Canadian literature. In 1974 they founded The Porcupine&rsquo;s Quill (PQL), a publishing house based in Erin, Ontario. Renowned for excellence in design and production, and for taking risks with new, unpublished authors, the firm has helped kick-start the careers of many of Canada&rsquo;s best known writers . PQL publications have won numerous awards and serve as an example to the world of Canadian publishing excellence.
Its first title came off the press in 1975: Brian Johnson&rsquo;s only book of poems, Marzipan Lies. Brian Johnson is currently the film critic for Maclean&rsquo;s and "claims to have met Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, twice!" (almost certainly an in-joke here that I&rsquo;m not privy to).&nbsp; Many of the early titles were slim volumes written by poets Tim Inkster had met as a student at the University of Toronto &mdash; amongst them Ed Carson who until recently was President of Penguin Canada, and Brian Henderson who is currently the publisher at Wilfrid Laurier University Press.
I met the Inksters recently in the garden behind their Press House. It butts up against the West Credit River, where this little critter

spent most of the morning chopping and hauling lumber from one
&nbsp;
&nbsp;bank to the

other.
While he was doing this Tim and I made our way back into the press room to talk about the history of The Porcupine&rsquo;s Quill and how to go about collecting its books. During this discussion we hit on how market forces often influence appearance: namely glossy versus matte finished covers. It was here that Tim got into describing the difficulties he&rsquo;s encountered dealing with Chapters, Canada&rsquo;s one and only big box bookstore. Please listen here to our conversation:

" Robert Fulford is a Toronto author, journalist, broadcaster, and editor. He writes a weekly column for The National Post and is a frequent contributor to Toronto Life, Canadian Art, and CBC radio and television. His books include Best Seat in the House: Memoirs of a Lucky Man (1988), Accidental City: The Transformation of Toronto (1995), and Toronto Discovered (1998)." This is how the man describes himself on his website. I&rsquo;d only add that I think he is the best of his kind.

Although often dark and complex, and at times racy, the &lsquo;Anne&rsquo; novels are today considered by most to be children&rsquo;s books.

Extraordinary Canadians series. We met recently to talk about the vast disconnect between the work and the woman; depression, lesbianism and gaiety; about place, truth and memory, narrative and culture, confidence and role models.&nbsp;

			<title>Book Artist Claire Van Vliet on the Janus Press</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://nigelbeale.libsyn.com/book-artist-claire-van-vliet]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3537/3814586047_486bd3d6b1.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="375" /></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Claire Van Vliet is the owner of <a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri018.html">the Janus Press</a> founded in 1955 located, since 1966, in Newark, Vermont. Janus Press has to date produced approximately 100 publications &mdash; books, pamphlets, and broadsides- , many of them designed, illustrated, type-set, printed (sometimes on paper made by the artist), and bound by Van Vliet herself&nbsp; in a well-equipped studio, printshop, bindery of her own design. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Born in Ottawa, Canada, she has lived in the United States since 1947. After graduating with an MFA degree from Claremont Graduate School (1954), Van Vliet traveled in Europe, apprenticing herself for a time as a hand typesetter. During these travels she taught herself etching while working as a craft instructor at the United States European Headquarters in Germany.&nbsp; For the remainder of the &rsquo;50s and early 1960s she taught printmaking, typography and drawing at the Philadelphia Museum School (now The University of the Arts) and worked as a type compositor for<a href="http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/andersn.htm"> John Anderson</a>, first at The Lanston Monotype Company in Philadelphia, and then at his own Pickering Press in New Jersey. In 1965 to &lsquo;66 she was hired by the Art Department of the University of Wisconsin, Madison as a Visiting Lecturer in Printmaking. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Primarily a publisher of first edition poetry (including the work of Seamus Heaney), Van Vliet pioneered the use of colored paper pulps for book illustration, and more recently has developed a variety of distinctive non-adhesive book structures. Museums that collect Van Vliet&rsquo;s&nbsp; work include The National Gallery in Washington, DC; the Victoria and Albert Museum, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/guide/bkarts.html"> The Library of Congress</a> and the Smithsonian Institute. In addition to her many honors, in 1993 the University of the Arts in Philadelphia named Van Vliet an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts. We met in her studio recently to talk about artist books and a long, outstanding career. Please listen here:</span></span></p>

			<title>Galway Kinnell on Poetry</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://nigelbeale.libsyn.com/poet-galway-kinnell]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2618/3790680891_20a69a3109.jpg" alt="" height="372" width="279" /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nigelbeale/3790680891/in/set-72157603766882092/"><span style="font-size: smaller;">NB Authors</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/212">Galway Kinnell </a>was born February 1, 1927 in Providence, Rhode Island. He has been hailed as one of the most influential American poets of the latter half of the 20th century. Educated at Princeton and Rochester Universities, he served in the United States Navy, after which he spent several years traveling, in Europe and the Middle East. His first book of poems, <em>What a Kingdom It Was</em>, was published in 1960, followed by <em>Flower Herding on Mount Monadnock </em>(1964). <br /> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Upon his return to the United States, Kinnell joined CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) as a field worker and spent much of the 1960s involved in the Civil Rights Movement. Social activism during this time found its way into his work &ndash; <em>Body Rags</em> (1968), and especially <em>The Book of Nightmares </em>(1971), a book-length poem concerned with the Vietnam War. Other books of poetry include <em>Selected Poems</em> (1980), for which he received both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award,<em> Imperfect Thirst </em>(1996); <em>When One Has Lived a Long Time Alone</em> (1990) and <em>A New Selected Poems</em> (2000), a finalist for the National Book Award; He has also published translations of works by Yves Bonnefroy, Yvanne Goll, Fran&ccedil;ois Villon, and Rainer Maria Rilke. Honors include a MacArthur Fellowship, a Rockefeller Grant, the 1974 Shelley Prize of the Poetry Society of America, and the 1975 Medal of Merit from National Institute of Arts and Letters. He has served as poet-in-residence at numerous colleges and universities, and as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 2001 to 2007. <br /> </span></span></p>

Galway Kinnell was born February 1, 1927 in Providence, Rhode Island. He has been hailed as one of the most influential American poets of the latter half of the 20th century. Educated at Princeton and Rochester Universities, he served in the United States Navy, after which he spent several years traveling, in Europe and the Middle East. His first book of poems, What a Kingdom It Was, was published in 1960, followed by Flower Herding on Mount Monadnock (1964).  
Upon his return to the United States, Kinnell joined CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) as a field worker and spent much of the 1960s involved in the Civil Rights Movement. Social activism during this time found its way into his work &ndash; Body Rags (1968), and especially The Book of Nightmares (1971), a book-length poem concerned with the Vietnam War. Other books of poetry include Selected Poems (1980), for which he received both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, Imperfect Thirst (1996); When One Has Lived a Long Time Alone (1990) and A New Selected Poems (2000), a finalist for the National Book Award; He has also published translations of works by Yves Bonnefroy, Yvanne Goll, Fran&ccedil;ois Villon, and Rainer Maria Rilke. Honors include a MacArthur Fellowship, a Rockefeller Grant, the 1974 Shelley Prize of the Poetry Society of America, and the 1975 Medal of Merit from National Institute of Arts and Letters. He has served as poet-in-residence at numerous colleges and universities, and as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 2001 to 2007.

&nbsp;
He has published three collections of poetry, including Between Silences and Facing Shadows, and three collections of short fiction, Ocean of Words, received the PEN/Hemingway Award, and Under the Red Flag, won the Flannery O&rsquo;Connor Award.

We met recently in Ottawa to talk about his first book of non-fiction The Writer as Migrant (University of Chicago Press). Adapted from The Rice University Campbell Lecture he delivered in 2006, the book consists of&nbsp; three interconnected essays exploring the experience of migrant,&nbsp; &lsquo;exiled&rsquo; writers in relation to their &lsquo;home&rsquo; countries and languages.&nbsp; Alexander Solzhenitsyn,&nbsp; Lin Yutang, Homer, Joseph Conrad , Vladimir Nabokov and others all contribute to the conversation.

Meir Shalev, (pictured above with his sister) one of Israel&rsquo;s most celebrated novelists,was born in 1948 in Nahalal, Israel&rsquo;s first moshav. He is a bestselling author in Israel, Holland, and Germany; and he has been translated into more than twenty languages. His novels include A Pigeon and a Boy, Fontanelle, Alone In the Desert, But A Few Days, and Esau. Russian Romance (The Blue Mountain) is one of the top five bestsellers in Israeli publishing history. Shalev is often compared to Gabriel Garcia Marquez. 
 Prizes he has won include the Juliet Club Prize (Italy); The Chiavari (Italy); and The Brenner Prize of 2006&mdash;the highest Israeli literary recognition awarded for his novel, A Pigeon and a Boy, published in the US by Random House in 2007.

This from contemporary writers: One of South Africa&rsquo;s most distinguished writers, Andr&eacute; Brink was born in 1935. Poet, novelist, essayist and teacher, he began work as a University lecturer in Afrikaans and Dutch Literature in the 1960s.&nbsp;He began writing in Afrikaans, but when censored by the South African government, began to also write in English and became published overseas. He remains a key figure in the modernisation of the Afrikaans language novel.
&nbsp;
His book, A Dry White Season (1979),&nbsp;was made into a film starring Marlon Brando while An Instant in the Wind (1976), the story of a relationship between a white woman and a black man,&nbsp;and Rumours of Rain (1978) were both&nbsp;shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction.&nbsp; Devil&rsquo;s Valley (1998)&nbsp;explores the life of a community locked away from the rest of the world, and The Other Side of Silence (2002), set in colonial Africa in the early twentieth century, won a Commonwealth Writers regional award for Best Book&nbsp;in 2003.&nbsp;He has also written a collection of essays on literature and politics, Reinventing a Continent (1996),&nbsp;prefaced by Nelson Mandela.&nbsp;
He is Emeritus Professor of English at the University of Cape Town. His latest novels are&nbsp;Praying Mantis (2005) and The Blue Door (2007). His memoir, A Fork in the Road, has just been published.  
I met Andre Brink recently at his home in Cape Town. (His lovely young wife Karina greeted me at the door and led me into his book-lined study. Before entering the house however, I&nbsp;encountered this in the garden: 
 
). Once seated we talked mostly about his life, about his father, about love and duty, justice, Apartheid, inter-racial sex, J.M. Coetzee, Nadine Gordimer; his love affair with poet Ingrid Jonker, her suicide, her poem &lsquo;Plant me a Tree,&rsquo; English as his second language, Picasso, recommended wines and staying in South Africa, despite his nephew having been shot dead by intruders last year at his home just north of Johannesburg.

I recently interviewed Canadian critic/editor/writer John Metcalf on his love of Books and Book Collecting. The same afternoon we talked also about the process of book reviewing,&nbsp; whether or not the use of insult and/or invective is ever justified and if so, when. John is known as a &lsquo;blunt&rsquo; critic; one who tells his unsugared truths directly, who is not reticent to attack &lsquo;with savagery&rsquo; books he feels 'insult' him. The conversation refers, among other things, to the Salon des Refuses exercise undertaken by Canadian Notes and Queries and The New Quarterly magazines, personal slights, the problem of awarding the same prizes to authors of widely varying talents, and the importance to healthy literary culture of truth-telling critics. 
Lengthy sentence alert: There are predictable attacks on M.G. Vassanji, Ann Marie MacDonald, and Robertson Davies here, and there is praise too for many young Canadian short story writers, but perhaps the most evident feature of this discussion is Metcalf&rsquo;s anger, precipitated, I&rsquo;d say, primarily by a combative dedication to serving a cause larger than himself &ndash; excellence in literature &ndash; aggravated in small part both by the perceived inability of Canadians to recognize literary greatness, and personal rejection at the hands of&nbsp; this country&rsquo;s &lsquo;literary establishment&rsquo;&nbsp; &ndash; bolstered by a natural taste for confrontation and a glee in the fighting of a good fight.

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Poet, author, Priscila Uppal, an English professor too at York University, challenges traditional psychological and anthropological models of mourning in her new book <span id="1236714339796S" style="display: none;"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=2301"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>We Are What We Mourning: The Contemporary English-Canadian Elegy</em></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">, suggesting that Canadians mourn differently. <br /> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Traditional models define successful mourning in terms of detachment from the loved one who has died; the ability to cut the strings of grief, and to step into the roles of mothers and fathers vacated by the dead. To become unnecessarily identified with grief and death is, according to traditional views, to fail at mourning. To succeed - to maintain health-&nbsp; one must &lsquo;move on;&rsquo; accept that the dead are gone; celebrate the fact that they are in heaven. All of this Uppal debunks. <br /> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After reading thousands of Canadian elegies she concludes that mourning, at least in late 20th century Canada, is not about forgetting, but about claiming identity. You are, she says, what you mourn. And we, apparently, mourn our parents in elegies to a much greater extent than do others in the U.S. and U.K., for example, who tend to mark the death of youth more frequently with this poetic form. <br /> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Many immigrants to Canada didn&rsquo;t know their parents very well; didn&rsquo;t know their countries of origin, didn&rsquo;t learn much about their traditions. In order to take over the roles their parents played - to learn about themselves - many have used mourning as a way to create and recreate the past; as a means to carry on into the future. Art - the elegy - is used as a way to attached to the past, and to connect and incorporate it into the present. What you mourn - what it is you are upset about losing -&nbsp; will determine, according to Uppal, how you see history. <br /> </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We talk about all of these topics, why and how the work of mourning has so drastically changed in Canada during the latter half of the twentieth century, why the contemporary English-Canadian elegy emphasizes connection rather than separation between the living and the dead.</span></span></p>

Poet, author, Priscila Uppal, an English professor too at York University, challenges traditional psychological and anthropological models of mourning in her new book  We Are What We Mourning: The Contemporary English-Canadian Elegy, suggesting that Canadians mourn differently.  
Traditional models define successful mourning in terms of detachment from the loved one who has died; the ability to cut the strings of grief, and to step into the roles of mothers and fathers vacated by the dead. To become unnecessarily identified with grief and death is, according to traditional views, to fail at mourning. To succeed - to maintain health-&nbsp; one must &lsquo;move on;&rsquo; accept that the dead are gone; celebrate the fact that they are in heaven. All of this Uppal debunks.  
After reading thousands of Canadian elegies she concludes that mourning, at least in late 20th century Canada, is not about forgetting, but about claiming identity. You are, she says, what you mourn. And we, apparently, mourn our parents in elegies to a much greater extent than do others in the U.S. and U.K., for example, who tend to mark the death of youth more frequently with this poetic form.  
Many immigrants to Canada didn&rsquo;t know their parents very well; didn&rsquo;t know their countries of origin, didn&rsquo;t learn much about their traditions.

Art - the elegy - is used as a way to attached to the past, and to connect and incorporate it into the present. What you mourn - what it is you are upset about losing -&nbsp; will determine, according to Uppal, how you see history.  
We talk about all of these topics, why and how the work of mourning has so drastically changed in Canada during the latter half of the twentieth century, why the contemporary English-Canadian elegy emphasizes connection rather than separation between the living and the dead.

Tanja and I talk here about playing Winnie, the difficulty of working at cliff&rsquo;s edge without a narrative, talking, doing nothing and the need for communication and attention, loneliness, mid-life marriages, revolvers, supportive fellow actors, the quality of attachment and mirroring, the imperative to carry on, suffering and the avoidance of and surrendering to pain in front of an audience, revisiting moments of terror and fright and aloneness and the agony of doing this as someone who has been abandoned, the unbearable parts of being human, and how the use of simple descriptives can generate profound distilled moments, poems of events.

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Joe Dunthorne is a graduate of the Creative Writing Masters at UEA, where he was awarded the Curtis Brown Prize. His poetry has been published in Reactions 5, Magma, Smiths Knoll and Tears in the Fence. His work has been featured on Channel 4, BBC Radio 3, 4 and in The Guardian and Vice magazine. We met recently at the IFOA in Toronto to discuss his debut novel, Submarine, why the behavior of teenage boys is often seen as abominable, the importance of getting laid, ambiguous characters, depression, the brilliance of novelist W.G. Sebald, East Anglia University, how humour works, and dustjackets which both attract attention and complement content.</span></p>

			<title>Michael Lista on: his first collection of poetry, Bloom</title>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">I first heard about Michael Lista in <a href="http://nigelbeale.com/?p=727">a workshop conducted by Meeka Walsh, Editor of Border Crossings magazine</a>. She raved about him: "Michael is a remarkably gifted young poet who lives in Montreal. He has a special interest in the points of intesection between science and poetics." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">These points live dramatically in the person of Louis Slotin, a scientist from Winnipeg involved in the Manhattan project and development of the atomic bomb, and Lista&rsquo;s desire to capture a day in his life. On May 21, 1946, Slotin conducted a dangerous experiment referred to by his fellow scientists as "tickling the dragon&rsquo;s tail." Using a framework of existing poems, in the way that James Joyce used Homer&rsquo;s <em>Odyssey</em>, Lista has borderline plagarized them in a collection which documents this May day.&nbsp; The book will be entitled <em>Bloom</em>. Anansi will publish it.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">"Out of admiration for the virtuosity of Slotin&rsquo;s achievements - with the attendant hubris and arrogance necessary to take risks and make anything new - and taking on those qualities in his own work, Lista&rsquo;s poems do glitter, but more lastingly than that word would suggest. Dazzle too has a showiness I don&rsquo;t mean to imply but the wit is so apparent. At the same time the tone is held and is exactly what the subject requires in this poetic construction."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Revisiting my <em>Salon des Refuses</em> experience in the last post, I am reminded of how rarely one encounters great literary work. Poetry especially. Pablo Neruda, Ted Hughes, Robin Robertson&hellip;I knew immediately upon first reading their poems that something extraordinary was happening. Their words rubbed up against my experience and sensibilities in ways that satisfied like few others have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I felt something of this while reading the handful of poems Michael sent me (<a href="http://nigelbeale.com/?p=1160">please find three in a future post)</a> in advance of our conversation. We talk here about the suicidal dangers of emulating Joyce&rsquo;s <em>Ulysses</em>, and the book&rsquo;s unapproachability; punning, the multiple meanings of bloom, epiphanies, coincidences, translation, sex and physics, life and death. <br /></span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://www.patriciakmccarthy.com/">Patricia K. Macarthy</a> is author of The Crimson Series, three books, to date, about vampires. We talk here about what makes Vampires so appealing to so many people, about their being symbolic of man&rsquo;s desire for supremacy, women&rsquo;s desire to be consumed, about the fringe elements of society, the attraction of eternal youth and immortality, confidence, the perfect villian whose weapon is seduction, alpha males, power, the lack of conscience, film, Halloween, the draw of fantasy, the defiance of death and the preciousness of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">During our conversation reference is made to poems by Byron and Goethe. Both example early literary treatment of Vampires <a title="Vampire" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire">[see vampires</a> (and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Vampire fiction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_fiction">vampire fiction</a>)].<br /> <br /><a href="http://www.simplysupernatural-vampire.com/vampire-poem-bride-of-corinth-goethe.html">The Vampire Female: "The Bride of Corinth"</a> (1797) by: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Patricia K. Macarthy is author of The Crimson Series, three books, to date, about vampires. We talk here about what makes Vampires so appealing to so many people, about their being symbolic of man&rsquo;s desire for supremacy, women&rsquo;s desire to be consumed, about the fringe elements of society, the attraction of eternal youth and immortality, confidence, the perfect villian whose weapon is seduction, alpha males, power, the lack of conscience, film, Halloween, the draw of fantasy, the defiance of death and the preciousness of time.
During our conversation reference is made to poems by Byron and Goethe. Both example early literary treatment of Vampires [see vampires (and vampire fiction)]. The Vampire Female: "The Bride of Corinth" (1797) by: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
(1) Once a stranger youth to Corinth came,
Who in Athens lived, but hoped that he
From a certain townsman there might claim,
As his father&rsquo;s friend, kind courtesy.
(2) Son and daughter, they
Had been wont to say
Should thereafter bride and bridegroom be.
But can he that boon so highly prized,
Save tis dearly bought, now hope to get?
They are Christians and have been baptized,
He and all of his are heathens yet.
(3) For a newborn creed,
Like some loathsome weed,
Love and truth to root out oft will threat.
Father, daughter, all had gone to rest,
And the mother only watches late;
She receives with courtesy the guest,
And conducts him to the room of state.
The Giaour by Lord Byron was first published in 1813 and the first in his Oriental romance series. It proved to be a great success, consolidating Byron&rsquo;s reputation critically and commercially. Here&rsquo;s how it starts:
No breath of air to break the wave
That rolls below the Athenian&rsquo;s grave,
That tomb which, gleaming o&rsquo;er the cliff,
First greets the homeward-veering skiff,
High o&rsquo;er the land he saved in vain;
When shall such hero live again?

This from Random House: "Miriam Toews&hellip;was born in 1964 in the small Mennonite town of Steinbach, Manitoba. She left Steinbach at eighteen, living in Montreal and London and touring Europe before coming back to Manitoba, where she earned a B.A. in film studies at the University of Manitoba. Later she packed up with her children and partner and moved to Halifax to attend the University of King&rsquo;s College, where she received a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in journalism. Upon returning to Winnipeg with her family in 1991, she freelanced at the CBC, making radio documentaries. When her youngest daughter started nursery school, Toews decided it was time to try writing a novel."
She&rsquo;s written four to date, including A Complicated Kindness which won the GG&rsquo;s Award for Best Fiction in 2004.&nbsp; We talk here about her latest The Flying Troutmans, about her father&rsquo;s struggle with depression and the stigma that still surrounds the disease, about road trips and siblings, the definition of love, the film Little Miss Sunshine, writing novels with movie deals in mind, trust, abandonment and Winnipeg, Manitoba.

			<title>Harlan Coben on the Business of Publishing Books</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/nigelbeale/Harlan_Coben.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">Harlan Coben&rsquo;s latest novel <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/ht.htm">HOLD TIGHT</a> debuted at #1 on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list &mdash; and simultaneously debuted at #1 in the <em>London Times.</em></span></p>
<div style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">Winner of the <a href="http://www.mysterywriters.org/" target="_blank">Edgar Award</a>, <a href="http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/triv72.html" target="_blank">Shamus Award</a> and Anthony Award &ndash; the first author to win all three &ndash; international bestselling author Harlan Coben&rsquo;s critically-acclaimed novels have been called "ingenious" (New York Times), "poignant and insightful" (Los Angeles Times), "consistently entertaining" (Houston Chronicle), "superb" (Chicago Tribune) and "must reading" (Philadelphia Inquirer). His most recent novels, <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/tw.htm">THE WOODS</a>, <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/pm.htm">PROMISE ME</a>, <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/ti.htm">THE INNOCENT</a>, <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/jol.htm">JUST ONE LOOK</a>, <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/nsc.htm">NO SECOND CHANCE</a>, <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/tno.htm">TELL NO ONE</a> and <a href="http://www.harlancoben.com/static/novels/gfg.htm">GONE FOR GOOD</a> have appeared on the top of all the major bestseller lists including the <em>New York Times, London Times, Le Monde, Publishers Weekly, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>USA TODAY</em> &mdash; and many others throughout the world. His books are published in thirty-seven languages around the globe and have been number one bestsellers in in nearly a dozen countries.</span></div>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">Harlan was born in Newark, New Jersey. After graduating from Amherst College a political science major, Harlan worked in the travel industry. He now lives in New Jersey with his wife, Anne Armstrong-Coben MD, a pediatrician, and their four children. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">****</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3"> I try to mix it up by warning that popularity should not be confused with greatness. Harlan brushes me off by following the good Dr.&rsquo;s line of argument: "The purpose of a writer is to be read, and the criticism which would destroy the power of pleasing must be blown aside. <em>[Samuel Johnson: Pope (Lives of the Poets)]. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">We look at the author as brand, the feigned disinterest many authors hold for the business side of publishing books, Harlan&rsquo;s New York Times Op-Ed pieces, his preference for the missing over the dead, suburban desperation, and 2.5 million books sold worldwide each year. &nbsp;</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Harlan Coben&rsquo;s latest novel HOLD TIGHT debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list &mdash; and simultaneously debuted at #1 in the London Times.
Winner of the Edgar Award, Shamus Award and Anthony Award &ndash; the first author to win all three &ndash; international bestselling author Harlan Coben&rsquo;s critically-acclaimed novels have been called "ingenious" (New York Times), "poignant and insightful" (Los Angeles Times), "consistently entertaining" (Houston Chronicle), "superb" (Chicago Tribune) and "must reading" (Philadelphia Inquirer). His most recent novels, THE WOODS, PROMISE ME, THE INNOCENT, JUST ONE LOOK, NO SECOND CHANCE, TELL NO ONE and GONE FOR GOOD have appeared on the top of all the major bestseller lists including the New York Times, London Times, Le Monde, Publishers Weekly, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal and USA TODAY &mdash; and many others throughout the world. His books are published in thirty-seven languages around the globe and have been number one bestsellers in in nearly a dozen countries.
Harlan was born in Newark, New Jersey. After graduating from Amherst College a political science major, Harlan worked in the travel industry. He now lives in New Jersey with his wife, Anne Armstrong-Coben MD, a pediatrician, and their four children. 
****
 I try to mix it up by warning that popularity should not be confused with greatness. Harlan brushes me off by following the good Dr.&rsquo;s line of argument: "The purpose of a writer is to be read, and the criticism which would destroy the power of pleasing must be blown aside. [Samuel Johnson: Pope (Lives of the Poets)]. 
We look at the author as brand, the feigned disinterest many authors hold for the business side of publishing books, Harlan&rsquo;s New York Times Op-Ed pieces, his preference for the missing over the dead, suburban desperation, and 2.5 million books sold worldwide each year. &nbsp;

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[
Donald Antrim is the author of three novels and a memoir entitled, The Afterlife, which is about the strained relationship he had with his mother, Louanne, an artist, teacher and alcoholic. In addition to receiving some of America&rsquo;s most prestigious fellowships, he is a regular contributor to The New Yorker, a magazine that includes him amongst their "twenty writers for the new century." 
We met at the Blue Met International Literary Festival in Montreal, and talk here about his mother&rsquo;s death, Camus, writing on the edge, suffering and distraction, luxury beds, Donald Barthelme, anger, sarcasm, loss of humour, collecting books, and the appeal of first editions. Donald also treats us to a reading from The Afterlife, and as part of this, the dedication in Sir Philip Sidney&rsquo;s Arcadia.

			<title>Frank Wilson on How to Write a Successful Book Blog</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<div align="left"><img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2368/2525268854_310fc00c3e.jpg?v=0" vspace="0" width="276" align="bottom" border="0" height="368" hspace="0" /></div>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">Frank Wilson has been reviewing books professionally since October, 1964. For most of the past decade he was Books Editor at the Philadelphia Inquirer, given to retaining committed bloggers (e.g. <a href="http://marksarvas.blogs.com/elegvar/">Mark Sarvas</a>, <a href="http://www.conversationalreading.com/">Scott Esposito</a>, <a href="http://www.edrants.com/">Ed Champion</a>)&nbsp; to review books. He retired recently. About five years ago he started blogging at <a href="http://booksinq.blogspot.com/">Books Inq</a>. It is one of the most successful blogs in the literary blogosphere.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: small;" size="3">I interviewed Frank at his home in Philadelphia recently. We talk about how he established his blog, about the potential and influence of this medium, about the benefits of interactivity and connection and roundtables; <a href="http://petrona.typepad.com/">Maxine Clarke</a>&rsquo;s crime fiction reviews; the provision of filtering services, shared links and interests; kindred spirits; embedding poetry and essays, and loneliness; about the strange side effects of reading and how passive entertainment becomes unwatchable, how most traditional media eschew feedback; what he looks for in book reviewers; Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s unknown correspondent; the book&rsquo;s connection to life;&nbsp; the nature of discourse; <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/">Instapundit</a> and &lsquo;instalanches;&rsquo; and those blogs he goes to every morning. </span></p>

For most of the past decade he was Books Editor at the Philadelphia Inquirer, given to retaining committed bloggers (e.g. Mark Sarvas, Scott Esposito, Ed Champion)&nbsp; to review books. He retired recently. About five years ago he started blogging at Books Inq. It is one of the most successful blogs in the literary blogosphere.&nbsp; 
I interviewed Frank at his home in Philadelphia recently. We talk about how he established his blog, about the potential and influence of this medium, about the benefits of interactivity and connection and roundtables; Maxine Clarke&rsquo;s crime fiction reviews; the provision of filtering services, shared links and interests; kindred spirits; embedding poetry and essays, and loneliness; about the strange side effects of reading and how passive entertainment becomes unwatchable, how most traditional media eschew feedback; what he looks for in book reviewers; Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s unknown correspondent; the book&rsquo;s connection to life;&nbsp; the nature of discourse; Instapundit and &lsquo;instalanches;&rsquo; and those blogs he goes to every morning.

It is the story of an English priest who takes over a small Scottish parish in a post-industrial town by the sea; a story of art and politics, love and faith, and the way we live now, which pretty well summarizes the conversation we had this past weekend at <a href="http://bluemetropolis.org/Festival">The Blue Met International Literary Festival</a> in Montreal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">More specifically we talked about tragedy, escape, the determination not to be determined, fathers, the blurred boundaries between fiction, memoir and journalism, the United States, the role of writer in society, Martin Amis and Islamism, parents, writing ones own life, and coloured doors in social housing projects. </span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Andrew O&rsquo;Hagan&rsquo;s most recent novel, Be Near Me, has just won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. It is the story of an English priest who takes over a small Scottish parish in a post-industrial town by the sea; a story of art and politics, love and faith, and the way we live now, which pretty well summarizes the conversation we had this past weekend at The Blue Met International Literary Festival in Montreal.&nbsp;
More specifically we talked about tragedy, escape, the determination not to be determined, fathers, the blurred boundaries between fiction, memoir and journalism, the United States, the role of writer in society, Martin Amis and Islamism, parents, writing ones own life, and coloured doors in social housing projects.

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;" face="Times New Roman" size="4">Find out why L.M.

 Biography as Screaming Farce: 
Find out why L.M. Montgomery was so skeptical about biography despite spending endless hours shaping and re-shaping her journals for public display; using them to incubate ideas for her novels. Find out too how biography can, according to Ms. Gammel, provide valuable cultural and historical context within which to interpret, understand and appreciate works of art.

If this still doesn&rsquo;t do it, or even if it does, buy the book, Looking for Anne, written by Irene Gammel who, in addition to owning a delightful Montgomeryesque style, shares many of the characteristics of the heroines she so admires.

William Deverell, has been widely hailed as Canada&rsquo;s greatest &lsquo;literary mystery&rsquo; writer. This from his website: 

"Deverell worked as a journalist for seven years, with Canadian Press Montreal, the Vancouver Sun and the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, where he was night city editor while at the University of Saskatchewan law school and editor of the student newspaper. 
As a member of the British Columbia, Alberta and Yukon Bars, he was counsel in more than a thousand criminal cases, including thirty murder trials, either as defender or prosecutor. He is a founding director, former president, now honorary director of the B. C. Civil Liberties Association.
His first novel, Needles, won the $50,000 Seal Prize in l979 and the Book of the Year Award in l98l. His subsequent novels include High Crimes, Mecca,The Dance of Shiva, Platinum Blues, Mindfield, Kill All the Lawyers, Street Legal &ndash; the Betrayal, and he is author of the true crime book A Life on Trial &ndash; The Case of Robert Frisbee, based on a notorious murder trial which he defended&hellip;Trial of Passion won Canada&rsquo;s 1997 Arthur Ellis prize in crime writing, and the Dashiell Hammett award for literary excellence in crime writing in North America. "

Our conversation explores Deverell&rsquo;s oeuvre in light of the question: How to write a great crime novel? Humour, complex characters, contentious relationships and appropriate use of &lsquo;the clock&rsquo; all feature prominently in Deverell&rsquo;s work, and contribute to what makes it award winning. &nbsp;
Twenty odd years ago my wife and I rented a cottage perched at the edge of the Rideau River for a weekend getaway. I cracked Deverell&rsquo;s Dance of the Shiva shortly after arriving.

After World War II they were joined by the second generation, Charles and Elizabeth. The business began to expand. In response to customers&rsquo; requests, new technical books were added, then Bibles and religious books and finally a complete line of trade books and a large section for children. The business has moved four times to accommodate growth. Today the store covers 30,000 square feet and contains some 300,000 books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">To promote books and reading, Charles had a television program on WEDU, the local PBS station, called "The Wonderful World of Books," and reviewed books on WSUN radio.

Ray and I talk here about book re-printers, early Baedekers, not collecting your own inventory, the explosion in self publishing and authors who want bookstores to carry their works and provide signing events, collecting what you like, and the error of passing up on buying opportunities.]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title> Antiquarian Bookseller Patrick McGahern</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://nigelbeale.libsyn.com/-antiquarian-bookseller-patrick-mc-gahern]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Patrick McGahern has been selling books in Ottawa, Canada since 1969. His store specializes in used and rare books: Canadiana, Americana, Arctic, Antarctic, Travel, Natural History &amp; Voyages, Illustrated &amp; Plate Books, Irish and Scottish History and Literature. More than 30,000 titles are stocked at the <a href="http://www.mcgahernbooks.ca/contact.htm">Glebe store</a>. Thousands of rare, scarce and interesting books are offered through their <a href="http://www.mcgahernbooks.ca/printables.htm">Catalogues</a> which are published six times a year. Almost 10,000 titles are featured in their online database through <a href="http://www.ilab-lila.com/">ILAB</a> (International League of Antiquarian booksellers).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I talked with Patrick recently in his store about the book trade: how it was, how it is, how it will be. About idiosyncrasies, obsessions, buses and booksellers playing psychiatrist and priest; about ILAB and <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/">AbeBooks</a>, and finally, about simply doing the work.</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Patrick McGahern has been selling books in Ottawa, Canada since 1969. His store specializes in used and rare books: Canadiana, Americana, Arctic, Antarctic, Travel, Natural History &amp; Voyages, Illustrated &amp; Plate Books, Irish and Scottish History and Literature. More than 30,000 titles are stocked at the Glebe store. Thousands of rare, scarce and interesting books are offered through their Catalogues which are published six times a year. Almost 10,000 titles are featured in their online database through ILAB (International League of Antiquarian booksellers).
I talked with Patrick recently in his store about the book trade: how it was, how it is, how it will be. About idiosyncrasies, obsessions, buses and booksellers playing psychiatrist and priest; about ILAB and AbeBooks, and finally, about simply doing the work.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Bernard Margolis <span style="font-weight: normal;">is President of the <a href="http://www.bpl.org/guides/history.htm">Boston Public Library</a> (BPL). </span></span>Founded i<span style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,arial;">n 1848, it was the first large free municipal library in the United States. Mr. Margolis has served </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">on the Governing Council of the 63,000-member American Library Association (ALA), and has won many awards including &ldquo;Colorado Librarian of the Year", two John Cotton Dana library public relations awards, and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts&rsquo; &ldquo;Award of Excellence? for his library-sponsored &ldquo;Imagination Celebration."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">He&rsquo;s also a master storyteller as you&rsquo;ll find out. We talk here about libraries as a public good, a culture of words and books designed to help everyone improve their lives, French ventriloquist and originator of the concept of the modern library Alexandre Vattemare (1796-1864), the U.S. as a leader in realizing this concept, immigration and self learning, an informed citizenry as the best defense of liberty, democratic access to information, BPL as the first to have a newspaper room, branch libraries and a separate children&rsquo;s room, the Red Sox and the Yankees, why the ebook hasn&rsquo;t replaced the paperback, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle">Brewster Kahle </a>versus Google and the Internet archive, and the question of whether or not information will be &lsquo;free for all&rsquo; to improve the world.</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Lydia Davis on: Translating Proust</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://nigelbeale.libsyn.com/lydia-davis-on-translating-proust]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lydia Davis is a contemporary American author and translator of French. From 1974 to 1978 she was married to <a title="Paul Auster" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Auster">Paul Auster</a>, with whom she has a son. She has published six collections of short stories, including <em>The Thirteenth Woman and Other Stories</em> (1976) and <em>Break It Down</em> (1986). Her most recent collection is not <em>Samuel Johnson Is Indignant</em><em>, </em>but rather<em> Varieties of Disturbance</em>, published by <a class="new" title="Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Farrar%2C_Strauss_%26_Giroux&amp;action=edit">Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux</a>. Her stories are acclaimed for their brevity, poetry, philosophy and humour. Many are only one or two sentences long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">We talk here, at the <a href="http://bluemetropolis.org/Festival">Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival</a>, about the role of the translator, her Swann&rsquo;s Way, measuring rooms three inches at a time, becoming Proust as an actor might a character, dialogue being more of a translation challenge than description because speech is born of environment and times, and the goal of creating living language that&rsquo;s timeless.</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Lydia Davis is a contemporary American author and translator of French. From 1974 to 1978 she was married to Paul Auster, with whom she has a son. She has published six collections of short stories, including The Thirteenth Woman and Other Stories (1976) and Break It Down (1986). Her most recent collection is not Samuel Johnson Is Indignant, but rather Varieties of Disturbance, published by Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux. Her stories are acclaimed for their brevity, poetry, philosophy and humour. Many are only one or two sentences long.
We talk here, at the Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival, about the role of the translator, her Swann&rsquo;s Way, measuring rooms three inches at a time, becoming Proust as an actor might a character, dialogue being more of a translation challenge than description because speech is born of environment and times, and the goal of creating living language that&rsquo;s timeless.

<p><span style="font-size: medium;" id="lbAuthors2">Cohen&rsquo;s fascination with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill">Churchill </a>began during his time with <a href="http://nigelbeale.com/www.economist.com"><em>The Economist</em></a> in London, shortly after his graduation from <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>. He began collecting Churchilliana in 1969. The publication of this major work is the culmination of 25 years&rsquo; dedicated research. Cohen is the National Chair of the <a href="http://www.cbsc.ca/english/main/home.htm">Canadian Broadcast Standards Council</a>, a lawyer, founding Chairman of the <a href="http://www.academy.ca/national/">Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television</a>, a Genie award-winning film producer, and President of the Friends of<a href="http://www.collectionscanada.ca/index-e.html"> Library and Archives Canada</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">We talk here generally about the art of bibliography, specifically about binding and centriod colour charts, altruism, accessibility, building road-maps, how many bibliographers start off as disgruntled collectors, experiencing the thrill and joy of collecting without having to lay out the dough, bibliography as storytelling, innovative periodical entry descriptions, errata, when to stop, how Cohen always got it wrong, surrendering, and uncharted works bolting from the undergrowth.</span></p>

So Beautiful was published in 2004 by The Porcupine&rsquo;s Quill Press.
We talk here about her stories, my favourites, and hers, bodies in bags, judging one&rsquo;s own work, doing the right thing, frustration, Christian brothers at Mount Cashel, dogs, Kafka at the CBC, the importance of radio and the weather to Newfoundlanders, Brad Pitt and parallel plot lines.
