        <itunes:summary>2009/10/18 Ghostly Talk:  Scott L. here to all our friends and comrades.  We here at Ghostly Talk feel that change in synonymous with life hense the decision that we all made today only a few hours before our scheduled live show tonight.  Ghostly Talk is going on an indefinite hiatus.  Let me be clear, GHOSTLY TALK IS NOT DEAD.  I am sure you have seen other situations where someone or something goes on hiatus.  They announce that and then you NEVER hear from them again.  Let me be very clear again, GHOSTLY TALK IS NOT DEAD.  If you want all of our reasoning for our decision, listen to the latest archive from tonight as I do not want to bore you in this communication.  There is not enough space on the internet to list all of the people we would want to thank thus far for making Ghostly Talk the thing that we are proud to be a part of today.  We have made our point though and Ghostly Talk Project II is dead. Project III is on the way.  How, When, or What?  We have no idea.  That's what keeps this thing interesting.  Thank You.</itunes:summary>
