	<description>The guard shifts this week, as Jeremy takes over hosting duties for Games, Dammit. Since Jeremy was too busy being in meetings, he didn't prepare show notes, so he, Scooter, Jose Otero, and Ryan Winterhalter talk about a bunch of random stuff. Here's a list to illustrate how off-topic this episode gets: Mario Kart 7, a hypothetical Star Dracula Kart, PlayStation Vita and a Black Eyed Pea, the big stick robbery, "Rage guy", James Bond, Superman, Yuji Naka's fishing game, Japanese vacation games, incompetent Ziff-Davis executives, Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike Online, the FFV Four Job Fiesta, FF Tactics for iOS, and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Tune in next week for either normal games podcasting or more off-topic shenanigans.</description>

Our roster this week includes Scooter, Jeremy, Matt, and Ryan; then Jose and Bob bring a special guest from 1UP's past into the studio for a seven man podcastravaganza. Stuff we talk about include the aforementioned price drop, Aliens: Infestation, Catherine, Ghost Trick, MGS 3 Snake Eater 3DS, and how amazingly racist we all are. Also, we get special live demos of Groove Coaster and Jubeat. Until next week!</description>

We talk about all the fighting game news, professional conduct during E3 interviews, Star Fox 64 3D's water effects, water and beaches in games, and how we personally don't pay attention to ESRB ratings.

Games-wise, we chat a bit about older Zelda titles, Deus Ex Human Revolution, LA Noire, and what Matt Leone would change about Bayonetta. We then answer reader queries about our feelings on QTEs, the supposed resurgence of 2D games, "what's the deal with Japan," and the Xbox Live Summer of Arcade lineup. Also, Bob Mackey repeatedly pushes his Marxist agenda onto both the podcast crew and the games industry as a whole (when he's not discussing "the week of hedgehogs").</description>

Then, we feel the curse of being part of a big company with a lot of podcasts, as just when we’re about to do voicemails and reader questions, we get kicked off due to another podcast needing the studio.

At some point, we will have things fixed. Until then, oh well! That doesn’t stop us from talking about Jeremy’s promotion to 1UP Editor-in-Chief and his overall goal for the site, the Supreme Court decision, the truth behind Bungie Aerospace, Call of Duty XP and Respawn Entertainment’s site launch, and even some news about Tactics Ogre’s Yasumi Matsuno and Ubisoft’s I Am Alive! We also talk a bit about Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D, the Uncharted 3 multiplayer beta, and Deus Ex Human Revolution. Have a great July 4 weekend, and do the homework that Jeremy assigns!</description>

	<description>The end of an era! Sorta! We're moving to IGN offices next week, so this is the last episode in the "1UP Admiral's Club." In it, we talk about gaming's love of celebrations (specifically Sonic, Quake, and Bungie), Jeff Green's return to EA (via the rumored Popcap purchase), how Gaikai and Wal-Mart have a nifty demo system, Kinect ads and Halo Anniversary support, and the weird "celebrity" appearances in the Duke Nukem Forever multiplayer trailer. Plus, we chat about Shadows of the Damned and discuss a listener's query about the appropriateness of attacking NYC in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Finally, while there is no official sponsorship, you'll agree that this episode should have been endorsed by Cake Boss. Until the first podcast from the IGN office!</description>

More ruminations about the Wii U, a random tangent about Ghost Recon Future Soldier, some Star Trek, the preponderance of QTEs in modern games, and even more Ninja Gaiden 3. Plus, we rank the "take something from the big screen and put it on the small screen" methods of Transfarring, Wii U, and PS3-to-Vita.

	<description>Wait, this episode of Games, Dammit! is either a little too early, or way late. Either way, it's also short. We (meaning Scooter, Matt, Jeremy, and Jose) recorded this right after our last appointment(s) at E3, and before taking off for a staff dinner. So it's 26 minutes of raw, in-the-moment E3 discussion. What we liked at the show, what we wanted more of, and most importantly: why Jose likes Ninja Gaiden 3 while Matt doesn't. Stay tuned later this week for a full E3 decompression/discussion episode.</description>

	<description>Matt and Scooter return from Pre-E3/Judges Week to talk about games with Tina and Jose. We talk a lot about Modern Warfare 3 and BioShock Infinite, while also touching on titles like Bastion, Renegade Ops, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, Ghost Recon Online, and more. We also talk about our favorite quotes from videogames, running speeds in FPS games, and a whole lot of inside-the-sausage-factory style stuff about reviews. Also, the random Inception noise comes up because we didn't want to name a specific company during one discussion. Until next week!</description>

	<description>Welcome to the split episode this week! In the first half of this podcast, Scooter, Matt Leone, Jeremy Parish, and Jose Otero talk about the whole Sony PSN debacle, a random story about Beyonce cancelling a game, and more ruminations about Nintendo's Project Caf&#233;. Games-wise, we talk about Driver: San Francisco, Dead or Alive 3DS, Square Enix remakes, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution's version of a hyper-competent and powerful FEMA. After answering some questions about chicken'n'waffles and console generations, we switch to the second half, the Portal-cast with Scooter, Jose, Tina Sanchez, and Mike Nelson. That latter half is an hour full of Portal 2 spoilers and random free associations. And Portal 2 voice samples. Enjoy!</description>

This week, we talk about the rash of cancellations, the pronunciation of "Weinstein," and lawsuits.

Questions we tackle include ones about licensed music in games, the overexposure of Kevin Butler, the Street Fighter 2 control scheme, and a bizarre apology that Jeremy doesn't understand. Also, we ask for people to call us and sing songs. Enjoy!</description>

	<description>With Scooter showing the downside of having children and shivering under the covers like a tired soup-craving old man, Frank takes the reins with guest Tina Sanchez to talk about Microsoft's pre-GDC press event featuring such games as Batman: Arkham City, Child of Eden, The Gunstringer, and Sesame Street: Once Upon a Monster. Then we cover the Battlefield and Skyrim trailers, and think all the way back to last week when we saw Telltale's Jurassic Park. Then Frank talks about sandwiches.</description>

	<description>The Games, Dammit foursome are reunited now that Matt Leone and Scooter are back from Las Vegas. Topics for the week include follow-through from the Duke Nukem Titty City discussion, the Dead Island trailer that everyone else talks about, the Smithsonian's game exhibit (and how Frank and Scooter ended up being on the advisory board for a different museum), the fame of Felicia Day, Double Fine's Once Upon A Monster, and the non-development of Mirror's Edge 2. Then we tackle questions about the review process, whether we want to truly see Mass Effect's Tali unmasked, and what sci-fi books would make good adventure games. Also, we briefly break an embargo, but rather than delete the conversation altogether, we edited it to feature dinosaurs in its place. Enjoy until next week!</description>

	<description>We welcome back Matt Leone and get him to deliver some final details on his experience with the Sony NGP (and how Japanese KFCs have a "Krusher" beverage). After that, we talk a bit about Namco's announcements -- ranging from the new Dark Souls and Armored Core titles to the role of the Power Rangers and whether "Unbounded" is a word. Afterwards, we deliver some thoughts on whether we should attend "Duke Nukem's Titty City" next week. Other topics include the new zombie MMO Class3/Class4 from Undead Labs and Microsoft, the rise of Hiphopgamer, a passionate (and lyrical) defense of Gamefan, the price of downloadable versions of retail games, and why Call of Duty isn't like Meet The Fokkers. Because of so many events and things, the show is a bit shorter, and we still haven't figured out what's going on next week due to the DICE Summit, but until we get our act together, keep listening!</description>

	<description>For this week, since Matt Leone is out in Japan, we invite Reviews Editor Justin Haywald to be his stand-in. Despite the one guy who saw and played with the Sony NGP not being present, we still manage to talk some thirty-odd minutes about Sony's new portable, and how it's a miracle that no one else had done a rear-facing touchpad before. Besides the NGP, other topics include: comic books we recommend, racial diversity in videogames, our memories of the Atari Lynx, more storytelling in games, the trouble with doors, and violence in games. Oh, and we finally declare the end of the Elevator Action joke, so don't leave any more messages on that topic. If you wanted one hour and forty minutes of lovable nonsense, this is the episode for you!</description>

Since Frank Cifaldi rejoins Scooter, Matt, and Jeremy in the studio and we all talk about Fallout: New Vegas' Dead Money DLC, Swarm, our musings about CES and Nintendo World, and the PSP2 (along with its "feel-y nipples"). Questions-wise, we tackle topics such as handholding in games, horseriding in Red Dead Redemption versus sailing in Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, a special boardgame from Brenda Braithwaite, M-rated sports games, and way too many voicemails about Elevator Action. Frank gives a special shoutout to the excellent video series Chrontendo, and we even conduct a live conversation with special guest/Oddcast contributor BallsRog. Enjoy!</description>

	<description>What happens when one podcaster goes to CES, you have a new office with a podcast studio that lacks headphones, and you bring in guests from Double Fine? You get this Work-In-Progress-Sounding version of "Games, Dammit!" for the first week of 2011! Subbing in for Frank Cifaldi, we invited Tim Schafer (studio founder) and Lee Petty (project director) from Double Fine to sit and jabber with us. As a result, we have about an hour-and-a-half's hour of talk about games like Minotaur Rescue, Enslaved, Limbo, Dead Space 2, Heavy Rain, and, of course, Double Fine's Stacking. We also have Tim and Lee tackle questions about writing, the funniest thing that's happened to them, and CES memories. Unfortunately, as we recorded this without headphones (still setting up our new office space), we didn't know how our podcast actually sounded until post-production. So unfortunately, while you can get the essence of jokes about Weekend At Bernie's and how it relates to games, the definition of a "scotch nipple," or Lee's office antics at previous studios he's worked at, the reality is that sometimes, we all fade in and out of the podcast depending on how close we're leaning towards the microphone while talking. Oops. Our sincerest apologies for our un-optimal setup this week, enjoy what you can, and we'll have the podcast studio finalized and kinks ironed out for next week.</description>

	<description>It's a Games, Dammit! holiday miracle! We start out thinking that because we're recording early in a short week before heading out for the holidays, that we'd have a short show, but nope, we still fill your ears with nonsense for nearly two hours. Games-wise, we talk about Stacking and Back to the Future -- in addition to each cast member detailing his personal Game of the Year (and the one 2011 he's looking forward to). You also learn that Scooter has a frankly irrational association with the number 12. Besides that, we tackle listener questions about elevator action pitches, time travel paradoxes, whether a game can address a heady issue like the Holocaust, and what is worth a dollar nowadays. And just like your uncle who keeps on ranting long after he's no longer relevant to your conversation, we close out the year by reminiscing about our Ziff-Davis days for way too long. Happy holidays,and we'll be back in 2011!</description>

With a quick substitution of Justin Haywald, we blaze though a somewhat games-packed, with talk about Journey, Uncharted 3, Tomb Raider, Catherine, Final Fantasy XIV, Demon's Souls, and Ni No Kuni (Another World -- which Justin and Jeremy go absolutely nuts over). We tackle questions about the disparity between preview and review coverage, our opinion on videogame music concerts, foreign boxarts, and our favorite JRPGs. All this, plus lots of lovable nonsense such as how much we hate the movie Eat Pray Love or what kind of concerts Matt Leone would attend.</description>

	<description>Just because most of the big blockbuster titles have shipped doesn't mean there's not enough lovable nonsense to podcast about this week. The big thing occupying our minds is our imminent office move, and how our prepwork for said mode has unearthed some awesome treasure from the glory days of print magazines. Games-wise, we talk up Darkstar (and how it features, in Frank's words, "the memory of handsome"), Infinity Blade, Binary Domain, Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, and even more Splatterhouse. Then we chat a bit about Matt's venture to Los Angeles, and our digressions include going from Uncharted to Lethal Weapon, and whether or not there's a massage in Punch-Out!! Questions lead to topics like: NES-era difficulty, why Xbox Live Indies aren't in all countries, how Mass Effect is like Grindhouse, Game of the Year nominations, and how Scooter handles gaming with his kids.</description>

	<description>Welcome to Version 2.0 of our first official episode as "Games, Dammit!" Due to a combination of user error, technical non-know-how, and Jeremy leaving for vacation, this week's episode is at 75% strength with Scooter, Matt, and Frank. There will be lots of references to the "lost" version of this episode (which sounded like Matt and Scooter talking to a mute Jeremy while Frank weaves in and out of the show depending on his excitement and volume), but overall, we cover the same ground. We talk up OnLive, Shenmue City, L.A. Noire, and the goodness of Desert Bus. For reader questions, we discuss plagiarism, why you shouldn't drive and talk at the same time, and the Spike VGAs (don't say "Spike VGA Awards"). Until next week!</description>

	<description>Welcome to the podcast formerly known as In This Thread/4 Guys 1UP/1UP Yours, and now currently being called either "Burger Time" or "USS 1UP Flagship Podcast." For this pilot episode of an all-new podcast, we have Thierry "Scooter" Nguyen on host/showrunning duties along with a ragtag band of fellows such as Frank Cifaldi, Matt Leone, and Jeremy Parish. If there's one way to summarize this episode, it'd be, "lovable nonsense interspersed with some game commentary." Sure, we lay down the basic ideas and format for this podcast moving forward, and we do talk about games like L.A. Noire, Fallout: New Vegas, Solatorobo, Final Fantasy Tactics, and numerous announcements such as new titles from EA and a new Super Monkey Ball. But then we frequently get sidetracked by things such as poetry from the past, the brief loss and rebirth of red M and Ms, our feelings about Gamefan, our advice for covering arcade expos, and just for you, an aural unboxing of some upcoming hardware. All this, plus a plea for reader input and a possible name for next week's episode.</description>

Then it's back into games with Alice's views on Kirby's Epic Yarn, and another round of post-release thoughts on Sengoku Basara. Rousing, you might say. And... you may be right.</description>

Every other big announcement is talked about, too, including but not limited to Microsoft's hardcore Kinect games, The Last Guardian, Shadows of the Damned, Phantasy Star Online 2, and at the end, non-TGS impressions of Pac-Man Championship Edition DX and Kirby's Epic Yarn. "Epic yarn" might be a good name for this episode, too.</itunes:summary>

	<description>Our E3 Day 2 coverage starts with -- what else? -- Nintendo's morning press conference, so we hit all the big points from that show, including but not limited to the unveiling of the 3DS. The Sony press conference was still going on as we were recording, so we keep most of the discussion brief, but there's still room to pontificate on the rest of E3's games and trends. Ken Levine from Irrational Games joins Ray, Matt and Scooter for this midday show.</description>

	<description>Our first day of E3 coverage is focused on Microsoft, whose awe-inspiring (on many levels) events left us wondering if Natal -- now Kinect -- is really what it's cracked up to be. A lot more discussion of Microsoft's Monday press conference follows, including chatting about Metal Gear Solid Rising, Gears of War 3, and all the extra Kinect stuff in between, plus a short rundown at EA's press conference later that day.

    <itunes:subtitle>E3 is mere days away, but why should information take a break?</itunes:subtitle>
	<description>E3 is mere days away, but why should information take a break? We start with some iPhone 4 chat with Jeremy Parish, then move on to game talk with some final thoughts on Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, then preview talk with Rock Band 3, Spider-Man, and more. In news, it's been Mortal Kombat Week, but that's almost overshadowed (in our opinion) by Telltale's upcoming Jurassic Park and Back to the Future games, plus some more E3 bits, like Tomonobu Itagaki's new game, Yakuza 4, and rounding it out with some industry views from EA's John Riccitiello.</description>

First Playstation 3 systems started shutting down around the word, then all Hell started breaking loose around Infinity Ward and Activision. Now we have the official announcement that Portal 2 is coming this year. We break down all those stories plus first-hand look from Nintendo's press summit, first impressions of Shinji Mikami's new shooter Vanquish, and we're joined by the developer of Love to talk about how procedural design could change the way we make games. Finally stick around for the end of the podcast for a look forward to GDC and a very special announcement.</description>

We also go a little further in talking about Nintendo's rumored new consoles along with what Sony can do to shore up their handheld division. Rounding things out we lament about the edits made to the US version of Yakuza 3, and we all gang up on Mark about the splendor of Heavy Rain.</description>

Eat Sleep Play's David Jaffe and Insomniac's James Stevenson join us in the first segment to talk about OnLive, interacting with the people that play their games, and the difficulty in creating products that reach a wide audience. In part two of this two segment episode, the MANGOD himself, Shane Bettenhausen, sits down for a candid conversation about his first year working for publisher Ignition Entertainment.

It also turned out to be a great chance to make some new friends by chatting up some the biggest names in game development. We chat with Peter Molyneux about his ongoing ambitions in game design, Bungie's Brian Jarrard and Marcus Lehto give us a tiny peak behind Halo Reach's curtain and Peter, James, and John tell us all about Crackdown 2. All this and much, much more. Enjoy!</description>

That means an empty office around here, but boisterous Brit and all-around great guy John Davison drops by to talk about his transition back to hardcore games press. He joins David Ellis to discuss the themes that stood out in 2009, and put on their psychic caps to make some bold predictions for 2010. When will the Wii HD be announced? Will the PSP survive the year? When will Facebook take over the games space?</description>

They get right into Microsoft noting highlights like Alan Wake and Splinter Cell Conviction as well as discussing the motion sensing control interface code named Project Natal. From EA there's no doubt that the announcement of APB's new home stole the show and despite an appearance by James Cameron Ubisoft's briefing was most notable for Assassin's Creed 2 only being shown as a trailer. </description>
