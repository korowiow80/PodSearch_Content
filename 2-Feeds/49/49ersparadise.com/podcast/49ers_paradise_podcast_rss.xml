<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - 49ers Shut Out Rams, Get Ready For Falcons</title>

	<description>
49ers fans had quite an exciting victory to bank on, having shut out the Rams 35-0.  It was an interesting game that saw both the offense and the defense evolve and grow.  Beyond that, 21 points came from non-offensive units which made the game that much more interesting to watch.  A physical match up against the Falcons looms for the coming week, and the 49ers will have to get helmets ot the ball to win this coming match up.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - 49ers Improve to 2-0</title>

	<description>
The 49ers were out to prove that beating the defending NFC West Champions was no fluke.  With an epic performance from Frank Gore, who ran for two touchdowns of over 75-yards, and a very strong showing from the defense, the 49ers strangled the Seahawks, and improved to 2-0.  With the sole spot at the top of NFC West theirs, the 49ers get ready to face the Vikings, in what will be a very interesting match up.  Both teams have strong run games, the 49ers defense likely has an edge, and the Vikings passing offense likely has an edge.  This has the makings to be a very good game.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - 49ers start season 1-0</title>

	<description>
The 49ers start the season 1-0 with a win over the Cardinals in a very tough and physical game.  The team had an interesting experience unable to run the ball but a few good calls, and the ability to dig deep eventually prevailed.  The team now will face Seattle for the chance to lead the NFC West.  Something to build on.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - Worry Sets In</title>

	<description>
Having dropped two consecutive games it seems that worry has once again set in around 49ers land.  Has JTO reached his maximum potential?  Can Nolan learn to adjust his scheme to the players talents?  Can Martz find a way to avoid three and outs?
It makes for an interesting dilemma for a team that entered the season influx, and continues to try and patch together a season that could save a number of careers.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - 49ers sign Tollner, can Nolan win back locker room?</title>

	<description>
Head coach Mike Nolan is wrestling with try to restore an offense that has been off-track all season.  As such the team has signed offensive assistant Ted Tollner who formerly coached quarterbacks and was the offensive coordinator for the club.  Team problems run far deeper though, and there are questions as to whether Nolan has lost the locker room.  Speculation towards next season has already begun, and there are hints that Nolan will be stripped of power.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - Heading into the final week before the NFL Draft</title>

	<description>
It's perhaps the biggest week of the NFL offseason as the 49ers and the rest of the NFL head into the NFL Draft.  I am predicting that the 49ers don't sit still at their number 11 pick, as the team tries to either move up using their 7 other picks in the first four rounds or go for some serious value in the second round by dropping back.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - Blow away in The Windy City</title>

	<description>
The 49ers were down 41-0 at half time, far to steep a hill to climb back against.  Turnovers, Turnovers, Turnovers, Penalties and more, this was one of the ugliest games I've ever witness the team play.  How can they rebound against the Vikings? Where can Nolan find solutions?  All that and more in this weeks show.

	<description>
The 49ers lost to the Eagles this past week, but there was plenty to learn from, and plenty of encouraging sights.  In particular Alex Smith had a very good game and made strong decisions with the football.  Of course, there were far too many mistakes too, including another goaline fumble by Frank Gore.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - 49ers lose season opener</title>

	<description>
The 49ers lost their season opener to the Cardinals, but looked much improved over last season.  Quarterback Alex Smith looked like a completely different player from last season, and running back Frank Gore looked like a legitimate threat at running back.  There was still plenty of areas to improve though, particularly on defense and third downs.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - Training Camp Closes</title>

	<description>
The 49ers looked more like what I expect of them this season with the loss to the Cowboys.  First round draft pick Vernon Davis caught his first touchdown pass, but the team was unable to perform on third downs and lacked any threat of a pass rush.  Earlier in the week Jerry Rice officially retired a 49er, and the team traded Kevan Barlow.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - Training Camp</title>

	<description>
The 49ers looked good winning their first pre-season game of 2006. Alex Smith clearly has a better understanding of the team's offense, and has a few new weapons to throw to. The 49ers traded former first round picke Mike Rumph to the Redskins in exchange for a receiver, Taylor Jacobs.

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - Conclude OTA's</title>

	<description>
The 49ers have been pretty busy since the conclusion of the OTA's.  The 49ers have signed 5 of their 9 rookies, and lead the NFL for rookie signings.  Unfortunately, that's about the only positive thing the 49ers have lead the NFL in over the past few seasons. The team is also busy evaluating the supplemental draft and preparing for Fan Day on the 24th of June.

49ers Paradise Podcast - Post Draft Report, Mini Camp Preview
</title>

	<description>
The 49ers had a very busy weekend selecting in the 2006 draft.  The team is believed to have struck gold with its first round selections of Vernon Davis and Manny Lawson.

</title>

49ers Paradise Podcast - 49ers Watch Super Bowl From Home
</title>

	<description>
The 49ers sat home and watched the Super Bowl win by the Steelers this weekend - but what I saw was the perfect mentor for Mike Nolan.  Bill Cowher is a guy that Nolan has so many similarities too, and would likely make a good role model for the 49ers young coach.  I also discuss Joe Montana's lack of attendance at the Super Bowl, and other 49ers issues!

<title>49ers Paradise Podcast - 49ers Lose To Jaguars</title>

	<description>
The 49ers rebounded from the slaughtering the Seahawks dealt them last weekend with a pretty decent game - all things considered of course.

Meanwhile runningback Frank Gore had a really solid game, which of course begs the question, why is Kevan Barlow starting?  All this and more in this weeks Podcast show, including a look at the rumor that Tom Rathman may be returning to the 49ers.
