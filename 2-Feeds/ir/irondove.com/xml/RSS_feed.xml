            <description>FEAR is the worst four letter word out there because it has a sticking power.   “Fear of what?”, you might ask.  Well the answer is as individual as each and every person.  Like snowflakes our fears are one of a kind and like snowflakes they can melt away and become healing waters as soon as we shine the warm light of truth upon them.

May you meet the world with your heart wide open and may you never miss a moment to LIVE Fearlessly!

            <description>The word Courage is a French word that loosely translates as &apos;Passion of the Heart&apos;.  To live from the heart is to love with wisdom and courage; to be brave enough to allow ones open heart to feel all the emotions it has the capacity to feel and to respond with truth and grace.  To follow ones truth (heart) with grace is not rational and it is not logical, it just is.  In matters of life the heart rules.</description>

            <description>Sometimes I go on these mind journeys.    A combination of mind matter, imagination and intuition - wonderings.  Today I wonder why we so easily accept someone else&apos;s dream - the &quot;American Dream&quot; without even wondering if that is really what our heart desires or what makes us feel alive and at peace.  Is the root of all suffering, the root of war desire or memory?</description>

Perhaps if they did, world wide, women and children would be better off, and poverty could be eradicated.</description>

            <title>Duke University Men&apos;s Lacrosse Team Accused of Gang Raping a Young Woman. #210 Thursday March 30, 2006</title>

The dog eat dog mentality of youth sports is not fostering healthy minds or bodies. Perhaps it&apos;s time to rein in our school coaches, administrators and the mainly publicly funded programs that hurt our kids.</description>

We have an infinite number of program choices, and our choices will affect our future and the future of our children. How exactly a new world paradigm, free of disease is to be birthed, depends on women.</description>

            <description>This, in my opinion, is religious fanaticism plain and simple. Abortion is a terrible heart wrenching decision, and a completely personal choice. Around the world women are subject to violations of the masculine principle on a regular basis. There are millions of cases each year where women become pregnant without so choosing.  This is about a woman&apos;s right to self determination. Violence against women, rape and abortion are all integrally related.</description>

            <description>This is an assault against women and women&apos;s rights. It has been reported that over 300,000 woman have reported being raped last year. Only 39 percent of rapes and sexual assault are reported. Over 32,000 pregnancies result from rape every year, and that&apos;s only the ones that are reported. More than half of all rapes occur before the age of 18. In 2004 the CDC reported that 734,965 women were treated and released for acts of violence against women.</description>

Only 39 percent of rapes and sexual assault are reported. Over 32,000 pregnancies result from rape every year, and that&apos;s only the ones that are reported.

            <description>South Dakota Govoner Mike Rounds signed into law the bill HB1215 which basically is the prohibition of any acts that would assist a woman in terminating an unwanted pregnancy and bans nearly all abortions in the state. This is an assult against women and women&apos;s rights. South Dakota has decided to be the first state in the United States to fight the fight. By enacting this legislation in direct conflict with the Supreme Court&apos;s Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in 1973. This is about a woman&apos;s right to self-determination.</description>

Why would the LMDC choose to leave us and our beloved city with some dank dark holes in the ground? This should be a beautiful cathedral built to hope. The World Trade Center should be replaced by The World Peace Center, a place of honor and renewal. Where the over 3000 souls from 92 countries can be remembered and celebrated. We need to build a place where our loved ones will shine and where the world will shine!</description>

Shaira Law and the outrageous aggression towards women can and must be turned around in order for this world to know Peace.  Women, supported by those men who are enlightened enough, brave enough and secure enough in themselves to see through the veil and embrace the beauty that a world including a full partnership of the feminine will bring.</itunes:summary>

            <description>The State Of The Union is pretty apparent. A mother and a congressman&apos;s wife are removed from the people&apos;s house and one is arrested. Four peace activists are jailed on misdemeanor charges for an act of non-violent civil disobedience in 2003. After a jury voted 9-3 for acquittal they were later tried in Federal Court. Not since since the late sixties and early seventies has the government resorted to this type of behavior, suppression, and censorship. SPEAK OUT! </description>

Sometimes we hit specific targets and sometimes there is what the DOD terms as Collateral Damage. That is an antiseptic way of saying we killed innocents. We are sending these drones around the world and really pissing people off.

            <description>Even though we have specific rights detailed by the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights, this Administration thinks it is OK  to eavesdrop on the American Public. The balance of power has become creepy and weird. The government has taken the position that with no meaningful judicial review any American citizen alleged to be an Enemy Combatant could be detained indefinitely without charges or council on the government&apos;s say so. First Yahoo, then Google and your international phone calls then your email and local phone calls. Where does it end?</description>

            <description>Three hundred years ago, the poet Matsuo Basho said Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old, seek what they sought. What did our Founding Fathers seek? Freedom from King George. Sound familiar? In 1776 our Declaration of Independence explained it like this.  Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</description>

Twenty one million people in the us suffer from an irrational fear of Friday the Thirteenth causing an estimated loss of revenue to business of nearly nine hundred million dollars.

            <itunes:summary>Friday the Thirteenth myths include stories about Kings, Popes, Warrior Monks, The Crusades, Women, Spirituality, Worship, The Knights Templar and Ancient Cultures.

Twenty one million people in the us suffer from an irrational fear of Friday the Thirteenth causing an estimated loss of revenue to business of nearly nine hundred million dollars.

            <description>Doing your &apos;Personal Best&apos; is so important. I am always amazed by how many people are willing to do an adequate job; not a good job, not a bad job just an adequate job. It is frustrating on a personal level but when I see it happening in our government I really get discouraged. We have entrusted our politicians with great power and great responsibility and in such matters as the confirmation of Judge Alito I expect one hundred and ten percent from our representatives!</description>

            <description>Us vs. Them. racism, in all forms is such an ugly manifestation of fear. I often wonder how it became so ingrained in our societies. We all bleed, we all breath air, we all desire love. All over the world people talk about Us and Them as if somehow we are different. History books would have little to talk about if it were not for one group fighting another for the right to be right I guess. When will we get it that Us is Them, and we are all one.</description>

The state sanctioned punishment for misbehavior is too easily violence and death. Do we bring further horror upon our selves by taking a life as punishment? We have a responsibility to the people of this country to be good role models. Our own government condemns other governments for what we do ourselves. What does that say about our society?</description>

            <description>The Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund has been proposed to allow for those who are conscientiously opposed to participation in war to allow for proper social contribution without supporting the war machine. Our military budget out spends every other country by more than three hundred seventy billion dollars. If we were to apply one third of the military budget to developing energy independence imagine how quickly we can have alternatives that would no longer require us to be in someone else&apos;s backyard and someone else&apos;s business.</description>

            <description>We grow more corn than anyone in the world. Ethanol Fuel made from corn is a stable reliable proven technology for the production of fuel that can run vehicles that are currently running on our roads. We have the technology, the land, the scientific and engineering know how to make this a reality. It will be good for the environment, create jobs and it will stop our reliance on foreign oil. Forty Percent of the vehicles in Brazil run on ethanol, so what are we waiting for?</description>

            <description>After yesterday&apos;s podcast I started to look into the ADF and I found out some really interesting things. The ADF is a huge sponsor of Rush Limbaugh and spends millions to make sure that Liberal viewpoints like that of Ed Schultz are not heard by our troops. Why, and how can the DOD allow this to go on with our tax dollars? Where is the separation of church and state?</description>

            <description>What are you willing to give up for your freedom? Living in a free society comes with some benefits and some risks. How do you define terrorism, and how does our government define terrorism? Who is keeping track of the secret courts, the wire taps, the background checks, bank and phone survelience. When is safety just too costly? Even in a perfect world you can&apos;t protect against everything. The Patriot Act has extended the powers of the Executive and Judicial branches WAY beyond what seems appropriate in the name of safety and our Civil Rights are at risk.</description>

            <description>Do you like rollercoasters? 456 feet in the air, 128 miles per hour, the ride lasts only seconds. Life is like a rollercoaster. If you really want to get the fullest experience, when you get to the top you have to let go. You have to put your hands up in the sky and let go and embrace the fear. Riding a rollercoaster is really just symbolic. What I&apos;m really talking about is letting go in life, taking chances. Is the hardest thing letting go or is the hardest thing believing that the fall won&apos;t be fatal?</description>

Maybe a lot of things are like that. Inside what we think is reality is a more spectactular and amazing reality just waiting for us to  mature the conception of relationships between one other.  If we keep working on it, anything can happen. It&apos;s a universe of possibility.</description>

            <description>Judge Samuel Alito, the most recent nominee to the Supreme Court is another really strange choice. I wonder if The White House has been doing their homework. It has been reported that he refused to recuse himself from two cases in which he had personal, financial conflicts of interest. Does that really show just prudence? Is this really befitting of a Supreme Court Justice?</description>

But your power can affect the lives of many, by giving joy, peace and friendship.</description>

            <description>Killed In Action over 2000 and counting. The headlines read &quot;Milestone in Iraq, 2000 dead&quot;. The numbers are so deceiving. What about the 7800 wounded and sent home or the 8500 wounded and sent back in? We need to support our men and women over there and make sure our government isn&apos;t minimizing their loss. This is a gigagantic quagmire, the violence is escalating, what is the exit stragegy?</description>

            <description>Harriet Miers withdrew this morning as a nominee for the Supreme Court, and I think that is a very good thing. The fact that she was unwilling to be open and let Americans know who she is and what she is about is not in the best interest of this country. This is a government of the people and by the people, and if you are not willing to tell us who you are you just don&apos;t belong in that position.</description>

            <description>Rosa Parks is an American Hero. A woman who quietly, peacefully, guided public consciousness towards racial equality. To me she is a courageous and inspirational role model. A woman who refused to be marginalized or acquiesce to demeaning treatment. We as a society have come a long way in 50 years, but we have a long way to go. Like Rosa Parks, the champions of our future will be Women.</description>

            <description>It&apos;s so hard when you come home with a newborn. My first baby was so colicky that she cried for four months straight. I couldn&apos;t even imagine a peaceful, happy, contented baby. But one night she stopped crying. She stopped just for a couple of minutes, and I told myself &quot;remember this moment, remember this time&quot; I really locked it in my mind. I hardly remember anything else about her being a newborn but that moment, that sweet moment is mine forever...</description>

Here in New York we are always on Terror Alert. People are wigged out. The Mayor gets on TV and says stupid things. How do we deal? We listen to our Pod of course.</description>

            <description>It has been reported that the talk around the Pentagon and in the halls of Congress is &apos;What to do about the Army&apos;s low enlistment figures for 2005?&apos;. It seems that this year&apos;s recruiting shortfall is in the range of 7,000 to 10,000 soldiers. In response they  have resorted to some very unusual and quite frankly stupid measures to fill their ranks with bodies.</description>

            <description>Today is Columbus Day. Our Nation&apos;s Capital, the District of Columbia, was named for Columbus. Unfortunately, although our children&apos;s school books glorify him as the one who discovered America, he was far from a hero. Columbus was actually a creep. A slave trader and murderous conquer. Why would this government honor him with a Federal Holiday? Surely there are many throughout history who deserve this recognition. He is not one of those persons.</description>

As we, the US continue to assist this country to build a democratic government, we have helped them write into their official documentation a requirement that 25 percent of the parliamentary seats will be reserved for women. Why not here in the USA?</description>

            <description>Everyone is creative, whether or not you consider yourself an artist. I think spirituality is a creative force. Some kind of connection that we all make. You don&apos;t have to be able to draw or paint or compose music to be an artist. It&apos;s this very individual, very personal understanding of the One, the Everything. So many of us over the years have been squashed by a mentor, someone whom we might have looked up to. These hurt our understanding of  creativeness, our personal sense of spirit, and contribute to a hurting world.</description>

Having a limitation does NOT make a person a sub-standard human being. The country has made specific accomodations for others with limitations, why did they forget us?</itunes:summary>

Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.</description>

            <description>Our founding fathers might have been really learned interesting great guys for their time, but in this time the halls of our capital are carved with emptiness for women. Carved in stone are the rights of MEN. There is no mention of Women, no mention of people only Men. All PEOPLE are created equal and all people are entitled to be fairly represented. As we watch the process of the Supreme Court nomination circus we all have to consider these questions.</description>

            <description>I think the whole search thing is a load of crap. Its someone taking my time to make other people feel warm and fuzzy. Perhaps it does make people feel better but mostly its trying to make the masses feel like something is being done. There is a price we pay for Freedom.</description>

            <description>One day, a snowy day I had this revelation of thought, I wasn&apos;t paying attention because I had so much on my mind and I crashed into the car in front of me. I get out of the car and I say to this old man &quot;Im so sorry&quot; and this old man says to me &quot;Don&apos;t Be in Such A Hurry, I&apos;m Worried About You - Slow Down, Don&apos;t Be in Such a Rush!&quot;. And the guy says forget it.</description>

            <description>We connect in a multitude of ways but connecting as a global people is a lot harder to do. It has to be personal, there has to be some familiarity or it&apos;s hard to make the connection. I think that&apos;s why some of these major religions are floundering. They don&apos;t make it personal because it&apos;s very difficult to connect to something that worked 2000 years ago.</description>
