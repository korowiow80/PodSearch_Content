     <title>Irish Dancers Piper Scots Irish Lessons</title>
     <itunes:summary> 
 Irving McNally McDermott www.Irishroots.com
Episode 15. When Kansas City met Denise Irving McNally.
Denise goes way back in Irish Dancing in Kansas City, and
 is a noted performer of both Irish and Scottish dancing.
Now, when the Irish pipe group that was started back in 
the 80's dissolved, I was left with a set of pipes, and so, 
somehow it came to be that those pipes were passed on to 
David, the son of Denise, and he did a fine job with them
 too !  (A much finer time they had with him, than if they
 had stayed with me, quietly hung on the wall !    How did 
that old saying go....(The Pipes that once through Taras 
Halls the soul of music shed, now lie as mute on Taras walls - 
as if that soul had fled....). So it was a good thing that these 
pipes fled to David - you betcha !
And now Denise has taken pity on all of us regular old folks 
who could not stand competition pressure, and she leads a dance 
group right to this day, for the rest of us - and thats a good thing.
By the way, The "Missouri Irish Book" is out and being stocked
 by Sheehans Irish Imports in Westport; The Celtic Ranch in 
Weston; and by the Kansas City Store.  You can't beat that at 
all. And of course I have it on our web page.  There is a lot of 
history there from the 1800's that people aren;t really aware of, 
and I've given it an update for this 2007 edition.
I am also adding to our web page, with illustrations and even 
Irish Songs from Missouri, the songs of course sung by none 
other than Peter Reilly Adams - who has no equal in this community.  
So be sure to take a look at that here soon.  For those on our blog, 
the new pages under design are at:
http://web.mac.com/irishpat/Irish_Roots_Cafe/Podcast/Podcast.html
Come support the "Wellie Race" at Weston on 
October 14th at 8 AM.   To register call The C eltic 
Ranch at 816-640-2881 or Toll Free 1-877-386-2358. ... 
There will be a free travel voucher for a trip to 
Ireland to be awarded in a drawing - you don't 
have to win the race !   Everyones thank you to 
the Celtic Ranch for supporting the activities up 
there in Weston so well !

Its as easy as :   a Hayn,  a do,  a Tree   and thats about 
as far as I have gotten.....
Now for the interview with Denise..........

 Our interview today was first broadcast our 'Irish Families' podcast

different format, but the interview is so good it had to appear in our
Kansas City series, including the appearance of Puff Daddy at the
Deli......

 We'll be going back as far as the 1880's today, so sit back and
relax and we'll listen to a few stories about Brownes Irish Market,
the oldest business in K.C., and the oldest Irish business in North
America as confirmed by the Irish Trade Board .... and just in case,
the festival at Brownes was set for June 16, the year 2007.
