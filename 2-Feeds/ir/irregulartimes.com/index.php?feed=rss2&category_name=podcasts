			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you need an example of how very out of touch <a href="http://irregulartimes.com/santorumbuttons.html">Rick Santorum</a> is, consider the recent declaration Santorum made about marriage:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Marriage is defined and has always been defined as &#8216;one man and one woman.&#8217; We simply cannot allow 50 different definitions of marriage.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>We cannot allow 50 different definitions of marriage?  Why not?  For that matter, what choice do we really have?</p>
<p>Most people who have been married for any length of time understand that every married couple has its own definition of marriage. There are millions of different definitions of marriage in the America today.  That&#8217;s life.</p>
<p><a href="http://irregulartimes.com/lgbtsantorum.html"><img src="http://irregulartimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/lgbtsantorum.jpg" alt="rainbow anti-santorum button" title="lgbt against rick santorum" width="199" height="193" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-31974" /></a>Rick Santorum does not live in the same world you and I inhabit.  Santorum lives in a fantasy land where everyone has the same idea about what marriage is supposed to be, and how it&#8217;s supposed to work.  It&#8217;s an outdated <i>Leave It To Beaver</i> model of marriage that wasn&#8217;t even accurate back in the 1950s.</p>
<p>We need a President of the United States who can deal with the world as it is, not the world as he wishes it could be.  In the real world, several states recognize that the scope of marriage is bigger than what&#8217;s imagined in Rick Santorum&#8217;s small vision.  </p>
<p>Marriage is not and has not always been defined as only between one man and one woman.  That&#8217;s a fact.  If Rick Santorum still doesn&#8217;t feel ready to learn the facts, that&#8217;s his business.  Let&#8217;s just not allow him to bring his ignorance into the White House.</p>

<p>But specifically, who would this better Republican presidential candidate be?</p>
<p>If you could pick a Republican politician to challenge Barack Obama this year, who would it be?</p>
<p>The GOP politician you choose can be from our own times, or from far back in history.  From the start, though, let&#8217;s eliminate Abraham Lincoln from consideration.  We all know that Republican Abraham Lincoln was marvelous &#8211; he&#8217;s just too obvious a choice.</p>
<p>What other Republican leader would you choose to beat Obama, and why?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re just moving toward the end of the 2010 Yule holiday season now, but one thing is already clear: This is the year when <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/irregulargoods.497291473">Krampus</a> was introduced to a large number of people living in the USA.  December 2011 promises to be the first winter holiday season when Krampus breaks through to popular recognition.  From there on, he may rival Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Why is Krampus?  He&#8217;s a traditional European spirit of mischevious revelry around the time of the Winter Solstice.</p>
<p>Christians depict Krampus as a nasty devil who tortures, murders, and damns naughty children to eternal torment.  I don&#8217;t buy that simplistic vision of Krampus, however.  </p>
<p>Krampus was a part of solstice celebrations long before Christmas ideology came in with its moralistic stamp.  Krampus can&#8217;t be truly satanic.  He predates Satan.  </p>
<p>As a trickster, Krampus exists outside of simple divisions between good and evil.  Maybe Krampus isn&#8217;t a <i>goodie goodie</i> like Santa Claus, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s evil.</p>
<p>Krampus allows for a more adult kind of moral ambiguity than Santa does.  Let&#8217;s face it &#8211; <a href="http://www.irregulartimes.com/krampusgoodsound.mov">Krampus</a> is more fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irregulartimes.com/krampusgoodsound.mov"><img src="http://irregulartimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/krampusnotsobad.jpg" alt="" title="krampus is not so bad video" width="391" height="397" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-24650" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s Friday, and I suppose that I could be writing about the ongoing Democratic revolt against Barack Obama and his tax cuts for billionaires.  Heck, maybe I will &#8211; later.</p>
<p>For right now, I&#8217;ve got the morning to drink a bottle of beer that I&#8217;m very excited about.  It&#8217;s a seasonal &#8220;imperial&#8221; beer, a &#8220;helles lager&#8221; from the <a href="http://southerntierbrewing.com/beers.html">Southern Tier Brewing Company</a> in Lakewood, New York.  I&#8217;m prepared for something interesting, just from the name of this brew &#8211; it&#8217;s called Krampus lager.</p>
<p>Krampus, you may remember, is the <a href="http://irregulartimes.com/index.php/archives/2010/12/05/merry-krampusnacht/">ancient spirit of Yule mischief</a>, descended from the distinguished pagan lines of Loki in the north and the satyrs in the south.  Imagine that kind of spirit in a beer!</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>

<p>My guess is that the package doesn&#8217;t include a loofah and bath salts, but I could be wrong.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taken from the <a href="http://www.inicom.com/hibakusha/akiko.html">testimony of Akiko Takakura</a>, Hiroshima survivor:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irregulartimes.com/akikotakakura.WMV"><img src="http://irregulartimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/akikotakakura.jpg" alt="" title="akiko takakura hiroshima testimony" width="275" height="281" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17234" /></a></p>
<p>After the air-raid the alarm was called off, I walked from Hatchobori to the Bank of Hiroshima in Kamiya-cho. I arrived at the bank some time around 8:15 or so, and signed my name in the attendance book. When I was doing my morning routine, dusting the desks and things like that, the A-bomb was dropped. All I remember was that I saw something flash suddenly&#8230; </p>
<p>It was like a white magnesium flash. I lost consciousness right after or almost at the same time I saw the flash. When I regained consciousness, I found myself in the dark. I heard my friends, Ms. Asami, crying for her mother. Soon after, I found out that we actually had been attacked. Afraid of being caught by a fire, I told Ms. Asami to run out of the building. Ms. Asami, however, just told me to leave her and to try to escape by myself because she thought that she couldn&#8217;t make it anywhere. She said she couldn&#8217;t move. I said to her that I couldn&#8217;t leave her, but she said that she couldn&#8217;t even stand up. While we were talking, the sky started to grow lighter. Then, I heard water running in the lavatory. Apparently the water pipes had exploded. So I drew water with my helmet to pour over Ms. Asami&#8217;s head again and again. She finally regained consciousness fully and went out of the building with me. We first thought to escape to the parade grounds, but we couldn&#8217;t because there was a huge sheet of fire in front of us. So instead, we squatted down in the street next to a big water pool for fighting fires, which was about the size of this table. Since Hiroshima was completely enveloped in flames, we felt terribly hot and could not breathe well at all. After a while, a whirlpool of fire approached us from the south. It was like a big tornado of fire spreading over the full width of the street. Whenever the fire touched, wherever the fire touched, it burned. It burned my ear and leg, I didn&#8217;t realize that I had burned myself at that moment, but I noticed it later&#8230;</p>
<p>The whirlpool of fire that was covering the entire street approached us from Ote-machi. So, everyone just tried so hard to keep away from the fire. It was just like a living hell. After a while, it began to rain. The fire and the smoke made us so thirsty and there was nothing to drink, no water, and the smoke even disturbed our eyes. As it began to rain, people opened their mouths and turned their faces towards the sky and try to drink the rain, but it wasn&#8217;t easy to catch the rain drops in our mouths. It was a black rain with big drops&#8230;</p>
<p>They were so big that we even felt pain when they dropped onto us. We opened our mouths just like this, as wide as possible in an effort to quench our thirst. Everybody did the same thing. But it just wasn&#8217;t enough. Someone, someone found an empty can and held it to catch the rain&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe I didn&#8217;t catch enough rain, but I still felt very thirsty and there was nothing I could do about it. What I felt at that moment was that Hiroshima was entirely covered with only three colors. I remember red, black and brown, but, but, nothing else. Many people on the street were killed almost instantly. The fingertips of those dead bodies caught fire and the fire gradually spread over their entire bodies from their fingers. A light gray liquid dripped down their hands, scorching their fingers. I, I was so shocked to know that fingers and bodies could be burned and deformed like that. I just couldn&#8217;t believe it. It was horrible. And looking at it, it was more than painful for me to think how the fingers were burned, hands and fingers that would hold babies or turn pages, they just, they just burned away. For a few years after the A-bomb was dropped, I was terribly afraid of fire. I wasn&#8217;t even able to get close to fire because all my senses remembered how fearful and horrible the fire was, how hot the blaze was, and how hard it was to breathe the hot air. It was really hard to breathe. Maybe because the fire burned all the oxygen, I don&#8217;t know. I could not open my eyes enough because of the smoke, which was everywhere. Not only me but everyone felt the same. And my parts were covered with holes. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blue Dog Democrats make me shake my head and wonder.  Don&#8217;t they know that the reason that the Democrats won control of the White House, and tightened control over both houses of Congress, is that they promised <i>progressive change</i>?  </p>
<p>Apparently not.  Those <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/blue-dog-democrats">Blue Dogs</a> just keep on voting with the Republicans, helping the GOP block the very legislation, like health care reform and a bill to confront climate change, that brought the Democrats electoral success in 2008.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that Blue Dog Coalition members like <a href="http://thatsmycongress.com/house/repGordonTN6111.html">Bart Gordon</a> and <a href="http://thatsmycongress.com/house/repTannerTN8111.html">John Tanner</a> are having to drop out of their re-election campaigns.  They can&#8217;t convince Democrats to donate to their campaigns any more, because they&#8217;ve been running with the Republicans for so long.</p>
<p>Yet, along comes U.S. Representative <a href="http://thatsmycongress.com/house/repMarkeyCO4111.html">Betsy Markey</a> this week, announcing that she&#8217;s <i>joining</i> the Blue Dog Coalition.  Her political perception is so out of focus that she doesn&#8217;t realize she&#8217;s jumping onto a sinking ship.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for progressives to <a href="http://www.irregulartimes.com/bluedoghowl.mov">howl against the Blue Dogs</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the week in review podcasts out there are broadcast on Friday, just when people are getting ready to tune out for a relaxing weekend, and to forget about what&#8217;s just taken place.  I&#8217;m creating this podcast instead on a Monday, because I believe that people ought to actually <i>use</i> the news to inform their active citizenship, speaking back to power.</p>
<p>In <b><a href="http://www.irregulartimes.com/irregularweekreviewoct309.mp3">this podcast</a></b>: Senate Democrats behaving badly, on <a href="http://www.irregulartimes.com/c-17spendingrollcall.html">C-17 military waste</a>, <a href="http://irregulartimes.com/index.php/archives/2009/09/29/democrats-join-republicans-to-defeat-health-care-reform/">health care reform</a> and <a href="http://irregulartimes.com/index.php/archives/2009/10/02/senate-democrats-join-republicans-to-kill-protection-from-government-spies/">government spying against Americans</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Why did Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln vote to kill Barack Obama's health care reform centerpiece, the public option?  The answer has a lot to do with her sources of campaign finance reform.<div class="read_more"><a href="http://irregulartimes.com/index.php/archives/2009/09/30/why-did-blanche-lincoln-vote-against-the-public-option/">read more</a></div>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senator <a href="http://thatsmycongress.com/senate/senatorBlancheLincolnAR111.html">Blanche Lincoln</a> is running for re-election next year as a Democrat.  The Democrats have been campaigning for years on the promise of universal health care, or at least health care reform that would make medical insurance affordable for all Americans.  The public option is a widely popular way to expand health care coverage.  Given that, <a href="http://www.irregulartimes.com/blanchelincolnhealth1.mov">why did Senator Lincoln use her vote in the senate to kill the public option in the Senate&#8217;s health care reform legislation?</a></p>
<p>Look at where Lincoln is getting the money for her 2010 re-election campaign if you want to find the answer.  She has raised <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00008092&#038;cycle=2010">over 4 million dollars for her campaign</a> so far, and most of it comes from political action committees and funneled corporate money.  A great deal of that money comes from organizations and individuals who profit from the health care status quo.  </p>
<p>Of all U.S. Senators, Blanche Lincoln is the top recipient of donations from companies that manufacture and sell medical supplies.  Lincoln also takes a great deal of money directly from political action groups set up by insurance companies.  These are the sources of the money she&#8217;s using to run for re-election &#8211; so it makes sense, in a cynical kind of way, that these are the interests she is protecting by voting against Barack Obama&#8217;s public option.</p>
