			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This is my Review of the Yamaha P155. The P155 features the highest amount of feel authenticity obtainable in Yamaha key boards these days: the “Graded Hammer Effect” (GHE). Compared to more affordable Yamaha digital pianos which commonly feature the slightly less realistic “Graded Hammer Standard” (GHS), you can be assured that the finger exercising you perform on this digital piano will very easily prepare you to advance on to a proper grand piano in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029RTYDQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399369&#038;creativeASIN=B0029RTYDQ">Click here for more info or to buy now from Amazon.com!</a><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029RTYDQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=zachblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0029RTYDQ"><img src="http://learntoplaypianokeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/p155.jpg" alt="" title="p155" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-896" /></a><br />
Graded-hammer means that the keys feel lighter the higher upward the notes go, just as on a standard piano. Yamaha has incorporated input from professional pianists into its “Graded-Hammer Effect” feature, and the result? Once again: simply astounding. The difference between “Graded-Hammer Standard” and “Graded-Hammer Effect” is subtle enough that novice pianists might never notice it. But rest assured that the difference is there. If you ever intend to pursue the grand piano as a concert-level pianist in future, the higher price for the GHE will be justified.<br />
Yamhaa P155 Review &#8211; Other features</p>
<p>As is standard with most digital pianos today, you can connect headphones to play to your heart’s content in the middle of the night. You can record your wonderful playings or compositions and transfer them to a USB device. The MIDI ports allow you to work with this digital piano as a MIDI controller, or to connect with your personal computer using a USB-MIDI cable. There’s also the split and dual settings, and also a small number of effects (reverbs and brilliance) you&#8217;ll be able to apply to each voice. And as you might anticipate from any Yamaha digital piano, it comes with a built-in metronome as well.</p>
<p>Weighing at forty one pounds, this isn&#8217;t the most light-weight electronic piano around. It does not include many other voices or tones besides the high-quality piano tones. If you&#8217;re serious about learning to play the acoustic piano, or are an accomplished pianist searching for a digital substitute, then the Yamaha P155 is perfect, especially if you wouldn&#8217;t want your piano to get bogged down with additional costly “features” which only serve as distractions.<br />
Yamaha P155 Review &#8211; </p>
<p>Bottom line</p>
<p>The 2 most crucial aspects for anyone who’s used to an acoustic piano, or who wants to play one in future, are realistic feel and realistic sound. The P155 digital piano is probably the cheapest pianos you will get for such high amounts of realism. In reality, it is currently the most inexpensive Yamaha piano which features the legendary “Graded Hammer Effect” keyboard: essentially the most realistic touch/feel mechanic currently available from Yamaha today. Other digital pianos having this function can certainly cost more than $2000!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This is my review of the New Korg SP170 digital piano that just came out. The product features include:</p>
<p>* The two skillfully sampled concert grand piano sounds capture all the nuances of the performer&#8217;s touch.<br />
* A total of ten sounds are provided, including electric pianos, harpsichord, organs, strings, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VO0F1W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B002VO0F1W"><img src="http://learntoplaypianokeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/korgsp170.jpg" alt="" title="korgsp170" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-691" /></a><br />
* Our new Natural Weighted Hammer Action (NH) faithfully reproduces the touch of an acoustic piano.<br />
* The SP-170&#8242;s compact body houses a robust, built-in speaker system to deliver a deep and powerful sound.<br />
* Two headphone jacks allow for parent/child or student/teacher private practice, or for just sharing with friends</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VO0F1W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B002VO0F1W">For the best place to buy the Korg Sp170 just Click Here!</a></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Rmm-UceBMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a flexible keyboard synth, this is simply not it. This is a piano. The different sounds are fun (Fender Rhodes is excellent), but that&#8217;s not why I bought it or even what I expect to do with it. Couple of things I was trying to find: awesome piano samples, along with a realistic touch. This Korg does those exceptionally well, a lot better (IMHO) than the Yamaha P95. The integrated speakers in fact sound pretty good in the living room, however will not work for stage. One criticizm: if you&#8217;re a pro-audio guy, you&#8217;re left to guess if the output quality through the headphone jacks is stout enough to have an instrument level signal (technical details are not available, anywhere, that I could find), so I took no chances and purchased a Whirlwind pcDI to stick before the mixer. If you&#8217;re looking for a piano, this definitely does it, and (if you like it) you&#8217;ll not find better sounds or touch at any cost. </p>
<p>Eventhough it has no buttons the Korg SP170korg sp 170 still have a few tricks up in it’s sleeve.</p>
<p>You can tune and transpose the notes. Tuning is useful if you are playing with other instruments which have a difficult time tuning properly. Transposing is fantastic in the event you only know how to play a specific song in one key but have to have a different key to match a singers range. Again this is achieved while using the 3 top keys down technique from before.</p>
<p>You can also find gorgeous selectable reverb and chorus effects. These added excellent depth into the sounds. Try adding chorus in the electric piano sounds and you should get a big broad professional sound or reverb in the strings to have a lush concert hall sound.</p>
<p>The piano is usually a pleasure to play. Korg have created new natural weighted hammer action keys. The Korg SP 170 is weighted such as a real piano, using a weightier touch within the lower ranges and becoming lighter and lighter from the higher keys. The same as the Yamaha NP-30 but this time with real weighted keys and not simply spring back.</p>
<p>Over all I would say that Korg has again gave us a great product for a good price. If you are interested in learning more about the Korg SP170 then just go here to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VO0F1W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B002VO0F1W">Amazon.com to find out more.</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This is my review of the Yamaha PSRS550 that is a sixty one Key Arranger Workstation which gives you all the features and quality of a professional arranger you need, but for a price you really can afford!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U5PA7C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B001U5PA7C">For the best place to buy the yamaha PSRS550 Click here!</a><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U5PA7C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B001U5PA7C"><img src="http://learntoplaypianokeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/yamahapsrs550.jpg" alt="" title="yamahapsrs550" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-684" /></a><br />
If compared to the other inexpensive key boards, the PSR s550 has pretty good sound. The sound by itself, though, doesn&#8217;t live up to the higher standadrds of the s910 and tyros, but it really gives you the basics. One of the main issues with the s550 is the fact that there&#8217;s no guitar setting. It is a major disadvantage when you are wanting to achieve that real guitar sound in your style accompinent. The best thing to do is to attatch a simple mixer so that your right hand sounds could get that clear rich sound. This won&#8217;t help you though for the accompinent sounds. Overall, it is a fantastic way to start your career with solo right hand sounds, however it can&#8217;t be depended upon for your style accompinents.</p>
<p>Product Features</p>
<p>* Sound Quality &#8211; large selection of realistic Voices &#8211; vast selection of 294 realistic instrument voices<br />
* LCD displays lyrics, chords, notation &#8211; Have you ever played a song and wondered what it would look like as sheet music?<br />
* Ease of Operation &#8211; Mixer Function, Music Database, One Touch Settings, Registration buttons<br />
* Sixteen tracks are provided to accommodate sophisticated melodies, chord accompaniment and rhythm parts.<br />
* Three effects blocks &#8211; tailor your sound &#8211; 35 Reverb, 44 Chorus and 237 DSP effects plus 26 Harmony and 5 preset types of Master EQ.<br />
* The PSR-S550B can display the score to a song whether it comes from the Internet</p>
<p>The s550 offers you great features for an entry level professional. This includes the four main variations, 8&#215;8 registration banks, style creator, and also the 16 track sequencer. I have found the one touch setting to generally be fairly pointless because you can not set your own voices. As I mentioned before, a guitar mode would certainly increase the keyboard, and without one it is tough to generate real live guitar sounds. One of the largest problems is the absence of a freeze button. It&#8217;s very annoying. I find it quite hard to swith sounds with all the registration keys because doing so gets in the way of the style playing. I&#8217;d venture to state that this is just about the biggest drawbacks of the s550.</p>
<p>Over all I would say this is a great keyboard for the price. As I said before there are some things that I would have liked to have seen done better on this keyboard but for the most part it will do just about everything I have needed it to do.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This is my own review of the Korg X50. This is a sixty one key Korg synthesizer which features the HI (Hyper Integrated) sound engine which is used on the world-famous TRITON series. It gives you pro-quality sounds within the ultra-compact body. This unique keyboard synthesizer offers unbeatable convenience plus pleasure for live performance as well as song production. The 64 MB PCM memory consists of a broad range of sounds, including piano, strings, guitar, as well as synth sounds. Together with 512 sound Programs, as well as 384 ?Combinations? that let you use up to eight Programs with each other, you can start experiencing a various selection of terrific sounds right away. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019Z7MOC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0019Z7MOC">For the best place to buy the Korg X50 Click here!</a></p>
<p>The effect section lets you simultaneously use four effects (one insert effect, 2 master effects, and one EQ), and provides a full selection of effect types such as reverb, chorus, and delay. Best of all, the X50 is compatible with Korg?s TR line of music workstations so you may share sounds and songs with Korg buyers all-around the globe. The X50?s ultra-portable design also makes it possible for greater availability to artists on the go with out having to sacrifice quality.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019Z7MOC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0019Z7MOC><img src="http://learntoplaypianokeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/x50korg.jpg" alt="" title="x50korg" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-677" /></a><br />
Overall User Ratings<br />
Overall:            9 out of 10<br />
Features:            9 out of 10<br />
Quality:            8 out of 10<br />
Value:            9 out of 10<br />
I Want It:            9 out of 10<br />

Ease of Use:            9 out of 10<br />
Support:            7 out of 10 </p>
<p>The sound on this keyboard is actually excellent and also with aftertouch and also velocity&#8230; works even better. Effects seem strong and you have 89 of them to pick from. It might be nice to have a sampler however for an additional $200 you can get the korg TR61 that&#8217;s basically the x50 with sampler. I havnt experienced any kind of static or relics from mine. Almost all appears to be crystal clear. I personally use mine for industrial/symphonic/ebm sounds and it is capable of making most things ive wanted until now. And really when I look at the price I paid, I doubt I could get any greater soundong board and not pay out an additional $500 or so for it. Making it easily among the best for it&#8217;s cost. (except maby the micro X that is about $550 which is simply an X50 packed into something about the size of the microKORG) </p>
<p>If you want more information on the Korg X50 and are interested in purchasing this keyboard then just go here to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019Z7MOC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0019Z7MOC">Amazon.com to find out more.</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This is my review of the Korg PA588. The Korg Pa588 is a digital piano and arranger keyboard that is for any no-compromise pianist who would like to add an extra dimension to his or her performances. Korg created the Pa588 keyboard to be sonically identical to the Pa500. The Korg Pa588 digital piano provides Korg&#8217;s 88-note, top-of-the-line RH3 graded hammer piano action, an attractive stand, a half-damping pedal, and also a more robust speaker system, offering a total instrument bundle. To complement this great piano action, Korg also equipped the Pa588 keyboard with the unbelievable piano sound of their flagship C-720 Concert Digital Piano.

Features<br />
* 88 keys; RH3 Graded Hammer Action with Velocity<br />
* 80 Voices, 80 Oscillators &#8211; Filters with Resonance -Three band EQ for each track<br />
* 4 Stereo Digital Multi-Effect systems &#8211; 124 Effects types &#8211; Final semi-parametric three band EQ<br />
* 880 Sounds, including a Stereo Piano and GM Level 2 compatible Sounds, 56 Drum Kits<br />
* SD/MMC card slot for data backup.</p>
<p>It all starts with sound. The Pa588 allows for unmatched expression and articulation. One example is, a simple guitar sound might play a harmonic, a mute note, a soft note, a loud note, a pull-off &#8211; all determined by simply how hard you strike the key. They have even added the noise of the pick lifting off of the string as you release the key. Overblown and triple-tongued flutes, brass slides and falls, all of the facets which provide a musical instrument having its very own identification are preserved and simply duplicated at a performance by the natural gestures of different dynamics while you play. Along with as much as sixteen oscillators to choose from per note in one sound, the breadth as well as range of realism is really incredible. Based on the very same EDS (Extended Definition Synthesis) that powers the favorite M3, the Pa588 features top-quality sound. Above 882 fully editable sounds are preloaded, representing the whole collection of musical instruments out of almost every genre, each bursting with depth, nuance, subtlety, accuracy, and richness.</p>

<p>The sounds with this keyboard are generally quite wonderful lots of instruments are outstanding. If you play jazz, latin, traditional styles, you will unlikey distinguish the sounds from that of real instruments. Some synth sounds are also very good. On the other hand, it&#8217;s not a keyboard for electronic music production (in my opinion). Actually, you have got only several different pads (other sound like slight variations), a large number of bass sounds (including incredibly peculiar ones), and several really decent leads. Orchestral strings are quite exceptional. Not fully authentic in any keyboard range, yet they sound very rich and extraordinary. Orchestra tutti is a great multilayered sample with timpani and crash cymbals heard at high velocities. Nylon guitars sound very realistic. Guitar strums come in 2 top octaves and they&#8217;re traditionally used in styles. There are a number of drum kits, many of them have multi-layered snares and toms. Also there are some good ethnic sounds, like koto, shamisen, bag-pipes, etc. A collection of accordion and harmonica sounds have some very realistic ones (including authentic accordion bass). There is a wide array of electric pianos in this keyboard. Tine piano RX is a high quality rhodes-like piano. Grand piano preset is nice, but soft. There is no &#8220;fortissimo&#8221; layer, therefore you won&#8217;t have the extremely bright piano chords. Some instruments sound very plain, like harp and soprano saxophone. You might need to replace these with custom sample-based sounds. Also, be sure to install the latest OS and media library, it seems that many instruments have become better in version 1.60.</p>

<p>A great deal of excellent functions. Polyphony as well as multitimbrality could possibly be limiting for people spoilt by today&#8217;s hardware. Yet if you do just like people did in the 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s: multitrack recording (one by one), this will be good. Mod sequencing is the finest feature. The vocoder sounds awesome as well. Being able to be able to record is a good plus. The Sound editor/librarian is a must in my own opinion, it makes editing a piece of cake compared to the front panel<br />

<p>Everyone is so obsessed with the retro sounds in the microKorg. The R3 is perhaps all things to all people. There is that retro flavor that is the craze right now as well as neo &#8211; electronica and stomping hardhouse and trance sounds. For affordable money you have a REAL synth. Consumers tell you it sounds too digital. I say it sounds just like a synth instead of a toy. The R3 is fantastic for the shear fact that the sounds you don&#8217;t hear yet. The microKorg sound (that the R3 has too people) is almost all over the place. This is much more versatile.<br />
For more information on the Korg R3 then just go here to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TUIE22/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B000TUIE22">Amazon.com for the best price.</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This is a review of the Yamaha YPG535, this is probably one of the finest piano for the price you can find. At merely under $600 you get every thing you would probably want in a keyboard piano. First off I&#8217;d say Yamaha YPG 535 88-Key Grand Piano Keyboard is a tremendously good looking piano keyboard. this keyboard looks fairly excellent, and Yamaha had lived up to its standards with this one. this stunning musical instrument simply just looks extremely state of the art. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DTEKYO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B001DTEKYO">Click here for the best place to buy the Yamaha YPG535!</a><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DTEKYO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B001DTEKYO"><img src="http://learntoplaypianokeys.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ypg535.jpg" alt="" title="ypg535" width="400" height="144" class="alignright size-full wp-image-601" /></a><br />
It is quite a big board with 88 keys and due to that, a person can very easily bang it upon walls and door frames on accident while packing it around. But never be shocked if you drop it and it still works. It is made to be that sturdy. The keyboard is actually extremely light, also. The stand is also very durable. When bolted, the piano keyboard seems like 1 with the stand, and won&#8217;t go off no matter what you do. Well, unless you unscrew it.</p>
<p>The sound on this particular keyboard is just simply great. The Live! Grand Piano is about as realistic a sound as you can get. The panel sustain and the sustain pedal are two unique, yet practical effects. Though there are nearly Five hundred additional excellent voices, for me personally I am in love with the Sweet! Soprano saxophone.. Looks like Kenny G is out of a job. It features instruments of which I had never heard of, never thought existed, and never thought that anybody might truly possibly be able to play. Awesome</p>
<p>The keys are generally really easy to press, almost weightless, providing out those fantastic clear, clean solid sounds, particularly the middle octaves. And you are not limited to piano voices, either. The interesting ones include maracas, electric piano, strings and even UFO. This makes it specially enjoyable to experiment with. The super metronome feature permits you to decide on the beat of accompaniment. However, whenever you turn the volume all the way up, there seems to be a very little bit of distortion as in case the loudspeakers can not handle all the pressure, and it is difficult to be able to hear individual notes. Of course, just switch the volume down to medium-high or even lower, and you resolve that problem.</p>
<p>The Yamaha PSR E423 is a all around great keyboard to look into. If you are interested in finding out more about this keyboard then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DTEKYO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=zachblog-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B001DTEKYO">just go here to Amazon.com to learn more</a>.</p>
