		<description><![CDATA[<p>Alas&#8230; things are winding down here in the Flimm Building.  Producer Ellen Smithee has edited the final piece of the season, and now it&#8217;s time for the nerds to look back on 12 years of being the world&#8217;s most successful podcast.  So many memories.  The boys recorded the podcast live on location from San Francisco (twice), they went to the Toronto International Film Festival, they talked to Charlie Sheen right in the middle of his now legendary meltdown, but most importantly they came together weekly, high atop this historical art deco building in midtown Manhattan to create the podcast beloved by thousands.</p>
<p>Some might wonder what topics would then be appropriate for the final episode ever of Lesser Nerds.  After much discussion it was finally decided the best thing to discuss would be the fact that everything you read in the first paragraph is complete nonsense.  It&#8217;s time to blow the doors off and answer the burning questions asked by many listeners (in their heads at least)&#8230; (we hope)<br />
Does the Flimm Building really exist?  Who are all those fictional employees the boys refer to?  How many people actually called into the show?  How many Ask Art submissions were legit? Those questions and much more will be answered on the final, supersized edition&#8230;&#8230; of Lesser Nerds.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Big news is coming out of the Flimm Building this week.  The Lesser Nerds are closing up shop.  But not before two more episodes of the world&#8217;s most popular podcast.  And this week&#8217;s episode is chock full of many favorite LN topics.  For example, when is it appropriate to update your Twitter feed?  If you&#8217;re Usher, apparently, right in the middle of being on television in front of millions of people on SNL.  The nerds debate the douchiness of tweeting on live TV.  There&#8217;s no debate however on the wisdom (or lack thereof) of the man who had four magnets surgically implanted in his arm so he could wear his ipod there.  Just one problem&#8230; ipod designs change pretty much every year.</p>
<p>One thing that apparently doesn&#8217;t change every year is the world of CCTV.  The news that most of the world uses the same kind of security camera has led to those very cameras being hacked.  Crashboy fills us in on the implications.  Art however is more amused with this week&#8217;s news that Captain Morgan is getting sued for&#8230;. piracy?!  And speaking of piracy, what would you guess is the most pirated TV show of 2012.  Amazingly enough, it&#8217;s not &#8220;My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding&#8221;  If you&#8217;re looking for a clue, think of the show that features the most midget sex.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what the best time is for you to post that tweet if you really want it to get some traction?  It turns out 1-3pm on a Monday is your best bet. (you&#8217;re welcome)  But wait&#8230;. what about if it&#8217;s your Tumblr blog?  The nerds give you all the answers.</p>
<p>All that plus&#8230; a history of the vibrator, the porn capital of America, and&#8230;. naked therapy.</p>

<p>There seemed to be lots going on in the world of memes this week.  Crashboy gives us a primer on &#8220;Annoying Facebook girl&#8221;, Fat emo, and &#8220;I can count to potato.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys didn&#8217;t talk about the Instagram buy when it happened a few weeks ago, but they make up for it this week with a rather fascinating and perhaps schizophrenic article which tells you why Instagram is destroying photography&#8230;. and why you should be using it!  Something you might not want to use however is the new spray from France which comes in a lovingly designed Phillipe Starck bottle and will supposedly get you instantly drunk.  The boys examine the culture of drinking across the pond and discover we still have a way to go before we get civilized.</p>
<p>All that plus, a topless club soils Charlie Sheen&#8217;s shiny reputation, a high priced escort spills the beans on her tiny clients, and why a tiny visit to a religious website might be more dangerous to your computer than a visit to Wifey&#8217;s World.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s show is what Art would call a &#8220;dog&#8217;s breakfast&#8221; of a show&#8230; lots of things all happily mixed up together.  For example, did you catch the White House Correspondent&#8217;s Dinner?  The Commander In Chief was in fine form, but the nerds wonder at his hot media hand in a slow jam week.</p>
<p>If you left your girlfriend for another woman, most smart people would likely stay away from said ex, yes?  Not so for Marek Olszewski, who two days later went to visit his ex because&#8230; well&#8230; she was also his dentist.  The results are fairly predictable, but the denouement to the story makes it all worth the while.</p>
<p>Something that might not have been worth the while is the hundreds of thousands of dollars a Ukrainian woman spent on surgery to turn herself into a real life Barbie doll.  The nerds discuss the creepiness factor of the results and discover one of them isn&#8217;t quite as disturbed by it all.</p>
<p>Crashboy expresses a bit of surprise this week that 8 of the top 10 highlighted quotes from Kindle books come from &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221;  (He was hoping for a few more from &#8220;Max Headroom&#8217;s Guide To Life&#8221;)  The nerds go over a few of the inspirational quote and weep at the wonderment of the poetry teenagers are capable of while in the act of brutally killing each other.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The two weeks off have done nothing to make the nerds any less persnickety.  (Fun fact, this week marks the first time in LN history the word &#8220;persnickety&#8221; has even been used.  Please mark your score cards appropriately.)  One thing the lads were NOT doing much of during their time off was playing Draw Something.  And it seems they were not alone.  According to people with the time to count these sorts of things, the rate of play for the former number one game on the app store has plummeted.  Art and Crashboy discuss the possible reasons.  No such examination is needed however for the post mortem on the DVD.  The fingerprints on that knife wound belong solely to Netflix and its streaming siblings.  The numbers for 2012 seem to be pointing in the direction of not only a decrease in DVD viewing, but perhaps its complete demise.</p>
<p>If you had spare time on your hands, how would you spend it?  Would you rig up a complex motion sensor array high above Fifth Ave. and convert the data into a real time, real world version of the classic video game Frogger?  And then leave the game on the side of the street so random passers by can wonder what it is and start playing it, not knowing the full extent of the technology in their hands?  If not, then chances are we didn&#8217;t talk about you this week.<br />
Are kids today growing up addicted to porn?  A few right leaning MPs in Britain seem to think so, and they&#8217;ve table legislation to do something about it.  Crashboy however takes issue with their definition of &#8220;addicted&#8221;, and Art takes issue with the definition of &#8220;porn&#8221;.  And while the boys are at it, they give you a few warning signs that you might be a sex addict.  (interestingly, excessive Frogger play does not crack the top ten)</p>
<p>All that plus, the stroke that turned a man gay, the current technologies your kids won&#8217;t ever use, and one listener gives a full hearted defence of the joys of online dating.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Every year April 1st brings two things without question: dumb April Fool&#8217;s Day jokes on various news websites, and Crashboy bemoaning the advent of dumb April Fool&#8217;s Day jokes on various news websites.

<p>One thing that was NOT a prank was Mattel&#8217;s announcement last week that they will be producing a &#8220;bald friend of Barbie&#8221;, the idea being to provide a sense of inclusion to children suffering from various diseases which cause them to lose their hair.  The nerds discuss.</p>
<p>One child who needs no help feeling included is Charlie.  By gnawing on his brother&#8217;s finger he bit his way towards a cool half million dollars.</p>
<p>The lads have much to say about the fairer sex this week.  For example, did you know women lose interest in sex earlier than men?!  (they were shocked too)  It all comes down to millions of years of genetics.  At least, that&#8217;s what their wives are telling them.  And if they do find themselves single again, they would get a chance to use the very real and very creepy &#8220;Women Around Me&#8221; app. (if it ever makes its way back to the app store)</p>
<p>Apple looks to have a few things up their sleeve, according to some of their recent patent filings.  The nerds have a look at some of the more interesting ideas coming out of Cupertino, including the virtual certainty of a 3D camera, and the more speculative advent of &#8220;haptic feedback&#8221; (yes, that will be explained.)</p>
<p>All that plus, a history of the breast enlargement, iAshton, and privacy, politics and putzes on Capitol Hill.</p>

Well, the good news is you&#8217;ll no longer be paying more for 3D movies.  At least one cinema chain has decided to even the price gap between 3D films and their 2D cousins.  The bad news?  The gap will be fixed by raising the price of all the other films.  Looks like we all have reason #24601 not to go to the movies and stay home to stream them.  After all, this year we&#8217;ll be in the majority, according to industry projections that tell us what we already knew &#8211; the disc is dead.</p>
<p>If you ever wondered what effect love has on your brain, you&#8217;re far from being the first one.  It turns out the effect is similar to&#8230; cocaine?  A piece in the New York Times this week lets us know exactly what happens to our nerve center when love steps in the door.  And in case you wanted to know when exactly love would be stepping OUT the door,&#8230;. you can plan on that happening one Friday this summer. At least, that&#8217;s the word according to Facebook whose algorithms are predicting you will have a very bad weekend in July.</p>
<p>Ah, the phone booth.  That quaint little throwback to a simpler time and a simpler phone.  One man thinks they should be returning.  Well, at least the &#8220;booth&#8221; part of it.  The nerds discuss the pros and cons of finding a quiet place to have that clandestine call.  And speaking of rejigging old designs, it seems the folks at AT&#38;T have designed a new GPS friendly steering wheel that won&#8217;t distract you quite as much as you try to find that address.  In fact, it&#8217;s VERY friendly&#8230; it vibrates!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>While you might think the nerds&#8217; week off was March break related, it actually was to give Crashboy time to truly savor his new iPad 3/HD/3.0/Nextgen.  And savor he did.  Crash gives us a quick overview of his new toy, and explains why he wouldn&#8217;t have been one of the people taken in by Gizmodo&#8217;s trick of giving people an iPad 2 and telling them it was an iPad 3.  For one thing, the burn marks on his lap are a testament to one of the device&#8217;s unadvertised new features.</p>
<p>Art has always been the mashup lover in this relationship, so he was surprised this week by Crashboy&#8217;s love of a completely mindblowing concoction between as disparate artists as you could imagine. Yes&#8230; imagine.</p>
<p>Back in 1956, the nerds interviewed Cyprian, the man behind IJustMadeLove.com to find out just what was so interesting about going online to update the world about your extracurricular activities.  It turns out, he might have something worth looking at.  The boys break down the numbers and find a massive gaping hole between fantasy and reality.</p>
<p>Sometimes when cruising around the internet, one comes across things that defy description or explanation.  Such was the case when Art stumbled across a rare and&#8230;. fascinating picture of Henri Toulouse-Lautrec.  It&#8217;s kinda hard to describe.  You might just want to take a look for yourself.</p>
<p>All that plus&#8230; ripping apart an Apple TV, chewing on Chewbacca&#8217;s tepid Twitter, and the death of Encyclopedia Britannica. (well, the really heavy version of it)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s iPad day!  And much like the first iPad release 37 years ago, the nerds are LIVE ON LOCATION for the big announcement.  (hopefully they won&#8217;t be put next to the bathroom yet again)  And as they wait for Tim Cook to take to the stage, there are some other items to discuss&#8230;.</p>
<p>Just when you thought it was safe to go back on your PS3, Sony has been hacked again.  This time however, it&#8217;s not YOUR personal information the thieves were after.  No no no, this time it was simply a little trifle&#8230;. $250 million worth of unreleased Michael Jackson back catalog.  The folks at Sony have been waiting for the other shoe to drop in the form of online leaks, but so far it seems like the thieves are sitting on their booty. (as it were)</p>
<p>Speaking of thieves, online piracy got a lot more organized and contentious this week with the &#8220;official&#8221; announcement that most torrent sites want to change the format people use to post video.  All of this is an attempt to make the results more idevice friendly.  But this hasn&#8217;t sat well with some long time pirates who are grumbling about the change.  The nerds discuss.</p>
<p>Do you remember that part in &#8220;Return Of The Jedi&#8221; when Luke referred to the ewoks&#8221;?  Actually you don&#8217;t,&#8230; since the words &#8220;ewok&#8221; was never said once in the film.  The boys look at a list of some pop culture moments most people remember incorrectly.</p>
<p>Would you like a Chia Obama?  Perhaps a Chia Abe Lincoln.  They can both be yours now with the release of some good ole&#8217; U S of A plant based kitsch.  Art gives us his suggestion for the origin of the Chia head, and Crashboy give his suggestion for how they might want to improve the Statue Of Liberty version.  And If Chia pets are not on your gift list, might we suggest a portrait of Whitney Houston made entirely out of prescription pills.  Sadly, such a thing exists thanks to the artist who created similar works out of Amy Winehouse and Courtney Love.</p>
<p>All that plus, twisted wifi, Lesbian Mountain, and every geek&#8217;s dream,&#8230; nerd panties.</p>

<p>If you live in Atlanta, congratulations.  You live in the engagement capital of the world.  This according to Facebook which shockingly enough managed to have a bit of data on hand to run down the list of cities in the U.S where people are most likely to get engaged.  Who knew Ted Turner was actually cupid.</p>
<p>Have you watched The Simpson&#8217;s lately?  Yeah, neither have the nerds.  But it turns out it might not be as bad as you&#8217;re imagining.  Two sites this week gave us possible reasons why we no longer think Homer is funny, and they don&#8217;t really have much to do with content. (hint: you grew up)<br />
OK, so if you&#8217;re not watching The Simpsons, surely you must have tuned into to Whitney&#8217;s funeral this weekend?  Anyone?&#8230;..  The boys look at a few funerals for famous people who dies before 50, and discover that post death marketing was around long before the days of Mad Men.</p>

Have you watched The Simpson&#039;s lately?  Yeah, neither have the nerds.  But it turns out it might not be as bad as you&#039;re imagining.  Two sites this week gave us possible reasons why we no longer think Homer is funny, and they don&#039;t really have much to do with content. (hint: you grew up)
OK, so if you&#039;re not watching The Simpsons, surely you must have tuned into to Whitney&#039;s funeral this weekend?  Anyone?.....  The boys look at a few funerals for famous people who dies before 50, and discover that post death marketing was around long before the days of Mad Men.

All that plus, how Target lives up to its name, how Twitter has completely reshaped comedy, and one of the nerds throws down to Cougar Town creator Bill Lawrence.</itunes:summary>

<p>Is Hollywood crying foul when they blame bit torrent for their current financial woes?  It certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the first time the movie industry tried to place the blame for their misfortunes wherever they could.  But now, a new school of thought suggests delayed international release dates are more to blame for falling revenue than piracy is.  The nerds discuss.</p>
<p>Is there an ideal point for a space station?  Is it on the moon?  Is it somewhere else?  Does Newt Gingrich have the answer?  There seems to be an internet flame war happening between rival PhDs who all think they have the best answer to the pressing questions of mankind building summer homes in space.  It turns out the best solution might just have come from Officer Scott.</p>
<p>What is your favorite TV spin off?  More importantly, what happened to the TV spin off?  Since the heydays of Maude, Flo, and The Facts Of Life, it seems the fine art of cashing in on a show&#8217;s success died around the time of Frasier.  The lads look at a few examples of spin offs that you should be thankful you never saw.</p>
<p>All that plus, Apple&#8217;s cynical Whitney gambit, Nazis from space, and Art&#8217;s Cougar Town turn around.</p>

(no pun intended)  It&#8217;s a cornucopia of love and sex related goodness on this week&#8217;s show.  Starting with a listener advisory&#8230; if you&#8217;re using the Lo/Ovral-28, Norgestrel birth control pill, you might want to ease up a bit on the extra curriculars for a while, seeing as how the pills have been recalled! You can maybe use the spare time to update your online dating profile.  After all, online dating is now in its glorious post stigma heyday.  And there are lots of things you can do to refresh your profile and increase your chances of finding the future ex Mr or Mrs. You.</p>
<p>The nerds touch on some&#8230;. sensitive bedroom topics this week, having come across a few sex related injuries that have their legs tightly crossed under their Flimm Building issued office desks.  But not everything is cringe inducing.  For example, did you know the secret to a long and happy marriage is actually two holidays a year and 11 cuddles a week.  It&#8217;s true!  Science told us so!</p>
<p>All that plus, Crashboy&#8217;s too tight pants, the 16 types of people on Facebook, and why you might want to stay away from hookers in their 60s. (like you needed a reason)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Well, in last week&#8217;s &#8220;strike&#8221; episode the nerds did promise jackassery upon their return, and they are men of their word.  So they have reemerged after single handedly getting the controversial bill to die.  Well, ok, they had a bit of help from some site called Wikipedia, as well as a few million outraged grassrooters who didn&#8217;t want the boys in Washington messing with their intertubes.</p>
<p>Considering the questions coming out of Crashboy this week, you might wonder if he&#8217;s been getting close with da ganja.  How else would you explain his query regarding how better to improve the human body through non existent genetics?  It does however lead Art to ask that age old question&#8230; invisibility, or flight?</p>
<p>Some people have written in to say we talk about iPhones way more than we talk about Blackberry.  We&#8217;d like to remedy that.  If only there was some sort of big news coming out of the hallways at Research In Motion that would facilitate a conversation regarding the future of the &#8220;other&#8221; smartphone.  I guess we&#8217;ll just have to try and make something out of this minor shuffle they came up with this week.  No biggie.</p>
<p>Apple wasn&#8217;t exactly quiet either this week.  In fact, it&#8217;s quite possible they might have taken the first steps towards changing the way we go to school.  The nerds take a hands on look at iBooks 2 and the future of the text book.  The verdict?  Well,&#8230; listen and see.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Art is big enough to admit that he has a problem.  When he is out for dinner, his iPhone is a third wheel.  Thus he jumped on the bandwagon of &#8220;The Phone Stack&#8221; this week.  Want to know what that is?  Have a listen and find out how he DIDN&#8217;T end up paying for dinner.</p>
<p>The music industry seems to be even more complex with each passing week.  How do they even keep track of &#8220;sales&#8221; anymore?  What is a &#8220;sale&#8221;.  To help the nerds make sense of it all, music historian Alan Cross pops by the Flimm building to discuss that, as well as the birthday of David Bowie, and just where the audience participation lyrics in Billy Idol&#8217;s &#8220;Mony Mony&#8221; might have come from.</p>
<p>Did you get a new tv over the holiday?  If you did, it&#8217;s likely to be outdated in just a few months.  Then again you probably already knew that.  The CES show is just around the corner and TVs will be front and center as some of the biggest names in electronics converge on Las Vagas to show their wares.  But as the nerds reveal, the CES itself is on the verge of needing some life support of its own.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re a big producer of beverages like,&#8230;oh&#8230; let&#8217;s say PepsiCo for example, and some guy sues you for finding a mouse in his Mountain Dew, what would your best argument be?  Let&#8217;s hope it was better than Pepsi&#8217;s actual defense which is&#8230;. well, listen and judge for yourself.</p>
<p>All that plus, Microsoft helps you avoid the &#8220;ghetto&#8221;, Crashboy learns who the f*@k Cee lo Green is, and how Facebook can help you even after you&#8217;re dead.</p>

<p>A new study this week tells us that you&#8217;re more likely to lie if you&#8217;re texting, but Art calls bulls#!t on the study which limited itself to only&#8230;.. stockbrokers!??</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a question&#8230; if you work as a secretary in a high school, and one of your students comes up and asks for your autograph, and you ask him what for, and he tells you it&#8217;s because he saw you in some porn films online, and then the school board gets wind of it and fires you&#8230;. what&#8217;cha gonna do?  Well, if you&#8217;re in Quebec, you&#8217;re just going to start your own porn business!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that time of year when most magazines and websites are looking back on the year, and one of the main things to do is pay homage to the people we lost.  2011 saw the demise of one of the biggest names in tech, but there are a few others you may not have heard about who left us this year.  The boys give props to a few people who changed your life but you&#8217;ve never heard of.</p>
<p>Art was confused this week.  It must have been the egg nog, but who else would have been unsure as to whether or not the site cats4gold.com was actually legit.</p>
<p>All that plus, a cold war secret revealed, one of the boys has a man crush on Ryan Gosling, and the Japanese world champion of&#8230;&#8230; well&#8230;. you might just want to listen and find out.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Did y&#039;all have a nice holiday?  The nerds sure did.  Those who listened to last week&#039;s show might be wondering what happened with young Miss Carlson&#039;s desk, and Crash daughter&#039;s Elf On The Shelf.  Fortunately, the lads update us on these and other essential festive goings on.  Including what it would sound like if those holiday objects around your house were given the gift of speech.

A new study this week tells us that you&#039;re more likely to lie if you&#039;re texting, but Art calls bulls#!t on the study which limited itself to only..... stockbrokers!??

So here&#039;s a question... if you work as a secretary in a high school, and one of your students comes up and asks for your autograph, and you ask him what for, and he tells you it&#039;s because he saw you in some porn films online, and then the school board gets wind of it and fires you.... what&#039;cha gonna do?  Well, if you&#039;re in Quebec, you&#039;re just going to start your own porn business!

It&#039;s that time of year when most magazines and websites are looking back on the year, and one of the main things to do is pay homage to the people we lost.  2011 saw the demise of one of the biggest names in tech, but there are a few others you may not have heard about who left us this year.  The boys give props to a few people who changed your life but you&#039;ve never heard of.

Art was confused this week.  It must have been the egg nog, but who else would have been unsure as to whether or not the site cats4gold.com was actually legit.

All that plus, a cold war secret revealed, one of the boys has a man crush on Ryan Gosling, and the Japanese world champion of...... well.... you might just want to listen and find out.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The nerds are back!  (Well, Crashboy is)  And just in time for a supersized episode and a heaping helping of some festive nerdy pudding.  It seems the folks over at &#8220;Duh&#8221; magazine have been at it again, since they released a study this week making the shocking claim that children frequently prefer the box rather than the toy inside.  Children apparently have very little connection between dollar value and awesomeness when it comes to their gifts.  Ahhh, would that the rest of the world could take their lead.  The nerds take advantage of the fact their children don&#8217;t listen to the show to dish on what the younger nerds will find under the tree this Sunday.</p>
<p>While on the subject of kids, the boy peruse a list of things you probably believed as a kid.  It turns out that Art still believes your face &#8220;will freeze that way&#8221;.  However, the nerds show their somewhat warped side by each revealing one unique thing they believed as a child. (hint, they involve witches and tar)</p>
<p>Do you know what you&#8217;re getting your mom for Christmas?  If not, just pop on over to &#8220;The Giftinator&#8221;, a flow chart from the folks at Mashable that lets you pick mom&#8217;s perfect gift depending on her degree of tech savvy.  Its fatal flaw?&#8230;. assuming mom&#8217;s have a degree of tech savvy.</p>
<p>Good news for the boys&#8230;. a new study this week reveals that swearing is actually good for you, or at least good for relieving  pain.  The release of the foul word seems to also release pain within your body.  All this can be found within the awesomely titled professional publication, the &#8220;Journal Of Pain&#8221; (yes, it actually exists) (yes, we looked it up)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All that plus, what&#8217;s a ringtone?&#8230; what&#8217;s object permanence , and what the hell is &#8220;daddy butter&#8221;.  All on the special Christmas edition of Lesser Nerds</p>
