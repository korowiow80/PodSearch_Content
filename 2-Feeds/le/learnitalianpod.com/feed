		<itunes:summary>Learn Italian with LearnItalianPod.com &#8211;   Several VIP Members (thank you Luis, Sandra, and Carmen) have requested that we dedicate a lesson to the hugely common Italian little words &#8220;NE&#8221; and &#8220;CI&#8221;. Just listen to two native Italians speaking and good chances are you will hear the two little words &#8220;NE&#8221; and &#8220;CI&#8221; repeated several times. &#8211; &#8220;NE&#8221; and &#8220;CI&#8221; are called &#8220;idiomatic&#8221; words because, even if they act as pronouns, they are particular to the Italian language and cannot be translated literally &#8211; and yes, they are a &#8220;must-know&#8221;! 
So, let&#8217;s learn, once and for all, everything we need to know about these two super important words and let&#8217;s practice a lot of very useful Italian words, sentences, and grammar rules that are sure to make your Italian better. Enjoy!

This one is entitled &#8220;To Stay or To Be: That Is The Question&#8221;. Several LearnItalianPod VIP Members have requested that we explained why and when the verb &#8220;stare&#8221; (to stay) is used versus the verb &#8220;essere&#8221; (to be). Although both &#8220;essere&#8221; and &#8220;stare&#8221; mean &#8220;to be&#8221;, they are not interchangeable, and this can create a bit of confusion to students of Italian. &#8212; So, let&#8217;s shed some light on these two verbs and let&#8217;s try, once and for all, to answer the question: &#8220;To Stay or To Be?&#8221;.

		<itunes:summary>Learn Italian with LearnItalianPod.com &#8211;  Learn Italian with LearnItalianPod.com &#8211;  Episode #15 of LearnItalianPod &#8220;5 Minutes A Day&#8221; lesson series is now live! This one is entitled &#8220;To Stay or To Be: That Is The Question&#8221;. Several LearnItalianPod VIP Members have requested that we explained why and when the verb &#8220;stare&#8221; (to stay) is used versus the verb &#8220;essere&#8221; (to be). Although both &#8220;essere&#8221; and &#8220;stare&#8221; mean &#8220;to be&#8221;, they are not interchangeable, and this can create a bit of confusion to students of Italian. &#8212; So, let&#8217;s shed some light on these two verbs and let&#8217;s try, once and for all, to answer the question: &#8220;To Stay or To Be?&#8221;. Enjoy!

<p>- Then he adds: &#8220;I&#8217;ve recently spent one entire month in Italy, and one of the things I&#8217;ve noticed is how much Italians use the verb &#8216;fare&#8217; (to do, to make), and how many Italian idiomatic expressions use this verb, where English use other verbs. I think that a lesson about this verb is in order, Jane &#038; Massimo&#8230; do you agree?&#8221; </p>

This one is entitled &#8220;Che Bella Figura!&#8221;. Italian author Beppe Severgnini in his interesting book &#8220;La Bella Figura &#8211; A Field Guide To The Italian Mind&#8221; says that only in Italian does there exist an expression like &#8220;fare bella figura&#8221;. It corresponds to the English &#8220;to look good, to make a good impression&#8221;, but it literally means &#8220;to make a good figure&#8221; and it&#8217;s more of an aesthetic judgment (and it also says a lot about how Italians think and act). &#8212; Practice this lesson, and discover how you can make a &#8220;bella figura&#8221; and impress your Italian friends!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Episode #10 of LearnItalianPod &#8220;5 Minutes A Day&#8221; lesson series is now live! This one is entitled &#8220;Che Bella Figura!&#8221;. Italian author Beppe Severgnini in his interesting book &#8220;La Bella Figura &#8211; A Field Guide To The Italian Mind&#8221; says that only in Italian does there exist an expression like &#8220;fare bella figura&#8221;. It corresponds to the English &#8220;to look good, to make a good impression&#8221;, but it literally means &#8220;to make a good figure&#8221; and it&#8217;s more of an aesthetic judgment (and it also says a lot about how Italians think and act). &#8212; Practice this lesson, and discover how you can make a &#8220;bella figura&#8221; and impress your Italian friends!

VIP Member Lisa sent us one of the most entertaining email we&#8217;ve ever received. She says: &#8220;I read this article in the New York Times about an Italian bank keeping wheels of Parmesan cheese as collateral for bank loans to cheese makers. I was blown away by this but not really surprised because Italians are so resourceful! What a brilliant way to make loans available for cheese makers by allowing their aging cheese to guarantee their loans! I think this would make a great lesson as well as a cultural surprise for your listeners, Jane and Massimo!&#8221; </p>
<p>You said it, Lisa, Italians can surely be resourceful, and what an example you brought up! So here it is, a Culture Shot about banks, loans, Parmesan cheese, and, most important, about the worldwide famous &#8220;arte di arrangiarsi italiana&#8221; (the Italian art of going with the flow). Enjoy!</p>

Longtime VIP Member Patricia from Boston sent us a terrific email.

Laura, a great friend who lives in Florence, Italy, sent us a wonderful email. She says: &#8220;I&#8217;m about to get married with the love of my life, a nice and charming Italian man, and  I couldn&#8217;t be any happier! But let me tell you&#8230; I had no idea a wedding cost so much money here in Italy until I started planning mine! I read that couples in Italy are forking out the equivalent of two years&#8217; salary to pay for their wedding day, and I found it to be true! I believe this could be a great subject for one of your Culture Shots, Jane &#038; Massimo&#8230;&#8221; Absolutely, Laura! So today, let&#8217;s learn a thing or two about this &#8220;wedding day spending madness&#8221; that Italians have caught, and let&#8217;s take a look at the &#8220;dark side&#8221; of the wedding day&#8230; a bleeding wallet!

Most of the time, I don&#8217;t know how to start a conversation, and I end up asking &#8220;yes or no&#8221; kind of questions, so the conversation is over before it begins. Add to it that when Italians speak, they speak fast! &#8211; Or, to try to be nice with me, they speak English!

So, let&#8217;s find out how to ask someone to speak slower, to keep speaking in Italian, and finally, let&#8217;s learn and practice a few &#8220;icebreakers&#8221; that are sure to keep the conversation going.
