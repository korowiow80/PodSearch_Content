            <title>The New Legal Battle over Song Rights</title>
            <description>A little noted change in copyright law 35 years ago is starting a multi-billion dollar battle today between musicians and record companies.  This provision gives artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan and Barbra Streisand the right to reclaim ownership of their work and pocket all the profits, but record companies are singing a different tune.  The industry says master recordings and profits belong to them in perpetuity.  Where is this legal debate going? Listen as Attorney and Lawyer2Lawyer co-host, J. Craig Williams, along with Attorney and artist advocate Kenneth Abdo of the Lommen Abdo Law Firm and Attorney and author Steve Gordon of Steve Gordon Law discuss the intricate details of this fight over copyright law.</description>

EMA, this was by no means an ordinary term.  Attorneys and co-hosts Bob Ambrogi and J. Craig Williams welcome Tony Mauro, Supreme Court correspondent for The National Law Journal, American Lawyer Media, and law.com and Amy Howe, editor of SCOTUSblog, to look back at the 2010-2011 term, the Justices, spotlight the biggest cases of the term and look ahead to the upcoming term.</itunes:summary>

            <title>The North Carolina Racial Justice Act</title>
            <description>When the North Carolina General Assembly passed the Racial Justice Act in 2009, it guaranteed that no individual would be put to death because of racial bias within the state’s justice system.  Since then, there’s been a battle in the North Carolina legislature to repeal it. What’s behind this debate?  Some say clogged courts and unfounded claims by death row inmates. Attorneys and co-hosts Bob Ambrogi and J. Craig Williams, along with  Cassandra Stubbs, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Capital Punishment Project and James E. Coleman Jr.,  the John S. Bradway Professor of Law at Duke University Law School and Co-director of Duke&apos;s Wrongful Convictions Clinic, take a look inside the issues. They explore the great debate, the repeal and what this means for inmates on death row.</description>

            <title>Two Appointments &amp; the Future of the NLRB</title>
            <description>Recently, President Obama appointed two union lawyers, Craig Becker and Mark Pearce to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) creating a labor law controversy. Some say that the addition of Becker and Pearce will restore balance, while others, like business groups, fear their influence on the board will cater to unions on big issues. Co-host and Attorney Bob Ambrogi welcomes Nancy Schiffer, Associate General Counsel with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, (AFL-CIO) and Attorney Charles I. Cohen, senior counsel in Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius’ Labor and Employment Practice, to get their reaction to the recess appointments of Becker and Pearce to the NLRB.</description>

            <description>A three and a half year government investigation in Ireland, called the Murphy report, revealed a cover-up of three decades of clergy sexual abuse in the Catholic church.

McGonigle, a victim of clergy abuse and victim’s advocate and Vincent Shannon, Senior Partner of Shannons Solicitors in Dublin, Ireland. They discuss the investigations into allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of priests, the Vatican’s tepid response, legal jurisdictions versus canon law and what victims of clergy sexual abuse can do legally here and abroad.</description>

19-year old Allison Myrick was stabbed to death  -  her ex-boyfriend charged with murder. Authorities and family members revealed details including two restraining orders which did not prevent this tragic crime.  Attorneys and co-hosts Bob Ambrogi and J. Craig Williams welcome Attorney Marsha Kazarosian from the Kazarosian Law Offices and the Honorable Judge Eugene M. Hyman from the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California, to explore what could have gone so terribly wrong. They will  look at how the legal system, lawyers, legislators and others can better protect victims in abusive relationships and how we as a community can prevent these tragedies.

Owen, a partner in Fulbright &amp; Jaworski L.L.P., to take a look at New Federal Rule of Evidence 502 and see how this new rule will affect litigation and litigation costs as well as clients.</description>

            <title>Unmasking the Patent Troll Tracker Blogger</title>
            <description>What are the implications of a blogger writing about someone anonymously? Last month, the burning question on everyone’s mind in the patent world was finally answered when the identity of the author of the anonymous, Patent Troll Tracker Blog, was revealed as Rick Frenkel, an IP Director and in-house patent attorney at Cisco Systems. Law.com blogger and co-host, J. Craig Williams, gets two different perspectives from the experts.  In the first segment, Craig welcomes Attorney Raymond Niro Sr., the attorney who was once a target of Frenkel’s blog. In our second segment, Craig speaks with the popular patent blogger, Dennis Crouch from Patently-O, to get his perspective on the Troll Tracker and the dangers of blogging anonymously.</description>

            <itunes:subtitle>The Southern California Fires</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>The California wildfires ripped through parts of Southern California last week destroying anything in their path and leaving many homeless. Join Law.com bloggers and co-hosts, J. Craig Williams and Bob Ambrogi, as they get first-hand accounts from three San Diego Lawyers affected by the fires: Attorney Mark C. Zebrowski and Katherine L. Parker both from Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP and Attorney Dan Hull, from Hull McGuire PC. On Lawyer2Lawyer, we will take a look at Morrison &amp; Foerester’s, “Helping Handbook”, which provides legal information for victims of the fires, discuss how law firms are coping with this disaster, the legal issues surrounding the fires, and take a look ahead at what is next for firms affected by the fires and how they are dealing with the aftermath of the fires legally.</itunes:summary>

            <title>9/11 Anniversary and Comair Flight 5191</title>
            <description>This week on Coast to Coast we would like to remember the victims of 9/11 and their families.  It has been 5 years since the United States was attacked on 9/11 on American soil and the victims will never be forgotten. Law.com bloggers and co-hosts Bob Ambrogi and J. Craig Williams welcome Attorney Robert Haefele, from the national firm of Motley Rice, to discuss the considerable amount of pro-bono work Motley Rice has done to help 9/11 families. In contrast, Coast to Coast touches upon a story about a law firm whose tactics are being criticized with respect to the recent Kentucky crash of Comair Flight 5191. Coast to Coast welcomes Attorney Ben Cowgill and Attorney Steve Frederick, both Kentucky attorneys, to discuss the crash and the actions of plaintiff attorneys.  Don’t miss it!</description>

            <description>In an interesting development in Vioxx news, a New Orleans judge ruled that the $50M in compensatory damages were “grossly excessive.” The judge upheld the verdict finding Merck liable in the case, but he said a new trial must be held to decide how much the manufacturer must pay a retired FBI agent who suffered a 2002 heart attack after taking the painkiller for 2½ years. Join co-hosts and Law.com bloggers, J. Craig Williams and Bob Ambrogi as they turn to our expert attorneys representing Vioxx clients.
