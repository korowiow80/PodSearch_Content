            <title>OMG! Lawyers Are Texting?</title>
            <description>Twenty years ago, lawyers were debating whether to use email in their practices. It&apos;s now impossible to imagine lawyers practicing without using email. Studies indicate that eight trillion text messages were sent in 2011. Will we see texts and IMs becoming as integral to law practice as email has become? In this episode, Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell discuss the growing use of texts and IMs by everyone, how these technologies are starting to play a role in the everyday practice of law, and how lawyers should prepare for the use of these technologies in the future.  After you listen, be sure to check out Tom &amp; Dennis’ co-blog and book by the same name, The Lawyers Guide to Collaboration Tools and Technologies.</description>

            <title>Inside the Trayvon Martin Tragedy</title>
            <description>The shooting death of 17 year old Trayvon Martin in Florida has sparked outrage across the country. On February 26, 2012, Trayvon died from a single gunshot to the chest.  Police say neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, fired that shot.  Zimmerman is using Florida’s &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; Law to justify the killing.  Lawyer2Lawyer co-hosts and attorneys, Craig Williams and Bob Ambrogi, welcome Professor Michelle Jacobs, from the University of Florida&apos;s Levin College of Law and Professor Kenneth Novak, Ph.D., Chair of the Department of Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri - Kansas City, to explore the legal issues surrounding the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, neighborhood watches, and the possibility of racial profiling.</description>

Police say neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, fired that shot.  Zimmerman is using Florida’s &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; Law to justify the killing.  Lawyer2Lawyer co-hosts and attorneys, Craig Williams and Bob Ambrogi, welcome Professor Michelle Jacobs, from the University of Florida&apos;s Levin College of Law and Professor Kenneth Novak, Ph.D., Chair of the Department of Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri - Kansas City, to explore the legal issues surrounding the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, neighborhood watches, and the possibility of racial profiling.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Turning TECHSHOW Topics into a Technology Agenda</title>
            <description>Each Spring, ABA TECHSHOW takes center stage as one of the premier legal technology conferences. While there is great value in attending legal tech conferences, all lawyers can benefit simply by seeing what&apos;s on the TECHSHOW agenda. Organizers put a lot of thought into their agendas, so we can all learn where to put our technology focus by seeing what topics these shows cover. Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell use TECHSHOW 2012 as an example of how to assess your current technological agenda, talk about the major topics being covered at TECHSHOW, and suggest ways you can use the TECHSHOW topic list to set your technology priorities for 2012.  After you listen, be sure to check out Tom &amp; Dennis’ co-blog and book by the same name, The Lawyers Guide to Collaboration Tools and Technologies.</description>

            <title>The Law and the Liability of Eugenics</title>
            <description>For decades, a program called Eugenics gave state boards the right to deem someone &quot;unfit to procreate.&quot;   The outcome of this was 66,000 Americans were selectively sterilized between the late 1920’s and the 1980’s. Lawyer2Lawyer co-host and attorney J. Craig Williams welcomes Professor Alfred Brophy, from the University of North Carolina School of Law and Attorney James Bowden from Waller Lansden, to discuss this controversial practice, the US Supreme Court’s shocking decision on eugenics and why forced sterilization &quot;is&quot; technically constitutional.</description>

            <title>The Economic Impact of Lawsuits by Patent Trolls</title>
            <description>Patent litigation has taken off in recent decades. While many of the most visible patent lawsuits are initiated by major technology companies seeking to gain leverage over competitors, an increasing number are brought by patent trolls—firms that acquire patents with no intention of developing a technology with them, but instead use them to threaten practicing companies with litigation over alleged infringements. In this BU Law podcast, host David Yas, a BU Law alum, former publisher of Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly and a V.P. at Bernstein Global Wealth, joins James E. Bessen, lecturer in law at Boston University School of Law and a faculty associate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, to talk about his paper, The Private and Social Costs of Patent Trolls. Together they discuss the economic impact of the surge in lawsuits by patent trolls, the potential for legislation to solve this problem, and how the patent war is ultimately affecting innovation.</description>

            <description>Many social media users have been surprised recently by changes to the design and user interface of the web pages and apps they have been accustomed to using with these services. These changes have been happening for quite a while, but this round of revision seems to have created a backlash from longtime users. Are these kinds of changes fair or foul? In this episode, Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell discuss recent interface modifications by Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others, the response to these changes and the rollout of the changes, and the implications for users as rely more and more on cloud services.  After you listen, be sure to check out Tom &amp; Dennis’ co-blog and book by the same name, The Lawyers Guide to Collaboration Tools and Technologies.</description>

After a lawsuit settlement, they are then faced with the difficult decision of whether to accept a lump sum or a structured settlement in their case. On this edition of Ringler Radio, host Larry Cohen and co-host, Rachel D. Grant, Settlement Annuity Specialist in the Detroit office are joined by guest,  Attorney James C. Lewis from the firm, Shapiro, Lewis &amp; Appleton, P.C., in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Jim shares his insights about why a structured settlement is the best choice when a child is injured and how this decision can benefit not only the child, but the entire family in the long run.</description>

            <description>The landmark Zubulake e-discovery decisions were the first of many to transform a narrow duty not to spoliate into a much broader duty to affirmatively preserve all possibly relevant evidence when there exists a &quot;reasonable anticipation of litigation.&quot;  But have these judicial opinions gone too far? In the December edition of Law Technology Now, Robert Owen, a partner at Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan, says it’s time to shift gears and restore the balance. He talks with Monica Bay, editor-in-chief of Law Technology News, about his five proposed rules that he says will prevent substantial injustices, yet be comprehensive and comprehensible.</description>

            <description>The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land, and throughout history, legal provisions like the First Amendment and Second Amendment have taken center stage. But what about the lesser-known parts of our Constitution? In this edition of the BU Law podcast, host David Yas, a BU Law alum, former publisher of Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly and a V.P. at  Bernstein Global Wealth, welcomes law professor and humorist Jay Wexler to discuss his new book, The Odd Clauses: Understanding the Constitution Through Ten of its Most Curious Provisions.  In a wide-ranging conversation, they touch on constitutional oddities such as the Titles of Nobility Clause and the Letters of Marque Clause, and discuss instances where these long-ignored provisions have suddenly become headline news after decades or centuries in hibernation.</description>

            <title>Suffolk Law Study Abroad in Lund, Sweden</title>
            <description>Suffolk Law offers an annual summer study abroad in Lund, Sweden. The program provides U.S. law students with an opportunity to participate in comparative and international public and private law courses while living in the charming, medieval city of Lund, Sweden. The close interaction of law students and law faculty from the University of Lund and other international law faculties distinguishes Suffolk&apos;s program from most other foreign summer law programs and offers students an excellent opportunity to learn about different legal cultures.

This week we welcome four student participants from the 2011 program to discuss their experiences in Lund. Next summer’s program will be held from June 14 to July 10, 2012. Learn more at http://law.suffolk.edu/academic/abroad.cfm.</description>

            <title>Exploring Modern Redaction Methods for Paralegals</title>
            <description>When it comes to redaction and the process of removing confidential information from legal documents, some paralegals still rely on the traditional yet cumbersome method of using a black marker and the copier machine.

On this edition of The Paralegal Voice, co-hosts Lynne DeVenny and Vicki Voisin join Christine Musil, Director of Marketing for Informative Graphics Corporation, to discuss the benefits of this modern face of redaction and how paralegals can get current and step away from their redaction methods of yesterday.</description>

In this episode, Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell discuss a few simple productivity techniques like using multiple monitors that have made a big difference for them, how those tips might benefit you, and steps you can take to make yourself much more productive than you were before you listened to this podcast.

            <description>When we&apos;re sick, our immediate response is to go to the doctor, and often times we&apos;re given antibiotics to combat the ailment. There&apos;s a growing problem today, which is that many microbes that cause infections in people are becoming resistant to antibiotics. To tackle the legal bugs of this issue, host David Yas, a BU Law alum, former publisher of Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly and a V.P. at Bernstein Global Wealth Management, talks with Kevin Outterson, associate professor and co-director of the Health Law Program at Boston University School of Law. They take a look at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s initiative to curb the overuse of antibiotics, the current legislation involving antibiotics and prescription privacy and how legal incentives can be used to address this public health issue.</description>

The industry says master recordings and profits belong to them in perpetuity.  Where is this legal debate going? Listen as Attorney and Lawyer2Lawyer co-host, J.

            <description>Coming off the heels of an NFL Lockout, the NBA officially locked out its players on July 1, 2011, when players and owners failed to agree on a new contract.

Feldman, Director of the Tulane Sports Law Program, to discuss the legal and business issues surrounding the lockout. They take a look at the impact of the lockout on players, employees and fans and the fate of the 2011-2012 season.</description>

            <title>468B Trusts and the Single Claimant</title>
            <description>468B Trusts (derived from Internal Revenue Service Code Section 468B), were originally created to simplify the settlement of mass tort cases. More recently, they have been suggested for the settlement of single claimant cases, which has become a source of much debate. On this edition of Ringler Radio, host Larry Cohen welcomes co-host, Carmella Limongelli and guest, Rick Woollams, Chief Claims Officer at Chartis U.S., to take an in-depth look at 468B trusts and the rather controversial area of their use in cases with a single claimant.</description>

            <description>With the Supreme Court’s 2010-2011 term over, looking back, there have been some decisions handed down by the Justices that have created a stir.  From the controversial ruling of the Wal-Mart discrimination case, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, to the court’s rejection of a ban on violent video games,  Brown v. EMA, this was by no means an ordinary term.  Attorneys and co-hosts Bob Ambrogi and J. Craig Williams welcome Tony Mauro, Supreme Court correspondent for The National Law Journal, American Lawyer Media, and law.com and Amy Howe, editor of SCOTUSblog, to look back at the 2010-2011 term, the Justices, spotlight the biggest cases of the term and look ahead to the upcoming term.</description>

And there are times when it seems like marketing must be the only possible use for social media. Is that really true? In this episode, Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell talk about what else social media can do for lawyers, and whether it’s time to open up the ways lawyers think about using social media.

            <title>The North Carolina Racial Justice Act</title>
            <description>When the North Carolina General Assembly passed the Racial Justice Act in 2009, it guaranteed that no individual would be put to death because of racial bias within the state’s justice system.  Since then, there’s been a battle in the North Carolina legislature to repeal it. What’s behind this debate?  Some say clogged courts and unfounded claims by death row inmates. Attorneys and co-hosts Bob Ambrogi and J. Craig Williams, along with  Cassandra Stubbs, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Capital Punishment Project and James E. Coleman Jr.,  the John S. Bradway Professor of Law at Duke University Law School and Co-director of Duke&apos;s Wrongful Convictions Clinic, take a look inside the issues. They explore the great debate, the repeal and what this means for inmates on death row.</description>

Capretz, to discuss the current litigation against the makers of some of the most dangerous drugs and medical devices.</description>

            <title>You ARE Backing Up, Right?</title>
            <description>Everyone (well, we hope everyone) knows data backup is important. That’s why we always vow to be more diligent after we lose more data at an inopportune time. Data backup has become more complicated over the past few years as our data moves out from our computers to the cloud. We know what to do, so why don’t we?   In this episode, co-hosts Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell discuss current good practices for data backup, whether backup fundamentals are changing, and how to walk the backup walk and not just talk the backup talk.  After you listen, be sure to check out Tom &amp; Dennis’ co-blog and book by the same name,  The Lawyers Guide to Collaboration Tools and Technologies.</description>

            <description>U.S. District Judge Royce C.

            <title>A Podcast Listener&apos;s Guide</title>
            <description>Lawyers have started to dabble in listening to and creating podcasts. Most of the emphasis we see is on how to create podcasts. However, listening regularly to podcasts can bring you a treasure trove of timely and practical information, especially if you don&apos;t have time to read everything in your &quot;to read&quot; stack. In this episode, co-hosts Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell offer some great tips and techniques for improving your use of podcasts, making the most of your listening time, and generally opening the doors to an underused information resource.  After you listen, be sure to check out Tom &amp; Dennis’ co-blog and book by the same name, The Lawyers Guide to Collaboration Tools and Technologies.</description>

            <title>Powering Up Your Personal Productivity</title>
            <description>&quot;Do more with less&quot; is a mantra of the day. One of the great promises of the day is that technology will organize and optimize us, as computers take over the work we don&apos;t need to do and make our lives easier.  The reality feels more like a jammed email inbox, a mountain of to-do lists and technology we often fight with. In this episode, co-hosts Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell and special guest Allison Shields, discuss the importance of improving personal productivity and the role technology, when done well, can play in optimizing your work, enhancing your productivity and simplifying your life.  After you listen, be sure to check out Tom &amp; Dennis’ co-blog and book by the same name, The Lawyers Guide to Collaboration Tools and Technologies.</description>

            <title>Two Appointments &amp; the Future of the NLRB</title>
            <description>Recently, President Obama appointed two union lawyers, Craig Becker and Mark Pearce to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) creating a labor law controversy. Some say that the addition of Becker and Pearce will restore balance, while others, like business groups, fear their influence on the board will cater to unions on big issues. Co-host and Attorney Bob Ambrogi welcomes Nancy Schiffer, Associate General Counsel with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, (AFL-CIO) and Attorney Charles I. Cohen, senior counsel in Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius’ Labor and Employment Practice, to get their reaction to the recess appointments of Becker and Pearce to the NLRB.</description>

The price - free - is obviously attractive, but Open Source is a completely different approach to software than lawyers expect.

            <title>A Call to Action: Re-examine Laws on Domestic Violence</title>
            <description>The murder of a young woman in Massachusetts raises new questions about the laws and the legal system in cases involving abusive relationships.

19-year old Allison Myrick was stabbed to death  -  her ex-boyfriend charged with murder. Authorities and family members revealed details including two restraining orders which did not prevent this tragic crime.  Attorneys and co-hosts Bob Ambrogi and J. Craig Williams welcome Attorney Marsha Kazarosian from the Kazarosian Law Offices and the Honorable Judge Eugene M. Hyman from the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California, to explore what could have gone so terribly wrong. They will  look at how the legal system, lawyers, legislators and others can better protect victims in abusive relationships and how we as a community can prevent these tragedies.

 

Show Notes: If you or someone you know is involved in an abusive relationship, call National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (1-800-799-7233) or contact Break The Cycle.

On this edition of Ringler Radio, host Larry Cohen welcomes Attorney James W.Turner from the firm Huddleston Bolen to discuss the groundbreaking railroad case: Carter, et al v. CSX Transportation, Inc. Larry and Jim will explore this controversial solvent study and how a Judge&apos;s ruling in various Daubert hearings took center stage when it came to these cases.</description>

            <title>The Textron Case &amp; Attorney Work-Product Privilege</title>
            <description>Earlier this year, the 1st Circuit stymied the IRS in its ongoing effort to attack aggressive corporate tax shelters. In a sharply divided 2-1 panel ruling, the court determined that internal documents of Rhode Island-based Textron didn’t have to be given to the IRS because they are protected by the attorney work-product privilege.   In-House Legal host, Paul D. Boynton, Esq., welcomes Attorney Brian Bixby of Burns &amp; Levinson, to help assess the important issues in the Textron case, including the scope of the how much information companies need to divulge to the IRS and perhaps other government regulators.</description>

            <description>When does the justice system realistically exhaust all efforts to determine if a conviction is correct? Or is there no limit? Its a provocative subject that has recently been raised again in the political arena with regard to the Ben Laguer case in Massachusetts, involving a man convicted of a brutal rape in 1984. Join the President of the Massachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys and Power of Attorney host, Marsha Kazarosian in a discussion with two very special guests:WBZ-TV Reporter and lawyer, Dan Rea and Attorney Michael J. Traft, partner at the Boston firm of Carney &amp; Bassil, P.C.. Both Rea and Traft have a depth of experience in real-life cases in which a conviction is later questioned and in some instances overturned. The Massachusetts Bar Association and the Massachusetts Criminal Defense Lawyers Association have honored Rea for his investigative journalism leading to freedom for Joe Salvati, wrongly convicted of murder and imprisoned for 30 years. Traft is one of the most experienced appellate attorneys in Massachusetts and has represented hundreds of clients in appeal cases in the highest courts of Massachusetts and the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Traft is also a member of the bar of the United States Supreme Court and a member of the executive board of the National Association of Sentencing Commissions.
