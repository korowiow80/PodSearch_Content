	<description>I think it is time to hang up the phone. Izzy went to the theater, many meetings, and of course the gym! She was not phased by big bangs unlike me, and did better on routes and walking on the lead. Many thanks for listening and for contacting  me with encouragement tips and advice. my contact details are:
m.brace@vision2020uk.org.uk so its good night from her (Izzy) and its good night from me!</description>

	<description>One of the most challenging yet as Izzy was ill!

A week where puke, pooh and a trip to the vet are the main highlights, As well as 3 working trips where she did well if a bit disinterested on one occasion. Have a busy week ahead so hope she is well. Also thought fopr the week, how do Vision Impaired dog owners cope with the messing and the sickness when they have no sighted help or other half to spot it and assist in clearing  it up?

	<description>Well another incredibly busy week with Izzy doing most things really well and me not doing so bad either! However a few situations where Izzy was either losing concentration or confidence on jhourneys that she has now done several times. Kept reinforcing and will check this out with the trainer tomorrow to see if there is anything further I need to do. Mainly on the route to the gym. Also experienced a bit of a strain in a social setting with my wife having to guide me and Izzy whilst holding 2 glasses of wine- not easy! Also found that I was caught out a bit in the gents toilets in that with a stick I was pretty good at finding the urinals and sinks but with the dog it is much more difficult! had a late night too with Izzy getting home at 3.30 am and then she still was up to taking me down to the gym that afternoon. must remember to ask the trainer tomorrow about using the dog whilst carrying wine and about gents toilets!</description>

	<description>Well the last week with Izzy has been really quite illuminating. 
I have seen different sides to Izzy with her working well on most occasions and then, after a late night, reluctant to get out of bed! 
The past Monday and Tuesday were busy with trips each day by bus into romford, and then on monday up to Kings cross via taxi and then tubes. Tuesday we came home and then just as Izzy thought it was time for her dinner I took her off to the Gym. She worked well there despite a rumbling stomach but when we came home we got lost or so I thought. we had a difference of opinion which way to go from the Gym and then when I thought we were going in the right direction I heard loud music coming from a building in front of me. We went back and forwards and in the end asked for directions. We had indeed been going right but the circus had been erected next to the park path we used and the evening performance was in operation! Wednesday involved trips to Bakers Street and Edgware road which went well and then Thursday it was our first trip to an area neither of us knew near Westminster. We then went on London Eye and on the Sunday a boat trip down the Thames, quite a lot for a dog to cope with!!
Next week it is more trips to London, our first train journey together, a reception at the House of Commons Speaker&apos;s residence, and finishing off with a late party on Saturday, more next week.</description>

	<title>One Man and his Guide Dog - Episode 26.</title>
	<description>The past 4 days since the last phlog have been very interesting indeed. After the Trauma of the journey last Tuesday with me and Izzy stuck on the tube for 3 hours Wednesday was fairly straight forward with us going via district and the dreaded Hammersmith line again up to Kings Cross. Thursday saw us doing a completely new route to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists at Baker Street.  We managed the stairs at West Ham sation onto the Jubillee line which run up between the escalators and then at Baker Street found there was no stairway up! I  learned how to pick Izzy up in my arms and she lay there like the queen of sheebah with her head lolling on my shoulder. It was disconcerting feeling for the escalator with my feet instead of a stick and not being able to hold the hand rail was also a bit scarey! They are looking to change  the byelaws where dogs have to be carried on escalators - yes I know the old joke about waiting at the top of an escalator for hours until a dog comes along! But until that happens we have to carry them. once the change happens I expect I will be trained how to  get Izzy on and off the escalator without a problem! Most days from now on are likely to be pretty similar so I propose to record my phlogs weekly and if anyone wants to email me please do at m.brace@vision2020uk.org.uk next week I have trips every day to London, a trip to the Olympic and Paralympic site, An event on the London Eye and finishing the week with a boat trip and lunch on the thames I&apos;ll let you know how I and Izzy cope next week.</description>

	<description>Three days of different experiences. Sunday after the successes of our maiden voyage together we had a day at home with a calm walk around the block.  Day 2 coincided with the tube strike so instead of getting on the tubes to go on our first day at work to Kings Cross, we went to the park to check on a route to the pub.  We soon learned that the path we needed was flooded when Izzy returned covered in dirt, water and I think several types of pooh! She then rolled in other kinds and presented herself proudly to us! we then walked back much to her disgust slowly and doing a bit of a divert via Tesco&apos;s carpark! Day 3, which  was our first proper trip to London together, ended with me taking 3 hours to get to Kings cross and Izzy sleeping on the floor of the tube train for most of it! we then went by taxi to a university which took an hour, she then sat through four hours of meetings with a short break and then another hour in the taxi home! she was fine! however she had water and went to the toilet whereby I just had to hold on have no drink and get back in the taxi! it&apos;s a dog&apos;s life!</description>

	<description>Well have just returned from my maiden voyage with Izzy to the Gym.  Today is the first time I have been out of my home alone without my white cane for nearly 50 years.  The route is difficult but she managed it with only one or two small problems which we solved pretty easily.  We missed the pavement leading to the sports centre but I soon realised Izzy was following two football players and got her back on the right path.  We then nearly missed the path to the Sports Centre as Izzy was intent on getting into someone&apos;s car right by the entrance.  The staff were good looking after Izzy and I phoned my wife from the changing room to have someone share this emotional and monumental moment.  Unfortunately she was out shopping so I had a tearful minute in the changing rooms on my own before pulling myself together and getting on with my training.  When I came out Izzy was being adored by the staff! As she is an absolute Star it is only her due.  So am back home now, elated, emotional and very proud of my dog Izzy!!</description>

	<title>One Man and his Guide Dog - Episode 23 - talking about not using an umbrella, rainand how it affects hearing,</title>
	<description>Well yesterday was again very interesting. I did some more bus work and because the buses were different Izzy tried to get off where we got on and having got the lead and harness rapped around an innocent passenger he and we nearly got off together which was sad as he was travelling further on! The other thing yesterday which was really interesting was that I think it was the first time I&apos;ve been out in the rain with Izzy, and realised why I could not use an umbrella because I had to use my hands to signal to Izzy! Also we have got into the habit of her going into her spending run not on the lead. I took her there this morning and went off to make the tea and when I came back she was not in the pen waiting. I reached over, but shock horror, no dog! I then felt a nudge by my leg only to find that Izzy had not gone into the pen at all and had been around the garden and was eagerly looking into the pen to see what I was looking at! Silly me!</description>

	<title>One Man and his Guide Dog - Episode 22talking about elm park, izzy, dog owner, pavement, post office, obstacles</title>
	<description>Well today&apos;s work with Izzy has been largely around My home area.   We went up to Elm Park on the bus and coincidentally met another guide dog owner and her dog of course.    We got off at the stop and then we did some refresher work really with Izzy going to have a look at the post office and the bank and the baker&apos;s all of which she found perfectly and she&apos;d only been there once before about 3 weeks ago! So we managed to find all of the counters and do the posting and banking.We walked back from the station and again she went around obstacles on the pavement. Also had vet issues to discuss and learn about which was facinating.</description>

So we managed to find all of the counters and do the posting and banking.We walked back from the station and again she went around obstacles on the pavement. Also had vet issues to discuss and learn about which was facinating.</itunes:summary>

	<title>One Man and his Guide Dog - Episode 21</title>
	<description>Today was one of the most challenging to date not so much regarding me and Izzy but the environment I was asking her to navigate.  I had a meeting at offices near Traffalgar Square which entailed going via embankment tube up to the strand, over Traffalgar Square to the offices.  I felt pretty stressed out with the noise and the crouds but Izzy seemed unphased by it all. Even found a tree area for her to spend near the office and then back home.</description>

	<title>One Man and his Guide Dog - Episode 20</title>
	<description>Today Izzy and I were assessed as to how we were doing and we passed! I signed the guide dog agreement and paid my 50 pence - well worth it!
We travelled from home to RNIB at Judd Street with the trainer and an assessor. There were a couple of mistakes/divergencies but Izzy  coped well with them and showed that we worked as a team with me exercising control and Izzy exercising her superior brain power and common sense. Also her rubber Chicken sadly announced a few days ago as giving up the ghost, has mirraculously risen from the dead and is now alive and squaking well! Also did some new routes to Euston mainline station as well which proved much easier than expected.  Felt somewhat emotional today when we passed and I got my badge.  Didn&apos;t think I would have been quite so moved!</description>

	<description>Well just back from the Caravan. Krissie the guide dog trainer came all the way down to Northampton to help re routes there which are quite difficult in that there are no pavements and we needed to ensure that Izzy&apos;s traffic awareness and caution was not impaired by us walking towards moving cars. She was very interested in ducks, geese, swans, squirrels and of course anyone that came bye.  With no landmarks for me to identify easily other than speed humps it was largely down to repeatedly going over the routes with Izzy and she then learned them pretty quickly.  we erected a temporary spending pen which she ignored and got back to her old tricks of getting onto the settee which of course was our fault as we did not put any barriers up as at home so who&apos;s fault is it then? big test tomorrow re regular routes and going to Kings Cross so fingers crossed!</description>

	<description>havbe had 2 very interesting days and experienced very much what it will be like in the future as both days had meetings, deadlines and a few issues.  Spending or the lack of it was an issue again but that is usual I believe! Krissie and Izzy got into the pit again and I also used my stick (encouraged by Krissie) to orientate myself for one route section which  I could not quite visualise with the dog. Trains were really crowded which changed things a bit re Izzy getting her tail out of the way of the closing doors, people standing on her and time scales ie having to allow more time with the dog than when I used the cane.</description>

	<description>Well we&apos;ve had another good day of mainly familiarising again over one or two routes that we already used before. And interestingly finding new challenges or differences on both routes. First route was to approach the area where she would normally have a free run on the weekend but not obviously going to the park itself. So we had a different approach this time to find a little alleyway near where I live that would bring us down to the main road which leads to the park. There were some interesting roads with very rounded corners. So no easy straight bits for Izzy to direct me.</description>

	<description>today we did a new route up to st. Dunstans at Edgware Road.  Izzy coped with the station like a veteran, and then we were faced with a new problem at the station ie a blocked pavement. No easy crossings and therefore had to seek assistance to get across a main road and then was fine down to the crossing and up to St. Dunstans.  We then had the proverbial ongoing issue of finding somewhere for madam, ie Izzy to spend! She would not go and we  managed to get home with Izzy clenching her bottom and us clenching our teeth!</description>
