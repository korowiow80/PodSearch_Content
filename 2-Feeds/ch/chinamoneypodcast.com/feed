<p>In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Nick Cao</strong> discusses China&#8217;s commercial property sector, which has gone through an explosive growth phase after early 2010, when home buyer restriction policies dragged down the residential property market.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Since the government launched home buyer restrictions, the commercial property sector has been going rapidly. Some are concerned about a bubble. Are you?</strong></p>
<p>A: It depends. I would say China&#8217;s commercial property sector is still less developed than the residential side.</p>
<p>We see two different groups in the commercial sector. One is the large developers in China, such as China Resources and China COSCO. They moved into commercial properties before the tightening measure was initiated.</p>
<p>But the other group is forced into the commercial sector because their residential sales have stalled. And they operate the commercial sector as if they are still running residential properties. Lots of these (commercial properties) are poorly designed. Some of them are in tier two and tier three cities.</p>
<p>Take the city of Shenyang. There are oversupply issues. We see ten large shopping malls within two kilometer distance. So that’s scary and there are a lot of concerns for investors.</p>
<p>But, overall I wouldn’t say it’s a bubble because in China, there still lacks good quality shopping malls (in many cities).<br />
<strong><div id="v-DE2r3g33-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-DE2r3g33-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=DE2r3g33&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" title="China Money Podcast" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div><br />
Q: For the past few years, the transaction volume in commercial property has doubled. Do you see that continue?</strong></p>
<p>A: I would say, yes. Because China&#8217;s economy is moving from manufacturing-based to services-based, so this generates stronger demand for office space. Some international firms are expanding into second tier cities in China, which requires high quality office space.</p>
<p>Also, the government is promoting domestic consumption. That’s demanding more retail shopping malls. Moreover, the insurance industry in China is just allowed to invest in commercial real estate so (investment) demand will still be quite high.</p>
<p><strong>Q: We have seen residential property prices double in the space of one to two years. Will the same happen in commercial property?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, I don’t think it’s going to happen that fast. It’s all case-by-case. For example, if there were two shopping malls next to each other, their prices would move very differently (depending on how well they are managed).</p>
<p><strong>Q: But we often read reports on ghost shopping malls across China. It seems as if you still believe that the fundamentals of commercial real estate is strong demand driving up supply?</strong></p>
<p>A: When you talk about ghost shopping malls, you still have to look at it case by case. In China&#8217;s tier two and tier three cities, it’s still very hard to find good quality shopping malls.</p>
<p>Yes, there are lots of them that are vacant. But that&#8217;s because the developers don’t know how to run a successful shopping mall.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So where do you see attractive investment opportunities in the property sector right now?</strong></p>
<p>A: It’s mostly still in tier one and tier two cities. In tier one cities (Beijing and Shanghai), the problems are that supplies are limited. As we know, foreign investors are not allowed to buy assets. They can only buy offshore equity, and those have already been acquired by investors already.</p>
<p>Most of the opportunities are available in second tier cities. There is very limited competition in the retail sector. If you have strong capabilities in running a retail mall, there are great opportunities.</p>
<p>But of course, In China, the leasing term, general market practice and the tenants are very different. so foreign investors really need strong local partners to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So, how much price appreciation do you see in commercial real estate?</strong></p>
<p>A: For retail properties, you can get eight percent yield on retail properties in good locations.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: Now, for local investors, they face fierce competition on the ground. How do they grab the best opportunities?</strong></p>
<p>A: Local investors have better resources for local financing and they also have a longer term investment horizon. Foreign investors don’t have local financing resources and may want to exit in three to five years, which limits their ability.</p>
<p>Four years ago, the whole investment market was dominated by foreign investors. In the last few years, we see that domestic investors have taken up 60 percent of the transaction volume. We see that continue to grow.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: What are some common mistakes foreign investors tend to make?</strong></p>
<p>A: Today, at this price level, foreign investors are looking at joint-venture at tier two cities. They face market risk and counter-party risk.</p>
<p>Some of the local city governments are also less sophisticated. Maybe you invest into a project. Soon after, the local government would release large supply into the market, which would negatively impact your project. So, you must find a tier-one, strong and large developers as your local partners.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Lastly, for the residential sector, do you see prices continue to go up after those restrictive policies are relaxed?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, it’s still positive. In the next ten years, Shanghai&#8217;s population will grow another five million. They all need housing. In tier one and tier two cities, properties in prime locations will have good potential for price appreciation.</p>
<p>But we see prices of those suburban areas with large housing supplies probably staying static, if not decreasing.</p>

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest Ludvig Nilsson discusses the challenges facing China&#8217;s private equity industry and where he sees attractive investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Listen to the podcast, watch the shortened video or read an excerpt:</p>
<p><strong>Q: Last year, you described China’s private equity industry as a hyped market with strong fundamentals. Have you changed your opinion?<br />
</strong><br />
A: Not really, I think the hype is still on. The inflows of new capital into China are actually increasing, not just from overseas investors but also from local institutions. Specifically, China’s insurance companies.</p>
<p>The insurance industry is only now allowed to allocate significant money into private equity. On an overall basis, the potential is very large. The combined assets of the insurance industry are a few hundred billion dollars. If you apply a percentage of two to three percent that could arguably be invested into private equity, that’s a quiet a large number.</p>
<div id="v-Ol6orkNN-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-Ol6orkNN-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=Ol6orkNN&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" title="China Money Podcast" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>
<p><strong>Q: You answered the first part of the question, but how about the fundamentals? People are concerned that there is now too much money chasing too few deals? </strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, but that’s always been the case for as long as the industry has been around. There are new opportunities right now and they derive from two areas. One, there are a range of newly emerged industries that need capital for consolidation, the consumer industry, for example.</p>
<p>On macro basis, China has never seen as tight a credit condition as the present ever. Some six months ago, it was the tightest condition I’ve ever seen since I moved to China 15 years ago. China has always had lots of money sloshing through the system. Now a lot of that money has dried up.</p>
<p>What I think we will see is that there are currently two thousand (private equity) funds. They will consolidate into perhaps one thousand or so funds. And, only half of them will make seasonable returns. That sounds like a lot, but (it means) 75 percent of the funds you see in the market will not do well.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So that should mean valuations for private equity deals are attractive. Do you find that’s the case? </strong></p>
<p>A: The real questions about this private equity overhang leads to high valuations or low valuations, that’s all down to the quality of the company. Yes, companies that perhaps are not great or those with issues or problems would raise money at very attractive prices. But you need to factor in the quality of the companies to work out if it’s a bargain.</p>
<p>Overall, a lot of deals are happening at low prices. But great companies can still command high prices. They can pick who they want to work with, and it’s all up to what kind of value-add can the fund bring in.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: With China’s private equity industry facing a wave of consolidation, have you adjusted your strategy in selecting funds? </strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, we have. The way we have adjusted our strategy in this cycle is we are focusing more heavily on resource-heavy managers. Basically, managers with strong connections in the political and financial systems in China that can help companies to navigate the IPO process and other significant developments.</p>
<p>The other aspect is that we focus more on fundamentals. That means alignment of interests. It goes down to co-investments. We want fund mangers to co-invest into their own funds properly &#8212; not just the standard one to two percent. We are looking at co-investment of over ten percent. Many of the fund managers that we work with co-invest 10 to 20 percent into their own funds, which are very high comparing to Western funds.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: So does it mean most of your funds are smaller funds? </strong></p>
<p>A: We invest in funds across all spectrum of size and stages. Most of our money are going to small and mid market type of funds from two to 400 million in size, that’s where we see the best risk-return return metrics at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there any particular industry or strategy that you think presents better opportunities at present? </strong></p>
<p>A: We are looking at western China regions more. Given the new development phrase that the western China regions are going through, we see a lot of opportunities of investment ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Some of the managers there tend to have strong local connections and very good deal flow and very good understanding of risks at that area. They have been able to do deals at very attractive valuations.</p>
<p>There are a large number of fund managers that emerged in Chengdu, Chongqing and Xi’an. Most of them started out as small RMB funds backed by leading industrial families in those regions. Many of them are looking to increase their capital base as the investment opportunities there are huge.</p>
<p><strong>Q: But going to a frontier market represents unique risks and challenges. How do you manage that?</strong></p>
<p>A: Exactly. The reason we want to work with local funds over there is because they know how to manage that risk. Some of the funds from Shanghai going to China’s western region, they are as foreign as I am. So, many of those local risks can best be managed by those with local connections.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You are only one of a number of China focused fund of funds. Do you ever feel lonely? </strong></p>
<p>We used to feel lonely, but we have gotten lots of companies now. All the Pan Asia and global fund of funds headquartered in Hong Kong or Singapore are all becoming China focused, and they are setting up presence in China.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are also local competitors. They tend to be feeder funds to help local funds do fund-raising. They also have ambitions to be internationalized. So I think competition will definitely increase.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When you do due diligence, what are some common red flags?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know where to start. China is a difficult market to do due diligence in.</p>
<p>The problem here in China (in due dilligence) is about getting real, trustworthy and meaningful data. When a manager provided a huge list of (people) and all of them want to tell you how good (the manager) is, that’s one of the most obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Lastly, your fund is a US dollar fund. There are obviously disadvantages in it. How do you mange that?</strong></p>
<p>A: All foreign investors in China need to think about risks relating to “currency inequality”, really. It’s a long-term problem.</p>
<p>We are working with RMB managers and they can help convert some of the RMB deal flow into allowable and doable US dollar deals. That’s why you need to work with strong RMB funds.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle>Ludvig Nilsson: China’s Western Regions Are Private Equity’s Golden Frontier</itunes:subtitle>

In this episode of China Money Podcast, guest Ludvig Nilsson discusses the challenges facing China’s private equity industry and where he sees attractive investment opportunities.

Listen to the podcast, watch the shortened video or read an excerpt:

Q: Last year, you described China’s private equity industry as a hyped market with strong fundamentals. Have you changed your opinion?

A: Not really, I think the hype is still on. The inflows of new capital into China are actually increasing, not just from overseas investors but also from local institutions. Specifically, China’s insurance companies.

The insurance industry is only now allowed to allocate significant money into private equity. On an overall basis, the potential is very large. The combined assets of the insurance industry are a few hundred billion dollars. If you apply a percentage of two to three percent that could arguably be invested into private equity, that’s a quiet a large number.

Q: You answered the first part of the question, but how about the fundamentals? People are concerned that there is now too much money chasing too few deals?

A: Yes, but that’s always been the case for as long as the industry has been around. There are new opportunities right now and they derive from two areas. One, there are a range of newly emerged industries that need capital for consolidation, the consumer industry, for example.

On macro basis, China has never seen as tight a credit condition as the present ever. Some six months ago, it was the tightest condition I’ve ever seen since I moved to China 15 years ago. China has always had lots of money sloshing through the system. Now a lot of that money has dried up.

What I think we will see is that there are currently two thousand (private equity) funds. They will consolidate into perhaps one thousand or so funds. And, only half of them will make seasonable returns. That sounds like a lot, but (it means) 75 percent of the funds you see in the market will not do well.
Q: Is there any particular industry or strategy that you think presents better opportunities at present?

A: We are looking at western China regions more. Given the new development phrase that the western China regions are going through, we see a lot of opportunities of investment ahead of the curve.

Some of the managers there tend to have strong local connections and very good deal flow and very good understanding of risks at that area. They have been able to do deals at very attractive valuations.

There are a large number of fund managers that emerged in Chengdu, Chongqing and Xi’an. Most of them started out as small RMB funds backed by leading industrial families in those regions. Many of them are looking to increase their capital base as the investment opportunities there are huge.

Q: But going to a frontier market represents unique risks and challenges. How do you manage that?

A: Exactly. The reason we want to work with local funds over there is because they know how to manage that risk. Some of the funds from Shanghai going to China’s western region, they are as foreign as I am. So, many of those local risks can best be managed by those with local connections.
Our Guest Today:
Ludvig Nilsson is a co-founder and managing director at Jade Invest, a Shanghai-based private equity fund-of-funds manager focused on China. Prior to co-founding Jade Invest in 2005, Ludvig was a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers where he focused on commercial due diligence for private equity clients.

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, our host <strong>Nina Xiang</strong> reads the tea leaves of an important signal from Beijing that China is determined to deliver its economic growth objective this year, whatever it takes.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1249" title="Nina Xiang" src="http://www.chinamoneypodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/nina-xiang7-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="86" height="86" />According to Chinese state media, the Chinese government is stepping on the pedal of fiscal stimulus. Organizations and local authorities were notified to report infrastructure and other investment projects earlier than scheduled. Beijing looks ready to accelerate approval process and appropriate funding for them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After disappointing statistics in April, China&#8217;s central bank has cut reserve requirement ratios, but there are a few challenges relating to monetary loosening alone. Number one, businesses are unwilling to take bank loans as the economy is cooling. Number two, opening the monetary faucet could make the government’s target on inflation more difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has the ability to use fiscal stimulus and it is a more appealing method as it does not tend to induce a credit bubble or drive up inflationary pressure. Public debt to GDP in 2011 in China was 43 percent, compared with 103 percent in the U.S., 82 percent in Germany and 120 percent in Italy. (Should we mention Greece, 165 percent?)</p>
<p>The effort is already underway as first quarter fiscal expenditure growth reached 33.6 percent, highest for the past two years. In addition, Beijing is speeding up the spending machine so that the economy does not continue to cool down further. That means we might see some stimulus effect in the real economy as soon as the third quarter.</p>

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest John Barnes examines investment opportunities in China&#8217;s drive to achieve a more sustainable and greener growth. In particular, he explains the enormous potential of wastewater treatment businesses in China, and why many green tech companies might fail as the industry consolidates.</p>
<p>Listen to the podcast or read the excerpt below.</p>
<p><strong>Q: First, give us a brief definition of “sustainability”, particularly relating to your work at PWC?</strong></p>
<p>A: Sustainability is all about building a sustainable business. It’s not an add-on. It’s not a separate thing that companies do. It’s about looking at every facet of all business operations and looking for ways to make operations more sustainable.</p>
<p>We work with companies at a high level, looking at how they can build sustainable programs within their daily operations: from looking at their core products and services to the carbon footprint and life cycle analysis of their products.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When we look at China where the policy and business environments are very different, what specific areas (under the sustainability umbrella) do you see opportunities? </strong></p>
<p>A: Given that the Chinese government has made a commitment to switch the economy way from high-energy, high polluting industries, the potential sectors to watch would be renewable energy, energy efficiency improvement technologies, environmental protection technology and equipment, water management, waste water treatment management, etc.</p>
<p>There is a word of caution here. Just because it’s green, doesn’t mean it will grow. (For foreign investors), clearly you need to do your homework. A lot of things have a green label, whether they are green or not, who knows. Some of these technology companies in renewable energy and wastewater management will eventually fail.</p>
<p><strong>Q: In those sectors you just mentioned, wastewater treatment for example, any specific technologies that would be the most relevant?</strong></p>
<p>A: With wastewater treatment in China, the government has said that it would have a wastewater treatment plant for all its major cities. The government has already built thousands of wastewater treatment plants around in China.</p>
<p>In China, there are a successions of quite small water treatment plants. You need engineering technology but also technologies to monitor the levels of toxins in the water and be able to add things that would break down the solids and wastes.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of plants in China, the government-owned and also private ones. The private wastewater treatment plants are licensed by the government and have contracts with the government to treat specified amounts of wastewater for a certain price. They will have certainty of their revenues.</p>
<p>The biggest costs are electricity and staff. The electricity is fixed by the government. So for example, if you run a water treatment plant heavy at night, then you will be more efficient. Obviously, all the (Chinese) companies are looking for foreign companies with the technologies to make their wastewater treatment process more efficient and more cost effective.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you have any estimate of the pace of future growth in wastewater treatment in China? </strong></p>
<p>A: The issue we have in China is that the price of electricity and water is set by the government, so there is less opportunity for companies to shop around for efficiency. Over time, as China grows, these fixed prices will be freed up. Whether it’s three to five years, I don’t know.</p>
<p>At the moment, wastewater is a safe bet because you know what your costs are and your revenue. However, the profitability is not that high. But as time goes on, as the market frees up, there will be more opportunity to make a greater return.</p>
<p>For example, you go to different cities and you will find different operators running different plants. There are not many operators operating more than two or three plants. We need consolidation in the market so that people can benefit from the economy of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You mentioned profitability is not high. How low is it right now? </strong></p>
<p>A: I think it’s about seven to ten percent return on the private ones. The public ones are probably at five percent return on investments.</p>
<p><strong>Q: With this kind of return, is it really attractive for foreign companies to come to China? </strong></p>
<p>A: People come to China because other people are doing it. If you think you are going to come to China to make a fast buck, you should think again.</p>
<p>Five to seven percent it’s not huge, but in this market, it’s not bad either. The only way I can see is up as the market consolidates and as regulatory policies ease.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What pitfalls should investors be watching out for, and a word on the lessons learned from previous mistakes? </strong></p>
<p>A: I want to propose eight steps to succeed in China.</p>
<p>1, Find a reliable local partner; 2, Use consultants; 3, Don’t rely entirely on Guanxi; 4, Do homework and due diligence before jumping in; 5, Be flexible and patient; 6, Bring your first-rate technology; 7, Protect your intellectual property rights; 8, Have a good business model.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Lastly, what’s your outlook for the sustainability/green sector in China? </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>A: We will see continued emphasis and focus on the renewable energy sector. China has developed its own carbon-trading scheme, which will again push companies to be more energy efficient.</p>
<p>There will be lots of new businesses with “green” labels (coming into the market), and a lot of traditional businesses will embed these concepts into their general business operations. So we will see lots of businesses reinventing themselves along the sustainable practice principle.</p>

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, prominent China economist at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Richard Herd, takes on China&#8217;s tax systems and financial reform. Contrary to popular opinion, Mr. Herd disagrees with policy suggestions to cut taxes as fiscal stimulus. As he sees it, China&#8217;s tax burden on companies and individuals is still light.</p>
<p>Mr. Herd talked with China Money Podcast on the sidelines of the <a href="http://www.friendsofeurope.org/Contentnavigation/Events/Eventsoverview/tabid/1187/EventType/EventView/EventId/1150/EUChinaUrbanisationPartnership.aspx" target="_blank">EU-China Urbanization Partnership conference</a> in Brussels. Listen to the podcast or read the excerpt below.</p>
<p><strong>Q: In your research report, you pointed out the strong fiscal position of the Chinese government. The government has little net debt, and fiscal revenue has been growing at an average of 1.5 times of nominal GDP. Therefore, some Chinese economists are calling for tax cuts. Do you think that will be a good policy move?</strong></p>
<p>A: Over the past 15 years, the growth in tax revenue has been quite rapid. But it was needed and was rooted in the tax reform of the mid 1990s. It lifted, in total with social security, government tax revenue to around 30 percent (of GDP). I think 30 percent, or perhaps 35 percent (of GDP), should be enough to cover most of the governmental expenditure needs. It will allow for a considerable increase in social benefits that’s so badly needed. Beyond that, there is a need to reform taxation so that tax revenue doesn’t grow too rapidly.</p>
<p>The disincentive effect is still quite limited because most people still don’t pay income tax. The main problem on incentives with the taxation system is in social security, where social security contribution (by employers) is around 40 percent of a person’s wage, that’s probably too high. Some of that too should be transferred to general taxation so that the incentives for employing labor are not cut too much.</p>
<p>As to whether taxes should be cut at this moment, I think that some of the main calls to cut taxes have come from those who think that the Chinese economy is going to a hard landing this year. I don’t think that seems at all likely at the moment. The need to reduce taxes is much less than a trillion Yuan. In fact, the government has announced income tax cuts and also stimulus programs to slightly raising the deficit to around 400-500 billion Yuan. That will go quite a long way to getting the economy going again.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The domestic economists are arguing that the tax burden for individuals and companies are too heavy. Sounds like you have a different opinion?</strong></p>
<p>A: I think that the tax rate for companies is 25 percent. That’s quite low by international standards. The tax rate for most individuals is, well, only a very small proportion of the Chinese population actually pays income taxes. You could perhaps say that in relation to other transition countries, China’s top tax rate is quite high because it’s at 45 percent. It’s much higher than in Hong Kong for example, which is 15 percent.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, China has a bigger social system than Hong Kong. The 45 percent tax rate doesn’t come until someone earns 36 times of the average wage, even then it’s just very few people who pay 45 percent. There is certainly a case for trying to move some of the social security contributions paid by the employer to a more general tax base.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You said the government&#8217;s increasing the deficit to around 500 billion Yuan is sufficient to stimulate the economy, but of course, you still think that the government should (further) loosen monetary policy, right?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, indeed. The People’s Bank of China has reduced the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) twice now. That’s had an impact on interbank interest rates. Some more RRR rate cuts is likely in the next few months. Also, the growth of credit has picked up as well. That too should stimulate the economy.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Lately, there have been many new policy initiatives in Beijing to reform the financial sector, including an experiment program on private lending in Wenzhou, setting up another offshore RMB center in London, significantly increasing QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors) quotas. There has been much debate about how best to open up China’s financial sector. What’s your recommendation?</strong></p>
<p>A: At the moment, the Chinese government does have a window open for opportunity for opening up the capital account. The extent of the current account surplus has diminished enormously. Already overseas investments by Chinese companies are growing rapidly. The current account surplus in the first quarter of this year was 1.4 percent (of GDP). That means the output pressure on the exchange rate is much less now than it was five years ago when current account surplus was ten percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The way the government should move on financial reform would be first to take more steps on the QFII and RQFII (Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors) areas. It is also important to allow people to invest outside of China, expanding that experiment in Wenzhou.</p>
<p>An equally important factor is at the same time of opening up the capital account, you need to liberate the setting of the interest rate. Otherwise, when you open up the capital account, that offers an opportunity for arbitrage between foreign markets and domestic markets. So I think the banking systems should be sheltered. You need to get rid of interest rate regulation and that should happen very early on.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there a certain sequence that all these needed reforms should be following?</strong></p>
<p>A: I think the essential thing is to start preparing the Chinese banking system so that it can live with much lower margins that it has been earning due to regulated interest rates. That would be among the first to try. The second is to open up the equity markets, then the bond market.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If there is one or two pressing reforms that you could advise the Chinese government on, what would that be?</strong></p>
<p>A: There are two areas. One is to improve the position of migrate workers in the cites. The way to do that is to detach social benefits for having a local Hukou. That makes it easier for the whole family of migrant workers to join and settle in the city. That’s a policy that China should follow and that is also a way to generate more consumption in the cities as well.</p>
<p>The other area is State Owned Enterprises (SOE). There are lots of areas to improve, but certainly one would be that SOEs should pay 30-40 percent of their profits to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Finance should use that to either cut taxes or to increase social spending.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle>Richard Herd: No Need To Cut Taxes In China; Instead Raise Government Deficit For Fiscal Stimulus</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In this episode of China Money Podcast, prominent China economist at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Richard Herd, takes on China’s tax systems and financial reform. Contrary to popular opinion, Mr. Herd disagrees with policy suggestions to cut taxes as fiscal stimulus. As he sees it, China’s tax burden on companies and individuals is still light.

Listen to the podcast or read the excerpt below.

Q: In your research report, you pointed out the strong fiscal position of the Chinese government. The government has little net debt, and fiscal revenue has been growing at an average of 1.5 times of nominal GDP. Therefore, some Chinese economists are calling for tax cuts. Do you think that will be a good policy move?

A: Over the past 15 years, the growth in tax revenue has been quite rapid. But it was needed and was rooted in the tax reform of the mid 1990s. It lifted, in total with social security, government tax revenue to around 30 percent (of GDP). I think 30 percent, or perhaps 35 percent (of GDP), should be enough to cover most of the governmental expenditure needs. It will allow for a considerable increase in social benefits that’s so badly needed. Beyond that, there is a need to reform taxation so that tax revenue doesn’t grow too rapidly.

The disincentive effect is still quite limited because most people still don’t pay income tax. The main problem on incentives with the taxation system is in social security, where social security contribution (by employers) is around 40 percent of a person’s wage, that’s probably too high. Some of that too should be transferred to general taxation so that the incentives for employing labor are not cut too much.

As to whether taxes should be cut at this moment, I think that some of the main calls to cut taxes have come from those who think that the Chinese economy is going to a hard landing this year. I don’t think that seems at all likely at the moment. The need to reduce taxes is much less than a trillion Yuan. In fact, the government has announced income tax cuts and also stimulus programs to slightly raising the deficit to around 400-500 billion Yuan. That will go quite a long way to getting the economy going again.

Q: The domestic economists are arguing that the tax burden for individuals and companies are too heavy. Sounds like you have a different opinion?

A: I think that the tax rate for companies is 25 percent. That’s quite low by international standards. The tax rate for most individuals is, well, only a very small proportion of the Chinese population actually pays income taxes. You could perhaps say that in relation to other transition countries, China’s top tax rate is quite high because it’s at 45 percent. It’s much higher than in Hong Kong for example, which is 15 percent.

But on the other hand, China has a bigger social system than Hong Kong. The 45 percent tax rate doesn’t come until someone earns 36 times of the average wage, even then it’s just very few people who pay 45 percent. There is certainly a case for trying to move some of the social security contributions paid by the employer to a more general tax base.

Q: You said the government’s increasing the deficit to around 500 billion Yuan is sufficient to stimulate the economy, but of course, you still think that the government should (further) loosen monetary policy, right?

A: Yes, indeed. The People’s Bank of China has reduced the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) twice now. That’s had an impact on interbank interest rates. Some more RRR rate cuts is likely in the next few months. Also, the growth of credit has picked up as well. That too should stimulate the economy.

Q: Lately, there have been many new policy initiatives in Beijing to reform the financial sector, including an experiment program on private lending in Wenzhou, setting up another offshore RMB center in London, significantly increasing QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors) quotas.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, hear what Mr. Ewen Cameron Watt has to say about China&#8217;s property sector. Mr. Cameron Watt is a managing director and portfolio manager at BlackRock, Inc, and below is an excerpt of his viewpoints.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.chinamoneypodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/ewan-cameron-watt.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1196" title="Ewan Cameron Watt" src="http://www.chinamoneypodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/ewan-cameron-watt.jpg" alt="" width="105" height="117" /></a></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Chinese property market, is it a bubble and is it bursting? </strong></p>
<p>What’s happening in the real estate market in China is fascinating, where the government has deliberately engineered a decline in prices to deflate a bubble. It’s really an experiment because it’s the first time in the fifteen years or so there has been a private housing market in China. The big question for us is to what extent does it hurt activity levels and to what extent does it impact the financial systems.<br />
<strong><br />
On the outlook for the property sector and how will it impact other parts of the economy? </strong></p>
<p>One of the big risks in China is that, investors in property invest on the basis that the value will always rise. This is the first real decline in prices induced by the central government in the 15 or so years of the private housing sector in China.</p>
<p>No one knows what’s going to happen for sure. On the positive side, more urbanization, household formation and all that supports the idea that there is an ongoing demand. That’s certainly true. On the negative side, how will that demand manifest itself?</p>
<p>I think that here the rate of return is important because there are very few avenues for real returns for savers in China. They&#8217;ve gone into real estate, gold, wine and jade, because they think they get a real rate of return, which they don’t get for bank deposits. Bank deposits are 90 percent plus of the savings vehicles in China. So it’s a critical question how the psychologies recover. If I’m honest, at this stage, I don’t know.<br />
<strong><br />
For global investors, what key indicators in China should they monitor closely to better position themselves? </strong></p>
<p>One of the things we have watch closely is the rate of money growth. There are some opportunities for the government to relax restrictions on banks to help the growth of monetary supply. Monetary supply has got to grow at nearly 15 percent to get 10 to 11 percent nominal growth. We will give it an inflation rate of four percent, then you got a seven percent real growth that people have come to believe is minimum growth for Chinese society and Chinese stability.</p>
<p>If you think about what investors would monitor, they should monitor Chinese money supply, loan growth, and watch closely if these really decelerate; if that’s the case, then the global financial risk is rising, not just Chinese risk.</p>

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, well-known British writer and China expert Jonathan Fenby gives his diagnosis of China&#8217;s long-term challenges. Will the world&#8217;s second largest economy go on to surpass the U.S. in a couple of decades? Or, is an apocalypse in the cards?</p>
<p>Listen to the podcast on our website, or read an excerpt from the audio interview.</p>
<p><strong>Q: In your latest book, <em>Tiger Head, Snake Tails</em>, you point out that China&#8217;s future dominance is far less certain than people have been led to believe. Why is that?</strong></p>
<p>China has certainly achieved a lot in the past thirty years. But China is now in a stage where it must rethink its economic model. The assumption that China will continue in the rapid pace of economic growth and that it will bring in political dominance is far from established.</p>
<p>Its economy needs re-balancing, reshaping and remodeling. China will spend the next ten years or so on getting its economic model up and running rather than thinking about dominating the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The Chinese government certainly understands that the model needs to be changed, but with the complicated system now China finds herself in, it seems hard to find a starting point?</strong></p>
<p>The difficulties with reforms in a situation like China after all those years of growth is that everything is interconnected. If you start reform in one area, for example, if you privatize farm land, people can then build up much more efficient farms in China.</p>
<p>That would be good, but if you do that, the local authorities which own the farm land and rely on selling them for revenues, they will need to introduce new tax systems to give the local authorities much more power to raise taxes locally and spend it themselves. If that happens, Beijing will lose an element of control over local authorities.</p>
<p>If you can start in one place, I would say the one area where you could consider is the Hukou registration system. You could allow migrant workers, especially second generation migrant workers, greater rights and the possibility to buy properties in the cities.</p>
<p><strong>Q: There is a consensus that the reform process in China is stalled and needs to be jump-started again. How likely do you think it can pick up speed under the next leadership?</strong></p>
<p>I think it will be slow and cautious. The people who run China have adopted a consensus style of leadership management. There are so many special interests involved in any debate of change.</p>
<p>But what I find interesting is that when I was last in Beijing, there is this awareness on the need to have a serious debate on reform. You have senior people like Wang Yang talking openly about the need to reform. There are similar commentaries on China Daily and other state newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So you are saying China is at a turning point in its economic growth model and it will have a paradigm shift from now on, what does that mean for investors who are looking to invest in China?</strong></p>
<p>First, I think there should be a paradigm shift. My question is that if the consensus style of leadership can be able to make that shift or not.</p>
<p>As for investors, this means China, in the short term, will be a rocky place to invest with lots of uncertainties. But for foreign companies investing in China, if they got something the Chinese government or the Chinese consumers want, whether it&#8217;s consumer goods or technologies, they will be welcomed.</p>
<p>The idea of coming to China to simply exploit cheap land, cheap labor and tax breaks, that stage is over.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Lastly, what is your forecast on the Chinese economy this year at Trusted Sources? </strong></p>
<p>We expect the economy to grow at 7.5 percent; inflation rate to fall below 3 percent; and exports to decline but not as fast as forecasters think they will. We think monetary easing in China will be prudent. It will be staged and slow.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t see a property crash in China. We expect a 10 to 15 percent decline in property prices with an upturn in the second half of the year. Overall, this will be a shift of investment away from infrastructure towards machinery and factory to improve productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The consensus forecast is 8.3 percent this year. Why is your forecast notably lower than others?</strong></p>
<p>Because we see the declining export market having a more notable effect than others. Secondly, we see a very cautious approach toward credit easing. We see the first half of this year as a rather tight period.</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Bank of China is adopting a cautious policy and they want to keep inflation below 3.5 percent. They don&#8217;t want it to bounce up again during the leadership transition period. Lastly, monetary supply will be kept tight. They want monetary supply back to the level of before 2008.</p>

Another example is energy and water, which is under-priced in China. If you freed water prices and they rose rapidly, it will have an effect on inflation.

If you can start in one place, I would say the one area where you could consider is the Hukou registration system. You could allow migrant workers, especially second generation migrant workers, greater rights and the possibility to buy properties in the cities.

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Michael Shaoul</strong> expresses his bearish views on the Chinese economy and expects the current economic slowdown to last until the end of this year, in stark contrast to the consensus view that the economy will pick up speed during the second half of 2012.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: First quarter GDP in China was 8.1 percent, lower than market expectations of 8.3 percent. Do you see the Chinese economy continue to soften further?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, we do. We ourselves don’t concentrate on the GDP, particularly, we’ve been very focused on the real estate sector. In terms of sales, now there is negative growth and shrinkage of activity. Our assumption is that it will start feeding into the construction of real estate later this year. That’s really when the overall economic statistics of China will decelerate more markedly.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: So your biggest concern is the property sector. How bad do you think it will get? </strong></p>
<p>A: I think pretty bad. The Chinese property sector reminds us a lot of the U.S. in 2007. What you started to see is that the collapse in transaction activity is starting to decelerate very sharply. The next stage of a housing correction is that the prices will come down. Now in the majority of Chinese cities, we do have prices coming down. </p>
<p>The third stage is where it really feeds into the wider economy. It is when you start to decelerate the pace of building. In the end, the property sector will be the epicenter and the beginning point of a Chinese economic slowdown.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: But we know that the Chinese property market is much less leveraged than the U.S. Most mortgages have equity of over 50 percent in them?</strong></p>
<p>A: I think that’s true. It will have a different cycle to the U.S. But if you went back in the U.S. twenty or thirty years, you would also have a much less levered real estate sector. But we still managed to have some really tough real estate and economic cycles, in the late 1970s, late 1980s and early 1990s. </p>
<p>The difference between a highly levered real estate cycle and a moderately levered real estate cycle is that, in the highly levered real estate cycle, the general population losses a bit of money and the banks lose a lot of money. In the moderately levered cycle, the people lose quite a bit of money and the banks lose a little bit of money. </p>
<p>I’m not sure which one is better or worse. It really depends on whether you are a bank or bank shareholder, or an individual owner of real estate.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: But in China’s case, the owners are not forced to sell, so prices are unlikely to drop dramatically? </strong></p>
<p>A: True, the owners are not forced to sell. But what happens after a real estate boom is that everybody who wanted to buy a house has already bought two or three. (In a down cycle), these houses are not worth what you thought they would be worth at the time of the purchase. There are no one else to sell them to. You are simply sitting on “dead asset.” </p>
<p>It’s true that it doesn’t create a forced sale, but it’s also true that you have lost money. It’s very much like buy equity, but not with a margin account. Though you are not forced to sell it (if the price went down), but you still lost money.  </p>

	<itunes:subtitle>Michael Shaoul: We Are Shorting Chinese H Shares; China’s Property Slide Is Just Beginning</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In this episode of China Money Podcast, guest Michael Shaoul discusses his view on the Chinese economy. He is bearish and expects the current economic slowdown to last until the end of this year, in stark contrast to the consensus view that the economy will pick up speed during the second half of 2012.

Here are his main points:

- The major concern of the Chinese economy is the real estate sector. The softness we have seen in this sector is only the beginning of a broader and deeper correction that will affect peripheral industries such as materials and commodities more harshly than people expect.

- China’s real estate cycle will be different from the US housing cycle. Though China’s property sector is less leveraged, the losses are still real on behalf of property owners.

- Even after the Chinese policymakers loosen monetary policy sometime during this quarter, the stimulus effect will not translate into economic improvements immediately. The economic deterioration will continue well into the end of this year, if not longer.

- The current transition will be difficult for the Chinese economy and for investors who are exposed to the Chinese “growth” story (as well as other emerging markets such as Brazil and Hong Kong).

- China’s economy is 25 to 35 percent of the U.S. economy, but China has 140 percent of the money (M2) that the U.S. has. The massive amount of liquidity will take time to unwind.

- We only have short exposures to some H shares in Hong Kong. It is difficult to find good investments in China right now as it was difficult to find good investments in the U.S. in 2007. Investors will have to hold through a difficult period and endure losses.

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Powell Yang</strong> discusses Chinese investors’ increasingly important role in fine and rare wine investments. </p>
<p><strong>Q: For those of us who don’t know much about investing in wine, how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>A: I think we can look at wine investment as any other commodity investment. The reality is that 99 percent of wine made in the world today won’t go up in price. The proportions of the wine that do go up in price are very small. Most wines that’s traded in high dollar amount are classified Bordeaux and Burgundy.</p>
<p><strong>Q: That does sound like a very niche market. What types of investors are better positioned to invest in wine? </strong></p>
<p>A: Everyday investors can still invest in wine by buying tried-and-true labels, such as your first-growth (Bordeaux). If you buy it at the right price, you won’t lose money on it. But because of their labels, their prices are also very high and your upside is limited. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Your focus is to explore the Chinese investor base for wine. What kind of (wine investment) growth have we seen in China? </strong></p>
<p>A: With Chinese investors’ appetite growing for wine, the producers are shifting their focus and availability to China and the Hong Kong region. A lot of folks in Bordeaux and Burgundy frequently travel to Hong Kong. </p>
<p>The Wine Expo 2012 is taking place in May in Hong Kong. It’s not something they normally do in the region. But now with the strong demand, they are doing this signature event in Hong Kong.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: What is the current demand from Chinese wine investors? Are they picking up?</strong></p>
<p>A: It seems like the interest in Bordeaux has soften a bit, which can be attributed to market correction. For example, Lafite Rothschild 2000 vintage was trading at about 1,500 dollars a bottle in the summer of 2008. As the global economy dove and in early 2009, it was trading at 800. </p>
<p>Granted, at 800 dollars, it’s still a healthy return from the initial release price. If you bought on futures, you could probably buy it at 250 dollars. So it’s still more than 300 percent return. But since February 2009, the wine has gone up from 800 dollars to 2,500 dollars a bottle during summer of 2011. That’s a ten-fold increase from the initial release price. And now it’s back to 1,500 to 1,700 dollar range. </p>
<p>We’ve seen a pick-up in interests in Burgundy, the new fashionable choice for Chinese investors, partially because of its limited supply. If there are ten cases of Bordeaux available, then Burgundy has one.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: What&#8217;s the most common mistake that Chinese investors tend to make?</strong></p>
<p>A: The mistake Chinese wine investors tend to make is to chase the market in disregard of the price. They could also be impatient to see their wine collections increase in price, though generally it is recommended to hold wine for at least five years to achieve a reasonable return.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle>Powell Yang: Wine Investments In China Still Have Huge Upside</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In this episode of China Money Podcast, guest Powell Yang discusses Chinese investors’ increasingly important role in fine and rare wine investments. How mature are Chinese wine investors? What common mistakes do they tend to make and what potential returns are they after?

Here are his main points:

- Wine investment is similar to other commodity investments. The key is to do your own research. As much as 99 percent of the wine produced will never go up in price. Only the very top wines of Bordeaux and some Burgundy wines are traded in high dollar prices.

- Everyday investors without deep wine knowledge can still invest in wine by buying the tried-and-true labels. If bought at the right price, it is likely to earn a decent return. More knowledgeable wine investors can explore the up-and-coming labels that could potentially yield greater reward.

- With Chinese wine investors growing, wine producers are catering more to the Asian and Chinese markets. They are shifting availability to China and hosting signature wine conventions in locations such as Hong Kong.

- The mistake Chinese wine investors tend to make is to chase the market in disregard of the price. They could also be impatient to see their wine collections increase in price, though generally it is recommended to hold wine for at least five years to achieve a reasonable return.

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Alberto Forchielli</strong> discusses China-Europe cross-border deals, the challenges Chinese companies face when expanding overseas, and the mistakes he has made but never regretted.</p>
<p><strong>Q: First, give us a brief introduction of your fund and its strategy?</strong></p>
<p>A: Mandarin Capital Partners is set up to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Europe, and European companies to invest in China. It’s a bi-lateral fund, cross-border (focused). We have invested all of 300 million plus euro we had. Plus, we did a number of leveraged buyout. So our overall volume of investment has been one billion euro.</p>
<p><strong>Q: For Chinese companies expanding overseas, what are the biggest challenges that they face?</strong></p>
<p>A: First one is to find a good deal. To find a good deal, you have to find out (about the deal) early on. Generally, good deals are done by insiders. So the trouble for Chinese companies is to become insiders. </p>
<p>Secondly, speed. They are not used to do mergers and acquisitions, particularly overseas deals. And also, there are many permissions they have to go through. So they need to sign a temporary contract with a very heavy break-up fee. That puts them at a disadvantage verses international competitors.<br />
<div id="v-JA29GPWp-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-JA29GPWp-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=JA29GPWp&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" title="Alberto Forchielli: Incredible Evaluation Arbitrage Opportunities Exist Between China And Europe" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div><br />
<strong>Q: Your focus is industrial companies. For this sector, how does valuations compare historically?</strong></p>
<p>A: With the crisis, the multiples have been coming down. We’ve never bought anything for more than seven times EBITDA. We even went down to buy great companies at 3.2 times (of EBITDA), which is unheard of in China. In China, you pay 20, 30 or even 40 times. </p>
<p>(We also buy) companies with technologies, profitable and full of cash. So you can definitely do an incredible multiple arbitrage with those companies. We did an exit yesterday. It was four companies that we bought and merged in the pharma business. We sold one year later at three times of our original investment, only because it was restructuring plus China exposure. </p>
<p><strong>Q: That all sounds great. But I’m sure during this process, you face many challenges and risks. Can you tell us about that? </strong></p>
<p>A: We got where we are, not because we figured everything out, but because we’ve made every possible mistake that can be possibly made. We’ve made them all. The first mistake is when people want to talk to you just to gain knowledge. They want to use you and make you work like crazy. We went through that, and now we are very quick in trying to do a closing. </p>
<p>The second is never co-invest with Chinese companies, because they slow us down. Their process is so slow that what I can discuss with a Swiss lawyer for half an hour takes me two days to explain to my Chinese partner. It’s a big burden. It’s like running a marathon with a 20-kilo bag on my back. </p>
<p>The third thing is not to go after a Chinese who comes to you and says, I want to buy something. Never. Whether it’s a European or Chinese, forget about it. It’s a waste of time. You only have an opportunity when you are in China or Italy (where a company needs to expand overseas), but never the other way around. </p>

	<itunes:subtitle>Alberto Forchielli: Incredible Evaluation Arbitrage Opportunities Exist Between China And Europe</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In this episode of China Money Podcast, guest Alberto Forchielli discusses China-Europe cross-border deals, the challenges Chinese companies face when expanding overseas, and the mistakes he has made but never regretted.
In his own words:

- There are great valuation arbitrage opportunities between Europe and China. We have never bought companies at more than seven times EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization). We were even able to buy companies at as low as 3.2 times EBITDA. But in China, valuations are likely 20 times or 30 times, sometimes as high as 40 times EBITDA.

- Chinese companies face many challenges when doing overseas M&amp;A. They are still not insiders and often do not have access to deals. Getting the required approvals from Chinese government also takes time and hurts their competitiveness.

- We were able to achieve our accomplishments because we have made all the mistakes possible. One pitfall is working with people who are interested to gain insights from you, rather than doing a real deal. Another is co-investing with Chinese companies that dragged down the whole deal process. We also stay clear from pre-IPO deals now after learning a lesson.

- We are just in the beginning of an enormous trend where Chinese companies will become more and more dominate in overseas investment. As investors, we have to stay head of the pack.

Primarily, the fund invests in Chinese companies seeking overseas expansion and European companies in search of local presence in China.

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Dan Ikenson</strong> discusses the latest U.S.-China trade frictions and if there is really an escalating trade war between the two countries.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: Just earlier this week, the U.S. Commerce Department released preliminary decisions to impose duties on solar panel imports from China. How bad is the current U.S.-China trading relationship?</strong></p>
<p>A: Certainly, the disputes the two countries have been having have been played up a lot in the media. This is an election year in the U.S. There will be a change of leadership in China at the beginning of next year. So scapegoating and pointing the fingers at each other is part-and parcel of that political process. </p>
<p>When we have these trade disputes, we tend to inflate the meaning of them all. For example, the solar panel case. That is just an anti-dumping case in the U.S. In other words, the WTO permits the U.S. and other member countries to have certain anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, where domestic industries can file for duties to be imposed, provided that they demonstrate that the domestic industry is materially injured and the cause of the injury is unfair trade.</p>
<p>So that doesn’t reflect government policy. It’s not like it’s an Obama administration initiative. It’s the U.S. solar panel producers. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Give us some historical perspectives. For instance, President Obama’s decision on tires in 2009. Have there been precedents? </strong></p>
<p>A: The tires case is unique. When China joined the WTO in 2001, it agreed to allow the U.S. and other standing WTO members to treat it differently with respect to several issues. Under one circumstance, China allowed the U.S. to have a so-called China Specific Safeguard. There was concern in the U.S. about surged imports from China that would injure some U.S. industries. </p>
<p>So China allowed the U.S. to have this law until 2013. During the Bush administration, the domestic industries brought cases under that safeguard five times. And, President Bush was recommended to impose duties on Chinese products four times. And each time, he said no. </p>
<p>On the tires case, President Obama agreed to impose duties. That was the first time in history that a U.S. president signed off personally on protectionist measures against China. I think that was the spark that initiated a series of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: Do you see the trading relationship get worse in the future? </strong></p>
<p>A: It could worsen. But people tend to miss the fact that the U.S.- China trade relationship is the largest in the world. And most of our trade creates no waves. It’s only a small percentage of our trade that creates frictions. </p>
<p>The U.S. and China have brought 18 cases to the WTO. The U.S. brought 12 cases against China. China brought six cases. But there have been fifty-four cases between the U.S. and Europe under the WTO. So I don’t think these actions necessarily reflect deterioration in the relationship as much as it reflects a maturing of the relationship. </p>
<p>That said, this is an election year. There has been lots of China bashing. We have some really serious problems in the U.S. that Congress is incapable of addressing. They are all too willing to blame it on somebody else like China. Particularly now, it polls well. Americans are a little bit skeptical on the meaning of China’s rise. </p>
<p>I suspect if we get through this year without things erupting and descending too dramatically, next year things could become much better. </p>

		<itunes:summary>In this episode of China Money Podcast, guest Dan Ikenson discusses the latest U.S.-China trade frictions and if there is really a trade war between the two countries:

- People often forget that the vast majority of U.S.-China trade is healthy
- Bilateral trade relationship could improve after this year when government transitions are accomplished in both countries
- Recommended action is that the U.S. should grant China market economy status and China should improve intellectual property and technology protection

“The U.S. and China together have brought 18 cases to the WTO… (but) there have been around 54 cases between the US and Europe at the WTO. So I don’t think these actions necessarily reflect a deterioration of relationship as much as a late maturing of the relationship.”

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, we hear special speaker <strong>Yukon Huang</strong> analyze China’s unbalanced economy. Is it really a problem, or is it a virtue?</p>
<p><strong>On the declining consumption-to-GDP ratio in China:</strong></p>
<p>People are very concerned about China’s consumption’s share of GDP. It has been falling to 35 percent, the lowest among any major economies. China’s investment’s share of GDP has been growing at above 45 percent now, the highest among major economies. </p>
<p>Obviously, people find it to be a problem. The discussions in the media and academia, even inside the Chinese government, are how do we stimulate consumption. But there are some problems here. We also see the growth of China’s consumption per person is the highest in the world. Eight percent compounded for decades. It’s much more rapidly than India, South Korea, Brazil and other middle-income countries. </p>
<p>So, is the low share of consumption to GDP a problem? I say: not really.</p>
<p>If you compare China to three star performers: Japan, Taiwan and Korea. We see that they have all went through this decline (of consumption-to-GDP ratio). They all had a significant unbalanced growth phase in their development. </p>
<p>I will explain why. The country that had the most unbalanced growth, in terms of the consumption-to-GDP ratio falling, is the U.S. It’s share of consumption to GDP fell 40 percentage points from 1930 to 1950. It’s the most unbalanced economic growth ever recorded in economic history. But it made the U.S. a global super power. </p>
<p>So, unbalanced growth is actually associated with tremendous economic strength, rather than a liability. </p>
<p><strong>Why does this unbalanced growth happen?</strong></p>
<p>We have to answer first what determines household consumption. There are two variables. Household consumption is depended upon its income and its savings. A falling consumption’s share to GDP has something to do 1, household income’s share of GDP is falling; 2, household savings’ share of GDP is increasing. </p>
<p>We can see that personal income as a share of GDP in China has been falling. And, that is the consequence of unfinished urbanization in China. Think about this. I’m a poor farmer in China. I grow 100 dollars of rice. That’s my total income. Ninety dollars goes to me as the labor and owner. Ten dollars goes to interests and other costs. </p>
<p>Now, I can’t make a living and decides to leave for the city for a job in the factory. I get paid 300 dollars. Of that industrial output at the factory, no more than 40 percent comes to me (the labor). The rest is capital, property, etc. I’m better off, and China’s economy is better off. </p>
<p>But what happens to disposable household income to the size of the GDP? It falls. Because 90 percent of what I produce goes to the household before, but now only 40 percent goes to the household. And more and more people move from the countryside to the cities, the share of household income to GDP declines. And that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>At the same time, savings rate in China has jumped up a lot in the last ten years. We’ve done surveys that indicate savings rate only goes up in urbane areas, not in the rural areas. That’s because migrant workers save 40 to 45 percent of income. Established people in big cities save to 20 to 25 percent.<br />
Migrant workers account for 40 to 50 percent of labor force in the cities, and their income has come up a lot. They explain the totality of the savings rate in China. Why do migrant workers save more? They can’t buy houses. They don’t have medical insurance, social security, etc. It’s like people in jail save more than people who are not.<br />
<strong><br />
What is the solution to China&#8217;s unbalanced growth?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of China’s trade surplus, if you give migrant workers Hukou, China will be a trade deficit country. </p>

		<itunes:summary>Yukon Huang is senior associate at Washington D.C.-based think tank, Carnegie Endowment, where he researches on China’s economic development and its impact on Asia and the global economy. He was the World Bank’s China director from 1997 to 2004, and also served at the U.S. Treasury previously. Mr. Huang holds a B.A. from Yale University and a M.A. and Ph.D. from Princeton.

In this episode of China Money Podcast, special speaker Yukon Huang discusses China’s unbalanced economy. Is it really a problem, or in fact a virtue?

- Deng Xiaoping is the unbalanced reformer who favored the coastal regions in the beginning of the country’s economic development
- Other countries all went through similar unbalanced growth periods in their history
- China’s unbalanced economy is the result of its unfinished urbanization process

“Unbalanced growth is actually associated with tremendous economic strength rather than a liability.”
- Yukon Huang</itunes:summary>

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Ben Simpfendorfer</strong> discusses China’s manufacturing sector and its challenges to improve productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Your perspective of looking at the Chinese economy is unique. You suggested that we shouldn’t look at it as a whole. Rather, we should look at it as city clusters. Why?</strong></p>
<p>A: China is going through a series of structural changes, with the population aging rapidly and the ability to invest increasingly limited. It’s important for the country to focus on productivity improvements. But these changes will come from particular parts of the country such as the city clusters, not from the central government itself.</p>
<p>This has been the case for the last few decades. Some of the most powerful reforms have come from regions or cities. An example would be the Pearl River Delta, cities like Guangzhou and Foshan, where they are building inter-rail links reducing the travel time to just 30 minutes, and that create wonderful network effects and reduced duplicating projects that has been a problem for many cities.<br />
<div id="v-U9yuPhwZ-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-U9yuPhwZ-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=U9yuPhwZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" title="Ben Simpfendorfer: the Era of Cheap Made-in-China Goods Is Over" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div><br />
<strong>Q: With this different approach, how does this affect your outlook? </strong></p>
<p>A: What we are looking for is not to track the monthly data and find the implications for the financial markets. We try to answer some of the most important structural questions that will determine the country’s medium-term outlook. </p>
<p>Will the private sector reclaim its role as China’s primary growth driver? Will there be growing investment into research and development to productivity gains to support medium term growth? These questions will be answered by the success or failure of these city clusters.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: So in your mind, will they succeed? </strong></p>
<p>A: Some will. The Pearl River Delta clearly enjoys the economy of scale and network effects. In many respects, it is among the most significant emerging markets in its own right. The Yangzi River Delta and the city clusters around the Bohai region are other examples. These will succeed.</p>
<p>Others in the interior may struggle. They don’t have access to foreign markets, and perhaps competing with the wealthier regions for raw materials. So there is a bit more doubt in the outlook.</p>
<p><strong>Q: With labor costs rising, China’s manufacturing sector is being threatened by other lower cost regions. What can China do to counter that? </strong></p>
<p>A: China’s competitive edge is certainly being eroded. That said, China has some serious competitive advantages. Logistics, for example. China has efficient ports and efficient roads, as well as economies of scale. For the electronics sector, it’s about how much you can produce the product, but also about the suppliers surrounding yourself. It’s difficult for other countries to reproduce that. </p>
<p>So China will remain number one, though we will see some erosions of the margin. The implication of that is that China will pass on the higher production cost to the rest of the world. So higher prices at Wal-Mart or Costco. The era of cheap goods is over. </p>

		<itunes:summary>In this episode of China Money Podcast, guest Ben Simpfendorfer discusses China’s manufacturing sector and its challenges to improve productivity:

- China will remain number one in manufacturing, but it is transferring higher costs to consumers
- China needs to focus on expanding the private sector and the services sector to avoid failing into the so-called middle-income trap
- China’s interior provinces will likely stagnate in economic growth if major reforms do not take place

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Tom Delatour</strong> discusses the opportunities in investing in China’s residential real estate in its second-tier cities.</p>
<p><strong>Q: First give us a brief introduction of Central Bridge Capital?</strong></p>
<p>A: We are Beijing-based and focus on investing in China’s tier two cities with regional developers to build housing that the middle class can afford.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: Why focus on tier two cities? </strong></p>
<p>A: If you look at China over the last six years, housing prices grew rapidly in Beijing and Shanghai. In the tier two cities, the housing prices were growing at about 11.9 percent a year, but household income was growing at 13.1 percent. So you actually had the affordability for housing in the tier two cities to stay stable or actually improve.<br />
<div id="v-TIaNmmt2-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-TIaNmmt2-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=TIaNmmt2&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" title="Tom Delatour: Long on Real Estate Investment in China&#039;s Tier II Cities" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div><br />
<strong>Q: There are different styles to invest in real estate, you can take a minority stake, majority stake or form a joint venture. You can also make on-shore and offshore investments. What are the pros and cons for each, and which strategy do you prefer?</strong></p>
<p>A: Some people who do it offshore think that someone else would already have the structure in place and getting your money invested is a simple process. But you are actually separated from the real assets. So that has risks associated with it.</p>
<p>Then you can do an on-shore investment. Most people have some kind of contractual joint venture with a developer. They may put 70 percent or 80 percent of the equity up, or they only put up 40 percent and have the developer put up 60 percent. But you have better control rights when you do it onshore.</p>
<p><strong>A: When you form a joint venture with local partners, how do you make sure that interests are aligned between the developers and investors like you?</strong></p>
<p>Q: This is a critical question. The consensus is that you want the developer to also put some equity in. There is a difference in opinion about how much is enough, whether it’s 20 percent or 50 percent. But you want to make sure that the developer has equity involved, and most foreign investors want to have a situation where they can get their money out quicker and give up much upside to that developer.<br />
<strong><br />
A: Lastly, you’ve made your money. What are the challenges repatriating that money offshore and how do you manage that?</strong></p>
<p>Q: If you bring the money in correctly, legally through the proper channels, and you are investing in sectors that the government encourages, then the repatriation process is an administrative process, and it’s timely. Everybody has heard horror stories. But when you dig deeper into these stories, usually it’s someone who’s investing in something that the government really is not encouraging, or they didn’t bring in the money through the proper channels. </p>

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Michael Werner</strong> discusses Chinese banking stocks, their exposure to local governments and the property sector, and whether Chinese banks will see their non-performing loan ratios skyrocket.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: First, let’s look at Chinese banking stocks. In terms of valuation, are they attractive?</strong></p>
<p>A: I still think the banks are attractive. We’ve seen a very strong increase in terms of the share prices over the past three to four months. But I still think you will get incremental news that will help the valuations of the banks. </p>
<p>As China’s Central Bank eases monetary policy that will help with valuations, thought it might not be the best for earnings. I still think for the next two to three months, we still have some upside for the banks.<br />
<div id="v-kSb9Ii6K-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-kSb9Ii6K-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=kSb9Ii6K&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" title="Michael Werner: Chinese Banks Will Surprise On The Upside" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div><br />
<strong>Q: Now let’s turn to the fundamentals of the banks. Many people are concerned about the banks’ exposure to the property sector and local governments. How big a risk are these? </strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, these are certainly risks to the banks. But I think the market has overstated the risks. We really saw that toward the end of last year. The market was pricing in for some of these loans to go to zero in terms of valuation, which in our view is simply not going to happen. </p>
<p>The listed banks that we cover, they had around 11 to 12 percent of their loan book exposed to local government loans. On the property side, you have around 15 percent going into residential mortgages and maybe another 10 to 12 percent going into commercial real estate. In our view, the residential mortgages are very safe with very low loan-to-values. There is a very good track record of people paying off these loans. </p>
<p>On the local government financing vehicle side, certainly there will be some problems. But I think the bulk of the loans are going to end up healthy. But there will be a good five to ten percent of the loans that will have trouble repaying. That’s a couple of years out, and the banks will have enough time to earn up enough reserves to provision against that. </p>
<p>On the commercial real estate side, the banks have actually reduced their exposure. They do have exposures, but they tend to have exposure to the largest, the best and the most liquid of the property developers. So I don’t think that will be a problem.</p>
<p>The largest concern that we have are the LGFV loans.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So, where do you think the non-performing loan ratio will peak? </strong></p>
<p>A: Our best guess right now is around 2.5 percent. Right now, the NPL ratio for the whole banking system is around one percent. Getting into 2 or 2.5 percent in the next couple of years is actually in line with what we have seen in other countries that experience slowdowns. </p>
<p>We think the Chinese economy will slow down to 7 to 8 percent at the end of this year to early 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So are you saying there are not as much trouble as people fear?</strong></p>
<p>A: That’s absolutely correct. What we have seen in China is relatively good underwriting standards. I think that Chinese banks are going to surprise people on how well they are provisioned and what the ultimate NPL ratio will be. </p>
<p>Some people have been forecasting 8 to 12 percent (NPL ratio). That does not seem likely in our viewpoint. The government will definitely help put in place policies that will mitigate these risks. Just like during the past few years, the banks have been earning a lot of money, and the government has put in place very restrictive policies in terms of capital and provisioning.</p>
<p>Now on the other end, when economic growth is slower, the regulators will relax some of those restrictive measures. That counter-cyclicality (in policies) is actually positive for the banks.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle>Michael Werner: Chinese Banks Will Surprise On The Upside</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In this episode of China Money Podcast, guest Michael Werner discusses Chinese banks&#039; stocks; banks&#039; exposure to local governments and the property sector; and whether Chinese banks will see their non-performing loan ratios skyrocket. Below are his main points:

- There are still upsides for the Chinese banking stocks as they trade well below past levels
- Chinese banks&#039; exposure to local governments and the property sector is manageable. NPL ratio will likely go up to only 2.5 percent
- Most listed Chinese banks have sustainable capital regimes and don&#039;t have to raise additional equity
- Chinese banks&#039; should focus on wealth management, custody business and financial advisory to boost their fee-based revenue
- Fee-based revenue will keep growing at a 20 to 25 percent annual rate and will take up to 25 percent of banks&#039; total revenue in five years
- China could begin to liberalize deposit interest rates in a year or two, but it will not hurt banks&#039; profitability


&quot;In general, I think Chinese banks are going to surprise people on how well they are provisioned and what the ultimate NPL ratio will be. Some people have been forecasting 8 to 12 percent (NPL ratio); that does not seem likely in our viewpoint.&quot;
- Michael Werner

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>Anthony Siu</strong> discusses Chinese cross-border M&#038;A, what challenges Chinese companies face when doing deals overseas and how they can handles those challenges. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Your firm focuses on middle market with transaction volume between fifty to 500 million dollars. And your focus is Chinese cross-border deals. Are you optimistic about this kind of deals in the current market?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, I’m very optimistic. In fact, we are spending majority part of our time working on cross-border deals between China and the U.S., and China and Europe. For Chinese companies, particularly those looking for advanced technologies, it makes a lot of sense (to look at these kind of deals).</p>
<p><strong>Q: So Chinese outbound M&#038;A deal in 2011 was about 43 billion dollars, and that’s up 12 percent from 2010. What’s your outlook for this year?</strong></p>
<p>A: Over the years, the growth has been around high single digits to low double digits. I expect that number will not change. We will see a tilt toward outbound side, where Chinese companies acquiring businesses overseas. </p>
<p>In the past seven or eight years, we saw big deals in the natural resources, metals and mining sectors. We will see a diversification from these sectors to consumer and technology sectors.<br />
<div id="v-sacbxGSg-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-sacbxGSg-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=sacbxGSg&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" title="Anthony Siu: Chinese Cross-Border Deals Are Diversifying" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div><br />
<strong>Q: There have been a number of instances, where a Chinese company either failed to close a deal, dropped the deal, or couldn’t secure financing. Are these kind of instances hurting Chinese companies’ chances overseas?</strong></p>
<p>A: Nowadays, it’s very common for a seller to run a sell-side auction process, which targets a wide group of potential buyers. Chinese companies are only a subset of this global buyer universe. So that means any buyer’s chance to have a closing will be smaller than if it’s a one-on-one transaction situation.</p>
<p>I don’t think that only Chinese companies have a low probability of closing. But having said that, Chinese companies do face some challenges. One is the physical distance. Second is that the Chinese companies use a different type of valuation method. </p>
<p>Then, we see some deals are done in a hurry without proper due diligence. Maybe the leadership at the Chinese company has a vision for international expansion. It’s very typical for deals to be done with a handshake.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: What do Chinese companies need to do to improve, and how long will it take for them to become mature dealmakers?</strong></p>
<p>A: The bigger Chinese companies will have a steeper learning curve. They will be very much up to speed. I don&#8217;t think it will take a decade. It may take three to five years. </p>
<p>For the smaller companies, it may take longer for them to learn the process. But as in all things, the Chinese learn very rapidly. I don’t think this will be different.</p>

		<itunes:summary>In today’s podcast, guest Anthony Siu discusses Chinese cross-border M&amp;A, what challenges Chinese companies face when doing deals overseas and what they need to do to improve:

- Chinese outbound M&amp;A will continue to grow at a high single digit to low double digit rate annually
- Cross-border deals will tilt more toward outbound transactions with industries diversifying from natural resources to industrials, consumers and technologies
- Physical distances, language barriers and valuation perspectives put Chinese companies at a disadvantage
- Advising Chinese companies involves more hand-holding and helping Chinese companies learn the deal-making process along the way
- Chinese buyers are not necessarily at a disadvantage as sellers’ key focuses are to get the deal done with good valuations

“It’s very typical for deals to be done with a handshake here in China. But…extra due diligence is required if you want to make sure that the acquisition will end up to be a successful one.”

In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest <strong>David Gosset </strong>discusses China’s potential aid to the Eurozone and the long-term relationship outlook between China and the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Premier Wen Jiabao has clearly signaled that China will help Europe to overcome its debt crisis. What kind of role do you think China can and will play? </strong></p>
<p>A: What’s interesting is that from the very beginning of this Euro-China story, China has always been supportive. I remember President Jiang Zeming told his European counterparts that we would be supportive of the Euro because we want to be in a multi-polar world. It’s not about economics. It’s about politics. </p>
<p>Premier Wen said also to the Chinese media that to help Europe is to help China itself. He’s obviously trying to persuade public opinion. But this year we will see an interesting fact, in which China will become the biggest trading partner of the EU, before the U.S.</p>
<p>If you look at China-EU trade, more than 30 percent is between China and Germany. Already, 5 percent of German exports go to China. For the first time this year, the first trading partner of Germany, outside of the EU, will be China. So that’s some very interesting facts (that will strengthen the relationship).<br />
<div id="v-iuV9q1Ot-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-iuV9q1Ot-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=iuV9q1Ot&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" title="David Gosset: Debt Crisis Draws China And EU Closer" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div><br />
<strong>Q: So do you think China will either go through the European Financial Stability Facility or the IMF in helping Europe?</strong></p>
<p>A: China would like better to go through the IMF than through the new mechanism in Europe (the EFSF). If China goes through the IMF route, it will also allow China a bigger say within the IMF. </p>
<p>But on the long-term, what also matters is that how much Chinese companies are going to invest in Europe. China’s outbound investment is estimated to be more than one trillion dollars for the next decade. For the most part, it will be in the Asia Pacific region. A small amount will go to Europe. It is in the interest in Europe to create conditions to attract more Chinese investments.<br />
<strong><br />
Q: What kind of risks, or even backlash, should China be prepared for when it accelerates its outbound investment?</strong></p>
<p>A: There are lots of traps, for sure. But I’m sure Chinese companies will learn extremely quickly. One of them, Huawei, is already very successful, and it’s creating jobs (in Europe).</p>
<p><strong>Q: We are all aware of the problems that Huawei has to deal with in the U.S. Can that similar problems happen in Europe? </strong></p>
<p>A: It could, but it faced these problems in the U.S. because of its obsession with national security. Huawei is not threatening anyone in the U.S. The business environment in EU is better than the U.S. from this perspective.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle>David Gosset: Debt Crisis Draws China And EU Closer</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In today’s podcast, guest David Gosset discusses China’s potential help to the Eurozone and the long-term relationship between China and the European Union:

- China probably prefers to offer potential assistance to the Eurozone through the IMF
- There is no explicit trade-off for China’s financial assistance to Europe
- Eurozone debt crisis will push further the process of integration of EU nations
- The coming China-EU Summit will be a symbol to a more indispensable relationship between China and the EU
- In the longer term, Chinese companies’ investment in Europe will be key for the Continent to propel growth

“The European integration process has been a series of answers to a series of crises. The Euro debt crisis is another important series of crises, probably the third biggest crisis that Europe has faced since WWII. The result of that is going to be more European integration and more transfer of sovereignty.”
– David Gosset

<p>In this episode of <strong>China Money Podcast</strong>, guest Jack Perkowski, a.k.a. Mr. China, discusses his views on China&#8217;s economy in the Year of the Dragon, where he sees great investment opportunities and key challenges facing China for the long term.</p>
<p>- Chinese government has great monetary and fiscal resources to achieve a soft-landing<br />
- Property market and its potential downturn is not a threat to China&#8217;s overall economy<br />
- Chinese stock market may swing upward along with loosening monetary policy<br />
- In five years and beyond, the Renminbi will become fully convertible<br />
- Great investment opportunities exist in energy efficiency and environmental technologies, health care and the financial services</p>

Acclaimed as Mr. China, Mr. Perkowski came to China in the early 1990s and founded ASIMCO, one of the largest auto components companies in China. That journey is captured in his book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Dragon-Building-Billion-Dollar-Business/dp/0593061691" target="_blank">Managing the Dragon: How I&#8217;m Building a Billion Dollar Business in China</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>&#8220;China needs to grow at somewhere between 7 to 9 percent (annually) to have an economy to absorb all of the new workers every year&#8230;so we are quite optimistic that china will continue on that growth path.&#8221;</em><br />

	<itunes:subtitle>Jack Perkowski: Bullish On Energy Efficiency Technology, Health Care And Financial Services In China</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In today’s podcast, guest Jack Perkowski, a.k.a. Mr. China, discusses his views on China’s economy in the year of dragon, where he sees great investment opportunities and key challenges facing China for the long term.

- Chinese government has great monetary and fiscal resources to achieve a soft-landing
- Property market and its potential downturn is not a threat to China’s overall economy
- Chinese stock market may swing upward along with loosening monetary policy
- In five years and beyond, the Renminbi will become fully convertible
- Great investment opportunities exist in energy efficiency and environmental technologies, health care and the financial services

“China needs to grow at somewhere between 7 to 9 percent (annually) to have an economy to absorb all of the new workers every year…so we are quite optimistic that china will continue on that growth path.”
– Jack Perkowski

<p>- China will achieve a smooth leadership transition to the fifth generation of leaders led by Xi Jinping<br />

<p>- Chinese government will probably begin to ease monetary policy further after the second quarter<br />
- Inflation in China will likely be more subdued and stay around 3-4% going forward<br />
- Investment opportunities are in consumer discretionary stocks due to the increasing spending power of China&#8217;s new rich<br />
