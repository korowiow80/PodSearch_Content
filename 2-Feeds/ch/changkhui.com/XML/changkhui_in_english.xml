	<itunes:summary>This podcast is a translation of our Thai podcasts. Changkhui podcasts started in August 2006 and by March 2007 Changkhui is offering 10 podcasts. Most of these are on a weekly basis. Because much of this will be interesting to a non-Thai audience our translations provide an avenue for non-Thais to gain knowledge of the way Thai people think and their concerns. We also want to make available news that is published in smaller and regional media but does not appear in the Bangkok Post or The Nation.</itunes:summary>

	<title>CIE: 9. Hosting a Student by Diane</title>
	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>@CuriosityBlue, @MobSK128 and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Mob, a guest on Changkhui last year, was an AFS exchange student to Alaska, USA, during July 2008 - July 2009. In April 2010, about 10 months after he came back, his host parents came over to visit him in Bangkok. It must have been an awesome experience, since they arrived during the Red-shirt movement at Ratchprasong intersection. On this episode, we talked to both Diane, the host mother, and Mob to share their life experience in hosting an exchange student.</itunes:summary>

	<title>CIE: 8. Top 10 Thai Movies of 2009 by @WiseKwai</title>
	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>@wisekwai, @Thai101 and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>The same gang from episode 7 regrouped. This time, we took another entry from @WiseKwai blog, http://thaifilmjournal.blogspot.com/2010/01/top-10-thai-films-of-2009.html, and made an episode out of it. As usual for a company of three that one would steer away from a topic and one would need to pull him or her back, thus, a 90-minute episode. A few of the movies were quite hard to find through normal Thai movies distribution. Oddly enough, those in overseas may have a better chance of finding them than we who live in Thailand.</itunes:summary>

	<title>CIE: 7. Top 10 Thai Movies of the Past Decade by WiseKwai</title>
	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>@wisekwai, @Thai101 and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>It's been over a year since we had an episode in English. This time, we have a listener who pulled an interesting subject to contribute to Changkhui. Rikker Dockum, our long-time listener, asked if Curtis, AKA @wisekwai, if he would like to share what he wrote on his blog and talk about it. His blog was http://thaifilmjournal.blogspot.com/2009/12/top-10-thai-films-of-2000s.html and the entry we talked about was the Thai Top 10 of the 2000s. It's was even more interesting when we knew that he could not speak or read Thai, but managed to enjoy it via english subtitles.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>Felix Loesch and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>From a guest, we asked if Felix would like to try hosting a program. Because he was quite fluent in Thai so we tried a Thai lesson. This time, it's about how many different ways of saying I in Thai. In English, as we all know it, there is only one I. In this episode, we came up with 10 different ways of I in Thai.</itunes:summary>

	<title>Changkhui in English 4: Lost in Translation</title>
	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>David Aldridge and Passakorn</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Having attending a presentation recently by overseas company, it trigged us to think of the topic. All these presentations could have been much better if they paid more attention on customers background and, also, the Thai culture. We invited our friend, David B. Aldridge to share his experience in dealing with the situation as both a listener and a presenter. We luckily caught him just a few days before he went overseas.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>David Aldridge and Passakorn</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Passakorn managed to get a classmate to join a session in Changkhui, he was David Aldridge. He had been in Thailand for some time, had been with a multi-national firm and currently with a Thai firm. He gave us his 2cents on interviewing Thai and working with Thai. We touched a little bit on software pricing in Thailand.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>Sigve Brekke and Passakorn</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>After some relatively easy correspondence, we managed to have a discussion with Sigve Brekke, the CEO of DTAC. We talked about his view on various issues, such as his perception of the use of Internet on mobile phones, Thai cultures, etc. I am sure some of you must have read some these stuffs from his interview elsewhere. But believe me, it's always different when you actually hear it from the source himself. I would have to apologize for the sound quality, though, there were quite a few humming and echoing sounds.</itunes:summary>
