	<itunes:summary>This is the entertainment program on our Changkhui podcast station. A place where we talk freely on things that make us up all days and nights such as movies, TV series, music, books, magazines and novels. Our hosts are Gan and Ood, they spend a lot of time discussing the topics that we think they deserve a program of their own. For those who do not know, Mai-Hlap-Mai-Non is a phrase, meaning "sleepless"; HLAP is pronounced as Lup, as in cup.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>Rud Sooparb, Sutin Tanrattanakorn and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>The epilogue to episode 70 and 71. We all took turn telling the end of each movies that we discussed in 70 and 71. It was hard to believe that this was the first MLMN recording for 2012. We also put in a small video of Rud's encounter with one of our listeners in Sydney, Twitter.com/PohnlyMinnie. Thank you for your hospitality and, hopefully, you did not mind us putting this video here.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>By being the only band that did not cancel their concert in Bangkok during the flood crisis on November 8, 2011, X Japan had commanded a very strong cult following in Thailand. @XGlay, a long time fan of the band and , also, a listener of Changkhui, told the band history with Rud's contribution from time to time. @XGlay brought along some CD collections to show and play in the episode. Kanjana who became a fan recently also joined to show her support for the band. This was the second part of the recordings.</itunes:summary>

Some went up country with no specific destination. We also talked about what movies we had been seeing.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Ood went missing in action and our target guest could not participate, so we decided to touch on a "light" topic, Star Wars, covering episode one, two and three, to finish off what we started in MLMN 75. We tried outdoor recording this time, sorry for the background noise.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>Rud Sooparb, Sutin Tanrattanakorn and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>We shamefully admitted here, this was our failed attempt to finish an American comics within one episode. We did not even do justice to the DC Comics that we tried to cover in the episode. However, Rud managed to carry the story as long as he could since Ood and I did not really know much about it, except for when these characters were made into movies. Anyway, we certainly would try again for the Marvel comics in the next episode.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Too bad, we could not get another guest to join in this epic episode, but we still had Rud to share the Star Wars stories. A must-see series for every moviegoer. With Rud and Ood talking, we managed to cover only Star Wars (A New Hope), The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>Rud Sooparb, Sutin Tanrattanakorn, Chalermporn Kaoian and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Instead of talking about movies based on true stories, which we had done in the past, we talked about several Thai stories that should be made into movies. Some were quite controversial, some were too close for comfort or too sensitive to touch but we were taking it from the light sides. Sincerely apologize if you are offended by our remarks for any reason.</itunes:summary>

This was a rather personal issue. Everyone has different opinion in what movies he or she did not particularly enjoy.

As usual, Rud was the one who could really contribute to the discussion, the rest tried to find their ways into the story with some vague memories. However, it was still a fun discussion, with lots of stories that had nothing to do with the topic (as usual).</itunes:summary>

We found a basketball enthusiast, who was also a Changkhui listener, on Twitter. Since we already had Rud as a source for almost any topic, so we put the two together and tried to make an episode out of it.</itunes:summary>

Boat (Twitter.com/WalkingTrail) was a long-time Changkhui listener and volunteered for the episode. Apart from the reading experience of Gan, Boy and Boat, we also would like to thank the following webboards for their information, petprauma.com, petchprauma.com, ppu.pantipmember.com and ThailandOutdoor.com/Gun/gunofpetch/gunofpetch.htm.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>A long-awaited episode for Ood. He had been longing to produce this for more than 2 years. For those, who enjoyed Bon Jovi, Mortley Crue, Poison, Quiet Riot and the likes, should enjoy this episode. Golf also came to play the guitar when an opportunity arose, which was rare but somehow, Ood managed. As usual, Rud provided background information. Another long recording that we decided to break into 2 episodes. This was the second and last episode on the recording.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>A chapter on Thai entertainment in the 80s, Nite Spot.

Rud managed to get bits and pieces here and there to get a whole picture of the company. This was not exactly a funny episode, we just wanted to make a tribute.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>After a long plan and delay, we managed to produce this episode on the very same day that the band had a re-union concert. This was unintended but it did play out well. The Innocent was a legendary Thai band in the 80s and, for many reasons, never went away from our memories. Their songs were still played in various places and the new generation seemed to know their songs but did not know who they were. Rud, as usual, packed with all kind of information, while Golf showed his guitar prowess, Ood sang as a backup and Nok became the lead singer on this episode. Wit (from www.polypink.com) was kind enough to produce this episode for us and it showed how well he knew this stuff. It was a very memorable recording experience in Changkhui this year.</itunes:summary>

Queen was a legendary band and Ood had been idolizing them since his teenage years. Instead of just playing some of their songs, Ood went one step further by singing those songs himself. Talking about nerve! This could be an irritating episode for those who wanted to listen to some serious review or comments on the band. We just had had too good time with the record so much so that we had to split into 2 episodes. And this was the last episode on Queen.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>Sutin and Passakorn</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>While Sutin and Passakorn drove to Phuket, the topic came to their minds; what kind of songs they played when they drove on their own. So each picked 10 albums and compared notes, it turned out that they had nothing in common, in terms of music selection. It was quite hard to believe that Sutin would pick Iron Maiden when he drove.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>Sutin and Wikanda</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>We recorded the 2nd episode of Thai songs in the 80s right after the 1st one, but decided not to launch it, frankly, due to the facts that we were singing even worse than the 1st one. And then we recorded an ad-hoc episode about a guy who were in London during a blackout evening, Ood was entertaining as usual, but the episode was rather short, so we decided to combine both and make a special episode out of the two. Hope you enjoy it.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>It must have itched Ood somewhat to come up with this topic. It started with a post on our webboard about wanting to hear Changkhui talk about ghosts. But we had talked about it in the Changkhui program, so Ood took it in his own hand and launched it in Mai Hlap Mai Non. This was more towards the Bhuddhist approach, rather than the scientific approach in Changkhui.</itunes:summary>

Since the series only had one season as of 2007 so there was not much to say and spoil our listners, let's just say that this was one serie worth watching.</itunes:summary>

Therefore, the BLUR-Oasis comparison would come up during the conversation from time to time. I must admit that I never listened to or knew BLUR before this episode. Nonetheless, the songs that Samkwan played during the episode were quite interesting and not that over the edge for my taste. Hope you enjoy it.</itunes:summary>

For those who like the Innocent, Free Bird, Kiriboon, GrandEx, McIntosh, etc., this episode was really for you. And for us, it was a cheap night out for in-house karaoke.</itunes:summary>

Gan also pulled down from quotes from the AFI site, http://www.AFI.com to compare notes. Funny enough, some simple sentence like "I am your father" could really remind people which movie that came from.</itunes:summary>

This list is provided on this link, http://www.cupress.chula.ac.th/bestbook.htm. We felt very incompetent since we all combined to having read about 20 books in total, a few were totally unheard of.
