	<itunes:summary>Indies' Girl introduced us to two well-known Net-personalities in Pantip.com of Thailand. They were known for their generosity in sharing their knowledge in Thai culinary arts, making countless contributions in answering questions about Thai food. Our first guest was Guzzie, a veteran in the Thai Internet community, well, she even used to use IRC (could anyone remember?). She was gracious in both her writing and talking styles.</itunes:summary>
