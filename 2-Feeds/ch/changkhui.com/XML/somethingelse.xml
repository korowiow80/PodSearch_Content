	<title>Something Else: 17. Bay on Still Image for Commercial</title>

	<itunes:subtitle>Thanaraj Vangsiripaisal</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Thanaraj Vangsiripaisal, a professional photographer, taught a friend how he could improve his shots. This was intended for distribution so the recording was of poor quality but the essence of the talk was quite interesting so we decided to put it here, in case it could be of use to some interested individuals.</itunes:summary>

	<title>Something Else: 16. France by Sarinee</title>
	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>Sarinee Achavanuntakul and Chalermporn Kaoian</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>If you could notice, we recorded this episode right after we recorded the Study Abroad's Harvard episode. After USA, Sarinee went to France with her family. We initially asked her to prepare for this episode and mistook the trip as an Italy trip. Therefore, we were teased a fair bit during the conversation. Ning (Chalermporn) wholeheartedly acted as the host as she was planning for a similar trip sometime next year, so this was a warm up for her. With 138 photos on a one-hour episode,you could imagine the speed Sarinee talked, so be prepared and pay attention to the pictures, or you will miss them.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>Kanjana Hongsyok and Aunt Nid</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Among Thai children 30 years ago, she was their favourite aunt. Her show at the time, Phuen Noi club, was the child favourite, as popular as Sesame Street in the USA. We managed to get an interview with her, she is as lively as ever and still enjoys producing programs for children. Let's see and hear about what she has been up to.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>This was an interview with four artists who would be having an exhibition at No.1 Art Gallery (http://www.number1gallery.com). The exhibition was named "IN HER MINDS", probably due to the facts that all four exhibitors were female.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>Payut Ngokrachang and Pakabutr, part 1</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Pakabutr arranged for this interviewed and was gracious enough to perform the interview himself. Payut Ngokrachang created the first Thai animation back in 1979, namely, Sudsakorn, all hand-written. Sadly, he lost one eye during the process due to excessive exposure to light during the production. He would have continued the animation a little more had his vision been intact. And due to financial reason, Thailand never got a chance to see the second part of the animation. This is one of many Thai artists, who would be lost in due time, eventhough his contribution to the Thai art history had been huge. We hoped we could help by, at least, recording this podcast, this is the second part of the interview.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>Sutin did it all; finding a topic, interviewing and recording this episode. Ood met two guys who went through the traditional monkhood, supposedly for three months, but opted to stay a little bit longer. This was somewhat unusual, so Ood asked what trigged both to do so.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>We knew one another during high schools and each went his separate way. As luck would have it, we met again after about 15 years. Thank you Pakabutr very much for his effort in arranging this. Pinyo was a well-known new generation, up-and-coming journalist in Thailand. He ran the Open publishing house and, for 5 years, ran a monthly magazine called Open. Just like every great journalist in the world, one had to go through that reporter phase of one's life to learn and earn the precious field experience.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>Angkarn Kalayanapong</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>A relatively young university lecturer seeked an advice from the veteran, so Angkarn shared his knowledge in his style. This was meant to be a historical memo, so that the next generation could hear the national artist teaching the subject. The lecturer was Mr. Rattanarith Jantararangsee from The Faculty of Fine Arts, Rajamangala Institute of Technology (Klong 6). I must admit that I was quite impressed of his English knowledge, the pronunciation and the use of words. Please enjoy, this was in Thai, though.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>By the arrangement by Bay, we had Ekapong Saego, Bay, Nut Sumonthaemee and two other friends to talk about Rolleiflex and LOMO. This was really a recorded conversation, rather than an interview or a conventional podcast. It was not full of in-depth details or analysis. It was rather an exchanging point of view.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>It's a rare place to visit to most people, so when we had a chance to talk to one who had been there, we could not pass up the opportunity to interview. Nun was an assistant photographer to a professional photographer for the project &quot;9 days in the Kingdom&quot;. They spent 6 days there with virtually no photos to brag about, that just went on to show how tough the job would be.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>Kanjana Hongstong by Kanjana Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>There had a general confusion about the two ladies; one is, of course, Kanjana Hongsyok (our Indies' Girl) and the other is Kanjana Hongstong (a well-known journalist, who regulaly wrote on the supplementary section of a daily business newspaper Bangkok Biznews of the Nation Group). Our Indies' Girl was always mistaken for being the Nation Group writer, even her alumni lecturer mistook her for that. So, with the help of our fan, Ben'Tale, they had arranged a meeting to get to know each other and she was kind enough to give us an interview. Kanjana Hongtong turned out to be quite a traveller in her own right, having been to Iran, India, Sikhim, Korea, etc. Hope you enjoy the conversation (which took place at Krung Thai Credit office, 14th Fl).</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>Dentist , composer, producer, singer, audio ads, movie critics, radio DJ, and painter are all unique, all require different skill sets. However, we manage to find a guy who can do them all and he is a Thai. He told us all how he did all. We talked about his high school year in CUD, Triam Udom, dentistry at CU, his first album with a band after graduation. He went on to further three degrees in the USA, two in dentistry and one in sound engineering. Interestingly, he once performed his dentist skill on the legedary Mario Lemeiux of Pittsburgh Penquin. By the way, he also writes for Pittsburgh Tribune. If you can listen to Thai, you would be just as amazed as I was. You can also read his blog at http://rudsooparb.spaces.live.com</itunes:summary>
