<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>You-Got.It Team and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>This is not your conventional group-of-friends startup. They all met in a startup event, brainstorming for 54 hours together to eventually earn the runner-up award. The event might be over by December 2011 but the group hung on to their dream and, six months later, came up with the actual launch of their mobile application, Got.It App, with a few established merchants joining their platform. This took an extraordinary combination of talents, dedication and a great business concept. You may learn more about them and their app at http://www.You-Got.It and http://www.facebook.com/GotItApp.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>Rud Sooparb, Yingchat Asavasopon, Anuthep Sribenjapanon, Buncha Chanintravanich and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Since Rud and Yingchat Asavasopon had been friends since primary school days, Rud asked if we could make an episode of BOSE, which Yingchat's family had been the sole distributor in Thailand since the 60's. So we visited Asavasopon's showroom at Siam Paragon on Christmas eve. We also had Mr.Anuthep Sribenjapanon (Joe), Assistant Sales Director (Home Audio) and Buncha Chanintravanich (Tum), Product Manager, to join the recording. For those who had been long-time admirers of BOSE, this episode could be quite interesting on how Asavasopon came to represent the company in thailand. Also, it might prompt a lot of people to pay more attention to Bose when they had a chance.</itunes:summary>

And then in 2007, we heard the announcement of the ceasing of EMI Music (Thailand) operation by Pook herself, as the General Manager. It would take us this long, 4 years, to get her to talk about her experience during her time in EMI. She had been with EMI since 1992 as a secretary, eventually taken over the top job and ended up closing the operation. We asked Rud and Sutin to join to spice up the episode and Kanjana, as an old friend, to make a livelier recording.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>We first met Pakorn, AKA iNattt, at Wawee as the lead local of the iHear band. And over the year, he became famous in his own right. He posted what he encountered during the chaos in Bangkok in May of this year. And over night, he gained thousands followers on Twitter because of the incidents. However, there was another side of him that most people were not aware of, he was jewelry designer. On the first episode, we asked him to share his experience and expertise in jewelry design. By accident, we had Rud coming over to join the conversation and it turned out to be a long discussion. We decided to break it into two episodes; one on jewelry design and the others on singing. On the second episode, we focused on his singing experience and how he became an iHear member.</itunes:summary>

The two usually talked on various Mac topic, and since Apple just recently launched an update on its iPod product line, a listener then suggested that DualGeek and Changkhui hosted an episode together to talk about this. And they promptly agreed. It was really a pleasure to have them on our show.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Something we have been wishing for but did not really push for it. We incidentally stumbled upon a listener, @VirusFowl, who was blind. It's been an itch to find out how the blinds surfed on the Internet, so we could not pass up this oppportunity. Then we asked a long-time volunteer for the blinds in Thailand, also, a long-time Changkhui listener, @VisEua to share his experience. He then tried persuading @NooKao, another volunteer to join the episode. But we would need @OuiMu's help, so she would come along. Finally, we found @Ripmilla on Skype, so we pulled him in just for fun.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>A topic suggested by @Paul_Lin, as we were running out of topic. Once a topic was established, the rest started falling into place. We managed to get @ripmilla and his significant others, @JoyZ, to share their experiences. Since this was the fourth-year anniversary of Changkhui, it would only be appropriate to get the new-blood co-host, @FordAntitrust, to host the episode with the original co-host since episode one, Worawat. As to be expected, having five people chatting, it was just a matter time when someone would steer away from the intended topic, hence, the name of the episode.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Having listened to their presentation on open source development at the first WordCamp in Bangkok 2008, I could recall my impression, it was fun and very informative. Later on, I got to know more about k.Akarawuth via Twitter and friends. Eventually, it's time to talk and invited him over for an episode in Changkhui. He also pulled along his friend, k.Pisal, to join the conversation. We talked about how he got started in the IT world and, later on, open source community. It was a very impressive story for me, personally, but, at the same time, sad that these great people did not quite get the recognition that they deserved in Thailand. You could follow k.Akarawuth at twitter.com/joomlacorner and at his blog (Akarawuth.com) and k.Pisal at Twitter/lungkao and Lungkao.com.</itunes:summary>

His name was Jakrit Talawat, AKA Menn or @iMenn on Twitter. He was one of the most well-known web designers among Thai Open Source community. We talked about making an episode, it was a little awkward since he lived in Pai, yes, that's Pai up north of Thailand. Finally, while he was in Bangkok, I managed to get him to record this. We talked on various issues, especially since I had my own difficulty in designing and coding for Changkhui site myself. He was a great representative of the up-and-coming generation of Thailand.</itunes:summary>

A few days earlier, relative to the time of this recording, she was invited to talk to the Thai police headquarter to share her experience about web hosting. So out of curiosity, we invited her over to share her story about her encounter with the law enforcement communities.

<title>Changkhui: 167. Concert Production 2</title>
<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>@muenue, @mr_aum and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>I was very impressed with the Innocent concert DVD, the 5.1-system audio on the DVD was, by far, the best audio on any Thai concert DVD I have ever listened to. So on these two episodes, we invited @muenue and @mr_aum to share their experiences in the concert production and post-production. We went through pre-production, production and post-production processes. It was an enjoyable recording session. This was the second episode.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>A long-time listener of Changkhui and great commentator on our webboard appeared on this episode. Visanu Euarchukiati, the webmaster and podcaster of http://www.KhaiKhan.in.th, was a long-time Astronomy enthusiast and a member of the Thai Astronomical Society (http://thaiastro.nectec.or.th). He shared his knowledge on the topic with our friends, Piyatad and Peng. With a party of four, the conversation took for hours and we had to break it into two episodes. We covered from where, when, time-of-night, equipment and FAQ on the topic. Sadly, the very first 50 minutes of the recording was mysteriously missing from the Garage Band recording. We had to schedule k.Visanu for a Skype recording to repeat it just for the part. So on this recording, you would hear the re-recording and whatever-was-left on the first recording. And this was the second and final episode of the topic.</itunes:summary>

<title>Changkhui: 159. Buying Smart Phones</title>
<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>@Ripmilla, @FordAntitrust and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>ฺBack in the first half of 2008, people would not have much of a choice in terms of selecting a smart phone, most, if not all, would have to pick iPhone. However, in the last quarter of 2009 and up until now, it ain' t that easy anymore. There are iPhone, Blackberry, Android and, yes, Nokia is still around. @ripmilla had direct experience in using all of them and was very happy with iPhone, while @FordAntitrust was content with his Blackberry. Sorry, I am still using my 2-year old Nokia N95 8GB. However, at the end of the conversation, we did not have any real conclusion on which was a winner but it should have some ideas to those who were interested in getting one.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>@Kajorn and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>In 2007, I had an opportunity to attend the Apple Pro Day event in Bangkok. One of the talk I listened to to was khun Kakorn Bhirakit's session, he was talking about workflow in Adobe's InDesign. He pointed out about the Thai-character encoding standard that was missing and caused a few headaches among the Thai publishing industry; a simple txt file could potentially gave different display, depending on which operationg system and software you were using to open it. More than 2 years went by and I managed to have a chance to talk to him. We talked at my place and he patiently explained what went wrong at the beginning and some possible solutions in the future.

This was one episode where we felt we should have prepared for the discussion, however, Loeng saved the day by sharing his working experience.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Seeing a referral from http://www.thaivisa.com, so we checked who the person was. Rikker Dockum turned out to be an American who could speak Thai very fluently. Too bad, he did not update his blog (Thai101.net) That often anymore. It took us sometime to schedule a recording session due to his hectic schedule, but anyway, when he came, he actually prepared the recording materials, so the episode was running on auto-pilot mode. He came with a few Thai books that he recommended to anyone interested in reading Thai materials, including Thai, of course. You can also follow him at Twitter.com/Thai101.</itunes:summary>

<title>Changkhui: 150. TwitPty</title>
<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>@1500miles, @UnseenPattaya and Eddie</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>We got some help on this episode. There would be a Twitter event in Pattaya on December 12, 2009, more information at http://unseenpattaya.do.in.th. One of our long-time listeners happened to be a DJ at a local radio station in Pattaya, his name was Eddie and the radio station was FM 106.60, http://www.fm10660.com. He produced an episode on the event, having both the guest and the host of the event on the show and passed it along if we could re-distribute. Hey, that saved me for another week of episode.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>After many postpones, we finally managed to record this episode in an office. Having noticed the popularity of GPS this year, we had to find someone to explain the practical use of it. Surached and Toom were my office colleagues who have been using it lately, so this was easy to find someone who could talk about this. All in all, the technology had been quite practical for some time even in Thailand and there were many practical uses of it, other than just maps.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>As a parting note when I met Patchara (iHEar), he suggested that I could talk to his friend, Plajazz, the trumpet man on iHear Band on how he went from an engineer to a full-time musician. Since we had no episode in stock, so I contacted him on Twitter and he duely responded within minutes, so we met on Skype on November 10 at almost midnight. Plajazz, Kriengkria Suntipojana, had been playing trumpet since grade 7. He continued to play during his engineering years at Chulalongkorn university. After graduation, he went through a few soul-searching years, until he realized that he was, really, a musician. This guy was still young and it was likely that Changkhui had spotted another star before it would shine in due time. His site was at http://www.plajazz.com and you might follow him at Twitter.com/Plajazz.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>For the last 2 months, I could not help but notice a new phenomenon in Bangkok among geeks and music lovers. Every sunday afternoon, a community is forming at a coffee shop. iHear is a loosely-formed band among friends, starting with @plajazz and @iPattt. This is a truely a social-network phenomenon. Pat is a enterpreneur and musician, he actually plays on stage and for studio recording, and the same time, he co-owns a web development company. Pat talks about how this is started, how he uses social network to market his audience. I witnessed this on Sunday October 25, 2009. You could see some of these performance at the YouTube playlist.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Not a tech topic, but purely out of curiousity, we talked about the Thai fooltball league fever. It would have been impossible a decade ago to see what we witnessed today in Thailand. There were actually thousands of people who actually paid to see Thai soccer players play in a stadium. I saw tweets after tweets from Champ (twitter.com/tvchampion) who described or commented in various matches that he went to see. It was a rather niche topic, which might not be of interest to a few people.</itunes:summary>

This was the college that was presented on Apple Pro Day in Bangkok last year, we also talked about them in episode 101. About 7 minutes into the recording, Arthit turned up on Skype so we invited him over to join the conversation. Turn out to be quite an interesting mix.

<title>Changkhui: 130. Quad Geeks</title>
<itunes:author>Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>Tum, Aum, Kangg and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>For some reasons, Ood, Job, mEnE, Aum, Tum and Kangg visited my place on June 20, 2009. Some came at the same time, some came alone. Anyway, since Aum and Tum brought along a new MacBook Pro and Kangg had also updated his iPhone to the new firmware 3.0 so we decided to make an episode out of it. Since the content was really going into DualGeek's territory and they would have done a much better job than we did, so we named this episode as a tribute to DualGeek. This was really a Mac-oriented episode.</itunes:summary>

<title>Changkhui: 129. Naming a Panda</title>

<itunes:subtitle>Worawat Tangsangasaksri and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Since the baby panda was delivered on May 27, 2009 at Chiangmai Zoo, it had gained some publicity. As part of the job, I had to participate the Panda naming event on Monday June 15, 2009 at Thai Post Convention Hall, Bangkok. The event was meant to narrow down the names of 10,000+ titles to 4. There were some 30 celebrities gathered to help selecting the names. However, there were some doubts about how the voting process was done. So I decided to share what I saw on the day. Thank you Thai Post (http://www.thailandpost.com) and the Zoo Organization for the event (http://www.zoothailand.org).</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>We were honored to host one of the first, if not the first, podcasters in Thailand, Wee Viraporn. He was a co-founder of the Dual Geek podcast. A month ago, he launched a new podcast with a different group of friends and listeners, Design Pai Bon Pai (http://www.designpaibonpai.com). The podcast was meant for those in the design industry, with as many as seven founders. We started with Design Pai Bon Pai in mind, but manage to talk about something else along the way.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>One of our long-time listeners, Zybernav, happened to have a first-hand experience in handling those who were injured during the Bangkok riots in April 9 - 15, 2009. He was a doctor, who volunteered at Narenthorn EMS Center (http://www.narenthorn.or.th). His working location was right at the ground zero and he was there. However, after all that we had heard, the situation at ER was not as bad as we, at least me, as we thought it would be. Since it was still fresh in our memory at the time of our recording, so we decided to launch it in mid-week. You can follow him at twitter.com/zybernav.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>This was recorded on December 30, 2008. Chalermporn (Ning) called in from Yala to discuss about the topic with Bay and Nok in Bangkok. However, due to high-noise recording, we had to get some help to, at least, make it less painful to listen to. Thank you khun Wit (http://www.polypink.com) for helping us on this. As mentioned on 112a episode, this episode may tire those who had enough of the topic and it could be too personal to some, so you may want to skip this episode, hence a sub-episode, not a full episode. Still, it's a fun episode to listen to.</itunes:summary>

Zip Car was mentioned as a Tuned In product. We have never heard of the concept so everyone was given a task to find out more and discussed. In short, this is a community car concept, which is somewhat different from traditional car rental service.

<itunes:summary>We intended not to have any more episode for 2008, but a phone call changed all that. We would like to pass along what we shared on the phone. Also, since we both finished Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell so we shared what we had read and what we thought about it. In short, we both enjoyed it. At the end, we shared what we personally liked and disliked for 2008.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>The more the merrier, so the saying goes. And so the episode duration. With four on the episode, this was one of the longest, if not the longest, episodes of Changkhui. Ben was curious after listening to episode 103, so he asked for an encore. We managed to pull mEnE to join and get Phz to share his experience. This was more towards home recording, rather than the innovation side. A rather technical for non-music lovers.</itunes:summary>

The PDC 2008 was Microsoft's equivalence to Apple's WWDC. We both never attended the event, just shared what we heard over various podcasts and from Microsoft's site. This was somewhat an IT hardcore episode.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>We read the Sprint's news on WiMAX rollout in Baltimore with some excitement. It was a good sign, though with some mixed reviews; good on speed but bad on coverage. Then we talked about the latest book we both finished, Crowdsourcing by Jeff Howe. It was one of the best books we have read this year, not that we read that many. Apart from what everyone knew about Wikipedia, the book took us to many different projects where crowdsourcing is applied. A good read, in short.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>Phz and Passakorn Hongsyok</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>A few posts on our forum triggered the idea for this episode. Our listener, Phz and more at http://passionsound.blogspot.com, shared his expertise in music and sound production. We asked for some software recommendations for beginner, some examples for music purely generated by software and music innovations in recent years. He surely did not not disappoint me. We learnt a few things for the episode. Also, towards the end of the conversations, things turned somewhat personal, but it was in the spirit of the conversation. Hope you all do not mind. We use Amon Tobin, album Foley Room and BT, album This Binary Universe as our samples during the discussion.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Because both of us went to the event so we could talked about this as our first-hand experience. The event was held at TCDC, Emporium Tower on October 19, 2008. The event was a gathering of Wordpress users in Thailand. It was fun and enjoyable. Too bad, our mEnE wasn't there. She was at her graduation rehearsal. Then we talked about the news release of Radiohead's In Rainbow album. The news did not get as much publicity as it did a year ago. So we would like to make a note of their result and hope to see more things to come along the line.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>mEnE came back by popular demands. This time we talked about the recent Apple Pro Day event on October 9, 2008. I attended the whole event on the first day and it was very enjoyable and a nice surprise on the podcast session, and so we talked about what I experienced on the day. And another topic came up when we came across the 163rd episode on This Week in Tech, when Kevin Mitnick shared his experience at an airport. It gave a very different picture of Kevin Mitnick from the book Take Down. Hope to see more of all on http://www.twitter.com/mene078 and http://www.Twitter.com/hongsyok.</itunes:summary>

Now, instead of having just 2 guys talking about computers, it would be more interesting to find a lady geek to help us facilitate the conversation and we had our mEnE to do the job. As should be expected, the topics went from software license to copyrights in songs, fonts, movies and Open Source. It was quite enjoyable and we ended spending 90 minutes talking about it.</itunes:summary>

MonoBangkok was one of our listeners, who resided in LA for the last 6 years. However, his life there was not on bed of roses. He had to work in a Thai restaurant for 2 years before he could afford a place in a MBA classs. It could have been an episode on Study Abroad, but more the content was more on life there rather than on the study part, so we decided to put it here, saving us another episode, too.</itunes:summary>

There were six in the panel, there were Mr.Chaiyakorn Apiwathanokul, CSO (Chief Security Officer) PTT ICT Solutions Company Limited, a company of PTT Group, Mr.Kumpol Sontanarat,  Director of Information Technology Department – Securities and Exchange Commission, Miss Surangkana Wayuparb, Director of Ethical, Legal and Social Impact of Information Technology Research Division / NECTEC, Assoc.Prof.Dr.Sujate Jantarang, President, Mahanakorn University of Technology, Pol.Col.Yanaphon Youngyuen, Department of Special Investigation and Mr. Prinya Hom-Anek, President and Founder  ACIS Professional Center. This was an interesting topic and the conversation cleared up a lot of fears, uncertainty and doubts among those who were yet to implement this. Hope it would be useful.

Then a few weeks later, there was a post at DuoCore.TV that they might have to close shop much faster than they had anticipated. What happened, we had to ask. It was the same old story keep repeating itself in different industries, they has to succumb to the power of software piracy.

If we did not hear much feedback on this, we thought we would steer away from the telecom topics and try something else.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>Worawat updated the progress of WiMax in Thailand. In short, there was none. We tried to explain what happened during the last few months in Thailand, comparing to the development on the US side. Then we picked a recommended topic in Pantip.com from the Silom community. This post/topic were series written by Uncle Add, a well-known contributor in Silom community, he shared his experience on how he became involved in selling computer in 1972, representing Burroughs. The most interesting part, so far, was how his company, Yip In Soy, managed to beat IBM in the Thai Farmer Bank (the name at the time) project in the early years, when his company virtually had no footprint in the industry. You might want to follow up the story from http://www.pantip.com/cafe/silom/topic/B6072388/B6072388.html (his latest post, with links to previous posts in the thread) and at this blog, http://lungadd.pantown.com.</itunes:summary>

Instead, khun Sarinee Achavanuntakul, the writer of http://www.fringer.org, gave us a telephone interview about the Justice Online course that we discussed last week. She had her first-hand experience during her years at Harvard. You might want to follow her articles at her blog, at Prachart Thurakit and at http://www.onopen.com. Finally, we introduced an interesting blog at http://angkul007.wordpress.com. This was written by khun Angkul Artornpathai, a retired policeman. He was quite famous during his hey days. He shared many interesting stories with direct experience. Some were quite scary, in a sense that, yes, justice was only a concept, not a reality.</itunes:summary>

We had some recommended sites for those who were interested in producing podcasts or listening to more podcasts. We recommended the site http://www.joecipriano.com to find a link to an online seminar by Apple on how to produce better podcasts. This was a very good content for those who were interested in producing ones. Also we talked about iTunes U, an excellent educational content avaliable freely on iTunes that not too many Thais were aware of.</itunes:summary>

The downside for Thai would be the facts that Safari on iPhone did not support Thai fonts yet, but the upside was the internet connection was faster than expected.

	<itunes:subtitle>Discuss our experience in presentation</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Inspired by Steve Jobs's presentation of iPhone, we talked about our presentation experience. We all had been listening to ones, and, occasionally, we also had to give ones. Some of the techniques used were discussed here and some of the more annoying ones are discussed here. We also quote the book &quot;You are the Message&quot; by &quot;Roger Ailes&quot; and &quot;The Story Factor: Inspiration, Influence, and Persuasion Through the Art of Storytelling&quot; by &quot;Annette Simmons&quot; as guidelines.</itunes:summary>
