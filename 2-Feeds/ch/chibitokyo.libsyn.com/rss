So most of those news stories are fucken old cuz we at Chibi-Tokyo bring the up-to-date info. A lot of new stuff in the show first of all you can hear new Chibi-Tokyo cohost Roger in the background for most of the show&hellip;. Then we give him a mic.

So first up was Dan talking about Millennium Actress will the Chibi-Tokyo streak of dick riding all of Satoshi Kon moives carry over??? Listen up and find out.

            <description><![CDATA[<span><font face="Calibri"><span><p class="MsoNormal"><span>On this episode of Chibi-Tokyo, Ed flies solo as he recaps our experiences at San Jose's (and in our opinion, the west coast's best Anime Convention) Fanime.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Fanime isn't the type of convention where big announcements made, but that didn't make the Dark Horse panel not interesting. Carl Horn (that's right, the mac-daddy, playa'-hata' of the year every year ) was the panelist for this year and even though he said he'd save some big announcements for this year's San Diego Comic Con, he did share a few things such as previews for Manga, such as Gantz, in the upcoming months and also some philosophies that Dark Horse practice in their manga division. He described Dark Horse going after a happy medium. If they were to release manga in it's original right to left form, it would alienate people who aren't familiar with manga, thus they would miss out on great stories. On the other hand, if they were to print it in a &quot;flopped&quot; style, or right to left, they would dissapoint the manga purists who want everything in it's original form. Dark Horse chooses to flip their manga from left to right in order to reach as many people as possible, while trying very hard to keep the original work's integrity. One example of his was Vertical Publishing who is enjoying some success putting out many of Osamu Tezuka's lesser known works for an American audience. A very interesting panel to attend and we look forward to seeing what Dark Horse has in store for Comic Con.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Also, this year at Fanime, we had a panel which was titled Mangaka Are All Perverts! and we think it went over well with the San Jose crowd. Our panel was video recorded and should be available soon. Until that happens... let this tide you over.</span></p><br/><p class="MsoNormal"><span><br/></span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[On this episode of Chibi-Tokyo, Ed flies solo as he recaps our experiences at San Jose's (and in our opinion, the west coast's best Anime Convention) Fanime.

&nbsp;

Fanime isn't the type of convention where big announcements made, but that didn't make the Dark Horse panel not interesting. Carl Horn (that's right, the mac-daddy, playa'-hata' of the year every year ) was the panelist for this year and even though he said he'd save some big announcements for this year's San Diego Comic Con, he did share a few things such as previews for Manga, such as Gantz, in the upcoming months and also some philosophies that Dark Horse practice in their manga division. He described Dark Horse going after a happy medium.

On the other hand, if they were to print it in a &quot;flopped&quot; style, or right to left, they would dissapoint the manga purists who want everything in it's original form. Dark Horse chooses to flip their manga from left to right in order to reach as many people as possible, while trying very hard to keep the original work's integrity. One example of his was Vertical Publishing who is enjoying some success putting out many of Osamu Tezuka's lesser known works for an American audience. A very interesting panel to attend and we look forward to seeing what Dark Horse has in store for Comic Con.

&nbsp;

Also, this year at Fanime, we had a panel which was titled Mangaka Are All Perverts! and we think it went over well with the San Jose crowd. Our panel was video recorded and should be available soon. Until that happens... let this tide you over.





For our first interview, We were able to catch a moment with Jason Thompson. Notable for writing Manga: The Complete Guide.

&nbsp;


Next, after attending their panel Why Girls Love Sentai we chatted with Panda Cube and had them explain to what the big deal is with Sentai.




Ever wonder how to pick up chicks at a con (not us, man. We're swimming in da ladies)? Now you can find out.


In typical Chibi-Tokyo fashion, since it was too hard to reach the panelists of How to Talk to Girls, we caught TWO chicks who attended this panel and&nbsp;they taught us how it really works.





...and then they joined us for lunch. Up yours How to Talk to Girls panel!


&nbsp;


Finallly, we were able to interview Austin Osueke from eigoMANGA.

&nbsp;


Picture of Austin isn't available because Ed was too busy drinking and not doing his damn job!

&nbsp;

A little more than a week ago, someone over at Anime World Order pointed us over to this Fansubbers Documentary. It's an interesting Documentary and we agree that people who consider themselves an anime fan should watch it.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;


So all in all, Fanime continues to be a fantastic con. We made some new friends and it's worth the trip to anyone who is able to attend. Thanks for listening and sit tight for more Chibi-Tokyo coming soon.

<p class="MsoNormal">After a run of laziness we’re here to bring you anther show.
Even though this show was record a while ago (so most of the news must be old)
have fun with our show dedicated to suicide……. Yeah………</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><br/>First up was Dan with his reviews of Blue Spring. Now we all
know Tekkonkinkreet was messed up. So now Viz is striking while the iron is how
with another of Taiyo Matsumoto’s books Blue Spring. Find out in the review if
Viz knows what its doing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next was Ed with Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. In the time after
the review was done Del Rey got the rights to the manga for this find out if
its going to be worth buying when Ed talks all things suicide.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next was Dan again with The Push Man and Other Stories. Probably
the best thing about Yoshihiro Tatsumi Push Man is it gives you a really good
look at what was going on in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region></st1:place>
during the time they were having their economic boom. Both books that are out
the second being Abandon the Old in <st1:city w:st="on">Tokyo</st1:city> give
you a gridy look at <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p>Maybe you're wondering what happened to the latest Chibi-tokyo since it's much (alot) later than our regular posting. Well... here's the skinny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ed's computer died. Well....really, a computer can't die...it was murdered. </p>
<p>Y'see, we HAD an episode recorded and it was on the later stages of editing. Ed turned off his computer and when he turned it back on... something went horribly wrong. His entire HD was wiped clean. Everything, 200 gigs of anime, porn, music, porn, movies, h-games and porn... gone. I blame all his porn (yaoi) H-games. He insists it was a virus that came with some software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;...you be the judge. </p>
<p>Anyhow, jokes aside. It really sucks. That episode was a really good one (not to be full of myself, but it was... honest). So I'm here to say that the next episode will be out in a week or two... likely going to be 2. Our schedules between the three of us haven't been convenient. Well. not Scott's. Ed and I have been trying to figure out how to get everything back now....over a game of football~! </p>

<p>Ed likes to brag how he can get box seats... but they ARE badass though. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's it. I can safely say that we got it together and we're gonna work hard and fast to bring back Chibi-tokyo for another *badass* episode. We won't dissapoint. </p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://chibi-tokyo.net/hey-we-have-blog-on-this-too-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Hi this is Ed no show last week we’re using a combination of thanksgiving and the fact that the Wii came as to why that happen. But really it’s because we did do a show it just sucked really bad and decided not to release it. (I mean it sucked a lot). So for the 2 people that go to the website. I though I would leave a blog post.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The fall season has really let me down from the look of our fall preview show it was going to be good, but from most of the shows I’ve seen I can’t really get into many of them. Shows I was really jazzed about like <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6431">Kanon</a> and <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6592">Death Note</a> I’ve stopped watching. Kanon I’ve seen already so there is noting really new about it and like <personname></personname>Dan said on Death Note its just like the manga so nothing new about that show either. The Wall Flower aka Yamato <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6818">Nadeshiko Shichi Henge</a> aka Perfect Girl Evolution aka has to many dam names is still my favorite show to have come out this season. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6688">Hataraki Man</a> is also a very good show now sub ep 4 already! What this show has done more for me is got me really excited in the manga. Which is doing really well in <country-region></country-region><place></place>Japan right now. I hope all this gets <a href="http://entropy-manga.com/">entropy</a> to scan more of it. And <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6864">History’s Strongest Disciple Kenichi</a> rounds out all I’m really watching. Which is a good thing because I can caught up on my old dvds. After so much fanfare from Scott and Sal I’ve been watching <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=355">Macross</a>. I have had the bug to watch it for a while now, but I wanted the <a href="http://www.animeigo.com/">AnimEigo</a> dvds so I have the first <a href="http://www.animeigo.com/Products/MACROSS.t">2 boxes</a>. <personname></personname>Also specking of AnimEigo I’m also trying to finish up my <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=90">Urusei Yatsura</a> dvds only to have to go back and buy more…. I don’t think I’m ever going to finish watching this show. &nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now for some follow-ups on reviews we have done in the pass. In the podcast it self we don’t really do follow-ups on anything my whole logic behind that is we have already talked about it one time people don’t want to hear about it again, but I did plan on following up series on blog post like this one. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2686">Hot Gimmick</a> which we talked about in episode 5 volume 12 came out sometime ago it had the parental sticker and was wrapped in plastic I knew shit was going to go down in this book. Now I like to retracted my statement about Hatsumi being the dumbest girl of anime/manga that tilted now goes to Shinju from <a href="http://www.thewafflehouse.net/projects/toriko.php">Toriko ~Aigan Shoujo~</a> (read the manga if you want to know why). Still I found Hatsumi extremely stupid so much so that towards the end I was more into the Akane/Subaru love story then the main story line. As far as her hooking up with Ryoki (the dude I was rutting for anyways) <city></city><place></place>Azusa was a jerk and Shinogu was a pussy. I rather have he go to the dude that you know…… beats her and puts her down…. But the love is there right? Or maybe Miki Aihara secretly made me hate Hatsumi so much that I wanted the worst match for her. I think I heard for the true ending I have to read the Hot Gimmick novel and read another manga, then kill the giant spider and answer thee questions 3. so looks like no true ending for me. The reason I read all the way to the end was I couldn’t stop with the shoujo smut. And oh this had a lot of that. I still found the book as a whole enjoyable but really lags a lot in the end…. Maybe not so long next time.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now if you listen to our reviews it clear that I am more of a manga fan then anime fan. So in this last part I’m going to talk a little about the titles hyped up about this December: <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=4670">The Drifting Classroom</a> (3) its part lord of the fly’s part battle royal. Ever since volume one I have been hooked on this manga it doesn’t take very long for the story to settle in the only turn off to people might be the old art. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1598">Naruto</a> (12) even though we don’t seem like it on the show I’m a big fan of Naruto I love the manga the only thing I don’t like is how slow it takes each volume to come out. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=3014">Beck</a> (6) I love music and I love mangas which is why Beck is a defendant pick up for me this month. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1536">Crying Freeman</a> (4) we talked about this manga on show on episode 18 so of course right after that I had to buy the manga. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1519">Golgo 13</a> (6) I saw the movie a long time ago on Showtime (yes Showtime shows anime) but after listing about it on anime world order I’ve been really turned on to this book. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1511">Monster</a> (6) Scott can not stop talking about it and I can’t stop reading the manga for it. With volume 6 we are really getting deep into the story now. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=3013">O-Parts Hunter</a> (1) aka 666 satan (how can you not love that fucken titled) done by the twin brother of the guy that did Naruto and I have already read some of it and I like it. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=5439">Gacha Gacha</a> (6) we talked about in episode 2 all I can say about this series is I love the fan services in this. I love <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=6163">Hiroyuki Tamakoshi</a> art. That’s enough for me to keep reading this. And <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=4120">the Wallflower</a> (10) yes I know I can’t stop talking about it. So I won’t. And just to make this post longer then it should be. My new obsession <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=48418">Eiji Ohtsuka</a> (I’m reading and digging all his work) he has a manga called <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=5925">The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service</a>. Which I’ve been trying to get for some time now Dark Horse manages aren’t easy to find in Borders. So I went to a comic book store near where I work. And all man did they have some hard to find stuff there. KCDS was there, but I also found a lot of out of print Viz books that I though I would never be able to read like: the first 2 volumes of <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=417">Phoenix</a> and the only <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=3137">Mitsuru Adachi</a> work even brought over here <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1344">Short Program</a>. It’s great because both of which I though I would never read.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>You can now buy the great show monster on dvd……well on Chinese region 3 dvd even though I guess really importing these dvd break the dmz also but I guess its better to give money to the people that are paying for the show. CPM titles going out of print were really not missing much with these gems gone. And last a poll at anime news network for your favorite director I of course voted for Navashen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></span><span><strong>Reviews:</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I reviewed the really episodic romantic comedy <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=3135">Midori Days</a>.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[News:
You can now buy the great show monster on dvd……well on Chinese region 3 dvd even though I guess really importing these dvd break the dmz also but I guess its better to give money to the people that are paying for the show. CPM titles going out of print were really not missing much with these gems gone. And last a poll at anime news network for your favorite director I of course voted for Navashen.
&nbsp;Reviews:
I reviewed the really episodic romantic comedy Midori Days. Where the whole plot is a girl replaces the right hand of the guy she loves……………. Man I love the Japanese I don’t know who could have come up with a more ridicules comedy and make it work.
Dan talked about the really short show Damekko Doubutsu which is about a forest of useless animals living together and when I say animals I mean people in animal suites so yea check this one out.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;For awhile now I've been having trouble sleeping, tis why this post is being written at 4:45 in the morning. Anywho, I was listening to episode 26 and was thinking about how great Japanese Tom and Jerry was. I wanted to see it again but don't remember where I saved it to. On top of that,&nbsp;I really don't feel like searching for it in over 200 gigs worth of anime.... as I'm sure many of you can relate,</p>
<p>Rather than (<em>ghasp!</em>) organize my hard drive, I did a little search and good ol' <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061020-8038.html">Youtube</a> came through! </p>
<p>Couldn't find the episode where Tom goes to heaven but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yqeYSzaac8">this is just as good</a>.</p>
<p>Is anyone else out there really impressed with all the quality animes coming out this fall season?&nbsp;Usually, I'll have 2 or maybe 3 to keep track of.&nbsp;Gosh, this seasons,&nbsp;seems like I always have something to watch.... which is good and bad since I have alot of anime on the shelf... as does Ed. </p>
<p>Thanks much. Please continue your&nbsp;support and I&nbsp;apologize for the delay.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Revews:</b><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well
the biggest story this week was ADVs plans to sell you episodes over the
internet. Of course this would have been a great idea if it didn’t cost about
the same as a dvd. Also there dubed only who watches dubes…….. oh yea everyone
else. Not only do they want us to watch anime on our computers…. Strange who
watches anime on there computers… &nbsp;*hides hard drives full of anime under
his desk* but now they want us to read manga off a world reader. Hey its only
$350 to own one then you just buy mangas online where if you hard crashes you
loses them forever. This is expected to do really well in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><country-region w:st="on"><place w:st="on">Japan</place></country-region></st1:place></st1:country-region>
and here in America Tokyopop has already signed on to put some of its mangas on
this monstrosity. Else where the trailers for Death Note the second movie and
the anime series are up. Anime looks great can’t wait!!! Also <a target="_top" href="http://project.baka-tsuki.net/index.php?title=Main_Page">baka
Tsuki</a> started Translating Zero no Tsukaim light novels they also do some
unknown series called The Melancholy of Harui Suzumiya if you know what is <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reviews:</b><o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">First
up was <a target="_top" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=4915">Sexy Voice and Robo</a> like I said the first you noticed about
this book is its big… big!!!. Come includes both volume one and two. Watch a
girl get all the info she wants just by her voices.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Dan
had some final thoughts on the Jubei-chan when he talked about <a target="_top" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2845">Jubei-chan2</a> electric boogaloo. So hears prays Madhouse for
really nice looking animation or course Dan like Jubi-chan one a lot more so
listen up and find out why.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Next
I answered the question what the hell is <a target="_top" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=3599">To Heart</a>. The name alone will send Japanese fan boys in to
humbug. Being one of the most successful dating sim games ah dating sims
something the hosts here at Chibi-Tokyo know nothing about (yea I’m sure they
bought it) so anyways back to To Heart I talk about the manga adaptation of the
story now of course being a game first and manga second doesn’t help it one
bit.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Lastly
Professor Dan talks to us about <a target="_top" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2663">Romances of the Three Kingdoms</a>. I added the Professor part
because you’re going to learn some things about old Chinese mythology
&nbsp;this anime may have come out in the early 90s but hey the story is even
older so find out what we thing about it<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Next
week is the fall preview episode well will also be giving our final thoughts on
spring so let us know what you though about spring season what shows you like
what shows you hated at <a href="mailto:chibitokyo@gmail.com">chibitokyo@gmail.com</a>
since it takes me a long time to edited there’s not much of a gap in-between
when an episode comes out and when we record so I’m sure we’ll also talk about
this the 2 shows from now<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I talked about the OAV for any old school arcade fan <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=846">Arcade Gamer Fubuki</a>. I guess only people that spent most of there childhood in arcade (Dan and me) would even think of watching this show. Most due to the fact that most of the comedy in this show comes from parity humor. A lot of parity of arcade games and anime. With a real shallow story and comedy that comes far and in-between I would wait till CPM goes out of business (cuz we know its coming) and get this dvd on the cheap if only if the subject matter seems good to you.</span></p>

Being one of the fist sports anime to start the scene. It started getting fansub about a year ago it soon stopped after 3 eps.

            <link><![CDATA[http://chibi-tokyo.net/chibi-tokyo-show-22-zombie-hunter-mermaid-saga]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>News is pretty dull again. But...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mitsuru Adachi's series &quot;Rough&quot; is going to be produced into a <a href="http://">live action movie</a>. Ed and probably 3 other people are super pumped about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/charts/analysis_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003019746">Full Metal Alchemist is the #1 manga sold in 2005</a>. Series is still&nbsp; going on in japan. Other good manga titles in the list are Fruits Baskets and Naruto. There might be others, but these are the only ones we care about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summer Season Segment:</p>
<p><a href="http://animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6603">Binbou Shimai Monogatari</a></p>
<p>A moei type anime that focuses on 2 positive sisters' lives as poor students. That's pretty much it. Ed wouldn't reccomend it and won't watch anymore and Dan is interested enough to give it more of a chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan reviewed the manga <a href="http://animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=3847">Zombie Hunter</a>. This is an action title that is very much about zombie HUNTING... kind of. Alot of sex, alot of violence. Very simple action anime. Fans of no nonsense violence will like this, so Dan will most likely keep tabs on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ed reviewed Mermaid Sage the manga. A collection of short stories comprised of <a href="http://animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2415">Forest</a>, <a href="http://animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2473">Gaze</a> and <a href="http://animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2473">Scar</a>. This series comes from Rumiko Takahashi, so naturally Ed will love it. It's really about evil mermaids and immortal humans and all the fantastic violence that ensues. Fans of Rumiko Takahashi will very likely love this, but apparently not many other people will.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[News is pretty dull again. But...
&nbsp;
Mitsuru Adachi's series &quot;Rough&quot; is going to be produced into a live action movie. Ed and probably 3 other people are super pumped about this.
&nbsp;
Full Metal Alchemist is the #1 manga sold in 2005. Series is still&nbsp; going on in japan. Other good manga titles in the list are Fruits Baskets and Naruto. There might be others, but these are the only ones we care about.
&nbsp;
Summer Season Segment:
Binbou Shimai Monogatari
A moei type anime that focuses on 2 positive sisters' lives as poor students. That's pretty much it. Ed wouldn't reccomend it and won't watch anymore and Dan is interested enough to give it more of a chance.
&nbsp;
Dan reviewed the manga Zombie Hunter. This is an action title that is very much about zombie HUNTING... kind of. Alot of sex, alot of violence. Very simple action anime. Fans of no nonsense violence will like this, so Dan will most likely keep tabs on this.
&nbsp;
Ed reviewed Mermaid Sage the manga. A collection of short stories comprised of Forest, Gaze and Scar. This series comes from Rumiko Takahashi, so naturally Ed will love it. It's really about evil mermaids and immortal humans and all the fantastic violence that ensues. Fans of Rumiko Takahashi will very likely love this, but apparently not many other people will.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yes,&nbsp; Jubei-Chan's art has that &quot;classic 90's&quot; kind of feel to it. I like it because it's at the point where anime is very much <em>cartoony</em> and not all razzle dazzle and realistic as it is today. Not that I have a problem with today's anime. But I digress. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a great series that's rediculously affordable. Also, Bravo to Ed for doing all this stuff. When do you get actual work done....<em>at work</em>?</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[News:
Dan was glad to hear that Tokyopop will start a new Yaoi line called Blu. 
Cartoon network and&nbsp;Viz&nbsp;join forces to make Jetstream.
New Cyberpunk Anime Idoru.
Kids WB to stop showing anime. This really sucks because this is how most new fans get into anime.
Ultraman to hit DVD this July.
&nbsp;
Preview:
I preview the manga Nodame Cantabile. I really though the story was great and just hope it can keep the same pace because it seems to be getting really long. Dan complained about the art. This took us in to a long dictation about art in manga.
&nbsp;
Animes you shouldn't have watched:
We know we don't do this that often but for anime you shouldn't have watched this week Dan bashed Saikano. 
&nbsp;
*Remember anime you shouldn't have watched are shows we take at faces value and should not be taken as a real review. If you have any comments on Saikano email us at chibitokyo@gmail.com
&nbsp;
Review:
I talked about Niea_7. This is truly a pickup especialy if you're in the middle of college, and we touched a little on Yoshitoshi Abe.

<p><span><strong>Previews:&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p><span>I previewed <a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,3586,ijevru,ohran_koko_host.html"><span>Ouran High School Host Club</span></a> I though it was a really good show just hope there not going to cut a lot of parts on the manga to make it fit the 26 episodes I think it's going to be.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Dan talked about his new love <a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,3587,mipqol,nana.html"><span>Nana</span></a>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>*side note: In this preview we kept using the line &quot;I don't want to sound like queer or anything but...&quot; which comes from the movie <a href="http://www.orgazmodvd.com/"><span>Orgazmo</span></a>. Which you all should go pick up.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Reviews:&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p><span>Keeping with his theme of Nana Dan talked about <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5906"><span>Nana the live-action movie</span></a>. And here is a link to the <a href="http://a.scarywater.net/live-evil/[Live-eviL]%20NANA%20Live-Action%20Movie%20(5.1%20surround%20sound%20AC3).avi.torrent"><span>torrent</span></a>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>I talked about <a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,131,sumrth,di_gi_charat.html"><span>Digi Charat</span></a> mostly about the original series. I forgot to say on the show even though it's a 45 minute dvd there are a lot or extras like commentary from the creators. Which is something I like about Synch-Point dvd releases. So not a bad idea to pick up&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Promos:&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p><span>We played a promo for <a href="http://anime101.libsyn.com/"><span>Anime 101</span></a> so go check them out.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>In my review of I''s, I said that in the past, Ichitaka and Itsuki didn't do 
the stereotypical &quot;promise&quot; as children. After reading the series again... turns 
out they did. Ed sure knows anime. Heh. Also, I mentioned that there is an anime 
series out there about I''s that people shouldn't watch. I was referring to
<a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,1125,ueqeew,i_s_ova.html">I''s OVA</a>. 
I've seen it and didn't like it. However, I did find that there is another anime 
out there called<a href="http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,3489,gvnnwt,i_s_pure.html"> 
I''s Pure</a>. After watching the first two episodes, I can say this closely 
follows the manga, thus making this series good. For those of you who want to 
maybe see what my whole fandom is about, you should watch I''s Pure, but I still 
recommend the I''s manga because I just love the damn art so much.</p>
