<p>After his death I found a neatly typed manuscript which he had hoped to get published, about a big event in his life that had occurred only weeks before the end of the war.</p>
<p>The story was never taken up by any editors. I&#8217;m sure that would have disappointed him. So, instead, I&#8217;m providing the opportunity for it to be heard.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>July 16th will mark the thirtieth anniversary of a campaign supporting what became known as the &#8216;Bradford Twelve&#8217;.</p>
<p>On that day in 1981 a dozen young Asian men from the United Black Youth League were arrested in dawn raids across the city and charged with conspiracy to make explosives and to cause explosions.</p>
<p>The case was set against a backdrop of racist attacks on black and asian communities in Britain, which the Police had done little to address.</p>
<p>The defendants asserted that &#8220;Self defence is NO offence&#8221; and the hearing of their case lifted the lid on racism in Britain at that time.</p>
<p>Shahnaz Ali was a teenage girl at the time and was very much involved in the United Black Youth League in Bradford. She was taken for questioning and came close to being charged with conspiracy herself.</p>
<p>Now a senior public sector official, Shahnaz looks back on those events with me, and describes what it was like to almost become the thirteenth defendant.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the evening of Monday 14th March 2011 the organisation <a href="http://www.transmediawatch.org/">Trans Media Watch</a> collaborated with <a href="http://www.channel4.com/">Channel 4 TV</a> to launch a new <a href="http://www.transmediawatch.org.uk/tmw/pages/tmw206.asp">Memorandum of Understanding</a> to an audience of media people, politicians and trans people.</p>
<p>The goal of the memorandum is to help eliminate discrimination relating to trans people in all media by setting out goals that all the parties can aspire towards. Channel 4 were the first organisation to subscribe to the principles.</p>
<p>The MOU doesn&#8217;t call for censorship but aims instead to give media organisations the tools they need to address endemic problems.</p>
<p>Trans Media Watch say they are guided by the basic principle that they wish to see transgender people and issues treated with accuracy, dignity and respect.</p>
<p>Just Plain Sense was there to capture the atmosphere of the event, including speeches by Minister for Equalities, Lynne Featherstone MP, Stuart Cosgrove from Channel 4 and reactions from the audience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professor Joan Roughgarden is no ordinary biologist - and no ordinary trans woman either - though there are quite a few high academic achievers within the world wide community of gender variant, transgender and transsexual people.</p>
<p>Joan is perhaps best known for her 2004 book “<em>Evolution’s Rainbow</em>” - an academic work, written in a language accessible to the public. In it she challenges Darwin’s theory of Sexual Selection.</p>
<p>Her subsequent book, “<em>Evolution and Christian Faith: Reflections of an Evolutionary Biologist</em>”, published in 2006, showed that her willingness to take on controversial subjects was, if anything, stronger and more confident &#8230; despite the inevitable way in which her critics responded to the first.</p>
<p>This interview was originally recorded for another channel in the summer of 2007, but hasn&#8217;t been aired on Just Plain Sense before. In the course of conversation Joan reveals an unexpected debt of gratitude to former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and talks about her biologist&#8217;s view of sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Note that this show features a new, alternative, signature tune that I&#8217;m trying out. I&#8217;d appreciate listeners&#8217; feedback on whether you like it or prefer the traditional one. The theme is &#8220;<em>New Ways of Seeing</em>&#8220;, composed and performed by Richard Harvey in 1978

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve covered a lot about crime in various forms over nearly three years of these Podcasts. A lot has been said about hatred directed towards Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans People. We’ve also covered domestic violence, which is mostly directed towards women.</p>
<p>None of these subjects are pleasant. Yet the hatred which seems the hardest to understand is that which is directed towards disabled people and those with Mental Health problems or Learning Difficulties.</p>
<p>The question why people behave so awfully in the first place tends to be brushed aside. And it’s clear that the unease that society as a whole has in this area is perhaps the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>In this episode I talk to Karen Machin, a campaigner in this field. She and her colleagues work to raise awareness about disability hate crime and how to report it.</p>
<p>She also works with the <a href="http://www.time-to-change.org.uk">‘Time to Change’</a> campaign, educating people about Mental Illness and she’s been involved in setting up the <a href="http://rolegroup.wordpress.com/">‘ROLE Network’</a> - which is open to anyone who has experienced or supported someone through these kinds of distress or mental health issues.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This coming week, on the 20th of October, Chancellor George Osborne will be unveiling the results of the Comprehensive Spending Review, and what’s expected to be the most savage cuts ever to public services in England.</p>
<p>In politics, however, things are seldom new. You just need a long enough memory to recall previous booms, cuts and recessions. And, as they say, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</p>
<p>For that reason this episode features a protest album that was recorded in 1977.</p>
<p>The Cuts Show, by “CounterAct” was a touring review made to educate people .. especially students .. about the public sector cuts being made at that time by James Callaghan’s Labour Government. The show was accompanied by a protest album .. omitting the show’s narrative, but including all the songs.</p>
<p>Listen carefully to the lyrics, because it’s all there .. the need to satisfy financiers, threats to welfare and health spending, education, scapegoating.. and more. The show was produced 33 years ago, yet it could have been today. It even features a nod to David Cameron&#8217;s &#8216;Big Society&#8217;</p>
<p><em>The performance was recorded at Riverside Recordings and featured Rich Armitage, Will Ashton, John Gill, Ruth Law, Chris Reason, Dave Simmonds, Steve Skinner and Caroline Stephens.</em>

<p>In 2010 Nadia returned to Big Brother for a celebration show with other popular or controversial housemates. The return was not such a happy event.</p>
<p>Three weeks after that event she agreed to give an in-depth interview and talks here about her childhood, changing gender, those television experiences and much more too.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, on 18th June 2010, a brand new radio station took to the air.</p>
<p>Gaydio, based in Manchester, is an FM station aimed at and run by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans People.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the world&#8217;s first such station. There are established FM stations in <a href="http://www.joy.org.au/" title="Joy FM" target="_blank">Australia</a> and <a href="http://www.proudfm.com/" title="Proud FM" target="_blank">Toronto</a>, for instance plus <a href="http://radiotime.com/genre/c_240/Gay.aspx" title="Joy FM" target="_blank">a host of internet stations</a></p>
<p>Unlike many, Gaydio is not simply a music station though; it&#8217;s aimed at a wider than usual audience, and has a community development dimension too.</p>
<p>To find out more I spoke to one of the founding directors, Toby Whitehouse, at the studios in central Manchester.</p>
<p><i>You can listen to the station online at <a href="http://www.gaydio.co.uk" title="Gaydio Website" target="_blank">http://www.gaydio.co.uk</a></i></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was in December 1997 that the story originally known as &#8220;the John / Joan case&#8221; first came to world wide attention through a feature in Rolling Stone magazine. (The text of that feature is reproduced <a href="http://www.pfc.org.uk/node/905" title="PFC Archived story" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>The story was significant at that time for transsexual people, as it dealt a heavy blow to the dominant medical narrative that gender identity was malleable and a product of nurture rather than nature. For people seeking recognition that gender change was not a &#8216;choice&#8217; but a necessity, this was more than an academic question.</p>
<p>Post-mortem brain research in the Netherlands that same year had suggested a biological connection for gender identity; however the story of how an accidentally castrated baby boy had been successfully reared as a girl appeared compelling because it had always been presented as an unqualified success.</p>
<p>The story of the child (real name David Reimer) had been part of the medical literature for a quarter of a century, and many people had an investment in the case, both as a model for treatment of physically intersex babies and to underpin sociological theories dating from the same period.</p>
<p>I well remember the morning when the link to the Rolling Stone story arrived in an email from an American contemporary and the haste with which we put it online for our own readers. The importance of promulgating the facts was immediately obvious.</p>
<p>The feature article by journalist John Colapinto blew the lid off previous accounts of what happened. It was apparent that the outcome was very different from what everyone believed.</p>
<p>The BBC Radio Four series &#8216;Case Study&#8217; revisited the story this week and tells the story in hindsight through interviews and audio clips which include the account of David Reimer&#8217;s mother, when she was told of the hospital accident involving one of her two sons.</p>
<p>You can hear presenter Claudia Hammond&#8217;s programme here on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00t97xf" title="iPlayer" target="_blank">BBC iPlayer</a> and the background on the programme is available on the Case study web page <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t97xf" title="Case Study web page" target="_blank">here</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s nearly Party Conference season again. And it’s the first time with Conservatives in Government since the mid 1990&#8217;s.</p>
<p>It may surprise some listeners to know that back in those days I was a Conservative Party activist. I was the secretary of an active branch of the party in Cheshire. And a regular attendee at party conferences.</p>
<p>I wasn’t “out” in those days. As a transsexual woman I had completed my social “transition” between genders many years before, and had settled into a quiet and discreet life among the well-to-do women who formed the backbone of a certain class of society in one of the Tory heartlands.</p>
<p>I didn’t advertise my transsexual history and, if anyone harboured any suspicions, it had never ever been mentioned.</p>
<p>All of that was about to change though. I had been a member of the campaign organisation “Press for Change” since shortly after it was formed in 1992. And now, because the campaign required visible representatives to put themselves forward on the public stage, I had taken the difficult personal decision to “come out”.</p>
<p>I had volunteered to organise and speak at two key events at the Labour and Conservative conferences in the first two weeks of October 1995.</p>
<p>This was momentous, life-changing stuff .. at least for me .. and so I wrote about it at the time.
Fifteen years on, it’s therefore a good time to revisit those two weeks covered by The Diary of a Conference Campaigner&#8230;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the BBC interviewer Robin Day who once famously infuriated Tory Defence Minister John Nott by referring to him as a ‘Here today, gone tomorrow politician’.</p>
<p>The epithet stung perhaps because Day was reflecting a truism that seems even more relevant today than in 1982.</p>
<p>In truth, many politicians do have a short career in Parliament and are soon forgotten.</p>
<p>This is why those politicians with true staying power are so interesting to examine.</p>
<p>Sir Gerald Kaufman is one of the latter category.</p>
<p>Sir Gerald recently celebrated his 80th birthday in his Manchester Gorton constituency, flanked by crowds of loyal party activists and supporters who turned out for the occasion.</p>
<p>Though regularly offered a chair to sit down by well-wishers, the incredibly sprightly octogenarian politely declined &#8212; remaining on his feet throughout.</p>
<p>The occasion also marked 40 years since Gerald had first won a seat as an MP. Only the Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell has served for a longer continuous period.</p>
<p>As an MP, Gerald served as a Junior Minister in Harold Wilson’s 1974 government and, was shadow Home Secretary, among other roles, during Labour’s opposition in the 1980‘s.</p>
<p>He also famously wrote for the ground breaking 1960’s satirical show “That was the week that was”, has written several books, and, as a Jew himself, is one of the leading critics of Israeli policies and the treatment of Arabs in Gaza.</p>
<p>In this first of a two part interview Sir Gerald talks about growing up in a working class family, his early career choices and close to Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the late 60&#8217;s and early 1970&#8217;s.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of the communities we may belong to, it&#8217;s clear that identity plays a very big part in our lives &#8212; whether that&#8217;s the identity given to us by our place among family, or the identity we have in official records, or the one which comes from within and which we broadcast to others in the way we present ourselves.</p>
<p>The Wellcome Collection in London is running a nine month season of activity on these themes entitled &#8220;The Identity Project&#8221;, examining the subject through the lens of scientists, artists, actors and other individuals who have, in some way, defined or challenged the boundaries.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve agreed to lead a tour of the exhibition in February 2010 during LGBT History Month. Prior to that this episode takes a private tour of some of the exhibits with Jane Holmes, one of the Project Managers.

		<itunes:summary>Regardless of the communities we may belong to, it's clear that identity plays a very big part in our lives -- whether that's the identity given to us by our place among family, or the identity we have in official records, or the one which comes from within and which we broadcast to others in the way we present ourselves.

The Wellcome Collection in London is running a nine month season of activity on these themes entitled "The Identity Project", examining the subject through the lens of scientists, artists, actors and other individuals who have, in some way, defined or challenged the boundaries.

I've agreed to lead a tour of the exhibition in February 2010 during LGBT History Month. Prior to that this episode takes a private tour of some of the exhibits with Jane Holmes, one of the Project Managers.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Britain&#8217;s National Health Service (NHS) came into being in 1948 there was a desperate shortage of people at all levels to staff it. As a result the Government of the day turned to the Commonwealth countries to recruit. This film, which was made to help mark the NHS&#8217;s Sixtieth Anniversary celebrations, looks at the contributions which Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) people have made to the service.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people fall into the trap of assuming that disabled people are defined and limited by their impairments.</p>
<p>The social model of disability teaches us to think differently &#8230; about the way that we limit such people by the obstacles we create. So, for instance, someone who uses a wheelchair isn&#8217;t primarily prevented from getting to a meeting by the condition of their legs, so much as by the steps we built in front of the entrance, or the inadequacies of public transport provision.</p>
<p>With one in five of the population having some kind of disability, it&#8217;s therefore important to get our thinking straight and realise all the ways people can work quite successfully, if only we don&#8217;t perpetuate barriers and assumptions.</p>
<p>Tom Doughty has always been a musician. He only acquired his disability as a young man and, at first, he assumed that was the end of his guitar playing. But then he got determined to make sure his impairments shouldn&#8217;t get in the way. The result is an incredible talent and a great sound.</p>
<p>In this interview I talk to Tom about his life, his music, and those barriers he&#8217;s demolished.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re smitten like me with his music then you can visit his web site <a href="http://www.tomdoughty.com">http://www.tomdoughty.com</a>. From there you can buy his CDs and also reach his MySpace and YouTube pages.

<p>Much strategic attention is focussed on dealing with the outcomes of all this violence: Catching and punishing offenders; Counselling and supporting those on the receiving end; Teaching self defence &#8230; even designing the built environment to make it safer.</p>
<p>But what about reducing the violence itself? Chris Green, UK Director of the White Ribbon Campaign, aims to do just that.</p>
<p>He says that wearing the campaign&#8217;s white emblem involves a pledge never to commit, never to condone, and never to remain silent about violence against women. His organisation runs various campaigns targetted at men and boys in particular through areas such as sport, and in schools.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twelve months ago this week <a href="http://podcast.plain-sense.co.uk/2008/10/01/trans-kids-on-the-block/">I reported in detail from a special conference at Imperial College in London</a>. Clinicians from Britain, Holland and the United States came together to discuss their different views about the best way to treat adolescents with persistent gender identity issues, and a strong desire to permanently change sex.</p>
<p>The central issue is about how to deal with Puberty. If clinicians don’t do something to prevent normal puberty occurring then a trans child will undergo changes that are impossible – or at least painful and expensive to reverse in adulthood.Some children say they would rather commit suicide and their parents are understandably frantic.</p>
<p>Puberty can be blocked in a way that’s completely reversible. So this is what doctors in several parts of the world are now doing. If the child should change their mind, you stop the drugs and puberty kicks in as though nothing had happened. It buys enough time till the child is older and their course in life is certain.</p>
<p>British clinicians have been ultra cautious and conservative though. They fear factors which might be as yet unknown if you meddle with puberty’s course. Paradoxically they weight this more highly than the certain negative outcomes of an unwanted puberty and the results of foreign studies.</p>
<p>That was twelve months ago. And on the face of it nothing seems to have changed much today. Clinicians at the UK’s only specialist centre for child and adolescent gender identity patients say they will still only prescribe blocking therapy once puberty has largely completed at the age of 16 – by which time irreversible changes have occurred.</p>
<p>What has altered, however, is that the advocates for change – mostly parents of trans children – are getting more of a hearing for their case.</p>
<p>In this show we feature a recent interview from BBC Radio Four’s flagship “Today” programme and afterwards I reflect on what mature media coverage does for the debate.</p>
<p>You can also listen to my full original interview with Nicky&#8217;s mother, &#8220;<a href="http://podcast.plain-sense.co.uk/2008/04/10/gender-dysphoria-a-mothers-tale/">Gender Dysphoria, A Mother&#8217;s Tale</a>&#8220;, first released in April 2008

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year people have been celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on 10th December 1948.</p>
<p><a href="http://podcast.plain-sense.co.uk/2008/03/17/political-correctness-gone-mad/">As discussed in an earlier show</a>, lots of people have no idea what the declaration’s thirty articles actually say. And when people don’t know, then they often assume that the whole thing is irrelevant to their own lives.</p>
<p>Artist Monica Ross has taken a rather novel approach to educating people. To counter the tendency to forget, she has memorised the entire work. When she recites the preamble and articles to live audiences, it is literally therefore a memorial act.</p>
<p>Monica first came to prominence in the 1970’s as a performance artist, before she turned instead to video work. The shooting of John Charles De Menezes renewed her desire to perform before a live audience. And she’s aiming to make 60 public recitals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a way of marking its&#8217; 60th anniversary.</p>
<p>This particular performance took place in August at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester. She was joined and assisted by various people from the local community who performed individual articles and the event was recorded by University Staff. This presentation is with their permission.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week I interviewed veteran Human Rights campaigner Peter Tatchell about what makes him tick, his methods and some of his opinions. You can hear that interview in the preceding item.</p>
<p>Peter and I were both speaking at the Centre for Local Policy Studies Summer School at Crewe Hall in Cheshire. In his keynote speech he addressed the risk that in being blindly sensitive to &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; we might undermine everyone&#8217;s human rights - including sections of the cultures we are reticent to challenge. Is female genital mutilation an absolute violation or subject to cultural relativism, for instance.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the opening section of Peter&#8217;s overall 30 minute presentation. I may make further segments available if the demand appears to be there.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The question of whether gay or lesbian couples should conceive or adopt children has been with us for many years. Some people think it’s wrong.</p>
<p>There seems no justification for those reservations of course. We’re confronted all the time with examples of heterosexual men and women being bad parents and abusers. Yet the idea that less conventional couples pose some extra kind of threat is deeply ingrained.</p>
<p>And if there’s concern about gay and lesbian people adopting children, what must it be like for trans people?</p>
<p>In this interview I speak to a trans man who, with his wife, has successfully overcome the obstacles to adopt two young children. He also now advises other trans people on how to navigate the process too, and to deal with the general ignorance of social workers in this context.</p>
<p>We agreed we would keep his identity confidential for the sake of his children. In this interview he adopted the pseudonym &#8220;Nick&#8221;. However if people would like to contact Nick for advice on adoption themselves then please ask for help by leaving a request via the comments facility below. If you supply an email address in the &#8220;mail&#8221; box on the comment form this won&#8217;t be shown publicly; however we can use this to put you in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Since releasing this episode, &#8216;Nick&#8217; has set up a special email address where people interested in adoption can contact him for advice:</em> <a href="mailto:lgbtadoptionuk@gmail.com">lgbtadoptionuk@gmail.com</a>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why would a young Doctor choose to specialise in Psychiatry? Why would he choose to work in a field that&#8217;s frowned upon by many of his peers? To cap it all, why would he work in a clinic that had (in the past) acquired a very negative reputation among patients?</p>
<p>Dr Stuart Lorimer works at Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic in Hammersmith, London. It&#8217;s a busy place. In 2008, 771 people were referred there with various degrees of gender dysphoria. At any time the clinic is treating well over 1500 people. Some (not all) are seeking support for one of the biggest challenges anyone can undertake: successfully changing the way they live and present to accord with their internal sense of being a man or a woman.</p>
<p>In Britain as a whole, over 300 people apply for legal recognition of permanent gender changes each year. Many others, with less intense dysphoria, take cross-gender hormones or simply find that their feelings can be expressed within their existing gender role.</p>
<p>Helping people make informed decisions about the steps they take is a tough challenge, which is made no easier by having to help them cope with the enormous levels of discrimination which many of those patients will face on the way. The clinicians face challenges too &#8212; not just from fellow Doctors who can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t understand, but from patients who arrive with negative expectations about the institution.</p>
<p>Stuart was at pains to stress that he cannot speak on behalf of the clinic he works in. This interview focusses upon him as one of a wholly new generation of specialists in the field, and his own thoughts about some of the controversial issues that have raged for years in this field. In sharing his own thoughts, however, he paints a picture of a team still struggling with an inherited reputation, constantly learning and evolving &#8212; and wanting to do their best in difficult circumstances.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 24th 2009 is Ada Lovelace Day – an initiative which we talked about in a <a title="Ada Lovelace will have her day" href="http://podcast.plain-sense.co.uk/2009/02/09/ada-lovelace-will-have-her-day/" target="_blank">previous episode</a>. At the time of writing around 1500 people have signed an <a title="View the Pledge Details" href="http://www.pledgebank.com/AdaLovelaceDay" target="_blank">online pledge</a> to produce a Blog, Podcast, Video, etc&#8230; about a woman in technology whom they admire. This episode is about one such woman.</p>
<p>Much of the technology we take for granted today is only possible because of the ability to design and prototype computer chips quickly and cheaply. At the beginning of the 1970’s the process was far from easy. It took time; It was prone to errors; and custom chip design was not economical for many kinds of product.</p>
<p>Professor Lynn Conway’s best known contribution, 30 years ago, was to invent and successfully promote a radical new approach which made the chip design process straightforward and affordable. It is arguable that some of the best known businesses and many of the products we nowadays take for granted would not have been possible without Lynn’s historical contribution.</p>
<p>In this interview Lynn talks via a transatlantic Skype call about her vision and the things that thrill her about engineering. You can also read her <a title="Lynn Conway's VLSI Archive" href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/VLSI/VLSIarchive.html" target="_blank">VLSI Archive </a>and about some of her other work and challenges <a title="Lynn Conway's web site" href="http://www.lynnconway.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today (17th March) I have completed production on the next Podcast (episode 57). However, this won&#8217;t be released for a week because it is my contribution to the Ada Lovelace campaign (see the recent episode on this for details).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very excited about the forthcoming episode as it features one of the true pioneers of the computer and technology revolution, Professor Lynn Conway. Lynn&#8217;s most famous work, which came to fruition 30 years ago this autumn, created the basis for engineers to be able to design and prototype electronic chip designs fast enough and cheap enough to make the technology feasible for inclusion in practically every electronic device we use today.</p>
<p>I am going to sit on that exciting interview until the allotted day, March 24th, but in the meantime here is a short video about how remote interviews like Lynn Conway&#8217;s are made. There are also some more details about the production process in general on the <a title="Just Plain Sense Blog (New Window)" href="http://christineburns.blogspot.com/2009/03/making-of-just-plain-sense-podcasts.html" target="_blank">Just Plain Sense Blog</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Father, Leslie Burns, was born less than four years after the end of the First World War. It was a world where women could not vote, and which was about to be hit by a terrible economic depression. Later he served in the RAF during the second world war, lived through post war austerity, married, became my Father and was almost into middle age by the time of the Cuban Missile crisis and the massive social changes which followed in the 1960’s.</p>
<p>One of the traps of looking back on a past you’ve mostly only read about or seen on TV is to assume that everyone shares the same narrative as the historians – and so parts of this interview may come as a surprise. They certainly did for me.</p>
<p>And interviewing your own Father is like no other assignment I’ve ever attempted before. As I found, it’s far from easy to adopt the same approach as you would for a stranger.</p>
<p>All in all, it wasn’t quite the interview I expected – but perhaps there’s something for us all to learn from the unexpected.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of all the diversity issues, religion is the most difficult. It so often involves the question of how far one can allow the rights of people to apply the doctrines they believe-in to the lives of other people.</p>
<p>Our religion – or lack of one – is perhaps the only thing we can really choose. Everything else is beyond our control – gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or age. But regardless of the indoctrination we might receive through our upbringing, we have the power as adults to choose what we believe and how we behave towards others.</p>
<p>So where does the right to have a religious belief (and to worship) end and discrimination begin? And, in such a multicultural society as Britain, how do people with competing religious beliefs reconcile the inevitable differences? Can any one person speak for them all when organisations wish to consult on the topic?</p>
<p>Monsignor John Devine is Churches’ Officer for the North West. He runs the <a title="Faith North West (new window)" href="http://www.faithnorthwest.org.uk/" target="_blank">North West Forum of Faiths</a> and is a priest in the Roman Catholic  Archdiocese of Liverpool. From his position of regular dialogue with people of many faiths, he seemed like a relevant person to ask.</p>

<p>In the previous episode I talked to her about FA&#8217;s uniqueness as three women writing and singing comic political satire for over 25 years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also quite widely known that Adele is a transsexual woman. Maybe that&#8217;s not such a big deal nowadays, when people have seen many representations of trans women (real and fictional) in film and TV. In this interview I talk to her about the way it was received 25 years ago, and the TV dramas and films she&#8217;s been involved with in the years since then.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Adele Anderson is one of the mainstays of the comedy/satire trio Fascinating Aida.

In the previous episode I talked to her about FA's uniqueness as three women writing and singing comic political satire for over 25 years.

It's also quite widely known that Adele is a transsexual woman. Maybe that's not such a big deal nowadays, when people have seen many representations of trans women (real and fictional) in film and TV. In this interview I talk to her about the way it was received 25 years ago, and the TV dramas and films she's been involved with in the years since then.

The songs you hear in this programme can all be heard in full on Adele's Myspace Page.</itunes:summary>

<p><a title="Fascinating Aida Website (New window)" href="http://www.fascinating-aida.co.uk/" target="_blank">Fascinating Aida </a>have been collecting ecstatic hyperbole from reviewers for a quarter of a century and have an immensely loyal fan base. Yet, in Britain at least, musical comedy and satire is still not an area that all that many women have conquered.

<p><a title="Adele's Myspace profile (New Window)" href="http://www.myspace.com/adeleanderson" target="_blank">Adele Anderson</a>, who joined the Act a year after it was created in 1984, was very generous with her time for this interview in her hotel room, a couple of hours before going on stage at the Lowry in Salford.

<p>This first episode departs from the normal &#8220;Just Plain Sense&#8221; format to focus on the group itself, their music and Adele&#8217;s career.

<p>To ask these questions, and to look particularly at the issues for LGB and Trans people, I hooked up with Internet broadcaster Ethan StPierre in Massachusetts. I learned, for instance, how a last gasp move by George Bush, aimed at women&#8217;s choice on abortion, could go on to have effects for trans people too.</p>

<p>During December I spoke to several audiences about the 40 year history that brought us to this point – you can hear a version that in an <a title="The Single Equality Challenge" href="http://podcast.plain-sense.co.uk/2008/11/25/the-single-equality-challenge" target="_blank">earlier episode</a>. I plan to feature an update when the Bill has been published and there&#8217;s been a chance to study the fine print.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here is a keynote speech about trans people in social care, which I delivered back in October 2007 for the Commission for Social Care Inspection. The audience included over 300 inspectors, social workers and service providers.

<p>Unless they are very lucky, most of the kinds of people we focus upon in Equality, Diversity and Human Rights will have had a close encounter of some kind with discrimination. Ideally that experience would make everyone that extra bit sensitive about respecting the differences of others. Unfortunately that’s not always the case. Firsthand experience of hurt doesn’t necessarily make better people.</p>
<p>People from some ethnic backgrounds may express homophobic views. Some lesbian or gay people may express racist views. It can seem at times as though people with evangelical religious beliefs might be intolerant of just about everyone other than themselves. Disputes can extend even within communities who, while distinct, experience similar forms of discrimination.</p>
<p>Nobody ever emerges well from these affairs. People behave badly on all sides. The in-fighting detracts from the business of tackling wider issues. Hostilities alienate friends and allies. They sap energy and lead to disillusioned and bruised people disengaging altogether.</p>
<p>But if these disputes can sometimes feel like war then it&#8217;s worth remembering that it takes two to make an eventual truce.</p>
<p>Not all truces last, of course. Yet even a brief halt can allow common humanity to be recognised and highlight the pointlessness of the fray. The setting here is the multiply-divided LGBT community, but it could be any.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Estimates vary about the number of Britons with disabilities of various kinds. Some say it’s 1 in 7; others say 1 in 5. Either way, it’s a significant chunk of the population.</p>
<p>Historically many disabled people have faced enormous barriers in being able to work and access facilities the rest of us take for granted. Yet none of us can be sure we won’t acquire a disability ourselves – through accidents, chronic illness or simply old age. If it doesn’t happen to us, it may affect someone we would end up caring for. So we cannot afford to be smug and thankful it doesn’t affect us.</p>
<p>One person who knows the barriers very well is Lorraine Gradwell, who recently received an MBE for her extensive work in the field. Lorraine is Chief Executive of <a title="Visit Breakthrough UK in a separate window" href="http://www.breakthrough-uk.com" target="_blank">Breakthrough UK Ltd</a>, a Manchester-based social enterprise, led and controlled by disabled people, and which specialises in helping people access work.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m hoping to get one more interview online for Just Plain Sense before the holiday season is upon us. In the meantime regular listeners with a Podcast &#8216;habit&#8217; to feed may like to know about a separate new channel which I&#8217;ve now opened for my poetry &#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Go Fishing for Birds in a separate window" href="http://fish4birds.podbean.com/" target="_blank">Fishing for Birds</a> features personal readings of the many poems I penned during the 1970&#8217;s and 1990&#8217;s. Almost thirty of these have been recorded already and, to kick things off, I&#8217;ve already released the first six of those. The rest will be released at the rate of one or two each day over the holidays.</p>
<p>The title poem in the collection is based on the experience of meeting a disabled man one day when I was walking across Boston Common, in Massachusetts. The experience of learning how Richard Troise overcame his physical limitations to fly kites had a lasting effect on my own thinking about dealing with apparent barriers.

		<itunes:summary>I'm hoping to get one more interview online for Just Plain Sense before the holiday season is upon us. In the meantime regular listeners with a Podcast 'habit' to feed may like to know about a separate new channel which I've now opened for my poetry ...

Fishing for Birds features personal readings of the many poems I penned during the 1970's and 1990's. Almost thirty of these have been recorded already and, to kick things off, I've already released the first six of those. The rest will be released at the rate of one or two each day over the holidays.

The title poem in the collection is based on the experience of meeting a disabled man one day when I was walking across Boston Common, in Massachusetts. The experience of learning how Richard Troise overcame his physical limitations to fly kites had a lasting effect on my own thinking about dealing with apparent barriers. That's why I think it has a valid place here, as a taster.

Happy listening!</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 11% of Britain’s population falls into the category of Black or Minority Ethnic (BME). Yet that umbrella term conceals a huge diversity in itself. Although it’s tempting to think in terms of some of the most obvious groups, such as people who’ve originated from Africa, the West Indies or Asia, or those from the middle east, it’s easy to forget all the other backgrounds that people have. Irish people are considered an ethnic group, for instance. So are white Europeans from the enlarged European Community.</p>
<p>In this Episode Rushi Munshi, a Regional Director for the <a title="Visit CEMVO's web site in a separate window" href="http://www.cemvo.org.uk/" target="_blank">Council for Ethnic Minority Voluntary Sector Organisations (CEMVO)</a>, describes how his organisation works with the vast number of voluntary sector organisations representing this varied segment of Britain&#8217;s society.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The three statutory equality duties in Britain - covering Race, Disability and Gender - all demand consultation or involvement with expert community stakeholders if problem identification and action planning is ever to be more than a token affair. The problem lies with how to organise that kind of engagement effectively.</p>
<p>Consider North West England. The region has over 30,000 voluntary sector organisations. Yet the number with sufficient capacity and skills to take part in strategic consultation work hardly exceed single figures. With well over 120 separate public authorities all needing to organise the same kind of consultation, there&#8217;s the potential for meltdown unless a practical approach is adopted.</p>
<p>Sefton is a diverse coastal borough which stretches from Liverpool in the south and almost up to Blackpool. Along its coast lies Southport, a distinguished old-style holiday resort which is reinventing itself for a new generation. I was invited there recently to give a speech as part of the borough&#8217;s annual diversity week. And whilst I was there I had the chance to speak with the people behind the borough&#8217;s &#8216;joined-up&#8217; partnership approach to collective consultation and strategy-making&#8230;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She has been likened to Marmite: you either love what she writes or hate it.</p>
<p>Outspoken Guardian columnist and radical lesbian feminist Julie Bindel is widely praised by some for the campaigning she has done on the issues of violence against women, and on the way that our legal system responds to women who defend themselves. She is treasured by others for the particular way she reveals her lesbian and feminist influences as a broadsheet columnist.</p>
<p>Yet, on the day when I had long arranged to meet for lunch and talk about these things, Julie was also embroiled in a controversy that had arisen over what she had written and said in the past about transsexual people. This issue was suddenly brought to the boil because she had been nominated for an award as “Journalist of the Year” by the leading British Lesbian and Gay charity Stonewall.</p>
<p>We discussed all these things and hopefully opened doors to dialogue with her detractors over a meal &#8212; though I hasten to add that Marmite wasn&#8217;t on the menu.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in April this year I <a title="Gender Dysphoria - A Mother's Tale" href="http://podcast.plain-sense.co.uk/2008/04/10/gender-dysphoria-a-mothers-tale" target="_blank">interviewed</a> the mother of an intensely gender dysphoric child. She told how her child (now living as a girl) had become increasingly desperate and suicidal as the prospect of a masculine puberty grew larger. Specialists in the UK weren&#8217;t prepared to medicate in order to delay the irreversible effects her child&#8217;s body would undergo and, in desperation, she took her child across the Atlantic to Boston instead.</p>
<p>The Royal Society of Medicine convened a conference to debate this issue in October. However, the country&#8217;s leading specialist Professor Richard Green, was concerned that the speakers selected for that conference were mostly based in the &#8220;conservative&#8221; camp. In response he organised a pre-emptive conference of his own at Imperial College in London, where specialists successfully practicing puberty delay therapy around the world could present their outcome data and experiences.</p>
<p>I went along to Richard Green&#8217;s conference at his invitation and recorded interviews with many of the speakers for this detailed feature.

Now I am considering whether to run a second season and, if so, what content to focus upon. Before I plan anything I&#8217;d like to hear from you, the listeners. Please help me by completing this brief survey about what you like or don&#8217;t like, or anything else you&#8217;d especially like to hear. The survey will take only a minute to complete but I really value your opinions.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is an occupational hazard of organising speaking events that now and then one of your speakers will be suddenly and unexpectedly indisposed. When that happens you can either leave a gap &#8212; or try and fill the breach yourself.</p>
<p>This is a problem that arose in the third of our recent conference / workshops on the Gender Equality Duty in Health. At each event civil servants from the Department of Health had volunteered to come and deliver their version of a common presentation about their department&#8217;s approach, and what it should mean. However, on our last day, one of them was prevented at the very last minute from attending.</p>
<p>Fortunately I&#8217;m familiar with what was going to be said &#8212; in part because I contribute regularly to two community stakeholder engagement groups, including an advisory group on Gender Equality. This meant I was able to step in at short notice and fill the gap &#8212; although the emphasis is inevitably my own as a result.</p>
<p>In the next episode we change tack again, with an in-depth interview with the Labour back bench MP Dr Lynne Jones. Lynne has lots to say about equality and diversity &#8212; in and out of Parliament, so be sure you don&#8217;t miss that episode, coming up soon.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attention has been focussed recently on whether NHS Trusts in England are responding properly to the Gender Equality Duty, since it came into force in April 2007. Research by the Men&#8217;s Health Forum highlighted that many of the published gender equality schemes it had researched were poorly evidenced, focussed on processes rather than outcomes, and showed a lack of effective consultation and involvement with service users.</p>
<p><strong><em>Plain Sense</em></strong> was recently commissioned to put together a series of conference workshops for senior NHS Trust managers in England&#8217;s North West region, to discuss how to be more effective and compliant in this area. Presenters included figures from the Strategic Health Authority, the Department of Health and the Equality and Human Rights Commission to explain what was expected. Just as importantly, an array of stakeholder speakers were invited to explain their view of the real priorities for promoting equality.</p>
<p>Karen Moore is a policy officer with the <a title="Visit the Women's Resource Centre web site in a fresh window" href="http://www.wrc.org.uk/" target="_blank">Women&#8217;s Resource Centre</a> - a national umbrella organisation based in London. In her speech, presented here in full, she challenged NHS Trust managers to look strategically at issues like violence against women and support for rape crisis centres as a means of avoiding longer term and more intractable mental and physical health issues. Afterwards her colleague, Darlene Corry, provided an interview summing up the challenges and opportunities in thinking &#8216;out of the box&#8217; on these kinds of issues.</p>

<p>With more time to spend than in the recent Nottingham event, and with a broader audience of public services in the audience, this presentation covers some different ground, and includes a tongue-in-cheek &#8216;confession&#8217;. There are, of course, some familiar elements too.</p>
<p>After quite a lot of LGBT coverage recently, the next few episodes will be moving on to look at Men and Women&#8217;s experiences of health, and the Department of Health&#8217;s strategy for Gender Equality. In the coming week I also have a very special interview guest booked, and they will be appearing in a later episode. So do &#8217;stay tuned&#8217;.

<p>The media&#8217;s stereotype of business attitudes to equality and diversity issues is a crude one, which tends to emphasise opposition towards regulation and any moves that might impact upon profits or flexibility. The reality is more complex. Many businesses understand already that embracing diversity is a good thing, and that private or corporate enterprise cannot pretend to exist in a bubble somehow divorced from larger issues about the kind of society we have.</p>
<p>Trevor&#8217;s speech reflected the former sensitivities whilst reaching out for a more sophisticated dialogue.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I&#8217;m presenting the second of three episodes in which you can hear the speakers at the recent Department of Health conference on LGBT Mental Health in Nottingham. (For more details see last week&#8217;s part one).</p>
<p>Tim Franks is the Chief Executive of <a title="Visit the PACE web site" href="http://www.pacehealth.org.uk/" target="_blank">PACE, a leading London-based charity</a> which promotes mental health and well-being within the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans community there.</p>
<p>In his presentation Tim talks about the different reasons that LGBT people may have for connecting with Mental Health services. Like many of the day’s speakers he emphasises that whilst being different in these ways is not a mental illness, people have the experiences of discrimination to deal with and, of course, they can experience conditions such as depression or psychotic illnesses like anyone else.</p>
<p>Tim also raises interesting perspectives about the way therapeutic relationships can benefit when service users don’t need to explain aspects of their identity and simply feel that their sexual orientation or gender presentation is accepted. He says that in PACE the service providers ‘come out’ about their position so that the service user doesn’t need to.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 28th May the Department of Health organised a major conference on LGBT Mental Health in Nottingham. The event was attended by well over 100 health professionals and the day was led by Professor Clair Chilvers, who is the Chair of Nottingham Healthcare NHS Trust.</p>
<p>In this and the following two episodes the speeches of some of the main presenters will be featured in full. For this first programme we hear the introduction from Surinder Sharma, National Director of the Department of Health&#8217;s Equality and Human Rights Group. Surinder is then followed by Professor Anne Rogers, who holds the chair in Sociology of Health Care at the University of Manchester. Both of these speakers paint a progressive picture of the understanding of the role of mental health, and how thinking is changing (or needs to change) to meet the true needs of people without unnecessarily pathologising their difference.</p>
<p><em>Copies of Powerpoint presentations and other materials from this conference are </em><a title="Link to event organiser's supporting web pages" href="http://www.glasgows.co.uk/mentalhealthconference/presentations.html" target="_blank"><em>now online here</em></a><em>.</em>

Surinder is then followed by Professor Anne Rogers, who holds the chair in Sociology of Health Care at the University of Manchester. Both of these speakers paint a progressive picture of the understanding of the role of mental health, and how thinking is changing (or needs to change) to meet the true needs of people without unnecessarily pathologising their difference.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next week things will be returning to normal with a series of episodes based on presentations from a recent Department of Health Mental Health conference that took place in Nottingham. For now, however, I&#8217;m offerring an opportunity to hear another full length interview with one of the grand old men of British trans campaigning, Mark Rees.</p>
<p>Like Stephen Whittle, featured in the previous episode, Mark transitioned from female to male role in the early 1970&#8217;s. He became the first trans person in the world to take a case to an international human rights court in the mid 1980&#8217;s. Although this bid for privacy and marriage rights was unsuccessful, he then went on to be instrumental in the creation of the UK campaign group Press for Change in 1992.</p>
<p><em>Postscript: Shortly after publishing this episode I learned from Mark that he has finally (somewhat belatedly) received his own Gender Recognition Certificate.</em>

<p>Dr Stephen Whittle is perhaps the world&#8217;s best known transsexual man. He is Professor of Equalities Law at Manchester Metropolitan University, the President of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and the Chair of Transgender Europe, in addition to being one of the founders of the UK lobby group Press for Change. He is also a committed family man, with a wife and four children. In this in-depth interview, originally recorded in summer 2007, we cover his own personal background growing up in Manchester, his transition in the 1970&#8217;s, his work as a campaigner, and his views about the future for trans people.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Just Plain Sense it&#8217;s my aim to feature every side of the enormous conversation around Equality, Diversity and Human Rights in British society. There are plenty of people who can talk about first hand experiences, or advocate on behalf of whole communities; in the last episode we heard from a senior civil servant; so in this episode I&#8217;m featuring a speech by an elected city council politician.</p>
<p>Councillor Paul Fairweather represents the North Manchester area of Harpurhey. He&#8217;s an out gay man and this speech is taken from a conference last year on LGBT Health strategy, so his comments about health and more general inclusion reflect that. Nevertheless his point about the role of local political influence &#8212; using scrutiny powers, local area agreements and partnerships &#8212; is just as valid for any group.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>July 2008 sees the 60th anniversary of Britain&#8217;s National Health Service. Much has changed in that time of course. It&#8217;s a different world from the immediate post war era in which the idea of a universal public health service, free at the point of need, was born.</p>
<p>Britain is far more culturally diverse. Public health emphasis is shifting from treating illness to preventing it. Health and well-being are increasingly seen as integral to wider strategy for encouraging and maintaining a socially equitable and economically successful society.</p>
<p>As the Department of Health&#8217;s programme director for equality policy, Barry Mussenden heads a team that&#8217;s responsible for ensuring that health and social care services match everyone&#8217;s needs equally and fairly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not an easy brief. The NHS is a federation of independent public bodies whose priorities can only be influenced, not commanded. The health service is Europe&#8217;s largest employer, staffed by ordinary people who have just  the same blind spots and prejudices as the rest of society.</p>
<p>In this short interview Barry explains how his team sees the challenge and takes it on.</p>

<p>In this in-depth interview Sue speaks at length about the organisation she has worked for during the majority of her adult life, the way things have changed in that time and the problem for the next generation of society when today&#8217;s teachers are not equipped to teach about diversity.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you do when your child exhibits markedly gender-atypical play behaviour almost as soon as they can walk and tells you, by the time they are four years old, that there&#8217;s been a mistake?</p>
<p>Susie is a Yorkshire mum with three young children. Two are very much boys, but the other, though born the same, has insisted since pre-school that a mistake had been made.</p>
<p>In this in-depth interview she tells how she handled the challenge, sought help and has cared for her child at every stage in a remarkable journey through growing up. She also tells why she felt her child was not getting the right kind of treatment at Britain&#8217;s only child and adolescent clinic specialising in this area, and why she turned, instead, to specialists in the USA and The Netherlands. As a mother, she also has advice for schools on how they could help parents and children avoid the bullying her child has experienced.</p>

<p>In this wide-ranging interview Paul talks about the background to the Lesbian and Gay Foundation; the reasons why places like Manchester have become centres of LGB culture; the surprising ordinariness of many lesbian and gay people&#8217;s lives; working for a better society &#8212; and working with each other.
