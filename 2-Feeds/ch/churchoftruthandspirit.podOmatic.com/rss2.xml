&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000; font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minister Stevie Tee records his fourth gospel music video. Song called Jesus Saw The Best In Me features Marvin Sapp,Shekinah Glory and his wife Prophetess Ertha Thompson was designed strictly for the streets to win new souls. Growing up not in Christ you see a lot and hear a lot of worldly music that clouds your mind with negativity, so Minister Stevie Tee was led to make a mixtape/cd that the non christians in the streets instrumentally can relate to but listen with christian lyrics. Minister Stevie Tee says informing the drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes and pushers know this is where he use to be having fun in the world that it was fun until you find out where it will lead you and that you can cause generational curses if you do not leave a true inheritance and thats to become rich in Christ Jesus and that will bring upon blessings to their kids and grandkids even their family today so that way they'll leave behind a legacy in Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Minister Stevie Tee records his fourth gospel music video. Song called Jesus Saw The Best In Me features Marvin Sapp,Shekinah Glory and his wife Prophetess Ertha Thompson was designed strictly for the streets to win new souls. Growing up not in Christ you see a lot and hear a lot of worldly music that clouds your mind with negativity, so Minister Stevie Tee was led to make a mixtape/cd that the non christians in the streets instrumentally can relate to but listen with christian lyrics. Minister Stevie Tee says informing the drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes and pushers know this is where he use to be having fun in the world that it was fun until you find out where it will lead you and that you can cause generational curses if you do not leave a true inheritance and thats to become rich in Christ Jesus and that will bring upon blessings to their kids and grandkids even their family today so that way they'll leave behind a legacy in Jesus Christ.
