        <h4>Onyx is Here! </h4>
        <h4 align="center" class="newrule">&nbsp; </h4>
        <p>April 15th 2011</p>
        <p>This week we welcomed the illustrious New York Hip Hop group Onyx to the facility to record an up and coming release. Also joining in on the sessions were Toronto natives Bishop Brigante and The So Sick Social Club. </p>
        <p> Onyx's shouting, in-your-face brand of high-volume rapping proved to be more at home in the slam pit than on the dancefloor and brought the rap quartet instant chart success. Originally formed in Queens, NY, during 1990, the members of Onyx met while working as barbers. The band honed their rhyming skills and act by performing at local clubs, which eventually gained the attention of Run-D.M.C.'s Jam Master Jay, who signed the group to his label, JMJ Records, and even helped produce Onyx's debut full-length, Bacdafucup, in 1993. The album turned out to be a platinum-certified smash, spurred on by the runaway success of the hit single &quot;Slam,&quot; which went on to become one of the year's biggest rap hits.

        <p> We were happy to welcome Canadian, Multi-Platinum Award Winning musician, <a href="http://ashleymacisaac.net/">Ashley MacIsaac</a> to the facility to record and produce some new material for an up and coming release. </p>
        <p>One of the most celebrated Canadian roots musicians of all time, having sold in excess of 500,000 albums, Ashley has garnered international acclaim by playing the fiddle in that hard-nosed, traditional Cape-Breton style, while adding his own spin, mixing genres and updating Celtic music to appeal to a broader spectrum of fans. Ashley has toured with the likes of Philip Glass and The Chieftains, and performed on the Conan O'Brian show, The Today Show, at Carnegie Hall and the Acropolis in Greece. </p>

        <p>We were happy to welcome back Toronto rap artist Brendan aka <a href="http://www.myspace.com/519620944">“The BeaMer” </a> to our studio for the production of his new release <em>Just to Let You Know </em>, where he worked together with one of our producers, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tripleabeats">Andrew &quot;Triple A&quot; Andriyashev</a>. “This song is about what I want to do in life based on the obstacles I've had to face in my life,” said Brendan. </p>
        <p> Over the past three years, Brendan developed a passion for writing music. His songs give the listener something to think about. He steers away from the typical rap songs about violence, drugs and money; instead his lyrics speak about life and the struggles that he has experienced and continues to deal with.

        <p>This month-long process involved removing each of the 56 module strips from the SSL console for cleaning and rebuilding. The center monitoring section was also rebuilt. &quot;We always have our studio technicians on call&quot;, commented Carman Guerrieri, President of Cherry Beach Sound. &quot;Proper maintenance doesn't just occur when something goes wrong, we service our gear whenever we have downtime. Technical support is very important to us. It assures our customers that they are receiving the best product, and differentiates us from the rest.&quot;</p>
        <p>Our new ICON is the state-of-the-art digital console that has quickly become the top choice of professional music studios and post-production facilities around the world. It replaces the original Sony MPX analogue console that has serviced our needs for over 25 years. We are excited about the upgrade and are anxious to put it to work!</p>

  </span>We welcomed <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Akriti-Jain/131164436922294">Akriti Jain</a> to facility to mix the audio for her independent short film “Two Months Ago”. </p>
        <p>She shared some information about herself while with us. “This is the first film I've written, directed and produced by myself. I have done other projects in which I have worked in different capacities, such as co-writer/co-director, assistant director, post-production coordinator, etc. I've been working in the film industry for about a year now and am currently writing my next short film. I went to University of Waterloo and graduated with a BA in Political Science. While I did do some film studies and filmmaking courses while I was there, I've learned most of what I know about filmmaking on my own.” </p>
        <p>The film can be viewed on The University of Waterloo, <a href="http://www.uwfcc.uwaterloo.ca/2009/11/two-months-ago-by-akriti-jain/">Film Creator's Club Website</a>. Be warned that the subject of the film is not for the faint of heart. There is uncomfortable subject matter and strong language. </p>

Their parents-next-door neighbors and polar opposites-are less than thrilled, and even their peers disapprove. What gives the series its heart is that young Tom and Jessie truly love each other. They're the right couple…at the wrong time. <br />
