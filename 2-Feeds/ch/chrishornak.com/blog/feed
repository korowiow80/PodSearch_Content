<p>&#8220;SEO and Social Media are about investing in the lifetime of your business. Paid advertising is like a Chia Pet, whereas SEO and Social Media is more like farming, if you put in the work you’ll be able to live off it.&#8221; </p>
<h3><a href="http://www.eyeflow.com/do-you-have-keyword-fever/" target="_blank">Do You Have Keyword Fever?</a></h3>
<p>&#8220;Do you find yourself Googling the same keywords over and over again to see where your website ranks? Are you basing the success of your online marketing campaign by these few keywords? If so, then you have keyword fever!&#8221;</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.eyeflow.com/international-seo-and-multi-language-websites/" target="_blank">International SEO and Multi Language Websites</a></h3>
<p>&#8220;Many clients wonder if they should buy country-specific domains (.au), create sub-domains (au.example.com) or use sub-folders (example.com/au). We’ve found in most cases you’re best off using a sub-folder. This will allow you to keep your existing domain authority and keep your online efforts consolidated.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I have an computer programming degree and was always tinkering with computers in high school I am forever known as the computer guy to most of my family and friends. Whenever one of them gets some new computer for Christmas I&#8217;m the one they call when Norton Anti-Virus, HP pre-installed software and Windows are all crying for attention. After a while I started keeping a list of freeware programs I could quickly install on any Windows PC and call it a day. Here&#8217;s my list&#8230;<span id="more-320"></span></p>
<h2>Anti-Virus</h2>
<p>When choosing the best Free Anti-Virus program it can be tough. There&#8217;s some pretty good solutions from AVG, Avast and Avira but for this list I can only choose one. I based it on these three things; low system impact, as few pop-ups as possible and level of protection. Avast was my winner because it has great protection and with the right settings you can really limit how often it alerts you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Avast Free Anti-Virus</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://chrishornak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/avast.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-321" title="avast" src="http://chrishornak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/avast-300x227.jpg" alt="Avast Free Anti Virus Software" width="300" height="227" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank">Download Avast</a></strong></p>
<h2>System Cleaner</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems I run into is that their system is just bloated with junkware and other files and programs they don&#8217;t need. You could spend hours digging through the programs files removing stuff, because I have, so when choosing a system cleaning program I wanted to pick something that was simple. There are a few programs that do this really well but when choosing a winner it really came down to using a program that didn&#8217;t constantly bother the user to upgrade. So our winner is&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">SlimCleaner</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://chrishornak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/slimcleaner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-323" title="slimcleaner" src="http://chrishornak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/slimcleaner-300x226.png" alt="Slim Cleaner PC Maintenance Software" width="300" height="226" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://slimcleaner.com/" target="_blank">Download SlimCleaner</a></strong></p>
<h2>GOM Media Player</h2>
<p>There are so many different video formats out there and thankfully services like Youtube came along and made finding and watching videos much easier than it was in the earlier days of the internet. Once and a while you still end up downloading a video file and sometimes you&#8217;re default media player has trouble playing it. I typically recommend using GOM Player as it plays almost any format and is an extremely light program, so it doesn&#8217;t slow down your system as much as other players.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">SlimCleaner<a href="http://www.gomlab.com/eng/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-338" title="gom-media-player" src="http://chrishornak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/gom-media-player-300x259.png" alt="" width="300" height="259" /></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a title="Download GOM Player" href="http://www.gomlab.com/eng/" target="_blank">Download GOM Media Player</a></strong></p>
<h2>Google Chrome Browser</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to have an up-to-date and secure browser. Many of the issues I run into is when people haven&#8217;t updated their browser in months even years. I stopped using Internet Explorer a long time ago. I initially Used Firefox and I still think that FireFox is great and all their exertions really make it an amazing browser, but iff I was going to recommend a browser it would be Google Chrome. The reason is purely based on it&#8217;s speed. When opened it launches very fast and it seems to render webpages faster than it&#8217;s competitors.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Google Chrome<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-339" title="google chrome" src="http://chrishornak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/google-chrome-300x220.png" alt="Google Chrome" width="300" height="220" /></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong style="font-size: 13px;"><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Download Google Chrome</a></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy my list of free software. I hope to have some good SEO topics soon!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 11th Google announced that they have began <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/04/high-quality-sites-algorithm-goes.html" target="_blank">incorporating data about the sites that users block</a> into their algorithm.  This change seemed to be their answer to improving their Panda Update. After many experts analyzed the effects of the panda update and noticed that some sites with poor quality content where still doing well for long tail terms. In this study Search Engien Land goes into detail about how<a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-lowers-boom-on-ehow-com-73327" target="_blank"> ehow survived the first update</a> but after this last tweak has seen a major drop in their visibility.<span id="more-284"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_285" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/hide-sites-to-find-more-of-what-you.html" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-285" title="block_matt_option-500x154 (1)" src="http://chrishornak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/block_matt_option-500x154-1.png" alt="Block Sites from Google SERPs" width="500" height="154" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">As always, Matt’s been gracious enough to let us use him as an example. His site is awesome, though, and we doubt many people will want to block it! - SearchEngineLand.com</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>What concerns me the most about this update is that Google just added the feature to block sites from the search results in March. It&#8217;s not normal for Google to use a new signal so quickly(considering it took them months to even consider using social media signals), especially one that probably has such low usage and can be manipulated. How long until companies start using it to to knock their competitors out of the SERPs.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m excited to see that MajesticSEO just introduce a beta version of their new site explorer (not the most original name. See: opensiteexplorer.org &amp; siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com).  I’ve been a big fan of majesticseo.com’s tools for years now. I don’t think anyone would argue that they have the largest database of backlink data available. This makes it a great tool for nearly anyone in the SEO industry. If you’re not using it now, you should be. I want to review the new layout and features available on the Majestic SEO Site Explorer.<span id="more-226"></span></p>
<p><em>In the following screenshots I used example.com: <a href="https://www.majesticseo.com/reports/site-explorer/summary/example.com">https://www.majesticseo.com/reports/site-explorer/summary/example.com</a></em></p>
<h3>Improved Backlink Data Layout</h3>
<p>MajesticSEO now presents the backlink data in a much simpler and easy to read interface, giving you a quick snapshot of any sites backlink profile.  This is great information for an SEO professional but would be information overload for most SEO clients. I would be careful on how you may present this data to a client.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-227" title="backlink data" src="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/backlink-data.jpg" alt="MajesticSEO Backlink Data" width="522" height="300" /></p>
<h3>Same Great Backlink History Graphs</h3>
<p>For those of you familure with the backlink history graphs this isn’t anything new. For those of you who are not these graphs represent the number of discovered links per month. If you click on these graphs you’ll get additional features like the ability to compare the backlink discovery of multiple domains as well as view it comulatively(my favorite view).  It would be nice if they’d allow you to change the defult view on the site explorer page.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-228" title="backlink history" src="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/backlink-history.jpg" alt="MajesticSEO Backlink history Graph" width="462" height="353" /></p>
<h3>Quickly See the 5 Top Backlinks</h3>
<p>Again this isn’t a new feature just an improved layout, which the site explorer page does well, giving you a summary of all the data available. In this section you are presented with the top 5 backlinks(Based on MajestiSEOs AC Rank) for the entered domain.  This can allow you to also check out some of your(or a client’s) backlinks as well as spy on a competitors top backlinks. This feature can be extremely useful for a link builder.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-229" title="Top Backlinks" src="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Top-Backlinks.jpg" alt="MajestiSEO Top Backlinks" width="514" height="354" /></p>
<h3>Referring Domains Visual</h3>
<p>This little diagram shows some of the reffering domains that link to the entered site the most. For one reason or another these domains link to the entered site many times. Not the prettiest looking diagram but it does the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230" title="reffering domains" src="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/reffering-domains.jpg" alt="MajestiSEO Referring Domains Diagram" width="375" height="303" /></p>
<h3>Most Popular Pages</h3>
<p>The final feature you’ll find on MajesticSEO’s site explorer page are the top pages(Based on MajesticSEO’s ACRank). Now you’ll be able to see what your most popular pages are based on their backlinkd ata.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/top-pages.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-231 aligncenter" title="top pages" src="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/top-pages.jpg" alt="MajesticSEO Top Pages" width="515" height="153" /></a></p>
<p>Overall the tool is great! Can&#8217;t really complain too much considering all the data that they provide for FREE! If I had any criticisms, is some of the data could be a little nicer looking and a PDF version of this report would be great. Keep up the good work <a href="http://majesticseo.com">MajesticSEO</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK you finally got your domain name and new website design launched, now what? How do you start getting people to your website? Honestly, developing a successful website, like any business project, takes a lot of hard work. This list will get you started down that path and on your way to building an online presence by instantly getting new links to your website.<span id="more-202"></span><br />
<a href="http://guides.seomoz.org/chapter-7-growing-popularity-and-links">Learn more about link building</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Diagnose and Monitor Your Website</h3>
<p>In order to measure the success of your website you need tools to monitor traffic and search engine indexing errors. Google not only has some of the most well respected monitoring tools but they’re also FREE! Installing <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> will allow you to monitor visitors to your website and measure its success, while <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Webmaster Tools</a> shows you how Google views your site and helps diagnose problems.</p>
<h3>2. Start with Your Friends and Business Connections.</h3>
<p>Who better to give you honest feedback and share your new website than your friends and business connections? Post a link to your new website on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIN and any other social network, message board or blog you are already involved in; then ask those connections to share it with their connections.</p>
<h3>3. Now Share Your New Website Design With Strangers!</h3>
<p>You’ve shared your new website with people you know&#8230; now share it with people you don’t. There are dozens of websites who want to share your new website design. These sites are primarily made up of web designers and developers who are looking for inspiration and something new  to share with their connections. If you feel your design is the kind to show off, then consider submitting it to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://thecssgallerylist.com/" target="_blank">these design galleries</a>.</p>
<h3>4. Bookmark It!</h3>
<p>I’m sure you have some of your favorite websites bookmarked on your browser, but that only helps you know your favorite websites. There are many websites that allow you to save your bookmarks online and share them with others who <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com" target="_blank">share the same interests</a>. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://social-bookmarking-sites-list.com/" target="_blank">a list of these sites</a> and bookmark your site today!</p>
<h3>5. Make a News Annoucement.</h3>
<p>You’ve launched a new website&#8230; isn’t that worth talking about? Make an announcement using <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/10/20/press-releases/" target="_blank">free online press release websites</a>. Not only will these give your website quality links but also get your news on popular platforms like Google News.</p>
<p>Now don’t stop here! Keep creating online content worth sharing and don’t forget to monitor visitors from these sites with Google Analytics.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I use SEOzio nearly everyday and I&#8217;m extremely proud of it&#8217;s performance. I can put in a domain and get an idea of how well it&#8217;s optimized within 5 seconds. I know it&#8217;s not the first tool of it&#8217;s kind but I truly believe it&#8217;s one of the most accurate and trustworthy. I wanted to take a moment to recognized the other SEO tools that inspired us during the development of SEOzio.<span id="more-176"></span></p>
<ol> <strong> </strong></p>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/trifecta/" target="_blank">Trifecta by SEOmoz</a></strong></li>
<p>SEOmoz&#8217;s reputation in the SEO industry is impressive and their tools are just as impressive. The inspiration that Trifecta had on SEOzio can be found in it&#8217;s scoring and categories.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.quarkbase.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Quarkbase.com</a></strong></li>
<p>The clean design and simple overview of the quarkbase results inspired us to make a tool just as user friendly. We still have features we&#8217;re working on that where inspired by this tool, but those are top secret at the moment.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<li><strong><a href="http://websitegrader.com" target="_blank">websitegrader.com</a></strong></li>
<p>Website grader is usually one of the first tools any aspiring SEO professional uses. The information is valuable and the presentation is impressive. But it&#8217;s short comings is exactly why we developed SEOzio in the first place. We found that the scores where generally high even for sites that weren&#8217;t very optimized.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.trustrank.org/" target="_blank">TurstRank.org</a></strong></li>
<p>TurstRank.org isn&#8217;t as well known as some of the other tools mentioned but their attempt to understand trustrank and apply it to their tool was a great inspiration to us to try to provide an intelligent way to measure the trust of a site.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<li><strong><a href="http://seo-browser.com/" target="_blank">SEO-Browser.com</a></strong></li>
<p>SEO Browser doesn&#8217;t provide you with a grade or a score but the information it does provide you is extremely important. I&#8217;ve been recommending this tool for years and have even done a youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHMTVniJI7A">video on how to use SEO-Browser.com</a>.</ol>
<p>Special thanks to all of the intelligent people behind the tools mentioned aboved. <strong>Check out the <a href="http://eyeflow.com/seozio" target="_blank">SEO Grading Tool</a> that was invented as a result of their inspiration.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a title="Google Instant" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/search-now-faster-than-speed-of-type.html" target="_blank">Google launched Google Instant</a> an update to the interface of Google that shows results as you type. Since that day there has been buzz all around the web about how this change will effect SEO. The most common concern would be a decrease in Long-Tail searches. Long-Tail searches are searches that are very targeted. An example of a short-tail search would be &#8220;shoes&#8221;, where an example of a long-tail search would be &#8220;white nike basketball shoes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Many websites(usually start-ups or small businesses) rely on long-tail searches to bring traffic to their websites. <span id="more-138"></span>This is based upon the difficulty and low conversion rate of short tail phrases. For example lets look at how many results there are for our short-tail and long-tail phrases;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/shoes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-139 aligncenter" title="shoes" src="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/shoes.jpg" alt="shoes" width="441" height="64" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/white-nike-basketball-shoes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-140 aligncenter" title="white nike basketball shoes" src="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/white-nike-basketball-shoes.jpg" alt="white nike basketball shoes" width="432" height="61" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see from our search, our short tail search had 272,000,000 results where our long-tail had 503,000 results. This means there where less pages on the internet competing for that combination of keywords.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With Google Instant many <a href="http://searchengineland.com/will-google-instant-kill-the-long-tail-50110" target="_blank">experts are concerned</a> that it will encourage users to settle for the shorter suggested Google searches, rather than creating a more unique targeted search phrase.  Others on the other hand think that it will encourage users to keep typing until the suggestion is more specific to their need, this would cause long-tail searches to increase.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After reading over many of <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/thoughts-on-google-instant/" target="_blank">these articles</a>, I think bottom line is; time will tell. As SEO professionals we need to keep a close eye on analytics, continue using best practices and analyze user behavior as this update is surely going to effect the way people search.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I loved that Google provided links to answers.com for some search quires they stopped using it in December 2009. They&#8217;ve replaced it with Google Dictionary (<a href="http://www.google.com/dictionary" class="broken_link">http://www.google.com/dictionary)</a> and at first it seemed like a logical step in the right direction. It does make more sense from Google&#8217;s point of view to use their own technology to return results.</p>
<p>The problem I&#8217;m having with it, is when I did a search today for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=all#hl=en&amp;q=SEO+definition&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=l1g1g-c6g-m2&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;fp=36ec6be010d257f">SEO definition</a>&#8221; I had a very strange result.<span id="more-101"></span> The definition Google pulled from it&#8217;s dictionary was about how Seo is a common Korean family name, while all 10 organic results where all related to Search Engine Optimization. This seemed unlike Google to give such a answer considering that I&#8217;m searching with in the US (so Korean family names might now be the best result for me) and that the remainder of the search results where all about Search Engine Optimization. Keep in mind I also capitalized SEO in my search and performed this search unpersonalized.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what my results looked like;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/seo-definition.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102" title="seo definition" src="http://chrishornak.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/seo-definition.jpg" alt="seo definition Google search results" width="570" height="508" /></a></p>
<p>It looks like Google may still be working the kinks out of this new feature. But it says something about a search engine when you expect more from them.</p>
<p>Post a comment and let me know your thoughts.</p>
