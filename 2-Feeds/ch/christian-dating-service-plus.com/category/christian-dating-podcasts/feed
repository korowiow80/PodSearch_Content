		<itunes:summary>Are ready to take a leap of faith? In our LEAP series at Oasis, we are teaching how God wants us to take a leap of faith, trusting Him for amazing things in 2012. Now I realize many of the Christian singles and married folks reading this are already soured on 2012, and we&#8217;ve reverted into safe mode to ride the year out. Bit without taking a leap of faith, single Christians will never become all the God has created them to be, let alone be successful in finding that special dating relationship and soulmate. Look, God want you and me to live life to the full, go for the gusto, take risks.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Single Career Women Trap</h2>
<p>Many successful single career women have succumbed to this trap: You go to college, and after graduation your main goal was to work up the proverbial ladder of success. Maybe you became a successful businesswoman, doctor or lawyer. But now as you enter <a href="http://christian-dating-service-plus.com/thirty-something-singles-online-dating.htm" target="_blank">30-somethings</a> or <a href="http://christian-dating-service-plus.com/40-somethings-and-50-somethings-dating.htm" target="_blank">40-somethings</a> status, your heart turns toward that special dating relationship you put on hold all these years, and all of a sudden this becomes your priority. Here&#8217;s the kicker, what you thought would be an easy  proposition (Ie: finding that <a href="http://christian-dating-service-plus.com/visit/eharmony">Christian soulmate</a> when the time was right) now looks to you as an improbability. in fact many single Christian career women I know lament that their time for romance and marriage may have passed them by as they were working on their careers. Some of the reasons single career women give for this are as follows:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Top Reasons Single Career Women Reasons Find  Romance Difficult</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Dating Prospects Lessen as You Age<br />
Not Knowing Where to Go to Meet a Date<br />
Inability to Balance Work and Romance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Are you a single Christian career woman who can identify with the above? In today&#8217;s Christian podcast, Lead Pastor Dave Butler of Oasis Church shares a relevant talk on how our jobs can destroy our  <a href="http://christian-dating-service-plus.com/visit/eharmony">dating relationships</a>. Oasis is meets Sundays 11am at 1180 Spruce Dr in Mountainside, NJ.</p>

After all, as we learn in today&#8217;s Christian podcast, a vision without a plan is like a ship without a rudder. For example, Nehemiah not only had a vision from God to rebuild Jerusalem&#8217;s city walls, he also had a plan ready to execute that vision.
