      <title>Episode Three - A Sequel is Born</title>
      <description>Episode Three

The third episode of Glitch Radio is here! 

This is actually part two to the show I posted last week, but for lack of a better title, I'm going to go ahead and call it episode three. Anyways, this week we round out the story of the Green Monster, and DJ Q. Do they make it home alive? Will WMTU as we know it suffer? Is Glitch Radio Doomed to vanish from the airwaves?!

Well, you'll just have to tune in to find out. Additionally, for those of you out there who actually read these long winded descriptions, and visit the webpage, you will notice that the Archival System has been put into place. You can find all the Archived episodes of Glitch now available through filedropper, as well as various other websites. To access the archives, click on the &quot;Archives&quot; link that is available on the bottom of the calendar. From there you will be able to see all the archived episodes of Glitch, Complete with their download link.

Additionally, I will be on air TWICE this week, so if you want to tune in live, feel free. The first time will be from 10PM to 1AM Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, April 29th. Additionally, I will be on air from 12:00PM to 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time on Thursday, May 2nd. These final live broadcasts of Glitch will be turned into an additional 3 episodes, the final two of which will be Glitch Radio's first special broadcast: &lt;b&gt;The Spectrum of Electronic&lt;/b&gt; all of which will be available for download from this site.

So, once again, and so this section stands out:
&lt;b&gt;Listen to Glitch Radio LIVE for it's FINAL two shows!

10PM-1AM EST Tuesday April 29th
12PM-5PM EST Thursday May 2nd

Only on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmtu.mtu.edu&quot;&gt;WMTU Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

To listen in, click on the 128kbps Stream. Dialup users will be sad to know that the 32kbps stream is broken. Sorry guys, I'm not on the computer crew...(yet)

To request music for either of these shows, you can send me an email at glitchradio@comcast.net, OR you can call in, instant message, or send us an e-mail while we are LIVE on air. If you want to choose the latter, simply tune in and wait for a vocal break, we will be giving instructions then.

One final thing. I would like to sincerly apologize for the delay with which last week's podcast was posted. Many of you will be suffering this week from the fact that you will be downloading two podcasts instead of one, because you only checked on Monday instead of Tuesday. Once again, I'm quite sorry, and I'll try to get these up on time in the future.

Now that we're done with all this administrative stuff, here is the playlist for this week's show:

      <title>Episode Two - Will there be... a SEQUEL?!</title>
      <description>The second episode of Glitch Radio is now available! This episode actually took place through another nine hour long block of Glitch Radio. The nine hours is a definate plus, because this is the last week that WMTU will be transmitting, and as such, the last OFFICIAL week for Glitch. However, What I have decided to do is split the nine hour long block into three, three hour shows, which I will post over the next couple weeks. These two additional shows, combined with a separate 3 hour long sub slot I did, and the special Final Exam edition of Glitch Radio, should keep the podcasts rolling in for the next four weeks.

I would also like to apologize for my delay in getting this posted. It is the final week before exams, so I've been a little bit bogged down. However, We tried to do something new during this episode, the results of which you will soon hear. At the end of it you may be wondering &quot;Christ! What the hell just happened?!&quot; and to that, I simply reply that you will have to wait until next week's post to find out. Furthermore, no members of WMTU were harmed in the making of this broadcast.

Enjoy the show! Here's this weeks playlist.

Eiffel 65 - Europop
Caramell - Caramelldancen
Crazy Loop - Crazy Loop (Mm-ma-ma)
DJ Icey - Castles in the Sky
Punkrockerz - Punkrocker
Oomph! - Traumst Du
Digital Droo - Monkey Developers
Bond - Explosive
Andrew W.K. - Party Hard
Haddaway - What is Love
DJ Anonymous - So I Herd You Liek Musics
Rammstein Feat Alec Empire - Amerika [Digital Hardcore Mix]
Manish - Series of Tubes
Bond - Samba
2PM - Tetris Trance Remix
REDAliCE - Motteke! Sailor Fuku
Portal - Still Alive
Aphex Twin - Come to Daddy [Pappy Mix]
HouseMasta - Tetris [Dirty Remix]
RageVI - Tailspin Tetris
Stage 3-1 - The Legend of Zelda
K.M.F.D.M. - These Boots are Made for Walkin
DJ Sharpnel - Pretty Green Onions
RaverRose - Star (Long Edit)
Celldweller - Switchback
DarkMateria - The Picard Song
Lazy Town - You are a Pirate
Aqua - Candyman
m477zorz - Break the Targets 2

Also, just so you guys are aware, this episode of Glitch has destroyed what little remaining storage space that I have left on Podomatic, and because of this, each subsequent post will require me to archive one previous podcast, starting, of course, with the earliest. However, never fear, they will be archived and available for download through a file hosting site such as mediafire or rapidshare. Just wanted to give you guys a heads up.</description>

      <title>Episode One</title>
      <description>&lt;B&gt;The first &lt;i&gt;OFFICIAL&lt;/i&gt; episode of &lt;u&gt;Glitch Radio&lt;/u&gt; has arrived!&lt;/b&gt;

It's not another sub show, no this one is a full three hour helping of &lt;U&gt;Glitch Radio&lt;/u&gt; brought to you by &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmtu.mtu.edu&quot;&gt;WMTU 91.9FM Houghton.&lt;/a&gt; While we regret to inform you that we are without wacky interviews this week, I am happy to say that we had an additionaly radio personality in the studio with us. Lucas stayed the entire show, which was nice because DJ PolarBear has fallen ill this week.

As for the music, I attempted to put together a playlist that could best be described as ordered chaos. Unfortunately, Winamp promptly ate this playlist, and the end result is this week's show, which turned out very well. As usual, you can find the playlist at the bottom of this post.

There have been some slight alterations to the way the show is handled, especially in the podcast processing section. If you couldn't tell, the last post was a bit rough around the edges, and I am working on cleaning it up. Additionally, the podcast page itself will be changing in the upcoming future. However, These edits will be made slowly depending on when I have the time to enact them.

As always, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:glitchradio@comcast.net&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; with any comments, suggestions, hate mail, or requests for next weeks show. You know how much I love hearing from you. If you are more interested in finding out about the contest, feel free to contact me. Also, expect further changes in the way &lt;u&gt;Glitch Radio&lt;/u&gt; is handled, as I continue to get better at this. I'm currently looking at reducing podcast length, or creating two different podcast streams. If you have any ideas, feel free to contact me at the address above.
