      <title>Brazilian Wonders - Come to Brasilia</title>

Brasilia is a unique place in Brazil. Here you can find a little bit of each part of the country with different kinds of people. Brasilia looks like a big city, but it has the caracteristics of small ones. The capital of Brazil is a planned city where you can find outstanding touristic places. At the end of the day people can watch one of the most beautiful sunsets in the world and enjoy it in awe. 

&lt;img src=&quot;http://image4.bubbleshare.com/media/00/24/61/53/a03ffa873add357a0f32f49eff6961cbbbca9ccc/162x162_c/Brasilia--3-_162x162_c.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot; vspace=&quot;10&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Touristic places&lt;/b&gt;: There are many supercool touristic places in Brasilia. Starting with the &quot;traditional'' places, people usually visit the Congress, the Palacio do Planalto where the president works, Palacio da Alvorada where he lives, the Cathedral, Ermida Dom Bosco where you can have an undiscribable view of the city. The JK bridge, which was recently built, is considered one of the most well-designed bridges in the world. Brasilia is in its essence a place for tourism.

&lt;b&gt;Culture&lt;/b&gt;: There's Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil, Memorial JK and Casa Thomas Jefferson where there are always art exibitions. 

&lt;b&gt;Nightlife&lt;/b&gt;: Young people in Brasilia usually go out at night to parties, shopping malls or bars. There are a lot of shoppings in the city, like Park Shopping, Patio Brasil and Pier 21 where young people go to meet their friends when there's nothing else to do. Pier has MusicStation which has lots of concerts on the weekends. It's easy to find concerts to go in Brasilia.

&lt;b&gt;Food&lt;/b&gt;: There are countless places in Brasilia where people go to eat. Sky's, Giraffas, McDonald's, TGI Fridays are the hot spots for young people. There are a lot of restaurants like Carpe Diem and Porc&#227;o. The new Mercado Municipal is a friendly place where you&#180;ll find all kinds of food.

      <title>Brazilian Wonders - Come to Fortaleza!</title>

In Fortaleza you will have outstanding moments: enjoying the breathtaking beaches, eating mouth-watering food, as well as going sightseeing. Near Fortaleza, you can find secluded beaches, wich are all extraordinary, for example, Morro Branco, Canoa Quebrada, Praia das Fontes and Jericoacoara.

	
&lt;b&gt;Fast Facts&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://image7.bubbleshare.com/media/00/24/c8/de/4c087251fd55471791119da6b214180c60555408/162x162_c/IMG-0208_162x162_c.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot; vspace=&quot;10&quot;&gt; In the past Fortaleza used to be a place in Brazil that exported sugar cane,which helped  develop the city. Many important people were born there, like one of the former presidents, Jos&#233; de Alencar, a famous writer, and Brazilian comedians Chico Anisio and Renato Arag&#227;o.

&lt;b&gt;Don't miss&lt;/b&gt;
Take a tour to the Central Market, where you can find a lot of manufactured stuff like clothes, ornaments and gifts. For sure you will have your best time at the spectacular beaches. The best one is Praia do Futuro. Don't forget to go to Beach Park, a water park that has the biggest water slide in South America.

&lt;b&gt;Where the locals eat&lt;/b&gt;
You will find the most tasteful food at the beach, seated in the barracks. Also, you can visit some  restaurants with local food called &quot;L&#225; na Ro&#231;a&quot;,&quot;Reduto das Tapioqueiras&quot; and &quot;Coco Bambu&quot;. The main food is fish and shrimps.

&lt;b&gt;Shopping&lt;/b&gt;
&quot;Feirinha&quot; is authentic. It has local furniture and every kind of art you can imagine. Don't miss the opportunity to make your portrait.  You can find all over the sidewalks some colourful gifts made by sand.

&lt;b&gt;Nightlife&lt;/b&gt;
'Pirata' makes the Mondays in Fortaleza very exciting. It's a night club with great people and all kinds of music. But Fortaleza's specialty is Forr&#243;, a  kind of music. You can go to the beaches even at night, because you will always find small-but-bustling parties.

&lt;b&gt;Lodgings of Note&lt;/b&gt;
The best hotels in Fortaleza are in 'Beira-Mar', at the Iracema Beach. There you&#180;ll find simple-but-comfortable, as well as fancy hotels. You will have the chance to choose the one that fits your own way of traveling.

Enjoy Fortaleza!

There are many exciting amusement parks where you go in the begining of the day and just come back home in the evening! If you don&#180;t want to stay just in the capital, you can visit the big Sao Paulo, Serra do Mar and the cities near the beach.

Entertainment during the day are: Hopi Hari, Playcenter, Ibirapuera park and Wet&#180;n Wild. Hopi Hari and Playcenter are amusement parks while Ibirapuera is a natural park, with well-known attractions, where you can be closer to the natural world. Wet&#180;n Wild is a delicious water theme park where you can go in a hot tropical summer day to refresh and have lots of fun!!

There you can enjoy bustling beaches and taste the natural thirst-quencing coconut water. Between Santos and Sao Paulo we have an amazing road in the middle of the mountains called 'Serra do Mar'. It&#180;s a beautiful road, surrounded by big trees, and it is really worth traveling there by car. You&#180;ll have an unforgettable view. In the big Sao Paulo there are some other blooming small cities, where you can have a relaxing good time, getting away from the stressful life of the capital. One of them is Barueri, a trendy-but-friendly city. 

Sao Paulo kicks at night!! Not only can the restaurants, theaters and shopping malls offer you a pleasant evening, but also the night clubs are an exciting option where you can dance a lot and meet lots of well-known actors and top models from the country. You can go to the Museo, a soulful nightclub where you have techno and black music. And if you prefer the typical Brazilian songs, like samba and pagode, you just have to visit Armaz&#233;m, another brilliant choice.

      <title>Brazilian Wonders - Come to Florian&#243;polis</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/13547/600x600_911307.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bubbleshare.com/album/72271.8b2cdd6a4b3/mini?mute=true&amp;amp;autoplay=true&amp;amp;interval=3&amp;amp;size=360x270&amp;amp;style=rounded&quot; style=&quot;width: 375px; height: 304px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Floripa&#180;s Photo Album&lt;/a&gt;

If you are looking for fascinating beaches and green areas to relax after a hard year, Floripa is the place. Even if you want a city to have fun with your friends, Floripa is also the place. 

Florian&#243;polis is an old city in the south of Brazil, in which the nature is its best attraction. The city is divided in two geographical landscapes, one in the Island and the other in the continent linked by three bridges. The Island has 42 beaches for all kind of tastes: from children to professionals surfers. 

&lt;img src=&quot;http://image7.bubbleshare.com/media/00/24/c9/1e/465fb5b3f960569b53ade8ad4147f58d3ebc7f20/162x162_c/DSC04714_162x162_c.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot; vspace=&quot;10&quot;&gt; If you prefer bustling beaches you can visit Praia Mole, Ingleses, Cansvieiras, Jurer&#234;, Praia Brava, among others, the so-called north beaches because of their location. In the summer these beaches are always crowded with beautiful people enjoying their vacations.

The locals go to the south beaches like P&#226;ntano do Sul, Arma&#231;&#227;o, Matadeiro, among others. These are peaceful places in which we can enjoy nature and the historical villages.

However, the city provides other activities, like tracking. You can discover desert beaches like Galheta or Naufragados just walking through preserved Mata Atl&#226;ntica rainforest. 

&lt;img src=&quot;http://image5.bubbleshare.com/media/00/24/c9/1c/63c220c3d87f5cc3dfcd8bcdcf315a562bc69309/162x162_c/DSC04696_162x162_c.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot; vspace=&quot;10&quot;&gt; You can not miss Lagoa da Concei&#231;&#227;o. It is a big gorgeous lagoon in the middle of the Island where young people like to practice adventure sports during the day. At night, it becomes the place to meet friends and party because of its restaurants and bars.

The locals eat big shrimp plates in small fisher restaurants. For just twenty reais (about US 10.00), one can eat three kilos of fried shrimps. Another good option is the gratinated oysters. The fishers cultivate the oysters and take them off the sea to cook when it is still fresh.

Typical gifts can be found in the Mercado P&#250;blico, an ancient and cozy building. There, you can also shop fresh fish.

It is worth staying in bed and breakfast hotels. It is easy to find them in almost every beach. There are some downtown, but we advise you to search for something near the beach, once downtown is too far from Floripa&#180;s excitement and transportation is not that good.
