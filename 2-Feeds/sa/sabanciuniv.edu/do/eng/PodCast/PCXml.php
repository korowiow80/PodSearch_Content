	<itunes:summary>The School of Languages of Sabanci University, located in Istanbul, Turkey, began creating podcasts in March 2006 with the dual aim of both offering instructors and faculty a forum to share their expertise, and providing a place where students can listen to academic discourse in English. Since then, the podcast project has expanded to include students, and distinguished members of the community as guest speakers. Podcast topics range from the natural sciences to the arts, business, popular culture and everything in between.</itunes:summary>

Aydilge Sarp is a young Turkish singer, poet, writer, and songwriter, born in 1979 in Kutahya, Turkey. Having successfully passed the entrance exam to the TRT Radio Children's Choir when she was eight years old, at 14 she obtained her first electric guitar and started composing her own songs. Later she performed in bars. At the same time she attended secondary school at TED Ankara Koleji. Studying American Literature at Baskent University, Ankara, she passed with flying colors. Although she received a scholarship to an American university, she preferred to stay in Turkey. Moving to Istanbul, she received an MA in Radio, Television and Cinema Studies from Istanbul University.

Aydilge published Thoughts From My Pen, a collection of short stories in 1998. Her first novel, Bulimia Street, was published in 2002 and was followed by a second novel The Thrust of Golden Love in 2004.
Aydilge's first album Küçük Þarký Evreni (Small Song Universe) in which she wrote all the lyrics and composed music was released by EMI in 2006. Aydilge is interviewed by Ali Nihat Eken from the School of Languages. slpodcast@sabanciuniv.edu</description>

			<description>Farewell to a filmmaker: Atif Yilmaz (1925-2006) Atif Yilmaz, who virtually forged the memory of an entire people in his films of every conceivable genre, put his stamp on Turkish cinema through hard work and constant innovation.

A film sometimes has a significance that is different, very different indeed, from what it sets out to depict. There are few people perhaps whose lives are changed by watching a film &amp;#8211;and they usually turn out to be directors or actors- but certain films become lodged in either the most vulnerable, or the most exuberant, times of a person&amp;#8217;s life. He is gone now, but some of Atif Yilmaz&amp;#8217;s films are not mere personal remembrances but a virtual repository of the memory of an entire society. Script by Berat Guncikan. Published  in Skylife Magazine 2006. Copyright permission granted by Skylife. Presenter: Mary Wynn Karatal. slpodcast@sabanciuniv.edu</description>

			<description>Let&amp;#8217;sTalk About Teaching Seminar and Discussion Series 1: Achievement as Metaphor by Dr. Tony Humphreys. Organized by The Center for Individual and Academic Development (CIAD), Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey. 
There is a strong association between achievement and belonging.  Everyone wants to belong, to a family, a partner, a classroom, a workplace.  The quality of the belonging has a direct bearing on a person&amp;#8217;s educational progress.  Indeed, educational under-achievement may often be a metaphor for emotional under-belonging!  Furthermore, many other educational difficulties may be symbolic of emotional ones.  It is a case of the heart ruling the head and not the head ruling the heart!  In any case, effective teaching and effective learning are both a heart and a head phenomenon.
About the Let&amp;#8217;s talk about teaching
Seminar and Discussion Series: 

The essential aim of teaching is to enable learning and this aim is unlikely to be realized in its full sense by settling down to particular strategies that are supposed to be &amp;#8220;working well&amp;#8221;.  While there are numerous ways in which teaching can be successfully carried out, there is a constant need for change and perhaps improvement in response to the changing needs and demands of learners and to the challenges presented by the new global and local contexts of knowledge production and dissemination.

By getting together to talk freely about some topical issues in teaching, we expect to increase our awareness of the social and psychological dimensions of teaching and learning, and perhaps to inspire one another to envision new ways of fulfilling our vocations. </description>

			<description>Hate it or love it: How can instructors lead a learner to success or failure? by Sevgi Ozpehlivan, a Junior student at Sabanci University. The relationship between instructor and learner is the ultimate determinant in successful language learning as it is the instructor who can lead a learner to success or failure. Thus there are actually no difficult languages but difficult processes of learning. One of the key aspects in this process is for the instructor to help the learner build up confidence. As languages are unique just like the cultures they represent, so should the bilateral relations between learner and instructor be. Not only the language   but also the culture itself should be introduced by the instructor using methods that consider both the capability and character of the learner.

Having gone through the process of learning English, Italian and Spanish as a foreign language, I will try to find answers to the following questions: Is learner awareness raised on why to learn a foreign language? Do students know the aims of all classroom games? Are they aware of their learning strategies? In this session we will discuss several techniques that are employed by students and teachers.

			<description>From identity of language to language of identity by Aycan Adrian Corum, a Sophomore student at Sabanci University. How much one masters a language is related to the ability to think intensively in that language. After mastering a second language, it becomes clear that each language contains its own way of thinking, identity. Each language can function in expressing different aspects of character and emotions, thus forming our identity. This awareness can help us to use learned languages as connective tools for the learning of further languages. Powerpoint presentation:http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/do/eng/pdfs/Aycan.pdf</description>

			<description>Learners' preferences for and opinions about integrated and isolated form-focussed instruction by Nina Spada, University of Toronto, Canada. Dr. Nina Spada is Professor and Graduate Program Head in the Second Language Education Program at OISE/University of Toronto where she teaches graduate and pre-service courses in second language learning and teaching. She joined the faculty of the University of Toronto in 2000 after 15 years at McGill University in Montreal.

Dr. Spada&amp;#8217;s research examines relationships between instructional practices and learning outcomes. She is particularly interested in the effects of form-focussed instruction on second language learning. Her research investigates such questions as whether there are better times to draw learners&amp;#8217; attention to language form in communicative classrooms, whether different types of form-focussed instruction are more effective than others and whether certain language features are more amenable to instruction.

			<description>Friday Colloquium by Andrew Berry. In this podcast Andrew Berry talks about what makes us different from chimpanzees
The PP slides for this podcast are available at <a href="http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/do/eng/PodCast/slides/humanchimpandrewberry.pdf" target="_blank">humanchimpandrewberry</a> .... Friday Colloquium by Andrew Berry. Comparisons between the human and chimpanzee genomes are sobering: we are, by any measure, astonishingly similar in genetic terms to our closest relatives.  What, then, are the genetic changes that have accumulated on the two lineages over the 5 million years since the most common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees?  Through outgroup comparison, we can determine which substitutions occurred on the human line.  Among these, necessarily, must lie the key to our humanity.  Because genetic drift will result in the fixation of mutations of no significant effect (ie neutral mutations), however, a large proportion of all differences between the two genomes are of no consequence.  Using the statistical tools of population genetics, it is possible to screen for mutations occurring on the human line that have been subject to positive natural selection (ie natural selection that drives a mutation to fixation in a population).  It is in this subset of mutations that the evolutionary action surely lies.  From whole genome scans using these methods, we have been able to identify candidate genes, some of whose functions we at least partially understand.  From these studies along with our reconstruction of the key events in that 5 million year evolutionary process down the human line, we are gradually piecing together a picture of what, genetically, makes us who we are. slpodcast@sabanciuniv.edu</description>

 			<author>School of Languages - Sabanc&#305; University</author>			<title>Yasar Kemal: A Question of Culture</title>
			<itunes:author>School of Languages - Sabanc&#305; University</itunes:author>			<itunes:image href="http://sl.sabanciuniv.edu/eng/PodCast/slpodcastlogo.jpg"/>			<pubDate>2006-08-02 08:17:28</pubDate>
			<description>(In Turkish). Yasar Kemal gave the Closing Lecture of the 2005-2006 Academic Year: This era is not an era of divisions but an era of living together . 

Yasar Kemal, who made a speech entitled A Question of Culture in the Closing Lecture held in Sabancý University Performing Arts Center, said Against all odds, we&amp;#8217;ll join the European Union. The speaker of  the Academic Year Closing Lecture held every year since 2003, the year of first graduation of students at Sabancý University, was one of the greatest living writers of our time, Yasar Kemal. Apart from the graduating class, families, representatives of foreign missions, rectors and academicians of various universities, journalists, Sabancý University students and faculty members and employees participated in the Academic Year Closing Lecture which is held every year one day before the diploma ceremony and arranged basically for the graduating class. 

Yasar Kemal was elected among world-famous candidates in their own fields, at the end of a democratic and participatory election carried on with the initiative of the graduating class since the year 2005. 

Yasar Kemal, mentioning that Anatolia has been a resource for world culture thanks to its geography and being multicultural, said Against all odds, we&amp;#8217;ll join the European Union and will make contributions to the world culture again when we get strength from our own cultural heritage. 

Yasar Kemal, saying that the public living in Anatolia will use its own language, will be educated, write books, make films in its own language, went on saying: 

We will be aware of the fact that we live in a multicultural land. We will realize that we have interests in freedom, not in prohibitions. We will have to realize it. If we don&amp;#8217;t hurry, we may even be exposed to the nuisance of being divided. However, Anatolia, rich with its multicultural nature, is not a land suitable for division.    This era is not an era of divisions but an era of living together. We have no way out other than preserving our multicultural structure. Turkey cannot remain like this. Those who say it will, will be disappointed like Ittihat and Terakki ( Union and Progress Party)   
Yasar Kemal, mentioning the multicultural structure in Turkey, ended his remarks saying: If a flower leaves the world, it means a colour, a smell has been lost. The world is a garden of cultures made up of thousands of flowers. This is the richness of humanity. Countries like us are gardens of cultures with hundreds of flowers. slpodcast@sabanciuniv.edu
