			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been near impossible to find the time to try and record a new mix ever since I became a parent. I have neglected updating this blog for almost just as long. I am in the process of phasing out this website and pushing forward www.djcurly.com. One of the clubs I work for named TONIC is releasing a brand new website. They asked for a mix and I finally found the time to record one. Here is my 66 minute mix full of electro, dirty dutch, and progressive!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to some unfortunate events one of the contestants had to pull out of the semifinal, which resulted in 2 wild cards being added to the lineup. I was one of the lucky ones to be chosen. I found out last minute and didn&#8217;t have any time to prepare a set or practice mixing. I brought my laptop to work and during 2 of my breaks I picked out songs and made cue points and loops. That&#8217;s the beauty of spinning with Serato! The set went well, I liked it better than my first one. I managed to squeeze in 28 tracks in the 15 minutes. Out of the 10 contestants that night, only 4 would advance to the final. Even though I didn&#8217;t make the cut, I am still thankful that I even had the opportunity to play in the semifinal as a wild card. Here is the full video recording of my set:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I entered a dj battle here in Santa Barbara a couple of weeks back. We got 15 minutes to show what we can do. I mixed 24 bmore, fidget, and electro tracks in the 15 minutes. There were approximately 15 dj&#8217;s on the lineup that night and 3 prelims all together. The top 3 from each of the 3 prelims were going to advance to the semifinal and the top 4 from that round make it to the finals. A lot was at stake at this competition: 2 headlining gigs at 2 of of Santa Barbara&#8217;s most popular nightclubs, free bottle service at both clubs, free gear from CRSVR, a good chunk of $$$, and more! Sadly my set wasn&#8217;t good enough to make it into the top 3 that night. Here&#8217;s the video:</p>

<p>DJ Curly was born and raised in Goleta, CA. He started DJ’ing in 2003 after getting his first pair of turntables and an extensive record collection from his uncle. The following year Curly started a radio show on KCSB 91.9FM while still a student at UCSB. The show lasted over 2 years and featured several of Santa Barbara&#8217;s best DJ&#8217;s. The exposure from the radio show ultimately landed him his first two gigs at the world famous Spundae in Los Angeles in 2005. Since 2006, he has held several residencies in the 805 and played at nearly every club in Santa Barbara. He has also gone on to play at some of the hottest nightclubs in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas. Curly has played alongside well known DJ’s such as DJ Spider, Steve1der, DJ Gusto, DJ Scotty Boy, Thee-o, Mark Lewis, Gene Farris, Jay-J, Justin Martin, Donald Glaude, Charles Feelgood, Kazell, Colette, Chuck Love, Ferry Corsten, and many more. Curly is known for staying ahead of the curve in music trends and is guaranteed to have the freshest music. He is versatile and can play any style to get the party rocking.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow it has been a very long time since I have posted a mix up on here for the podcast. Being a father is taking up so much of my free time. And I have also been spinning 3-4 nights a week. I have tracks ready to go for a new podcast episode and I promise it will be coming soon! I have been spinning a lot of crap out at the clubs lately to make ends meet, but I will be going back to my roots for Episode 28 of the Savage Methods Podcast. It is going to feel sooooooo good to lay this mix down. Be sure to add me on facebook and twitter! I hardly use myspace anymore due to all the spam. Episode 28 will be some raw tech house, minimal, and techno. You know, the usual savage style that you know me for.</p>

<p>I am back! Its been a couple of months since I have been on here. I have been super busy since the birth of my son and the move to my new apartment. My son is now nearly 3 months old and healthy! His name is Noah Ethan Guillen, pics and more info can be found on my myspace page (www.djcurly.com aka www.myspace.com/curlyguillen).</p>
<p>I finally found some time to record a mix using a ton of tracks I&#8217;ve been wanting to use for a while. This is my first mix using Serato. I originally planned on this mix being 48 tracks but I fucked up mixing out of &#8220;Sweet Lullaby&#8221; and decided to cut it at the end of that track. I haven&#8217;t mixed this style of music in a long time also&#8230;feels good to get these beats bumpin through these ears again. The mix is just a tad under 2 hours long. I may try and record another podcast mix this weekend with the remaining 13 tracks I intended to use but didn&#8217;t get to.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found this sweet interview with DIrtybird&#8217;s Christian Martin on <a href="http://www.musicalmissionary.com/2008/05/new-christian-martin-interview-and-mix.html" target="_blank">www.musicalmissionary.com</a> (interview posted by &#8220;Musical Missionary&#8221;):</p>
<h3 class="post-title entry-title">New Christian Martin Interview</h3>
<p>After chatting with Christian in Miami this past March at the kickass WMC Early Bird Dirtybird party, I learned that Christian has been managing the label since January. I thought this little known fact might be a good nucleus for an interview, so&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Give me a quick rundown of how Dirtybird got started and your involvement?</strong><br />
Dirtybird (the party) began in early 2003, before I ever played a gig. A good friend threw an outdoor party in the Mojave Desert, 6 hours south of San Francisco. Somehow, the only thing they forgot to pack was their mixer. While we waited for a backup mixer to arrive from LA, someone popped in my just-completed first mix CD and let it play as the sun came up. People danced! I felt like I was on the right track. When I returned to San Francisco, I decided to purchase my own sound system so I could throw outdoor parties in Golden Gate Park. Our first party had 20 people at its peak – now we regularly see 600. The original dirtybird lineup is myself, my brother Justin, Worthy, and Claude VonStroke (aka Barclay Crenshaw).</p>
<p>Dirtybird (the record label) released its first record in January 2005, but the idea began in 2002 during Barclay’s production of &#8220;Intellect,&#8221; one of the most intensive studies on DJs and producers of house and techno music ever filmed. The Intellect DVD featured over 40 interviews with legendary producers from Juan Atkins, to Swayzak. Crenshaw created the concept of the label in order to supply tracks for the DVD’s soundtrack. The bird logo was derived from a sketch cartoon character Barclay has drawn since he was 10 years old. In 2005, dirtybird began releasing vinyl. At the same time, Barclay created the DJ alias &#8220;Claude VonStroke&#8221; as a joke but the name stuck forever after his debut record &#8220;Deep Throat&#8221; sold through more than 11,000 vinyl copies worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>How did the original Dirtybird crew meet and who has been adopted into the family since those first days?</strong><br />
I met Barclay while working on a music video back in 2000. He was at a video postproduction studio at the time – we would have been sunk without him! (the video is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-Qf0MOqztQ)<br />
He was working on evil drum &amp; bass in those days. Justin and Worthy have been roommates since their days together at Fordham in Manhattan. It was pure serendipity that our interests collided to create the dirtybird BBQ. Since then, we’ve worked with so many talented people! I have to give shouts out to Tanner Ross &amp; KiloWatts for consistently blowing our minds with their production skills, Jesse Rose &amp; Style of Eye for rocking Golden Gate Park into the dusk, and of course Riva Starr for flipping his style almost every other week. Last but certainly not least is the 5th member of dirtybird since day one – Fernando Rivera!</p>
<p><strong>So how long have you been at the helm of the Dirtybird music machine?</strong><br />
I’ve managed daily operations at the label since January 2008.</p>
<p><strong>What were you doing right before you took over?</strong><br />
I was managing the bar at a sushi restaurant right around the corner from the dirtybird office!</p>
<p><strong>How has it changed your daily routine?</strong><br />
Switching from a service industry sleep schedule to waking up early every day has done wonders for my priorities and work ethic. I am elated that my passion has become my livelihood.</p>
<p><strong>Which of the label duties are democratic between you Barclay and Justin?  And which do you handle by yourself now?</strong><br />
Justin’s feedback on potential signings is crucial, but he isn’t generally involved with the day-to-day proceedings. Barclay and I are always on the lookout for standout unsigned tracks, and we collaborate on strategy and content as each record hits the promotional stage. I handle all production matters and back catalogue management, and I am the go-to for all of our label artists and distribution partners.</p>
<p><strong>How many unsolicited demos do you receive at Dirtybird Headquarters every week/month? Is that still a good way of finding quality unreleased music or do you find yourself working your network harder these days to find hidden gems with the flood of overnight bedroom producers out there?</strong><br />
I probably receive 20-30 unsolicited demos per month via the internet and mail. It’s not exactly the best way to get music, but I have to listen to everything, because I would kick myself if I heard a bomb track out or on the internet somewhere and then discovered it later sitting in my inbox.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the typical release process you go through for a new record as far as hyping it up?</strong><br />
It starts with a onesheet, which contains crucial info like tracklisting, UPC code, release date, and artwork. It also contains a very short (1 – 2 paragraphs) description of the record. I have to strike a balance between descriptive writing (a summary of how the tracks unfold &amp; what they sound like) and business writing (hyping up the artist’s previous accomplishments on other well known labels). A successful one sheet should make you yearn to hear the music immediately. This goes to our distributor, who puts it on their site and packages it inside promo copies of the record when they are ready to be sent out to around 60 tastemaker dj’s and press contacts around the world. We also send digital promos out to more djs/producers in our network – people we’ve met, producers who have worked for dirtybird/mothership, etc. I gather &amp; organize the feedback, as well as trying to track down any videos of tracks wreaking havoc in packed clubs. It’s a lot easier to sell a record if you can show the effect it has on people.</p>
<p><strong>What are your short-term and long-term goals for the label?</strong><br />
My short term goals are to keep the production schedule running smoothly on dirtybird and mothership (the more experimental techno label). Each vinyl is a nine week process (acquisition, mastering, test pressing, promotion, distribution), so there are always several releases in various stages of development at all times. On mothership, I am coordinating the fall ‘08 release of an artist album from Catz ‘n Dogz (aka 3 Channels).</p>
<p>In the long term, I will continue to expand the dirtybird brand, both within and beyond the dance music community. I recently coordinated a deal to place selected dirtybird music on airline radio networks, beginning in June. We are planning a remix contest with a high profile music software company, also happening in June. I would like to introduce our dirtybird party to more cities as a complete entity and experience, much like Ghostly have done. We will be together in Europe this summer for several dirtybird parties, so the groundwork is laid!</p>
<p><strong>Give us a taste of what’s coming out soon and maybe not so soon on the Dirtybird label?</strong><br />
There is a new Martin Brothers record, the “Rocket Surgery EP,” in the final stages of production. It’s due out in early June. It is three club-smashing tracks, heavily influenced by Bay Area hip-hop and werewolves. Due in July is a single from SF’s J.phlip, called “Rumble Rumble.” She built the song around an earth-shaking 40 Hz bass tone and soda cans opening. It was a lock after hearing it on massive sound systems all over WMC. In August, we’ll be dropping EP’s from the next Claude VonStroke full length album.</p>
<p><strong>Describe what makes Dirtybird unique?</strong><br />
From our first BBQ in Golden Gate Park to our recent label showcase in Miami, we have strived to create events that gain momentum and intensity as they progress. That philosophy &#8211; combined with elements of playfulness, surprise, and nasty bass lines &#8211; is the driving force behind all of dirtybird’s music.</p>
<p><strong>How about DJing?  Do you find yourself DJing as much as before?</strong><br />
I am DJing more than ever now, travelling to new cities all the time. In San Francisco, I now have two monthly parties. There is the long running dirtybird residency at Shine (3rd Fridays), where we throw down nothing but dancefloor bombs after about 11:30 PM. Then there are 4th Tuesdays at 222 Hyde with Justin and Monty Luke (mothership, XLR8R). It is more of an experimental night – we delve into the newest deep techno and subterranean house we can get our hands on. It’s a pleasurable challenge to consistently entertain both crowds.</p>
<p><strong>I hear your Dirtybird parties are quite the rage in San Francisco.  What do your guys have planned on that tip? </strong><br />
We have two confirmed Golden Gate parties, on June 1 and August 10. On October 3rd, we’re taking over Mezzanine’s rib-rattling Function One soundsystem. October 4th is Lovefest – San Francisco’s take on the famous Berlin party. We’ll all be playing on a float downtown. It will be a memorable weekend &#8211; bring earplugs!</p>
<p><strong>How did your WMC go this year?  What were your highlights?</strong><br />
Without a doubt, this was my best WMC. Instead of running around town chasing after parties, I played four stellar gigs and relaxed (sort of) the rest of the time. Highlights are all gig related: pulling up to our dirtybird party at Studio A at 7:30 AM with Barclay after flying all night and entering to see packed dancefloor was easily the best start I could have asked for. I had a ton of fun playing for Sean &amp; the Heatr crew on Friday night – it was a nice break from Miami mayhem, and it led perfectly into my Saturday morning Aquabooty warehouse set. Sunday morning, I was lucky enough to play up on a rooftop with the ocean at my back and all my friends lounging around as the sun came up..</p>
<p><strong>What can we expect from your upcoming gig down here in Miami on May 24th?</strong></p>
<p>I always welcome the opportunity to play on a nice large sound system like Vagabond’s Funktion One – it gives me the chance to drop those tracks with the lowest notes, the illest buildups, and the best payoffs; tracks that I would be less likely to trust on smaller systems. Plus I have a treasure trove of unreleased goodness from both dirtybird and mothership. That always helps!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.savagemethods.com/images/cpod.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick update on me:</p>
<p>Only 6 more weeks until the baby arrives!! I am trying to find a new apartment for my girlfriend, the baby, and me. My new position at work is going really well. Family is doing well. I&#8217;ve been gaining a little bit of weight. Been partying a lot&#8230;.trying to get it out of my system as much as possible before the baby comes. My cat is becoming more insane.</p>
<p>I just bought 2 JBL powered monitors, and now I am saving up for a laptop and&#8230;.oh God&#8230;I never thought I would be saying this&#8230;.but&#8230;I am also saving up for Serato. I am going to be converting to Serato. I fell in love with the idea of SEARCHING for tracks on the computer and setting up cue points and other stuff. I have way too much music on CD&#8217;s and it is getting difficult trying to find tracks quickly when I am playing out. The Serato conversion won&#8217;t be for another 2-3 months.</p>
<p>The DJ&#8217;ing is pretty slow at the moment but it will be picking up soon. I am only spinning one night a week at TONIC every Saturday night in Santa Barbara. I do the opening house music set, and it sucks that I have to play a ton of cheese. We are talkin&#8217; house remixes and mashups of Top40 stuff. Ew.</p>
<p>The 1 year anniversary of INCOGNITO is coming up&#8230;I am pretty bummed that I haven&#8217;t been booked to play with them for several months now, especially the anniversary party! I was their first resident DJ and helped them get started. No love for Curly. Oh well, shit happens I guess. Me reppin only Fix and Sbtherapy for this episode of the podcast is me being bitter. LOL.</p>
<p>Good news- I am now resident DJ @ Statemynt Lounge in Santa Barbara for their Monday night party called &#8220;Dyrty Mondays&#8221; which will be nothing but dirty house music! WOOT! Such a big breath of fresh air it will be to play some underground shit finally in Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be spinning a beach party at the end of the month in Ventura for the 10 year anniversary of Left Side Productions. I will also be spinning (hopefully) a few of the Sunday Sessions parties at TONIC starting Memorial Day and going on til Labor Day. I am also working on some other gigs/residencies.</p>
<p>Well enough about ME and now onto the latest episode of the podcast. I&#8217;ve had the tracklist prepared for almost a week now and finally had the time to record it. I think that I have perfected my sound and I am very fortunate to be able to continue finding songs that fit this style. I think this mix has more energy and flows better than the last couple of episodes of the podcast. Check it out and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Also, if you are a producer or are from a record label, please feel free to send me promos. My contact info is <a title="here" href="http://www.savagemethods.com/?page_id=10" target="_self">here</a>.</p>

<p>I held residencies this year at Couchez in SB, Wildcat in SB, Tonic in SB, Pangaea in Ventura, Boardner&#8217;s in LA, and played random gigs at several other clubs throughout Southern California.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to spin at the world famous Circus Disco this year (my 4th time there!). I also spun at Orange County&#8217;s number 1 deep house club, Focus @ Tapas, twice! I got to play beside some world famous djs along the way as well.</p>
<p>I also kept myself busy with the radio show on KCSB, (TECHNO)LOGICAL Radio), for half the year. 2007 also saw the creation of the Savage Methods Podcast (www.savagemethods.com) which spans 20 episodes with nearly 10,000 total downloads. I have had guest mixes featured on various websites and online radio shows such as deeprepublic.com, euphoric senses radio @ insoulwetrust.com, four4 @ afterhoursdjs.com, and liveatfocus.com.</p>
<p>I want to thank you all for the support. I couldn&#8217;t have accomplished any of this without you. I have big things in store for 2008. Stay tuned!</font></p>

<p>Wow. I apologize for the long delay in updating the podcast. I am back from a brief hiatus and have recorded Episode 18. But before I get to talking about the new mix, I just wanna discuss what has kept me busy over the past month and a half.</p>
<p>I DJ&#8217;ed down in Orange County at FOCUS in October, and I spun in Ventura at Pangaea recently. I work 3 nights a week at TONIC in Santa Barbara (Thurs-lighting, Fri-dj&#8217;ing, Sat-lighting/dj&#8217;ing). I haven&#8217;t even had time to record or practice mixing at home.</p>
<p>I went to SF twice in October to party with the Dirtybird crew. The first time was for the bbq at Golden Gate Park, and the second time was for the Halloween party at Shine. Fun times!</p>
<p>Ok so now onto the juicy stuff&#8230;.I just found out recently that my girlfriend is pregnant with my child. She is currently 7 weeks pregnant. Which means that she got pregnant around the time that we took off for San Francisco to hit up Love Fest. We are still in shock but definitely excited for the new arrival.</p>
<p>With everything going on as you can see, it was fairly difficult to finally find some time to get in the &#8216;studio&#8217; and record a mix. I had this particular tracklist planned for about 3 weeks now but never had the opportunity to record until now. This mix  is my interpretation of the house and techno sounds of San Francisco. My favorite city. I hope you enjoy the mix. Thanks for your support.</p>
<p>ps- I will be spinning at RED@CIRCUS on Saturday, November 24th. My residency INCOGNITO will be hosting the backroom. I am going to be spinning alongside Franco Benito, DJ Iann, Bas &amp; Clovis, and Ryan Sage. I have the 230-4am timeslot. WOOT! That means I get to bang it out finally. Also, I have a live recording up over at LIVEATFOCUS.COM from when I spun there on 08/07/07. My mix is at the #4 position on the top downloads list. Download my mix from there if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Wow. I apologize for the long delay in updating the podcast. I am back from a brief hiatus and have recorded Episode 18. But before I get to talking about the new mix, I just wanna discuss what has kept me busy over the past month and a half.

I DJ\'ed down in Orange County at FOCUS in October, and I spun in Ventura at Pangaea recently. I work 3 nights a week at TONIC in Santa Barbara (Thurs-lighting, Fri-dj\'ing, Sat-lighting/dj\'ing). I haven\'t even had time to record or practice mixing at home.

I went to SF twice in October to party with the Dirtybird crew. The first time was for the bbq at Golden Gate Park, and the second time was for the Halloween party at Shine. Fun times!

Ok so now onto the juicy stuff....I just found out recently that my girlfriend is pregnant with my child. She is currently 7 weeks pregnant. Which means that she got pregnant around the time that we took off for San Francisco to hit up Love Fest. We are still in shock but definitely excited for the new arrival.  

With everything going on as you can see, it was fairly difficult to finally find some time to get in the \'studio\' and record a mix. I had this particular tracklist planned for about 3 weeks now but never had the opportunity to record until now. This mix  is my interpretation of the house and techno sounds of San Francisco. My favorite city. I hope you enjoy the mix. Thanks for your support.

ps- I will be spinning at RED@CIRCUS on Saturday, November 24th. My residency INCOGNITO will be hosting the backroom. I am going to be spinning alongside Franco Benito, DJ Iann, Bas &#38; Clovis, and Ryan Sage. I have the 230-4am timeslot. WOOT! That means I get to bang it out finally. Also, I have a live recording up over at LIVEATFOCUS.COM from when I spun there on 08/07/07. My mix is at the #4 position on the top downloads list. Download my mix from there if you haven\'t already.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.savagemethods.com/images/cpod.jpg" /></p>
<p>Last Thursday, I did the lighting for DJ Dan at Tonic in Santa Barbara. I am the light guy on Thursdays and Saturdays there now, and I am also dj&#8217;ing there on Fridays and Saturdays as well. $$$.</p>
<p>Friday I went up to SF for the weekend for Love Fest. I saw Lee Burridge on Friday night at Mighty. Great night of music and seeing a ton of familiar faces.</p>
<p>I caught Love Fest on Saturday and checked out all the floats. My highlights were seeing Infected Mushroom, Claude Vonstroke, Alland Byallo, Dyloot, Chris Fortier, and a ton of dj&#8217;s I had never heard before. I caught the Official Love Fest After Party afterwards at the Bill Graham Civic Center. I caught Richard Vission, DJ Dan, Dyloot, Gabriel &amp; Dresden, Three, John 00 Flemming, Sasha, and more.</p>
<p>I left SF on Sunday morning but not before going to Haight Street and hitting up Tweekin Records. I went vinyl shopping for the first time in almost a year! I haven&#8217;t bought vinyl records in a very long time ever since I switched to mixing on cd&#8217;s. I bought 3 Channels Presents: Catz &#8216;n Dogz &#8220;Fixation/Chicken Affair&#8221; on Dirtybird Records, Monty Luke &amp; Tasho &#8220;Paranoid&#8221; on Mothership Records, and DJ Blaqstarr &#8220;Shake it to the ground&#8221; on Mad Decent Records. I can&#8217;t wait to play these tunes out!</p>
<p>My residency in LA is moving venues from Boardner&#8217;s to a club called PLAY. I hope they book me to spin at their next party featuring Randy Boyer.</p>
<p>I got in trouble at the radio station (KCSB) and have been suspended for 2 weeks. I will not be coming back to do my show because I want to focus more time on the podcast/website and trying to get more gigs. I will also no longer be using KCSB as an affiliation on the podcast/website. I may return to do my radio show again in a few months.</p>
<p>I have been busy with gigs and other things and was not able to deliver Episode 17 sooner. I recorded this mix a week ago exclusively for the Four4 online radio show (hosted by LRCN) on Afterhoursdjs.org. My mix was featured on Saturday afternoon while I was at Love Fest in San Francisco. This mix is 80 minutes of my usual combination of tech house, minimal, and techno. Enjoy!<br />

<strong>WORTHY (SF, Dirtybird, Katabatic)</strong></p>
<p>The guest mix for Part 2 of Episode 16 comes to us from Worthy of Dirtybird and Katabatic. I am a huge fan of the SF style of tech house &amp; minimal (as if you couldn&#8217;t already tell). This is the 2nd mix from Worthy being featured on the Savage Methods Podcast. This mix was recorded live from the Dirtybird party @ Golden Gate Park on August 19, 2007 and was released as Worthy&#8217;s latest promo mix called &#8220;A Good Day&#8221;. I was there for the party and heard this set in person. If you have never been to a Dirtybird party, I highly recommend that you check them out. Worthy was recently interviewed by iDJ magazine and he talks about one of his recent productions &#8220;BassQuake&#8221; and also speaks about his record label Katabatic Records. Pick up a copy of this month&#8217;s issue of iDJ magazine from Border&#8217;s or wherever else sells magazines and check out the interesting interview. Also, check out all of the releases from Worthy on Beatport.com, and while you are at it, check out all the releases on Dirtybird and Katabatic. Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Worthy&#8217;s Bio from myspace.com/djworthy:</strong><br />
<em>Currently residing in San Francisco, DJ Worthy grew up around Washington DC in the early days of Deep Dish, Scott Henry and the early American rave scene. In the late 90&#8242;s after moving to New York City, Worthy met his good friend Justin Martin and was exposed to the sounds of people like LTJ Bukem, Stacey Pullen, and Sasha. All of these influences made an impression on this young producer as he began to play records of all genres from hip hop to breaks to techno and drum n bass.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2001 Worthy set up his studio in San Francisco and began producing house music. He began DJing around the city at clubs such as The Top, Lit, and Anu. Soon a San Francisco tech house label called Dirtybird, soon noticed Worthy&#8217;s talent and asked him to be a resident DJ at their huge monthly summer event in Golden Gate Park along side of Claude VonStroke, Justin Martin, and Christian Martin. He has played along side other great DJs such as Jesse Rose, JT Donaldson, Lance Desardi, and Luke Solomon. In 2006 Worthy started his own label called Katabatic Records to give him a way to release his own music. Katabatic Records has been releasing a steady stream of quality tech house and has gaining praises for its edgy music.</em></p>
<p><em>2007 is looking to be a break out year for Worthy with two releases coming out on dirtybird including a remix of Claude VonStroke’s “The Whistler” and an ep on Matt Tolfrey’s label Leftroom Limited.

		<itunes:summary>The guest mix for Part 2 of Episode 16 comes to us from Worthy of Dirtybird and Katabatic. I am a huge fan of the SF style of tech house &#38; minimal (as if you couldn\'t already tell). This is the 2nd mix from Worthy being featured on the Savage Methods Podcast. This mix was recorded live from the Dirtybird party @ Golden Gate Park on August 19, 2007 and was released as Worthy\'s latest promo mix called \"A Good Day\". I was there for the party and heard this set in person. If you have never been to a Dirtybird party, I highly recommend that you check them out. Worthy was recently interviewed by iDJ magazine and he talks about one of his recent productions \"BassQuake\" and also speaks about his record label Katabatic Records. Pick up a copy of this month\'s issue of iDJ magazine from Border\'s or wherever else sells magazines and check out the interesting interview. Also, check out all of the releases from Worthy on Beatport.com, and while you are at it, check out all the releases on Dirtybird and Katabatic. Enjoy!

<p>I am back on track with releasing a new episode every Monday, hopefully I can stay consistent. There were so many tracks that I wanted to use for this week&#8217;s episode but I try to keep the mixes under 80 minutes so that people can burn them to CD&#8217;s. I had about 15 other tracks that I wanted to use&#8230;maybe next week. This mix is once again in the style of tech house and minimal. I have some brand new releases in there as well as some old gems. I am really excited about the new Justin Martin release (he is releasing a mix CD next month) and also Samim&#8217;s new artist album. I also picked up a copy of Claude Vonstroke&#8217;s &#8220;At The Controls&#8221; mix CD and there were 2 tracks that really stood out for me and I couldn&#8217;t resist using them on this week&#8217;s episode of the podcast (Lee Mortimer &#8220;Mush&#8221; and Meat vs. Einzelkind &#8220;Freebase Night At Robert-Johnson&#8221;).</p>
<p>I have switched up the way that I cue my incoming tracks and as a result I have found that my mixes are more energetic. I try to deliver just the meat and potatoes of the song and cut out all the boring stuff like the long intros/outros. I also pretty much just wait til the first breakdown of the song and then start mixing out when the beat drops again.</p>
<p>I am pretty pleased with the tracks I used in this mix, however I had 2 rough transitions towards the end. Sorry about that. I blame it on trying to squeeze in as many tracks as possible and still trying to hold long transitions in the process. I record all my mixes in one take and I believe that the beauty in doing so is that you can hear the mistakes I make and how I recover from them.</p>
<p>I will try to get a guest mix for Part 2 of Episode 16 by the middle of the week. I also have to find some time to record my &#8220;Jackin The Box 3&#8243; mix. I do not have any gigs until September 21st @ Boardner&#8217;s (LA) for INCOGNITO, and I also play September 22nd @ TONIC (SB). Rene (aka &#8220;The Blacklight Special&#8221;) and planning on throwing underground techno parties in Santa Barbara. I don&#8217;t plan on partying until September 18 when I go down to the OC to catch Jesse Rose @ FOCUS.  Enough with the blabbing&#8230;Enjoy Episode 16!</p>

<strong>ALLAND BYALLO (SF, [KONTROL])</strong></p>
<p>I am very honored to have a guest mix coming from [KONTROL] SF&#8217;s Alland Byallo. I am a big fan of this guy&#8217;s work and the style of techno he plays, not to mention the parties the [KONTROL] guys throw are killer from what I hear. Alland and [KONTROL] are just 2 more reasons why I want to move to San Francisco, in addition to the Dirtybird peeps. Check out Alland Byallo&#8217;s releases on Beatport.com, and make sure to keep an eye on him because he is blowin&#8217; up!</p>
<p><strong>Alland Byallo&#8217;s biography from AllandByallo.com:</strong></p>
<p><em>A Los Angeles native now residing in San Francisco, Russian-blooded Alland Byallo has broken into the House scene with his own unique blend of Minimal Tech funk. Alland’s taste, coupled with his research and digging, always instills an undeniable groove and tickles the chin-scratching trainspotting senses.</em></p>
<p><em>Alland’s involvement with music didn’t just start from splurging and buying some 1200’s. Having been raised with music since the age of 5 playing piano, and adding trumpet at age 11, it only seemed natural for Alland to follow up his skills and training by sharing his taste in quality music with people as a DJ, and pursuing production. Lately, Alland has been quite busy in the studio working hard on his own unique take on electronic dance music, blending the ethics of Minimal Techno with the moods and feel of House Music.</em></p>
<p><em>Alland has hosted the infamous netradio show Comfort Sessions for four years, only recenlty switching to an On-Demand format with Proton Radio, the most respected netradio portal in Underground Electronic music. The show is inspired by a couple of things: The admiration and respect for some of the most talented names out there, and the love of enlightening and educating others about music and the brilliant artists who make it all happen. Alland has made it his mission to give back to the local and global scene that has given so much to him; to make the world aware of the missions of those around him that truly deserve recognition and respect.</em></p>
<p><em>Currently, A&amp;R for his own digital label, Nightlight Music and his upcoming label Kvadrat Produkt, takes up much of Alland&#8217;s time. Nightlight Music started as a digital label used as an outlet for Alland&#8217;s personal music projects. But since it&#8217;s inception, the label has grown to accomodate some of the world&#8217;s most talented and passionate Tech-House artists. Kvadrat Produkt is a new label that Alland is creating to fill a certain void. &#8220;Minimal Yet Musical&#8221; is the motto for this venture. As the name implies (Kvadrat meaning &#8220;Square&#8221; in many languages), the vehicle is minimalism, yet filled with mass that supports the structure.Alland is a resident at [KONTROL], San Francisco&#8217;s finest Minimal Techno/House event. The night has gained a worldwide reputation for being one of the nations most respected nights, and that reputation grows with every guest performer that rolls through. Guest talent includes: Daniel Bell, Isolee, Matthew Dear, Akufen, Sutekh, The Kooky Scientist, Sammy Dee, Alex Under, Troy Pierce, John Tejada + Justin Maxwell, Caro, [a]pendics.shuffle, Derek Plaslaiko, Tim Xavier, Philip Sherburne, Pheek, Claude VonStroke, Pan/Tone, Modeselektor, Ryan Crosson + Lee Curtiss, Justin Martin, Mossa, Dafluke, Kenneth Graham, Brian Aneurysm, Someone Else, Dave Aju, Jeff Samuel, Galoppierende Zuversicht, and DJ Fragment.</em></p>
<p><em>San Francisco&#8217;s bustling music scene is no secret. However, the location of their best radio station, the pirate station WestAdd Radio 93.7FM is. In 2006 WestAdd Radio asked the [KONTROL] residents to start a show. And here we are . Every second Monday from 9-11PM PST, you can the residents broadcasting live during [ground.KONTROL]. Try to find quality minimal techno, micro-house and deep dark techno anywhere else on the San Francisco airwaves.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2006 Alland founded ElektrUS. This private forum is made specifically to increase European interest in the American minimal techno / tech-house scene. By providing a simple, central and easy means of communication, ElektrUS streamlines the booking process and maximizes the productivity of tour booking ventures. The hope is to make the US a more fun place for techno fans, and a more profitable venture for European talent and agents. So far things are looking great for 2007!</em></p>
<p><em>All of these facets, in addition to his work as a full-time graphic designer for the very well-respected Publicis Dialog advertising firm, make up Alland Byallo&#8217;s life.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s quite clear: this man is on a mission</em></p>

<p>I am still trying to get back into the groove of things and get a new mix done every week for the podcast, but it has been fairly difficult. . I was busy last week preparing a mix for my CD release party on Thursday (08/30). I opened up for DJ Colette at the Wildcat Lounge and handed out 100 copies of my electro-house mix titled &#8220;Electrotherapy.&#8221; Burning/printing CD&#8217;s up until Thursday kept me busy and therefore was not able to record a mix for the podcast. But here I am now and I knocked out a mix in just over an hour with 19 sick minimal and techy tracks.</p>
<p>I recently saw Mauro Picotto on Saturday night down in Los Angeles at Vanguard. It was my 2nd time seeing him spin and this time was certainly way better than the last time. He layed down some filthy minimal, tech house, and techno. He was dropping big track after big track for over 3 hours straight. He even played several of his classic tracks as well.</p>
<p>Seeing the legendary Mauro Picotto on Saturday made me want to throw down a filthy minimal mix. Well that and the fact that my mix I recorded last week was rather cheesy. Haha.

		<itunes:summary>I am still trying to get back into the groove of things and get a new mix done every week for the podcast, but it has been fairly difficult. . I was busy last week preparing a mix for my CD release party on Thursday (08/30). I opened up for DJ Colette at the Wildcat Lounge and handed out 100 copies of my electro-house mix titled \"Electrotherapy.\" Burning/printing CD\'s up until Thursday kept me busy and therefore was not able to record a mix for the podcast. But here I am now and I knocked out a mix in just over an hour with 19 sick minimal and techy tracks.

I recently saw Mauro Picotto on Saturday night down in Los Angeles at Vanguard. It was my 2nd time seeing him spin and this time was certainly way better than the last time. He layed down some filthy minimal, tech house, and techno. He was dropping big track after big track for over 3 hours straight. He even played several of his classic tracks as well.

Seeing the legendary Mauro Picotto on Saturday made me want to throw down a filthy minimal mix. Well that and the fact that my mix I recorded last week was rather cheesy. Haha. So here ya go, Episode 15 of the Savage Methods Podcast. I am working on getting a guest mix for Part 2...so keep checkin back right here to find out who will be featured. I also hope to  get back on schedule with recording a new episode every week. Wish me luck.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a good fuckin party. This was my 2nd time seeing Mauro Picotto and I think that he totally redeemed himself. I was so disappointed when I saw him a while ago at Circus Disco. He fuckin brought it hard, filthy, and techy on Saturday night. He was playing bomb track after bomb track for over 3 full hours.</p>
<p>Some of the tracks I remembered throughout the night were:<br />
Deadmau5 &#8211; Faxing Berlin<br />
Burnski &#8211; Pop3<br />
Robert Babicz &#8211; Sin<br />
Gregor Tresher &#8211; A thousand nights<br />
Chymera &#8211; Umbrella</p>
<p>Most of his set was comprised of stuff I have never heard before. And of course he plugged in some of his own classic productions. People went nuts to them. I was quite impressed how he worked his own older tracks in with the current minimal/techno stuff. It fit right in and didn&#8217;t sound too out of place.</p>
<p>I was so fuckin tired from getting 2 hours sleep the night before and then working 9 hours at work and then coming straight to LA afterwards. I had to sit down for the last half of Mauro&#8217;s set but still kept nodding my head to the sick beats.</p>
<p>I cant wait to have Mauro Picotto back in LA. It certainly was a treat.</p>
<p>Check out pictures from the night over at <a href="http://photo.rukes.com/vanguard81/vanguard81.html" target="_blank">RUKES.COM </a></p>

<p><font size="2">I am back on track with everything&#8230;Episode 14 is finally here! I was in a slump that lasted almost a month and a half. I needed to take a few weeks off to clear my head&#8230;now I am back in full force. Life has never been better. This mix is a collection of tracks I have been sitting on for a few weeks and they all remind me of my amazing weekend in San Francisco. This mix is a perfect demo for LA &amp; SF. This is the kind of shit I would play in those cities.</font></p>
<p>I have done a lot of partying and played a lot of gigs in the time off that I had from recording the podcast. I was dealing with a very bad breakup between my girlfriend and I. We were together 3.5 years. It was a difficult time&#8230;.I couldn&#8217;t eat or sleep for a few weeks. I dropped 17 pounds. I totally did not have the motivation or dedication to try and keep up with the website/podcast. I hung in there and surrounded myself with true friends and kept busy. I am now better than ever and ready to get the momentum going with not only the podcast, but also in life.  I hope you enjoy this mix. All feedback is appreciated.</p>

<p>Last week on the (TECHNO)LOGICAL Radio show, I had DJ Ducky do a 3 hour guest mix. The show went very well. Thursday I saw Donald Glaude at Tonic in Santa Barbara. On Friday I got invited to spin a few tracks at a new club in Santa Barbara called EOS. I got to the club and was asked to jump on the decks a few minutes later. I played 4 songs and then had the other DJ&#8217;s take over for me because I was having an off night. I redeemed myself when I played on the patio on Sunday at Tonic. I opened up for the other sbtherapy resident dj&#8217;s, Steve1der, and Charles Feelgood. I had a great set and a lot of people liked what they heard.</p>
<p>This week I plan on doing a solo 3 hour set ony my radio show. I am also going to check out Max Cheddar play at the Wildcat Lounge. The DJ Dan party got cancelled but was rescheduled for a later date. I am playing down in Hollywood on Friday at a club called Boardner&#8217;s. The name of the party is &#8220;INCOGNITO&#8221;. I am their resident DJ and this will be our 3rd installment. Hit me up for guestlist by 2pm Friday! Also, I am very excited to see Daft Punk on Saturday!!! To end the weekend, I will be partying all day on Sunday at Tonic for &#8220;Sunday Session.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming up soon- I will be spinning at Wicked@Pangaea in Ventura on Friday August 03. It will be a sbtherapy vs. Left Side Productions dj lineup.

I am also spinning at a BBQ in Santa Barbara on Saturday August 11th, anyone can come!</p>

<p><strong>(Edited: July 11, 2007):</strong> I recorded this mix as an exclusive for the Four4 Online Radio show on Afterhourdsdjs.org which is hosted by LRCN. I decided to feature this mix as Episode 12 of the Savage Methods Podcast. I uploaded it on Sunday morning just before heading to San Francisco for the Dirtybird party at Golden Gate Park. I drove up there, partied, and drove back home all in the same day. I had an awesome time, heard a lot of amazing music, and got to hang out with the Dirtybird guys. It was my first time seeing Claude Vonstroke spin and it was such a treat seeing him work his magic on the decks. I uploaded a bunch of pictures on my myspace page, and also several videos on youtube.</p>
<p>This mix for Episode 12 was a lot of fun to record. I put a lot of time into picking out tracks for this one. I have been really lucky in being able to find tracks week in and week out that work perfectly with my style. This mix is pure tech house and minimal. Enjoy!</p>
<p>I have the (TECHNO)LOGICAL Radio show this week and I will feature DJ Ducky (Santa Barbara) as the special guest DJ doing a 3 hour exclusive live set in the studio. Then on Thursday, sbtherapy presents Donald Glaude at Tonic. I spin on Sunday afternoon/evening at Tonic for the sbtherapy 7 year anniversary. I spin next week on Thursday opening up for DJ Dan, Friday in LA at Boardner&#8217;s for Incognito (w/ Kristina Sky and Bas &amp; Clovis in the main room), then Saturday of next week I get to see Daft Punk in LA! CRAZY! I also just got booked for Friday August 3rd in Ventura at Pangaea: sbtherapy vs. Left Side Productions. Word!</p>

<p>I apologize for being a week late on recording a new mix. I have been extremely busy and exhausted since I last recorded a mix for the podcast. I have had several gigs over the past 2 weeks. I played at 2 bbq&#8217;s (I dj&#8217;ed for 8 hours nonstop at one party, and the other one I dj&#8217;ed about 6 hours). I started my radio show last week on Wednesday where I did a tag team set with The Blacklight Special. I opened up for Gene Farris at the Wildcat Lounge last Thursday in Santa Barbara. Then last Friday I played in LA at the King King and opened for Chuck Lepley, Kazell, and Max Cheddar. My equipment has been in my car throughout those 2 weeks and never had time to set up my equipment in my &#8216;studio&#8217;, er I mean my room, to record. Keep in mind I have a regular 40 hr/week job aside from all this dj&#8217;ing.</p>
<p>In other news, my car is almost done getting repaired. The grand total for the damage caused to my ride was $6000!!! Atleast it is going to be looking like new (sorta) when I get it back.</p>
<p>Ok so back to episode 11&#8230;I finally got around to recording the mix I had intended to record last week but had no time. This mix has a little bit of everything as usual, deep house/tech house/minimal techno, served up with a side of savage. LOL. Enjoy!</p>
<p>I have the radio show on Wednesday night, no club gigs. I have to record another mix during the week because I am doing a guest mix for LRCN&#8217;s Four4 online radio show on Saturday afternoon. Sunday I am heading up to SF to catch the Dirtybird party at Golden Gate Park. Monday I have to report to jury duty. FUCK!</p>
<p>Oh and I don&#8217;t know if I am supposed to mention this, but at my work today (airport), there was a plane crash (minor &#8211; ran off runway) and a bomb threat (stupid lady was pissed cuz her bag got lost and started talkin out of her ass). That shit made for a pretty savage day.</p>
<p>For Part 2 of this episode, I am featuring a guest mix from my homie Richard X.</p>

<strong>JAMES TALK (UK, SPOKEN RECORDINGS)</strong></p>
<p>For Part 2 of Episode 10, I have a guest mix from James Talk. He is a well known DJ/producer from the UK and represents Spoken Recordings. I got permission from James to host his latest June 2007 demo on the Savage Methods Podcast.</p>
<p>I was first exposed to James Talk when I first heard the track &#8220;Eggs are cute&#8221; back in 2004. Since then, James has released a ton of similar quality original productions and remixes. Remember his name because he is on the verge of a much deserved breakthrough.</p>
<p>I am stoked to be able to feature a guest mix from James Talk on the Savage Methods Podcast. Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>James Talk&#8217;s Bio from jamestalk.co.uk:</strong></p>
<p><em>Be it via his DJing or studio work,<br />
James Talk’s unique funky tech and acid house sound can already hold claim for causing mayhem on many of the world’s finest dancefloors, and all at the age of just 23. Hailing from the murkiest waters of Southampton, James has already achieved a tremendous amount at such a young age and it seems like things aren&#8217;t slowing down either.</em></p>
<p><em>2006 has been spent by Talky laying the foundations and releasing his first mix compilation; the second installment of the Thinking Out Loud series. The mix incorporates big up party electrohouse, squelching acid lines and funky bass and is set to propel James to a new level. James launched the compilation at Miami WMC and followed this by embarking on a major UK tour supporting the CD. This incorporated major gigs at Product at Stealth (Nottingham), Type at The Cross (London), High Tide at The Opera House (Bournemouth) and his Curfew Time residency at Turnmills (London) amongst others. In 2006 James has also been rocking the dancefloors at Shindig (Newcastle), ClubClass (Ministry Of Sound, London), Ageha (Tokyo), Apriori (Moscow), Furry Music (Oslo) and at Sphinx (Gdansk, Poland). This follows his superb performances in 2005 alongside the likes of Nic Fanciulli, Lee Burridge, James Zabiela and Desyn Masiello at nights such as Godskitchen (Birmingham), Punchfunk (Portsmouth) and Renaissance (The Cross, London).</em></p>
<p><em>In the studio James has been just as prolific with eight awesome remixes completed including Meat Katie &amp; Aquasky’s ‘Feathers’ (on Adrift Records), Denney ‘The Phantom’ (Saved), Kid Blue ‘Nothing To Lose’ (Lot49) and Hyper ‘Twisted Emotions’ (Hope). And if that wasn’t enough James has been flat out with his original productions. His collaboration with Audiofly called ‘Cool Wet Grass’ is soon to be released on Get Physical, whilst ‘House Rhythm’ and ‘Wiggle Wiggle Shake Shake’ were the first releases on his new label Spoken Recordings, with his and Dave Robertson’s ‘Mine &amp; His EP’ and a full artist album to follow.</em></p>
<p><em>Such efforts follow an excellent start to James’ career in which three of his productions were signed to Saved Records, whilst further work for Nu-Republic Records and Phil Docherty&#8217;s Pravo Recordings also gave James massive exposure. ‘Love That Acid’ reached no. 10 in the UK Buzz Charts, whilst ‘Get Down’ featured on Nic Fanciulli’s Renaissance mix compilation. These efforts received support from the likes of John Digweed, Sasha, Steve Lawler and Danny Howells and James continues to enjoy the support from these individuals to this very day. James has also worked with none other than Pete Tong in the studio, with the duo completing a remix of Wally Lopez for Pacha Records.</em></p>
<p><em>2006 has also been an outstanding year for James with Nic Fanciulli, Sander Kleinenberg and Fergie all choosing him as their breakthrough artist for the year in DJ Mag’s Top 100 issue and IDJ magazine featuring James in their February issue in an article in which the magazine chose twenty prospects on course for great things in 2006. Further press in IDJ came in July, this time a full page spread in the ‘Bubblin Under’ section of the magazine in July in which the magazine again proclaimed James as one of the UK’s hottest rising talents. And with future gigs at many of the planet’s seminal club nights, numerous sensational productions due for release on world class record labels and the continued growth of his own Spoken Recordings who are we to argue!</em></p>
<p><em>“James Talk is without question one of the brightest new lights on dance music’s horizon. Emerging last year, from Zabelia’s Southampton based electronica gang, few new dj’s have got off to such an impressive start. Juggling production, remixing and dj-ing from the start James epitomises what it takes to get noticed in the world of dance music. He is a man on a mission!” Pete Tong</em></p>

<p>Last Thursday I was supposed to open for DJ Scotty Boy at the Wildcat Lounge in Santa Barbara. I guess he cancelled due to a broken foot. He was replaced by local hip-hop/top40/mashup sensation DJ Matty Matt. I opened the first hour and then DJ Hogg and DJ Matty Matt played after me. I don&#8217;t think I had a very good set although I had a lot of people dancing early on. I had been feeling out of it ever since my accident, which by the way I heard my car might get totalled!!! It is probably going to be too costly to repair the vehicle, so the dude&#8217;s insurance may just give me the cash for the car. I hope I don&#8217;t get screwed. I got a free rental car out of it, but I am having to pay for the insurance out of my own pocket. That shit is gonna add up!</p>
<p>Alright back on track&#8230;Friday I went down to LA to play again at Incognito at Boardner&#8217;s. I got to open up for the LA rave legend Thee-o. It was a good party. It definitely has potential. My buddy Gerard, the promoter of Incognito, named me his resident DJ. Good things are heading my way!</p>
<p>I was supposed to have a guest mix from Gabriel and Dresden for Part 2 of Episode 09&#8230;but Dave Dresden never sent me the file as promised. It was to be an exclusive 1 hour set from one of their recent shows. I am very upset that I never received the file. I think I am going to boycott Gabriel and Dresden/Organized Nature as a result. A lot of people were expecting that mix and it never came.</p>
<p>Anyway, I recorded a new mix for Episode 10&#8230;this is a collection of some recent purchases which consisted of old and new tracks. I also threw in some tracks that I have had but never got a chance to use in a mix. This mix is pure tech house with a splash of electro and a pinch of minimal. I apologize for the dodgy mixing here and there. I just didn&#8217;t have it this time. I tried to go with the Dirtybird sound on this mix, so if you like Dirtybird, you will enjoy this mix.</p>
<p>For Part 2 of this episode, I am featuring a guest mix from James Talk from the UK.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any club gigs this week, but I am doing 2 private parties. One of them will be a pool party with a bunch of crazy party peeps, and I have invited Calvin and Hogg to spin with me. That party is gonna be savage!</p>

Most records will be $5.25 each, and some of my special ones will go for $10.50. I will cut ya a great deal on shipping also if you buy several at once. I have tons more to add to the database so keep checking back. The inventory of records that I am going to sell will consist mostly of trance, with a little bit of progressive, electro, and house.</p>

<p>Last Thursday I saw Charles Feelgood at the Wildcat Lounge in Santa Barbara. Then on Saturday I went down to LA @ Vanguard to see Luke Fair and Sasha. Amazing party! On the way back I got in a frickin car accident. I wasn&#8217;t in the mood Sunday to record and I forced myself to do the mix Monday night. I wasn&#8217;t really into it because I am still sort of traumatized from the car accident. I think the mix turned out decent considering the frame of mind I&#8217;ve been in.</p>
<p>I decided to play it safe on this mix and play fewer tracks and mix more traditionally. I&#8217;ve got some tech house, minimal, and techno on this one.</p>

<strong>WORTHY (Dirtybird Records)</strong></p>
<p>As most of you may know, I am a huge fan of everything that is Dirtybird. It all started when my good friend Rene Lomeli aka The Blacklight Special dropped Claude Vonstroke&#8217;s &#8220;Deep Throat&#8221; in a mix and I said &#8220;Wtf is that! Its garbage!&#8221; But over time that sound grew on me and it was all over when I picked up Claude Vonstroke&#8217;s &#8220;The Whistler&#8221; and The Martin Brothers&#8217; &#8220;Stoopit.&#8221; I was hooked from right there on.</p>
<p>Then in late April, I got to open for Justin Martin in Santa Barbara at the Wildcat Lounge. That same weekend I went up to SF to catch some Dirtybird parties. I wrote about my experience there in a previous blog entry. But let me summarize by saying that was the best weekend I have ever had. Since that experience, I am hooked on Dirtybird for life. I got to know Justin Martin better, and I also met Christian Martin, Tanner Ross, and Worthy. All from Dirtybird.</p>
<p>For this week&#8217;s guest mix of the Savage Methods Podcast, I&#8217;ve got a brand new hot off the decks mix from Worthy of Dirtybird. This mix features some of his current favorites along with his latest productions that are due to come out soon. I am very honored to be able to feature this mix on my podcast. Enjoy!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some exciting new releases coming out on Dirtybird Records in the near future, so keep an eye out and make sure to support these guys.</p>
<p><strong>Worthy&#8217;s Bio from myspace.com/djworthy:</strong><br />
<em>Currently residing in San Francisco, DJ Worthy grew up around Washington DC in the early days of Deep Dish, Scott Henry and the early American rave scene. In the late 90&#8242;s after moving to New York City, Worthy met his good friend Justin Martin and was exposed to the sounds of people like LTJ Bukem, Stacey Pullen, and Sasha. All of these influences made an impression on this young producer as he began to play records of all genres from hip hop to breaks to techno and drum n bass.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2001 Worthy set up his studio in San Francisco and began producing house music. He began DJing around the city at clubs such as The Top, Lit, and Anu. Soon a San Francisco tech house label called Dirtybird, soon noticed Worthy&#8217;s talent and asked him to be a resident DJ at their huge monthly summer event in Golden Gate Park along side of Claude VonStroke, Justin Martin, and Christian Martin. He has played along side other great DJs such as Jesse Rose, JT Donaldson, Lance Desardi, and Luke Solomon. In 2006 Worthy started his own label called Katabatic Records to give him a way to release his own music. Katabatic Records has been releasing a steady stream of quality tech house and has gaining praises for its edgy music.</em></p>
<p><em>2007 is looking to be a break out year for Worthy with two releases coming out on dirtybird including a remix of Claude VonStroke’s “The Whistler” and an ep on Matt Tolfrey’s label Leftroom Limited. Along with new releases on his label Katabatic Records with remixes from Alland Byallo and Christian Martin. If you have not heard of Worthy then you will soon know that he is worthy.</em></p>

<p>This last Friday I played down in Ventura at a club called Pangea for a party called &#8220;Wicked&#8221;. I played along with DJ Also, and Calvin &amp; Hogg. We are doing a monthly residency down there and trying to bring house music to the city of Ventura. This was the 3rd party so far and there are some indications that there will be potential in building a scene there. I played mostly jackin&#8217; house for my set there and set up the vibe perfectly. Other than that, I took the weekend pretty light since I am going to be partying hard in the next couple of weeks. I am gonna check out Charles Feelgood at the Wildcat Lounge here in Santa Barbara on Thursday. Then on Saturday I am going to Vanguard in LA to check out Sasha and Luke Fair.</p>
<p>I opened up a store on spreadshirt.com for Savagemethods.com merchandise. You can check out the store at http://savagemethods.spreadshirt.com. I bought a shirt with &#8216;Savagemethods.com&#8217; text on the front and the quality is really nice. I also bought a shirt with my &#8216;cpod&#8217; logo on the front and I was disappointed with the quality of that. I will be updating the store by removing the items with my &#8216;cpod&#8217; logo on them. Keep in mind tho that the stuff with the text on it is legit and really good quality.</p>
<p>One thing I love about doing the podcast is that I can play music that I don&#8217;t get the chance to play in the club. I am still getting my foot in the door playing out, which means that I am stuck doing opening sets for now. The thing with doing opening sets is that I have to compromise and play within certain guidelines. It can get frustrating at times because I have a huge selection of music that will never get played in the club. Enter the Savage Methods Podcast. This is where I find solace&#8230;this is where I can express myself without worrying about pissing off DJ&#8217;s after me for playing too hard or too fast. There are no rules here. For Episode 08 of the podcast, I put together a playlist of old and new songs from different genres that really caught my attention. This is another mix that shows how I blend the various styles that I like. This mix has deep house, minimal techno, tech house, progressive house, electro house, and techno. Enjoy! (I apologize for desperately squeezing in some tracks in the beginning and towards the end, I got stubborn and didn&#8217;t want to leave any of these tracks off the mix! LOL!)</p>

<p>Last Wednesday I went down to Hollywood to catch Richard Vission&#8217;s birthday party at Basque on Hollywood and Vine. We got there a little late and missed a few DJ&#8217;s. We still managed to catch sets by Dave Aude, DJ Dan, Richard Vission, and David Garcia. I missed sets from Static Revenger and Mark Lewis. It was a fun party. Then on Thursday I got to see DJ Sneak at the Wildcat Lounge. That was my first time seeing him and he absolutely blew me away. It was a fun night indeed. Then on Saturday I went back down to Hollywood to catch Gui Boratto (live), Michael Mayer, Ladytron (dj set), and Dave Seaman. I got there around 11pm and caught the opening set by Jeffrey Allen. That dude threw down a sick sick sick set. I caught all of Dave Seaman&#8217;s set and part of Gui Boratto&#8217;s performance and had to leave early. I am bummed I missed the rest of Gui Boratto&#8217;s set and all of Michael Mayer. There&#8217;s lots of good parties coming up with summer knocking on our door.</p>
<p>I am back on track with recording the mix for the podcast on Sunday night and releasing it Monday morning. I picked up a lot of new tracks and once again was able to throw in some old gems as well. This set is a perfect example of how I weave through the different genres that I love. I mixed in some deep house, tech house, and minimal techno in this mix. I am very proud of this one because I managed to squeeze in 22 tracks in just under 80 minutes. This is probably my favorite mix that I have ever done and I hope that you enjoy it!</p>

		<itunes:summary>I am back on track with recording the mix for the podcast on Sunday night and releasing it Monday morning. I picked up a lot of new tracks and once again was able to throw in some old gems as well. This set is a perfect example of how I weave through the different genres that I love. I mixed in some deep house, tech house, and minimal techno in this mix. I am very proud of this one because I managed to squeeze in 22 tracks in just under 80 minutes. This is probably my favorite mix that I have ever done and I hope that you enjoy it! I have several gigs lined up for June. Check out all the flyers on the front page of savagemethods.com!

<p>For part 2 of this episode of the Savage Methods Podcast, I have a guest mix from LRCN (djlrcn.com, di.fm, afterhoursdjs.org). This is one of the best mixes I have heard in a very long time. This mix aired on his online radio show The Bidness, episode #25, on May 8th. I am very honored to have LRCN on the Savage Methods Podcast.</p>
<p>Here is the bio from his myspace (www.myspace.com/lrcn):</p>
<p><em>Mixing music regardless of medium requires a certain amount of skill: the result is either a concerted effort or an effortless seam. Larson Shepherd, a.k.a. LRCN to his fans, certainly retains the latter. Since his debut in December 2001 on the 2nd Birthday Bash of the world&#8217;s largest online radio station Digitally Imported Radio LRCN has been building a modest following. With a style not confined to genre, his talent is evident in his infectious sets: whether spinning breaks, trance, or &#8211; the core following favorite &#8211; progressive, the crowd response is always the same, fanatic.</em></p>
<p><em>Originally from Ganado, Arizona, a small town in the middle of the Navajo Reservation, his entrance into the EDM community began with his arrival to Los Angeles in 1996 during his enlistment with the armed forces. While mentoring under Drum and Bass DJs: Jason Angel, DJ W, and Alder, the refinement of his skill commenced with the purchase of his first records and decks. His exposure to Los Angeles dance and club culture only served to fuel his fervor. So not surprisingly, after countless hours of dedicated practice, LRCN lived up to expectations with a fantastic performance on Digitally Imported Radio&#8217;s 2nd Birthday Bash. With a passion for music so evident in his delivery, LRCN is sure to become a familiar name.</em></p>
<p><em>He has since been playing locally, with a few out of state gigs, and even has an international gig under his belt. Since his introduction into the dance community he has played with the likes of deejays John Kelley, Jesse Brooks, Cor Fijneman, Antonio Arebalo, Kazell, Mark Tabberner, Thee-O, Jethro, Ray Mack, SIM_01, Johan Nillson a.k.a. Irish, Ciacomix, Mike Hunter, Andrew Muchmore, Eve Falcon, Jason Blum, Garrett S, Austin Scott, Kris B, Pat Schoolastra, Tony Gamboa, Verdugo Brothers, GT, Project C, Junior Chavez, Kent Christian, Tigo, Labelwhore, D-Frag, Adam Carver, Jonathan Morning, Brian Bartel, &amp; Iss.</em></p>
<p><em>Currently LRCN has two active internet radio shows on two different internet radio stations. The first is called &#8216;Four4&#8242; and it airs on AfterhoursDJs.org every Saturday from 12:00 PM PST to 4:00 PM PST. LRCN is considered one of the original founders of this community, which began as an off-shoot of the Digitally Imported Radio community. The second show is called &#8216;The Bidness&#8217; and it airs on DI.FM every 2nd Tuesday of the month from 11:00 AM PST to 2 PM PST. LRCN used to host another show on AfterhoursDJs.org called &#8217;4&#215;4 101&#8242; but decided to end it at show #100.</em></p>
<p><em>LRCN is also a Co-Director of Digitally Imported Radio&#8217;s Progressive Channel. As a Co-Director his duties include acquiring new content for the channel, scheduling shows in the calendar, reviewing submissions, &amp; moderating the forum.</em></p>

<p>This last Thursday, I opened up for Max Cheddar  and special guest Jeff Bomb at the Wildcat Lounge in Santa Barbara. Then on Friday I headed down to Hollywood to play at a party called Incognito, which was held at Boardner&#8217;s. I played in the main room opening up for Kris B. Both gigs totally blew out my ears pretty bad. That is why I wasn&#8217;t able to record and put up a new mix on the podcast sooner. I usually record late Sunday nights and have everything up by Monday morning. I had to let my ears heal some from all the damage I caused with the 2 gigs.</p>
<p>I finally got the new mix done. This one is mostly in the style of deep house. I had a chaotic past couple of days and just wanted to put together a mix that I could chill out to. I like the songs a lot and I like the flow of the mix as well. I think this mix makes for some good baby-making music. I wouldn&#8217;t doubt if 9 months from now I get a bunch of emails from people telling me that they got down to my mix and just had a kid! Haha. But seriously, the music in this one is sexy and really chill. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>I want to apologize again for not following through with Part 2 of Episode 04 as promised with a guest mix from Thee-o (Biohazard Digital, System Recordings). As I said before, he never sent me his mix. Sad face. I will try to reschedule him for a guest mix on the podcast in the near future. Hang on tight!</p>
<p>Moving forward! I am slapping you in the face with a fresh off the decks episode 05. This mix consists of tech house + minimal + techno. I used some old tracks that I have been waiting a long time to play. I also used some tracks that I found for free on google by searching for different artists and including the word &#8216;zshare&#8217;. I found a ton of free tracks this way. New and old. I found a lot of stuff that isn&#8217;t even available on beatport.com yet! Great trick! Try it sometime. Ok ok&#8230;back on topic. So I used some older stuff I have had for a while, some free tracks I found through google/zshare, and I also picked up some new stuff on beatport.com to tie all the stuff together. I am going to continue bringing fresh mixes every single week, and with no songs repeated! Every mix will show you my neverending influences. From the different genres of electronic dance music, to different producers from all over the world. When I set out to record a new mix, I try to capture whatever sounds I am feeling the most at that very moment. I hope you enjoy episode 05 of the Savage Methods Podcast.</p>

<p>I have a gig this Saturday at a rave. This will be my first time playing at a rave. It is called Binary History and I will be playing in the VIP area. I heard a rumor that they lost the location and were scrambling to find a new venue for the party. I hope that I am still able to play. Locally, I don&#8217;t play at the Wildcat until next week on Thursday. I will be playing along with Max Cheddar and special guest Jeff Bomb. I will be going back to LA next weekend on Friday May 18 to kick off the Incognito party at Boardner&#8217;s. I will be opening up for Kris B. Some exciting stuff coming up for me in my &#8220;DJ career.&#8221; I really wish I could have the opportunity to travel more doing this.</p>
<p>For this episode of the Savage Methods Podcast, I put together a mix that I think best defines my main style at the moment. This mix is a blend of deep/tech/electro house. I finally got around to using some tracks I had been sitting on for a while. I also came across some older tracks that tickled my fancy, and as always I dove in one the new releases that I wanted to put my stamp on. I have decided that I am going to try using tracks once per episode of the podcast, that way I can expose all this beautiful music to you listeners. Thanks for checking out my little corner of the world wide web. I promise that each new episode will keep getting better and better, and I will work hard at getting awesome guest mixers to contribute exlusive mixes.</p>

<p>For part 2 of this episode of the Savage Methods Podcast, I have a guest mix from Chicago&#8217;s Brian Triniti (briantriniti.com, Dry Waxx Muzik). He brings the heat in this mix dropping some of the hottest electro bombs out there today. I am very honored to have Brian Triniti on the Savage Methods Podcast.</p>
<p>Here is the bio from his website (briantriniti.com):</p>
<p><em>Within five short years, Brian Triniti has traveled to cities such as Los Angeles California, Las Vegas Nevada, and Miami Florida, to play along side of such talent as Green Velvet, Diesel boy, Danny the Wild Child, DJ Bam Bam, Alex Peace, Judge Jules, Robbie Rivera, Dj Irene, Dj Funk and many more. With a unique style of House and Techno, he is sure to move a crowd. </em><em>Brian has held residencies at some of the finest Chicago Clubs such as Chromium, Rive Gauche, Spybar and Zentra. Being a Chicago native, he is inspired by the legendary Bad Boy Bill. In 2004, Brian and Tony Cocco partnered up in Distorted Muzik, a record label company with a DJ focus which has promoted several artists and gained recognition worldwide with some of the top producers and DJs. Becoming a part of Distorted Muzik was a big step in his career. The roster was unbelievable and many accomplishments were achieved.</em><em>In April of 2006, Brian left Distorted Muzik to pursue his own record label and new establishment, Dry Waxx Muzik. When Brian is not DJing hes working in the studio which he likes to call Dry Waxx Studios, a project that he started in 2003. Dry Waxx Studios has been home to numerous mix compilation CDs and cutting-edge tracks.</em><em>In March of 2005, Triniti competed against worldwide DJs in the Winter Music Conference Spin Off, only to win first place. The prize was a sponsorship from Behringer thus becoming a power user of the newest top DJ/Production gear. Returning back to WMC in 2006 to defend his title, Brian walked away once again on top to win first place. This time, rewarded with brand new Mackie and Ortofon gear.</em><em>Future projects include getting DRY WAXX MUZIK launched in the Fall of 2006 with the first release being &#8220;Feel My Synth&#8221; among working in the studio and creating big room hits.</em></p>

&#8220;Ya want curly fries with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>I just turned 25 years old and spent pretty much the entire week partying. We kicked off the festivities on Wednesday evening at Z&#8217;s Taphouse. I drank like a fish which resulted in me puking several times once I got home. I felt like death on Thursday but managed to suck it up. We partied at the Wildcat Lounge to the sounds of Vittorio, Calvin Riley, and special guest Nigel Richards. My group and I were partying VIP style with 2 bottles of Grey Goose. I don&#8217;t know how I managed to survive that night. Then I DJ&#8217;ed a house party on Friday night for a little bit before heading out downtown for a few drinks. I went down to LA for Giant @ Vanguard to catch my buddies Max Cheddar spinning in the VIP room. Kristina Sky and Judge Jules were in the main room. A whole lot of partying in such a short amount of time. Good thing I made it out alive. You only live once&#8230;I am now a quarter-century old. Anyway, all this partying left me quite pooped and it was fairly difficult to have the concentration necessary to record a proper mix. I gave it my best shot and did my first all jackin&#8217; house mix. 60 minutes of some of the top jackin&#8217; house tracks at the moment. Enjoy!</p>

Anyway, all this partying left me quite pooped and it was fairly difficult to have the concentration necessary to record a proper mix. I gave it my best shot and did my first all jackin\' house mix. 60 minutes of some of the top jackin\' house tracks at the moment. I recently added this style of music to my repertoire. Enjoy!

This is the tracklist for the mix:
01. Lucas Keizer - Nitty Gritty (Sound Navigators Eat Your Grits Mix)
02. Troydon - Shake That Groove Thing (Sound Republic White Ninja Remix)
03. Cosy Creatures - Show You The Way (Sound Republics Midwest Warehouse Mix)
04. Francis Jilla  Johnny Drama - Just Another Boot
05. Style of Eye  Lil Mark - U Want (Style of Eye Bump Dub)
06. Matthew Brian, Alan Alda - Round Girls (Dirty Deep Peeps Bus Stop Dub)
07. d-t3ch - Chicago Soul (Jason Hodges Digital Exclusive Mix)
08. Joshua Reynolds - Drama (Sound Republics Romantic Comedy Mix)
09. Oriental Funk Stew  Olivier Desmet - Simple Things (Sound Republics STDisco Mix)
10. Pushin Boundaries - Keep it Goin (Ricardo Raes Bump n Wiggy Remix)
11. Sexual Chocolate - Dat Bump
12. Swirl People - The Greatest Time
13. Bryan Jones - No Doubt
14. Olivier Desmet  Chuck Diesel - Gary\'s Groove
15. White Collar Criminals - Ive Said Enough

<strong>CHRISTIAN MARTIN (Dirtybird Records)</strong></p>
<p>I spent this last weekend in San Francisco checking out the Dirtybird parties. Friday night we hit up Shine to see Christian Martin, Worthy, and Justin Martin. Later that night we hit up an afterparty and saw Justin Martin spin. We spent the following day at Golden Gate Park checking out the infamous Dirtybird BBQ. We were treated to some great food, free flowing alcohol, and the best beats on the planet. There we got to hear Christian Martin, Worthy, Tanner Ross, and Justin Martin tear it up on the decks in the rain. There was a great turnout at the BBQ despite the rain. Everybody was dancing in the mud without a care in the world. This was one of the best parties I have ever been to.</p>
<p>I got to chat it up with all the dj&#8217;s, and I&#8217;ve got an exclusive mix from Christian Martin from Dirtybird Records. I am very honored to have the opportunity to feature this mix on my podcast. Christian is one half of The Martin Brothers, who gave us &#8220;Stoopit&#8221; and &#8220;Venus Fly Trap&#8221;, two amazing pieces of work that heat up the dancefloors everytime they are dropped.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some exciting new releases coming out on Dirtybird Records in the near future, so keep an eye out and make sure to support these guys.</p>

<p>This last weekend was insane!!! It all started with me opening up for Justin Martin (Dirtybird, Om) on Thursday at the Wildcat Lounge. Wildcat once again experienced another night of the most awesome music ever heard in Santa Barbara from start to finish. I got to hang out with Justin the whole night. That fool can party! We went to Jack in the Box after the club and then attempted to hit up an afterparty that was nonexistent. Then that was pretty much the end of that adventure.</p>
<p>But then Friday afternoon I took off to SF with my girl, Mando &amp; his girl. We were gonna hit up the Dirtybird parties all weekend long. We get to our hotel and Oh Man that thing was ghetto. Bad choice on my part. Ooops. We settle down, later get some food, and then pre-party before heading out to Shine. At Shine we saw Christian Martin, Worthy, and Justin Martin all throw down on the decks. We heard a ton of new shit!!! Then after Shine, we hit up an afterparty in what looked like an abandoned warehouse. We got to see a bit of Justin Martin&#8217;s set before the cops shut the party down. Back to the hotel we went.</p>
<p>We were super hungover Saturday and managed to crawl out of bed and get ready to head over to Golden Gate Park for the Dirtybird BBQ. We get there and we see the dj setup on the grass, and tons of booze and food. We got to see Worthy, Tanner Ross (aka Bald &amp; The Beautiful), Christian Martin, and Justin Martin spin. It started raining and everyone stayed. I got to experience one of the most awesome vibes ever. I heard so much bad ass new music that totally owned my life. I got to know all the dj&#8217;s that played. I have never drank+ate+danced so much at one party before. I&#8217;ll upload some pics/videos later.</p>
<p>Thursday through Saturday consisted of some of the best music I have ever heard. That shit changed my life forever. I decided to record a mix that sort of reminded me of the crazyness I experienced in the past couple of days. In this mix I threw in some of the tracks that I heard throughout the weekend, along with some older tracks I really like, and some brand new stuff I just picked up. This mix consists mostly of minimal and techno. It is harder than what I normally play, and is definitely not something I would get the chance to play in the club. I was planning on only mixing the first 10 tracks, but once I got going I couldn&#8217;t stop. I recorded this mix with a really bad sinus infection so please don&#8217;t be too harsh on the mixing. Haha.</p>

<strong>DJ HOGG (sbtherapy)</strong></p>
<p>Here is Part 2 of Episode 01 of the Savage Methods Podcast. This guest mix comes from fellow sbtherapy resident DJ Hogg (www.myspace.com/djhogg). The style of this mix is funky/jackin/tech house.

I love this style a lot and I have recently started spinning it out. I&#8217;ve learned so much from DJ Hogg and it is an honor to have him do a guest mix for my podcast. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Well here it is, Episode 1 (Part 1) of the Savage Methods Podcast is finally here. This mix originally aired this past Saturday on the Four4 online radio show on Afterhoursdjs.org hosted by LRCN. It is a blend of Tech house + minimal techno + electro house. I like to touch upon the different genres that I like in my sets. This mix is a perfect example of how I do just that and bring it all together.</p>

<p>I was a guest mixer on LRCN’s show called Four4 on Afterhoursdjs.org. The show is every Saturday from 12-4pm PST. The style of the mix I submitted was tech house + minimal techno + electro house. Deadly combination, or should I say, SAVAGE combination! This was my 2nd appearance on Four4 (it used to go by the name 4×4 101) as the guest mixer. Maybe next time I will mix live in the studio. Thanks for tuning in if you happened to catch it when it was aired live. I will be posting this same mix as the 1st episode of the Savage Methods Podcast that launches Monday. Check back here on Monday so you could download the mix. Word.</p>
