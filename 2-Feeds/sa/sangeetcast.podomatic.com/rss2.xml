      <title>Sangeetkaar Madan Mohan</title>
      <description>Madan Mohan is undisputably the Ghazal king of Hindi film music. But composing Ghazals was just one of his expertise. Be it the shokh 'jhumakaa giraa re' or the poignant 'tuu jahaa.N jahaa.N chalegaa', his mastery was at full display in a wide genre of songs. The lyrical excellence of most of his songs also betrays his good understanding of poetry. The evergreen melodious nature of his compositions ensured that 'Veer Zaara' - an album of his compositions released long after his death - was liked by all.

This podcast tries to take a look at his work. Your opinions and comments are welcome.</description>
