Here's what past celebrity Challengers think of the uROk 33 Day Challenge:

&#8216;Testimonials&#8217; for The uROk&#174; 33 day challengeTuesday 11 September 2007

Dr Linda Radford Health specialist, writer

Firstly, what the challenge is....I believe it is a commitment to really, honestly examine all areas of your life, what you are giving people are the tools to organise their own thoughts rather than some one else&#8217;s philosophies. 

This means that urok works with you to find the best you not to mould you into some dogma. Secondly while urok gives you the means we must make the commitment to do the actions, you can't just read the challenge you have to do the challenge! You have to act; you have to write things down, say your mantras and record your actions and feelings.  Finally the concept of integrating all facets of your life.  

We all know that successful businesses are based on principals of research, examination, reasoning and analysis and imagination and creation but very few of us ever consider applying this to our personal and emotional life. 

Wow- the urok 33 day challenge is Deepak Chopra meets Bill Gates what a fantastic marriage of spiritual purpose with good business practice!

I&#8217;ve done the wheel 3 times so far, and look forward to doing it again and again. The wheel has helped me to achieve great things in work, and health - 2 areas I sometimes find hard to focus on. 

Last year I did the wheel and set myself the goal of completing the Hajj by the end of the year. I was fortunate enough to have completed this pilgrimage last December.

The wheel is an outstanding way of setting goals, listing achievements, and bringing order to one's daily routine. It forces you to focus on your objectives in each of the areas, which can be often hard to do without such a tool, &#8216;The Challenge&#8217; gives you direction.

Kira Llewellyn Australia's NO 1 Female Body Boarder (Currently Ranked World No 4th)

When I started my 33 day challenge on Thursday 10 2007 I was in great need of direction and positive energy. I did my personal inventory on the uROk.tv website and found I had flat spots in my create, work, self and most definitely in my wealth!!! 

I was very excited when I started my personal wheel to be writing goal statements, feeling focused, relaxing to my guided visualisation cd and learning how to be happy and grateful for my life. This helped bring awareness to the 6 major factors: (CREATE, WORK, LOVE, SELF, WEALTH, HEALTH) in my life which I never focused on trying to balance before. Within 1 week I could happily say I was already noticing positive changes in my thinking, speaking and doing. I had a visual of who I am, where I&#8217;m heading and what I want out of my Life. 

The challenge helped me to really think about my core values in life and to appreciate even the small achievements I make in a day with gratitude and celebration. Half way through the challenge the amazing amount of coincidences was beginning to make me realise just how magical the power of attraction can be!!! 

On completion of my first challenge, I have never felt better and I&#8217;m ready for my next 33 day challenge. Those flat spots from my personal Inventory are now building to be strengths in my everyday life. 

Thanks to uROk!!!!

Have you ever been to that point in your life where you feel that the universe has stripped you of everything? I was there a week before Christmas. After a particularly trying couple of years swimming against the tide&#8230;intrinsically I knew it had to turn, god help me it couldn&#8217;t possibly get worse! Or could it? Instead I was hit by a tsunami. T

here I was Christmas 2006, no job, no-where to live and no money!The only thing that kept me going at this point apart from my wonderful friends and family was a book I had just written &#8216;Slapped by an Angel&#8217; due for release Valentines Day 2007. I knew that I had to give this my best shot and that meant there had to be a shift in me. My energy, my attitude. 

A week later I started my 33 day challenge. Even after the first couple of days I was feeling better within myself. I was starting to feel hope again. By the 8th day my energy had shifted and I knew I was going to get through it. By the time I had finished my challenge we had confirmed interviews on A Current Affair and The Today Show, two of my major goals. Many other things happened that are just too hard to articulate&#8230;whether they were feelings, instances of serendipity or just a knowing that I was on path. 

The funny thing was I already knew about the Law of Attraction. I knew that everything we think and feel we manifest, but sometimes we just need someone to hold our hand. I am now onto my second urok 33 day challenge and I think it is something that I will incorporate into my days, just like cleaning my teeth. 

It keeps me focused, on track and gives me the clarity I need to achieve my dreams!

Having been a person who never set goals, I&#8217;ll admit I was a bit nervous when I was invited to do The uROk 33day Challenge &#8216;having to commit to something was daunting in itself&#8217;. 

After a couple of months however, I saw what The Challenge had done for some of my friends, and I thought &quot;O.K I'm ready to do this now&quot; (also while thinking &#8216;I want a bit of what they&#8217;re having&#8217;!)

After the 2nd week I stopped thinking so hard as to whether I was writing the correct things and let my thoughts come to me, as soon as I started doing this everything started happening for me. A new place to live with a fantastic new flatmate, extra compare work, a new promotions job, amazing new people coming into my life, plus loads of other amazing personal goals were being achieved. 

I am now able to control my thoughts and keep those thoughts positive. The more excited and positive I was about The Challenge, the more exciting and positive things came to me.When I speak about uROk.tv, I speak with such passion, as I want everyone else to get their life Roking!

I'd like to thank the uROk team for giving me the opportunity to be one of the 1st (of millions I'm sure) to do The uROk 33 day Challenge.

uROk big time!
