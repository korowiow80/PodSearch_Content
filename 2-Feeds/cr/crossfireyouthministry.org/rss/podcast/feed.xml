				<h2 class="title"><span>I’ve Come Too Far To Look Back (Part II)</span></h2>
				<p>Philippians 3:13-14 – &ldquo;Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended <em>(in effect, repeats what he said in the previous Verse)</em>:  but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind <em>(refers to things the Apostle had depended upon to find favor with God, and the failure that type of effort brought about [3:5-6])</em>, reaching forth unto those things which are <em>before (all our attention must be on that which is ahead, and not on what is past; &lsquo;those things&rsquo; consists of all the victories of the Cross)</em>,<br />
       <br />
  &ldquo;I press toward the mark <em>(this represents a moral and Spiritual target)</em> for the prize of the high calling of God <em>(Christlikeness)</em> in Christ Jesus <em>(proclaims the manner and means in which all of this is done, which is the Cross [I Cor. 1:17-18; 2:2])</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is an old saying, <em>&ldquo;hindsight is always 20/20,&rdquo;</em> meaning that if you knew then what you know now, certain things could have been avoided in the past.  We must realize that Satan is a master at bringing up something that is under the Blood of Christ, if that person has asked for forgiveness, and constantly beating us up with past mistakes, raining condemnation down upon us.  He constantly seeks to drag up the past of the Believer, and tries to steer the Believer to quit based upon his past.  And when the Devil tries to bring up the past, you must remind yourself of this one thing, <em>&ldquo;the Christian has no past, and the Devil has no future.&rdquo;</em>  What does this all mean?  Simply put, if the Believer has brought their sin unto the Lord, and has asked His forgiveness, then God not only forgives, but He tosses that failure into the Sea of His Forgetfulness, which means He does not remember the past, He only remembers the Blood of Christ that has washed and made clean.  As we have stated before, you must realize that God forgives us on the basis of the Finished Work of Christ, and our Faith in that Finished Work.  He cannot forgive on any other basis, only the Shed Blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>HOW DARE WE DRAG UP THE PAST OF A FELLOW CHRISTIAN!</h6>
<p></p>
<p>However, the Devil is not the only one that likes to drag up the past of the Believer, but unfortunately, most Christians love to drag up the past of the Believer as well, and take great pride in doing so.  How evil it is for someone to drag something up that the Lord has forgiven!  If the Christian who has failed has asked the Lord to forgive them, then we as Christians must be the first ones to welcome that Believer back into the fold.  Jesus brought this up in Matthew 6:14-15, when He said, <em>&ldquo;For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you:  But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you.&rdquo;</em>  Now those are strong words indeed.  We all need the Heavenly Father to forgive us, but if we do not forgive others, then how can He forgive us?  The Bible is full of people who had failed the Lord, and some were catastrophic failures, but if that person asked the Lord to forgive them, then they are forgiven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>I CAN DO WHAT I WANT!</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Now, some would say, <em>&ldquo;Then this means that I can do whatever I want to do, and all I have to do is ask the Lord to forgive me.&rdquo;</em>  No!  We must not be so foolish.  Paul said in Romans 6:1-2, <em>&ldquo;What shall we say then?  Shall we continue in sin that Grace may abound?  God forbid.  How shall we, who are dead to sin, live any longer therein?&rdquo;</em>  In other words, we do not sin because Grace covers it.  If we are a Child of God, our desire is to please God, and not fail Him.  We must ever strive to please the Lord in everything that we do, and we must strive to not fail Him in any capacity.  But, as humans, we sometimes fail, and we fail big time!  And as fellow Believers, we must not continually drag up that past of an individual, if that person has asked the Lord to forgive them, then we must forgive them as well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Too many Christians live in the realm of <em>&ldquo;what might have been.&rdquo;</em>  But God never works from that perspective, He only works with <em>&ldquo;what is.&rdquo;</em>  Sin has an awful attachment to it, and we must suffer the consequences of our actions, but God still works from <em>&ldquo;what is.&rdquo;</em>  We are all burnt stones, for we <em>&ldquo;all have sinned&rdquo;</em> and are constantly <em>&ldquo;coming short of the Glory of God&rdquo;</em> (Rom. 3:23).  But this is the Story of the Gospel.  How that man failed God, and made a royal mess of things, and how that God became flesh, to do for us what we could not do for ourselves, redeem us.  God worked from <em>&ldquo;what is,&rdquo;</em> and not <em>&ldquo;what might have been.&rdquo;</em>  Thanks to God for that.  If God only worked from <em>&ldquo;what might have been,&rdquo;</em> then He could not work with any of us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>REACHING FORWARD</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Paul would now tell us that even though he has not apprehended yet, there is one thing that he will do, and that is <em>&ldquo;reaching forth unto those things which are before.&rdquo;</em>  The Believer cannot reach forward if he is constantly looking back.  Irrespective of what has happened in the past, <em>&ldquo;those things&rdquo;</em> are still ahead, and are still attainable.  There are always going to be things that try to keep us down, which we are ashamed of, but we must not allow those things to stop us from reaching forward.  Man does not have the final say, God does.  And if God is not through with you yet, then who is man to say that He is?  God has the final say, and if He will not give up on us, then we must not give up on Him.  In other words, God can take our wrong, put it into His Right, and make everything all right!  Praise God!  If you will look to Him, believe in Him, trust Him, and pick yourself up, then He will help you up. <br />

We must never listen to the doubters and unbelievers, and even many Believers, when they tell us that we have too many bad things, and the Lord can never forgive us.  Do not listen to them at all, for it&rsquo;s not what man says, it&rsquo;s what God says!  It&rsquo;s not what others do, it&rsquo;s what God does!  And most importantly, it&rsquo;s not what man thinks, it&rsquo;s what God knows!  No matter what has happened in your life, you must continually look to the Cross of Christ, for it is the Cross of Christ that brings forth our Redemption, forgiveness of sin, and the Restoration of our soul.  You must realize that you are here, not because of what some person has to say, but you are here because of what God knows.  As someone has well said, <em>&ldquo;What do we do when we fail the Lord?  We fall back on the Cross!&rdquo;</em>  Amen!  We fall back on the Cross, for it is through the Cross of Christ, and our Faith in that Finished Work, which allows the Holy Spirit the ability to Work on our behalf, that guarantees our Victory!  Keep reaching forward, and when the Devil comes to you and tries to bring up your past, you tell him that &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come too far to look back now!&rdquo;  </p>
<p>In Him,<br />

				<h2 class="title"><span>I&#8217;ve Come Too Far to Look Back</span></h2>
				<p><strong>Philippians 3:13-14 </strong>– &ldquo;Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended:  but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind <em>(refers to things the Apostle had depended upon to find favor with God, and the failure that type of effort brought about [3:5-6])</em>, reaching forth unto those things which are before <em>(all our attention must be on that which is ahead, and not on what is past; &lsquo;those things&rsquo; consists of all the victories of the Cross)</em>,<br />
       <br />
  &ldquo;I press toward the mark <em>(this represents a moral and Spiritual target)</em> for the prize of the high calling of God <em>(Christlikeness)</em> in Christ Jesus <em>(proclaims the manner and means in which all of this is done, which is the Cross [I Cor. 1:17-18; 2:2])</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the Ministry of Paul the Apostle, there were many at that time who believed that they had achieved, what is known now as, <em>&ldquo;sinless perfection.&rdquo;</em>  This means that they believed they were now at a stage in their lives where they were perfect, with no sin in their lives whatsoever.  Of course, we know now that there is no such thing as <em>&ldquo;sinless perfection,&rdquo;</em> and that the Only Person that has ever lived that was/is Perfect is Christ.  We were born in the state of original sin (Ps. 51:5), due to the Fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden.  As well, the Sin Nature controls every unsaved person, which is that inner bent towards that which is against God. <br />
       <br />
  However, when we accept Jesus Christ, and His Way, His precious Blood washes and cleanses us from every stain, past, present, and future.  At that same time, the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Christ, where our old man has been crucified with Christ, and a new man has been resurrected in Newness of Life (Rom. 6:3-5), and because we are now in Christ, God looks at us as being perfect.  Now, we must qualify this statement.  We are not perfect based upon our good works, or upon what we have accomplished, but God sees us as perfect because we are <em>&ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo;</em>  Christ is the Perfect One, and since we are in Him, God looks at us as perfect.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;I Count Not Myself to Have Apprehended&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>Now, Paul would address this situation of sinless perfection in this Chapter, and he would tell these individuals believing this, <em>&ldquo;Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended,&rdquo;</em> meaning that I have not made it yet, or I have not attained yet.  What he is saying is summed up in the previous Verse, <em>&ldquo;. . . if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus,&rdquo;</em> which speaks of Paul ever pursuing to be like Christ.  In fact, the word <em>&ldquo;apprehend,&rdquo;</em> means <em>&ldquo;attained,&rdquo;</em> but it has a little more meaning than just being <em>&ldquo;attained.&rdquo;</em>  It has the idea that when a football player wants to catch hold of his man, he not only wants to catch the man with the ball, but he also wants to pull him down.  Likewise, Paul wants to make Christ his own, just as Christ caught Paul and made Paul His Own.  To sum it up this way, we were not Saved only so we could miss Hell, but we were Saved to be made in the Image of Christ.  We must never forget that.  We were Saved to be conformed into this Image of Christ. </p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Being Made Conformable Unto His Death&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>Paul would say, <em>&ldquo;That I may know Him, and the Power of His Resurrection, and the fellowship of His Sufferings, being made conformable unto His Death&rdquo;</em> (Phil. 3:10).  What Paul is saying here is that we are to conform to what Jesus did at that Cross and the Resurrection, not trying to do this ourselves, for we simply cannot.  We are to accept the fact that He did this for us, not for Himself, for we could not save ourselves, and neither can we make ourselves Holy and Righteous by means of our works.  We are to stop trying to do this ourselves and accept the fact that He did this for us, and we are to conform to His Plan, His Purpose, and His Path.<br />
       <br />
  Let us say it again, we cannot attain a place of spiritual perfection based upon our own works, for if we try to attain this by what we do, we are placing ourselves in a position of self-righteousness.  Trusting in our works and trusting in our own doings automatically places us in a position of self-righteousness, which means that we become righteous through what we do.  If that is the case, then what Paul is saying here is useless, meaningless, and an outright lie.  However, we know that this is not the case, and that we have not come to the place of attaining this perfection, but we are striving everyday to be more like Christ.  This is what Paul is saying here, <em>&ldquo;I may not be there now, but that will not stop me from doing what I can to be more like Christ.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>His Death Equals Our Victory</strong></p>
<p>Now, many know that we must be made conformable unto His Death for Salvation, but many do not understand what that means in regards to our everyday life and living.  We must understand that Paul here is not talking about our Salvation, but he is talking about Sanctification, which is our everyday life and living.  Everything that we receive from God, everything barring none, is wrapped up in the Crucifixion of Christ.  Everything!  That means our Salvation, our Healing, our Deliverance, our Baptism with the Holy Spirit with the Evidence of speaking with other Tongues, and every Blessing, has come to us on the basis of what Christ did for us at Calvary.  In other words, His Death equals our Victory!  I feel the Presence of God even as I write these words, His Death equals our Victory!  Hallelujah!  Praise God!  You must get this into your spirit, His Death equals our Victory! <br />
       <br />
  What He did at the Cross was so powerful, so magnificent that through His Death, He broke every shackle and chain that kept us in captivity to Satan.  That problem, which has kept us bound, has been totally and completely defeated through His Death!  That means that there is no problem that He did not conquer at Calvary!  There is no struggle that He did not defeat at Calvary!  As the song writer wrote many years ago, <em>&ldquo;Burdens are lifted at Calvary, Jesus is very near!&rdquo;</em>  <br />
       <br />
  Our Victory is found totally in Christ and what He did at the Cross, and we must look to that Finished Work on a daily basis for us to be <em>&ldquo;conformed unto His Death.&rdquo;</em>  We are to place our Faith in the Cross of Christ exclusively, which allows the Holy Spirit to Work in our lives to take out the bad, and put in the good.  The only way that we are to apprehend the victory needed in this life, is by reaching out to what Christ did at the Cross, and we are guaranteed that His Victory will become our Victory!</p>

				<h2 class="title"><span>The True Biblical Basis for Music in the Church</span></h2>
				<p>What I am about to write is not merely my opinion, but rather is based upon the Word of Almighty God.  Everything that we do must be based solely upon the Bible, and not left into our own hands.  Many will say that the following is my personal opinion, but I want to be perfectly clear, that this is <u>not</u> my opinion, but it is what the Bible says.</p>
<p>  As it regards the topic of &ldquo;Christian Rap/Rock/Punk/Metal/Alternative&rdquo; etc., I want to say the following.</p>
<p>  These types of music were inspired by demon spirits, and because of such, you&nbsp;CANNOT take that which is inspired by demon spirits, attach the Name Jesus to it, and make it right.  When David played before Saul, the Bible tells us that it was the music that drove the evil spirits away.  It was David&rsquo;s music that was <u>anointed</u> by the Holy Spirit, which drove the evil spirits away.  There is no anointing behind &ldquo;Christian Rap&rdquo; or &ldquo;Christian Rock.&rdquo;  Rap music, or the basis of Rap music, as well as Rock,&nbsp;is inspired by demon spirits.  You cannot take that which is of the world and put Jesus&rsquo; Name to it and make it Holy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h6><strong>BECOMING ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN</strong></h6>
<p></p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;I become all things to all men&rdquo; (I Cor. 9:22), but that does not mean that we are to be like the world to WIN the world.  What that means is, we simply preach Jesus Christ and Him Crucified to&nbsp;ALL men; Jew, Greek, Gentile, black, white, red, yellow, brown, Saved and unsaved.  Likewise, we do not become alcoholics to reach the alcoholics.  Nor do we become drug addicts to reach the drug addicts.  Many have used this Passage of Scripture to justify their actions as to why they have allowed worldly methods into the Church.  They believe that they have to become like the world to win the world with ungodly music.  Let&rsquo;s be perfectly honest, not many, if any at all, truly get Saved by these types of methods, and the reason is that these methods are not inspired, or anointed by the Holy Spirit to do such.  People are won to the Lord by the Preaching of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ &#8212; plain and simple!  When the Gospel is being preached under the Anointing of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will begin to Move upon the hearts of the people to convict them of their sin, thus being the turning point to bring them to Christ.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h6><strong>WE ARE IN THE WORLD, BUT NOT OF THE WORLD</strong></h6>
<p></p>
<p>Also, the Holy Spirit through Paul said, &ldquo;Wherefore come out from among them, and be you separate, SAYS THE LORD&rdquo; (II Cor. 6:17).  That is clear, cut, and precise.  We are <u>IN</u> this world, but not <u>OF</u> this world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice the wording that the Holy Spirit uses in this Passage of Scripture.  The Holy Spirit through Paul tells us to, &ldquo;Come out.&rdquo;  What does this mean?  It simply means to get out, or to escape, or depart.  When the Lord saves us, He saves us <u>OUT</u> of sin, and places us <u>IN</u> Christ.  He never saves us in sin, but saves us out of sin.  And because He saves us out of sin, He definitely does not want us to go back into that lifestyle.  So, to try and use the methods of the world to try and win the world will not work, for this very reason that is mentioned above. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h6><strong>BIBLICAL BASIS FOR MUSIC</strong></h6>
<p></p>
<p>As Believer&rsquo;s, when it comes to music, there is a Biblical basis to which we should adhere to, and that is simply the Anointing of the Holy Spirit.  We need to get past the idea of whether or not it&rsquo;s this style or that style, and we must focus on the idea of whether or not it is Anointed of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>  Now, to clarify, the Anointing of the Holy Spirit is not emotionalism.  Many mistake emotionalism for the Moving of the Holy Spirit.  However, when the Holy Spirit is Moving upon a singer, or a piece of music, it will generate a response from the Believer, or unbeliever, whether it be weeping, laughing, shouting, dancing, or just being still.</p>
<p>We must understand that nearly every piece of music is either Anointed by the Holy Spirit, or it is anointed by demon spirits. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h6><strong>HOW CAN WE TELL?</strong></h6>
<p></p>
<p>You may ask, &ldquo;How can we tell?&rdquo;  First of all, we can tell by simply asking the following questions:  &ldquo;Is this pleasing to the Lord?  Will that music lead us into the very Presence of God?  Will this music cause a Believer who is facing the very powers of darkness to have Victory?&rdquo;  Music Anointed by the Holy Spirit will usher in the Presence of God, and will bring conviction to the lost, and rejoicing to the Saved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  As well, we should never isolate music at all to say that whatever type of music that you like will not reach the youth, or maybe that the adults will never &ldquo;get it.&rdquo;  Music that is Anointed by the Holy Spirit will reach ALL age groups, and will minister to ALL age groups.  The Word of God is never isolated to one specific age group, and will never be isolated to one age group.  But, once again, we should not compromise our stance because it is popular with the world, or even with much of the Church.</p>
<p>  Much of the Church world will laugh at this response and say that we are not up with today&rsquo;s crowd, or that we are just too &ldquo;old-fashioned.&rdquo;  Well, I will close with what the Holy Spirit said through the Prophet Jeremiah, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD, Stand you in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls.&rdquo;  But here is where the modern church is, and is found in the last phrase of that Verse, &ldquo;But they said, We will not walk therein&rdquo; (Jer. 6:16).</p>
<p>Talent will only titillate you, but the Anointing will set you free.  The Lord is drawing the line in the sand through His Word.  Which side are you going to be on?</p>

				<h2 class="title"><span>The Great Commission</span></h2>
				<p><strong>I felt the need to republish this Article, which is from the December, 2011, Evangelist magazine, because of the importance of it.  Youth Pastors, you need to gather your youth that is in your Church, and gather them around the television, Internet, or even radio, and tune in to the Crossfire Services that are aired every Thursday night at 7 p.m., (CST) on SonLife Broadcasting Network.  Crossfire needs your support to bring the Message of the Cross to the youth of this world.</strong></p>
<p>Mark 16:15 – <em>“And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world</em> (the Gospel of Christ is not merely a western Gospel, as some claim, but is for the entirety of the world<em>), and preach the Gospel to every creature</em> (‘preaching’ is God’s method, as is here plainly obvious; as well, it is imperative that every single person have the opportunity to hear; this is the responsibility of every Believer)<em>.”</em></p>
<p>This Verse that I will be using as my Text for this article is known as <em>“The Great Commission,”</em> in that it was given by the Lord Jesus Christ to all who are His Followers, with the sole purpose being that of World Evangelism.  In fact, World Evangelism is the very heartbeat of this Youth Ministry.  God has Called Crossfire Youth Ministries to reach the four corners of this globe, and by the help and Grace of the Lord, we will do it.  As many of you know, we are living in uncertain times.  This beloved Nation of ours is in a mess, Spiritually speaking, and it will not get any better until the Lord comes back, bringing His Heavenly Headquarters down from Planet Heaven to Planet Earth, and then all the Earth will be changed back to its rightful and original state.  But until then, we must be about our Father’s Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>HOW CAN I HELP FULFILL THE GREAT COMMISSION?</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I answer that question, I would like to share something with you that has become a priority in my Ministry.  As many of you know, I am the Youth Pastor of Crossfire Youth Ministries, and have been so for the last nine years.  God has given me a burden for our youth, a tremendous burden at that.  My calling is to see as many young people brought out of spiritual darkness into the Light, which is Christ.  As well, my calling is to see as many young people delivered from the bondages of Satan, which are many, and to see them baptized with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking with other Tongues.  And God has given Crossfire an opportunity to share the Message of the Cross over television, radio, and over the Internet and, in fact, reaching all over the world.</p>
<p>Which leads me to say this:  Everywhere I travel, in regards to meetings held all over the country, I always inquire of the Pastor of their youth program that is being held at that local body.  To my shock, many Pastors are completely honest with me and tell me that they really don’t have much of a youth program at their Church, simply because they can’t either afford to hire a full-time Youth Pastor, or they have no one that will step up and volunteer to help with the youth.  I heard someone say not too long ago that the youth is not the Church of tomorrow, but rather is the Church of today.  That struck me to the core, for that is a very true statement, and when the local congregation passes on due to age, in most cases, that local assembly will dissolve and be no more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>“I WISH YOU COULD BE OUR YOUTH PASTOR”</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was ministering at a particular Youth Conference some time ago with young people coming from all over the area to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  We saw many Saved and baptized with the Holy Spirit that weekend.  As the Services came to a close, young people surrounded me thanking me for the Messages that the Lord had given to me to minister.  But what really got to me were the words of one Pastor and Youth Pastor, which was told to me personally.  They pulled me off to the side where no one was around, and they began to relay to me the following request<em>, “I wish that you could be our Youth Pastor.”</em>  I will never forget that.  With tears streaming down their cheeks, they pleaded with me if there was someway that I could Minister to their youth every week.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.  I want to encourage you to gather your youth that is in your Church, and gather them around the television, Internet, or even radio, and tune in to the Crossfire Services that are aired every Thursday night at 7 p.m., CST.  We have had many e-mails, letters, Facebook messages, and even Twitter messages, from Youth Pastors, and even Pastors, telling me that they will move their Youth Services from their normal night to Thursday nights just so they can hear what is being preached.  In other words, your Youth Group can now be a part of Crossfire Youth Ministries.  And even though you might not be here with us in the natural, you are linked up with us to reach this world for Christ.  And we are only as strong as the links that are connected with us.  The young people will hear anointed praise and worship, anointed preaching, and will have the opportunity to accept Christ as their Saviour.  Because of television, radio, and the Internet, we have the opportunity to do what those two Pastors asked of me at the close of that Youth Conference.  And as well, it doesn’t cost anything money wise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>IF WE DO NOT REACH THE YOUTH, SOMEONE ELSE WILL</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve got to understand that if we do not reach the youth for Christ, someone else will reach them for the Powers of Darkness.  If you are a Youth Pastor reading this article, or even a Senior Pastor, there is one thing that you can do to help reach the youth for the Cause of Christ, preach the uncompromising Word of Almighty God, which is the Message of the Cross!  It is the only Message that will offer hope to a generation that is being targeted by Satan.  It is the only Message that will offer Peace that surpasses all understanding in the midst of a storm.  It is the only Message that will give that young person the Answer to all of life’s problems, and will provide them with a Path of unlimited Victory that they desperately need.</p>
<p>Join with us every Thursday night at 7 p.m., CST, on the SonLife Broadcasting Network as we bring the Message of the Cross to the youth of this world!</p>
<p>In Him,<br />

				<h2 class="title"><span>The Battle is Not Yours, But God&#8217;s (Part II)</span></h2>
				<p>II  Chronicles 20:15 – &ldquo;And he said, Hearken you, all Judah, and you  inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus says the LORD  unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude;  for the battle is not yours, but God&rsquo;s.  (If we try to fight the battle  on our terms, we will lose; if we fight the battle on His Terms, we will  win.  What are those terms?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  have to trust in Christ, Who has already fought this battle and won,  and did so at the Cross [Col. 2:14-15].  Doing that, the Holy Spirit  will then guarantee us the Victory of Christ [Rom. 8:1-2, 11].)&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD</h6>
<p></p>
<p>It  was during this time, as Judah gathered herself to prayer, that the  Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel.  The Spirit of God is the Answer  and Strength of the Church, and we should not take this statement  lightly.  Without the Moving and Operation of the Holy Spirit, nothing  can be done for Christ.  Not one person can come to the Lord without the  Holy Spirit Working behind the scenes.  Not one person can be filled  with the Spirit, nor can sick bodies be healed without the Moving of the  Holy Spirit among us.  However, far too many youth groups across this  Nation have opted for the ways of man, and the movings of man, which  will result in more harm than good.  I want to say it one more time so  that you, our dear reader, can understand that without the Moving and  Operation of the Holy Spirit, nothing can be done for God.  I know that  this statement is strong, but it is the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>THE POWER OF THE CHURCH</h6>
<p></p>
<p>The  Holy Spirit is the Power of the Church, and if we look at the birth of  the Church, it was born in Power, Holy Spirit Power.  In fact, the last  Words of Christ while on this Planet, before His Ascension, is found in  Acts 1:4-8, which says, &ldquo;And being assembled together with them,  Commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for  the Promise of the Father, which, said He, you have heard of Me.  For  John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy  Spirit (and with fire) . . . But you shall receive power  (Miracle-working Power), after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you  (specifically states that this &lsquo;Power&rsquo; is inherent in the Holy Spirit,  and solely in His Domain):  and you shall be witnesses (doesn&rsquo;t mean  witnessing to souls, but rather to one giving one&rsquo;s all in every  capacity for Christ, even to the laying down of one&rsquo;s life) unto Me  (without the Baptism with the Holy Spirit, one cannot really know Jesus  as one should) both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and  unto the uttermost part of the Earth (proclaims the Work of God as  being worldwide).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>IS THE INFILLING OF THE SPIRIT RELEVANT TODAY?</h6>
<p></p>
<p>I  want you to notice something very important here, Christ did not tell  His Disciples that day to go and build churches, or to go and do  citywide crusades, or to sing, or to even preach.  He Commanded them  that before they do anything, they must be filled with the Holy Spirit.   Now, I know what some of you are asking, &ldquo;Is this Command still  relevant today?&rdquo;  Well, it is and it is not.  It&rsquo;s not relevant in the  fact that we do not have to go to Jerusalem and wait for the Promise of  the Father.  When the Holy Spirit fell on the Day of Pentecost, He never  left, and we can be filled anywhere, anytime, or in any place.   However, it is very relevant in this way, that whoever has accepted the  Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour, then they must immediately  begin to seek for the infilling of the Holy Spirit.  If you are Saved,  but have not yet received the Baptism with the Holy Spirit with the  evidence of speaking with other Tongues as the Spirit of God gives the  Utterance, I would like to take this opportunity to give you some very  simple instructions on how to be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>HOW WE RECEIVE THE BAPTISM WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h6>
<p></p>
<p>1.   The only requirement to be filled with the Spirit is to be Saved.  By  this, I mean that you do not have to belong to any man-made  organization, or church, all you have to belong to is His Church, the  Body of Christ.</p>
<p>2.   We believe that when a person is filled with the Spirit, they will  speak with other Tongues (Acts 2:1-4; 8:14-17; 9:17; 10:44-46; 19:6).   Tongues are a real language, known somewhere on Planet Earth, but not  known by the recipient (Acts 2:5-11), and when we speak with other  Tongues, we speak the wonderful Works of God (Acts 2:11).  </p>
<p>3.   We must understand that everything that we receive from the Lord comes  to us on the basis of Faith, and Faith alone.  This is not something  that we earn, but rather it is a free Gift given to us by our Heavenly  Father, and is made possible for us to have through Christ and what He  did for us at Calvary.  As well, the Holy Spirit will not make you speak  with other Tongues, for He is a Perfect Gentleman, represented by the  Dove.  And when you pray, and ask the Lord to be filled with the Spirit,  you will begin to sense words and languages in your innermost being  (Jn. 7:37-39), and here is where the Faith comes in, open your mouth and  begin to speak what you sense and feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>THE MOVING AND OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately,  even though this Command by our Saviour is plainly relevant today,  there are less young people being filled with the Holy Spirit today than  ever before.  Once again, let us repeat ourselves and say that without  the Holy Spirit Working in our midst, nothing can be done for the Lord.   As I write this article, the Lord has been so gracious and kind to this  Youth Ministry, as we have seen scores of young people Saved, Baptized  with the Holy Spirit, healed, and delivered from drugs, alcohol,  cutting, homosexuality, and lesbianism, all because of the Moving and  Operation of the Holy Spirit.  Without Him Working, then we would not  have seen these things happen.  We would not have seen young men bound  by cocaine set free by the Power of God!  We would not have seen teenage  girls delivered from cutting themselves on a nightly basis.  It is  through the Moving and Operation of the Holy Spirit that we have seen,  and will continue to see, these results take place.  My question to you  today, Youth Pastor, is, &rdquo;Do you want to see things take place for the  Lord, or are you satisfied entertaining your young people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be continued next month!</p>
<p>In Him, Pastor Gabe</p>
				
				
				
				<h2 class="title"><span>The Battle is Not Yours, But God&#8217;s (Part I)</span></h2>
				<p>II Chronicles 17:3 – &ldquo;And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat (the greatest thing that could ever be said of any man), because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim (it is believed by some scholars that the name of David is wrongly inserted here; as well, it is not in the Septuagint; most probably, the reference is to Asa, the father of Jehoshaphat; inasmuch as the terminology does not exactly fit David, it is my personal opinion also that the translation is incorrect here, with Asa being the correct name).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judah was surrounded by a confederate army that consisted of the Moabites, Amorites, and Edomites.  Their sole purpose was to completely wipe Judah off the face of the map.  This invasion was more than likely allowed by the Lord to take place because of King Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s unholy alliance with Ahab, King of Israel.  Israel had long since abandoned the Ways of the Lord, by leading the people into idolatry, which was a gross sin to say the least, and forbidden by God.</p>
<p>But despite the fact that he aligned himself with Israel, which God did not approve of, it is said in the Scripture that, &ldquo;The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not Baalim&rdquo; (II Chron. 17:3).  What a statement!  One of the greatest things that can be said about a person is that &ldquo;the Lord was with them.&rdquo;  While on the throne, King Jehoshaphat did something that had not been done before in Judah, he brought the Word of God unto the people.  He sent people all throughout Judah, teaching the people the Word of God, which resulted into one of the greatest Revival&rsquo;s in the history of Judah, up until that point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Before Revival, We Must First Experience A Reformation</h6>

<p> Now, we all pray for Revival, and rightfully so.  But before we can have Revival, we must first have a Reformation.  What do I mean by this?  Before I explain this, let me say that Revival is not the banging of drums, or leading parades down city streets.  Revival is not really even seeing souls Saved.  That is a result of Revival.  True Biblical Revival will come when the People of God first come back to the Cross of Christ.  And in order to come back to the Cross the Word of God must be preached, and it must be preached without compromise or fear.  We need a Reformation in this Nation of the Word of God, where young men and women will stand up and proclaim the True Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the Cross of Christ and the Power of the Holy Spirit.  There is no other answer for the ills of mankind, NONE!  It is the Cross of Christ alone that will bring about true change in the heart and life of Believers and non-believers. </p>
<p>On October 31, 1517, a monk by the name of Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-five Thesis on the door of a Catholic Church in Wittenberg, Germany.  Noticing that the Catholic Church promoted indulgences, and salvation by works, he, by studying the Word of God, realized that the Bible says, &ldquo;The Just Shall Live by Faith&rdquo; (Rom. 1:17).  By Martin Luther doing this, it helped bring about a Reformation which brought people out of darkness into Light.  And like it was in 1517, we need a Reformation of the Word of God in our youth groups, which will result in seeing souls brought to the Saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.  Without the Word of God, there can be no Revival.  Without the Cross, there can be no Revival.  Without the Moving and Operation of the Holy Spirit, there can be no Revival.  Many want Revival, but without the Cross.  Simply put, there can be no Revival without the Cross of Christ being the central focus of that movement.  In order to experience the Glory of the Lord filling the House, the Cross of Christ must be the focal point!</p>

<h6>Satan Will Try To Steal Our Possession</h6>
<p></p>
<p>As this confederate army surrounded Judah, Jehoshaphat gathered all the men, women, and children, and went to the Lord in prayer.  Not knowing what to do, when situations grow dreary we must do the only thing that will bring about peace in the midst of the storm, drop to our knees and begin to seek the Face of God.  Most Christians, unfortunately, wait until the dark times to seek the Lord, when we are instructed to seek the Lord in all things, which means in the good times, and in the bad times, ever seeking His Direction and Guidance in every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>Look at Verse 11, Jehoshaphat prays this prayer, &ldquo;Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of Your possession, which You have given us to inherit&rdquo; (II Chron. 20:11).  This is exactly what Satan ever tries to do, to steal the possessions that God has given us to inherit.  Every Child of God has a possession given to us by the Lord, and Satan will attempt to steal away this great possession, and if we do not understand the Cross of Christ, relative to Sanctification, and how the Holy Spirit Works, which is exclusively through the Cross of Christ, then Satan will steal that which the Lord has given us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Left This Pea Patch My Last Time&rdquo;</h6>
<p></p>
<p>  Sadly, this is true of most Christians.  They have allowed Satan to swoop in and steal every possession given to them by the Lord.  It reminds me of the Children of Israel after spending their effort in planting a pea patch, and at harvest time, the Philistines would come down and steal everything for which the Israelites had worked so hard.  Until Shamaah, one of David&rsquo;s Mighty Men of Valor, stood up and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left this pea patch my last time!&rdquo;  The next time the enemy came down; he stood in the midst of that possession, defended that pea patch, and defeated the Philistine troop. </p>
<p>Some of you have been watching the enemy steal that which God has given you, your Joy, your Salvation, your Victory, your Healing.  But now, instead of watching the enemy steal your possession, it&rsquo;s time you stand your ground, and tell the Devil, &ldquo;I will not allow you to steal from me anymore!&rdquo;  Stand firm on the foundation of the Cross of Christ, by placing your Faith in His Finished Work, which allows the Holy Spirit the latitude to work in our lives.  We must understand that the way to keep Satan from stealing our possessions is to stand on His Word, and keep our eyes on the Cross of Christ! </p>

				<h2 class="title"><span>The Great Commission</span></h2>
				<p>Mark 16:15 – &ldquo;And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world (the  Gospel of Christ is not merely a western Gospel, as some claim, but is  for the entirety of the world), and preach the Gospel to every creature  (&lsquo;preaching&rsquo; is God&rsquo;s method, as is here plainly obvious; as well, it is  imperative that every single person have the opportunity to hear; this  is the responsibility of every Believer).&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Verse that  I will be using as my Text for this article is known as &ldquo;The Great  Commission,&rdquo; in that it was given by the Lord Jesus Christ to all who  are His Followers, with the sole purpose being that of World  Evangelism.  In fact, World Evangelism is the very heartbeat of this  Youth Ministry.  God has Called Crossfire Youth Ministries to reach the  four corners of this globe, and by the help and Grace of the Lord, we  will do it.  As many of you know, we are living in uncertain times.   This beloved Nation of ours is in a mess, Spiritually speaking, and it  will not get any better until the Lord comes back, bringing His Heavenly  Headquarters down from Planet Heaven to Planet Earth, and then all the  Earth will be changed back to its rightful and original state.  But  until then, we must be about our Father&rsquo;s Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6> HOW CAN I HELP FULFILL THE GREAT COMMISSION?</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Before  I answer that question, I would like to share something with you that  has become a priority in my Ministry.  As many of you know, I am the  Youth Pastor of Crossfire Youth Ministries, and have been so for the  last nine years.  God has given me a burden for our youth, a tremendous  burden at that.  My calling is to see as many young people brought out  of spiritual darkness into the Light, which is Christ.  As well, my  calling is to see as many young people delivered from the bondages of  Satan, which are many, and to see them baptized with the Holy Spirit  with the evidence of speaking with other Tongues.  And God has given  Crossfire an opportunity to share the Message of the Cross over  television, radio, and over the Internet and, in fact, reaching all over  the world.</p>
<p>Which leads me to say this:  Everywhere I  travel, in regards to meetings held all over the country, I always  inquire of the Pastor of their youth program that is being held at that  local body.  To my shock, many Pastors are completely honest with me and  tell me that they really don&rsquo;t have much of a youth program at their  Church, simply because they can&rsquo;t either afford to hire a full-time  Youth Pastor, or they have no one that will step up and volunteer to  help with the youth.  I heard someone say not too long ago that the  youth is not the Church of tomorrow, but rather is the Church of today.   That struck me to the core, for that is a very true statement, and when  the local congregation passes on due to age, in most cases, that local  assembly will dissolve and be no more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>&ldquo;I WISH YOU COULD BE OUR YOUTH PASTOR&rdquo;</h6>
<p></p>
<p>I  was ministering at a particular Youth Conference some time ago with  young people coming from all over the area to hear the Gospel of Jesus  Christ.  We saw many Saved and baptized with the Holy Spirit that  weekend.  As the Services came to a close, young people surrounded me  thanking me for the Messages that the Lord had given to me to minister.   But what really got to me were the words of one Pastor and Youth  Pastor, which was told to me personally.  They pulled me off to the side  where no one was around, and they began to relay to me the following  request, &ldquo;I wish that you could be our Youth Pastor.&rdquo;  I will never  forget that.  With tears streaming down their cheeks, they pleaded with  me if there was someway that I could Minister to their youth every week.</p>
<p>This  is where you come in.  I want to encourage you to gather your youth  that is in your Church, and gather them around the television, Internet,  or even radio, and tune in to the Crossfire Services that are aired  every Thursday night at 7 p.m., CST.  We have had many e-mails, letters,  Facebook messages, and even Twitter messages, from Youth Pastors, and  even Pastors, telling me that they will move their Youth Services from  their normal night to Thursday nights just so they can hear what is  being preached.  In other words, your Youth Group can now be a part of  Crossfire Youth Ministries.  And even though you might not be here with  us in the natural, you are linked up with us to reach this world for  Christ.  And we are only as strong as the links that are connected with  us.  The young people will hear anointed praise and worship, anointed  preaching, and will have the opportunity to accept Christ as their  Saviour.  Because of television, radio, and the Internet, we have the  opportunity to do what those two Pastors asked of me at the close of  that Youth Conference.  And as well, it doesn&rsquo;t cost anything money  wise.</p>
</h6>
<p></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve  got to understand that if we do not reach the youth for Christ, someone  else will reach them for the Powers of Darkness.  If you are a Youth  Pastor reading this article, or even a Senior Pastor, there is one thing  that you can do to help reach the youth for the Cause of Christ, preach  the uncompromising Word of Almighty God, which is the Message of the  Cross!  It is the only Message that will offer hope to a generation that  is being targeted by Satan.  It is the only Message that will offer  Peace that surpasses all understanding in the midst of a storm.  It is  the only Message that will give that young person the Answer to all of  life&rsquo;s problems, and will provide them with a Path of unlimited Victory  that they desperately need.</p>
<p>Join with us every Thursday  night at 7 p.m., CST, on the SonLife Broadcasting Network as we bring  the Message of the Cross to the youth of this world!</p>

				<h2 class="title"><span>The Lord Preserved David</span></h2>
				<p>I Chronicles 18:6 – &ldquo;Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and  the Syrians became David&rsquo;s servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD  preserved David whithersoever he went (it is the Will of God, and even  the insistence of the Lord, that we subdue not just some of our  spiritual enemies, but all; we must rule the sin nature, and not the sin  nature ruling us [Rom. 6:3-14]).&rdquo;</p>
<p>David is one of the  greatest Bible characters found in the Word of God, and is one of my  personal favorite persons to read about. In this particular Chapter, you  will find David, the king of Israel, bringing Israel into a place where  there are no enemies around them, for he had subdued them  all. Likewise, we also find in this Chapter exactly how the Child of God  should live, with all enemies subdued, living in a state of complete  Victory over the world, the flesh, and the Devil. We need to understand  that this is not just a Bible story, but it can be the story of every  person who names the Name of Jesus Christ, Victorious!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>SUBDUING THE &ldquo;INWARD FOES&rdquo; IN OUR LIVES</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Before  we get into how this story can be applied to our lives, I would like to  deal with a very important point that is the case of so much failure in  the life of a Believer, the death of Saul at the hands of the  Philistines. The last picture we see of Saul, the people&rsquo;s king, is a  man lying on the battlefield, dead from a self-inflicted wound by his  own sword, in other words, he committed suicide. The Philistines were  known as an &ldquo;outward foe,&rdquo; meaning that they were an enemy outside of  the territory that God had promised Abraham, many years before, and this  enemy had to be defeated. But, since Saul could not defeat the &ldquo;inward  foe,&rdquo; which was the Jebusites, this &ldquo;outward foe&rdquo; defeated Saul. Before  we can have Victory over the external foes in our lives, the internal  foes must be defeated.</p>
<p>How  many Christians or how many young people still have Philistines in  their lives? How many young people, who love God with all of their  hearts, still live with Philistines dominating their lives? The  Christian, no matter how long they have been living for the Lord, will  find, and without exception, that the greatest foes in their lives are  these &ldquo;inward foes,&rdquo; such as lying, gossip, pornography, lust,  etc. Satan knows that if he can keep his strongholds within our lives,  that this will greatly hinder our walk with the Lord. Each one of these  &ldquo;inward foes&rdquo; must be defeated, no matter what they are, and without  question. If they are not brought under subjection, then we will  continue to live a life of spiritual failure. There is only one way to  Victory, it is through our Faith in Christ and Him Crucified. There is  no other way that the enemies of our lives can be brought down and  subdued, it is only through the Cross of Christ, and our Faith in His  Finished Work. By our Faith ever being anchored in the Cross of Christ,  this allows the Holy Spirit to begin to do a Work within our lives that  will bring about the Victory needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>THE ONLY SOLUTION KNOWN TO MAN: THE CROSS</h6>
<p></p>
<p>The  moment that David became king of Israel, the first thing that he did  was to subdue the Jebusites (I Chron. 11:4), which would lead to the  defeat of the Philistines (I Chron. 11:14, 18), and the Syrians (I  Chron. 18:6). Once again, let me state that if we do not defeat the  enemies within our lives, these strongholds of Satan, those without fail  will ultimately overcome us. That is why we preach the Cross as  strongly as we do, for the Cross of Christ is the only Way to have  complete and total Victory over these strongholds of the enemy. Paul  would write and say, &ldquo;For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but  mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds&rdquo; (II Cor.  10:4). The strongholds that Satan has erected in the very center of our  lives can be pulled down, but we cannot do it, in and of ourselves. Now,  Satan is very clever at presenting another way of victory besides the  Cross of Christ, and he will use much of the church world to present  that way and to carry out his work. But, the truth remains that there  are not several ways to obtain the Victory needed; not a way for  Pentecostals, a way for Baptists, and a way for Catholics, they are all  different. No! There is only One Way to experience this Victory that we  are discussing now, and that is through the shed Blood of Jesus  Christ! Without the shed Blood of Christ, there is no Victory. Man is  burdened down with sin, and most Christians have strongholds of Satan in  their lives, with no victory in sight. The only Solution to man&rsquo;s  problem, which is sin, is the Cross of Christ! This goes for the young  and the old alike, the same Cross that Saved the old, is the same Cross  that saves the young.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>WILL THE CROSS WORK FOR TEENAGERS?</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Simply  put, yes! There is not a separate way for young people different from  that which is given in the Bible! Jesus Christ did not present another  way for the youth of Israel that was different from the adults, it was  all the same, &ldquo;Come unto Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and  I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am  meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your souls. For My  yoke is easy, and My burden is light&rdquo; (Mat. 11:28-30). This &ldquo;yoke&rdquo; that  Christ is speaking of is the &ldquo;yoke&rdquo; of the Cross. Once a Believer  places their Faith in the Cross of Christ and that Alone, the Holy  Spirit has the ability to Work in our lives, and to do for us what we  cannot do for ourselves. But, notice this, there is one word that the  modern church world needs to look at very carefully, &ldquo;ALL.&rdquo; This means  that the Cross of Christ is exactly what our Young People need, and the  Cross of Christ will work for our teenagers and young adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>THE LORD GAVE VICTORY TO DAVID</h6>
<p></p>
<p>After  David defeated the &ldquo;inward foes&rdquo; of Israel, he turned to the &ldquo;outward  foes&rdquo; of Israel, of whom the Syrians were. Now that the Ark of God was  seated and enthroned in the very center of Israel, David now enjoys  complete Victory over all enemies, both at home and foreign. Once Christ  is seated and enthroned in the very center of our lives, which speaks  of our Faith being placed in the Finished Work of Christ, we can enjoy  Victory over all the enemies of our lives, inward and outward. It is not  the Will of God that we enjoy Victory over a few of our enemies, but it  is the Will of God that we have Victory over all of our enemies. As He  gave David the Victory over these enemies, He has already given us the  Victory over all of our enemies, and it was done through the Cross of  Christ.</p>

				<h2 class="title"><span>&#8220;Baca&#8221; has a Double Meaning</span></h2>
				<p>Psalms  84:5-6 – &ldquo;Blessed is the man whose strength is in You; in whose heart  are the Ways of them. (Over and over again, the Ways of God are  contrasted with the ways of man. &lsquo;Blessed is the man&rsquo; who follows the  Ways of God [His Way is in His Word]. There is no blessing to the man  who follows the ways of man.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also fills  the pools. (The &lsquo;valley of Baca&rsquo; actually means &lsquo;the valley of  weeping.&rsquo; It produces a well of tears. If the spirit of the Believer is  carnal, this valley will only be a &lsquo;valley of weeping,&rsquo; but to the  Spiritual Heart, it will be a new nature and unfailing reservoir of  strength and refreshment.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  word &ldquo;Baca&rdquo; has a double meaning. First of all, it means &ldquo;a garbage  dump,&rdquo; and secondly, it means a &ldquo;place of tears,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;valley of  weeping.&rdquo; In regards to this first meaning, we have to admit that this  world has become, and presently is, a garbage dump. Satan has taken that  which God has created and turned it into a massive mess, in his effort  to control the world system. Everything that God had created, Satan has  made into a massive garbage heap. A place that is so vile, filthy, and  ragged, with a stench that stings the very Nostrils of God. Secondly,  &ldquo;Baca&rdquo; means a &ldquo;valley of weeping,&rdquo; and this can be indicative of every  Child of God who has had to pass through a place of tears, suffering,  and sorrow. But thank God that we do not have to stay in this place of  weeping, we can make it through, and I would like to address how in a  moment. First though, I would like to dive a little deeper into the  double meaning of this word &ldquo;Baca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>A GARBAGE DUMP</h6>
<p></p>
<p>As  we mentioned above, the first meaning to the word &ldquo;Baca,&rdquo; is &ldquo;a garbage  dump.&rdquo; In actuality, in the days of old, outside the city walls of  Jerusalem was an actual valley of &ldquo;Baca,&rdquo; where the trash of the city of  Jerusalem was dumped. It was typical of a garbage dump, oozing  foul-smelling, sickening, and nauseating odors. Not to mention that on  top of the gross stench, they would throw dead animal carcasses on top  of the garbage heap. In other words, it was not a pretty picture.</p>
<p>But  there is a lesson here that we need not overlook, and that is this, as  we draw closer to the Lord, we have to admit that this present world in  which we live in is a garbage dump. The more we grow in the Lord, the  more we see how reprobate this world is, where the Truth becomes a lie  and the lie becomes the truth. Where immorality reigns, and morality is  always called into question. Literally, this world is a garbage dump and  it will not get any better but rather worse.</p>
<p>Thank  God that we do not have to stay here! Soon and very soon, those who  have been bought with a price, the Shed Blood of the Lamb, will be  caught up to meet the Lord in the air (I Thess. 4:17), to be with the  Lord forever and forever. On top of that, the Lord Jesus Christ is going  to come back and change this present world system, and the garbage  dumps of this world are going to burn for the last time, when Christ  will return and restore the Earth once again to the place God had  intended from the very beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>A VALLEY OF WEEPING</h6>
<p></p>
<p>The  second meaning to this word &ldquo;Baca,&rdquo; is a &ldquo;valley of weeping.&rdquo; It is  this meaning that I would like to address ourselves to at this very  moment. I think that I can say without fear of contradiction or failure  that every Child of God has gone through or is going through a &ldquo;valley  of weeping.&rdquo; Things may occur that are unexpected and have left us in a  state of shock, or at times things have happened to us that we knew was  coming, or sickness could ravage the body, or a very close loved one has  left us too soon, but nonetheless, we have to travel through this  valley of &ldquo;Baca,&rdquo; this place of weeping. There are times where demonic  oppression is so strong that we feel that we cannot survive another  onslaught of pain and heartache. Death would be sweet. But there are  ways that we can face these attacks, or these times of great sorrow, we  can lose faith and blame God for our trials, which untold millions have  done, or we can &ldquo;make a well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As  stated, millions have grown cold toward the things of God because of  their present situation, believing that God is a mean God or He would  not have allowed those things to come upon us. They question why God has  not answered their prayer and this will make them grow angry towards  God. With bitterness creeping in, they lash out not only at those who  offer to help, but also at God Himself. Millions have lost their soul  because of this very thing. But, that does not have to happen.</p>
<p>As  a Child of God, we must understand that we are not immune to the forces  of Darkness, and that the fiery darts of the enemy will come our  way. In fact, Peter said, &ldquo;Think it not strange concerning the fiery  trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto  you: but rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings;  that, when His Glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with  exceeding joy&rdquo; (I Pet. 4:12-13). Attacks will come our way, that is if  we are truly following the Lord Jesus Christ, and we must understand  that. However, it is not the intention of the Holy Spirit that we remain  there. We are only passing through this &ldquo;valley of weeping.&rdquo; As we  endure the hardships that are ever going to come upon us, we do not have  to grow bitter and angry, but we can &ldquo;make a well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>MAKE A WELL</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Some  can buckle under the pressure, or you can &ldquo;make a well!&rdquo; In other  words, in the midst of our desert, we can plant a garden. In the midst  of our barrenness, we can dig a well, and be refreshed. The Christian  can turn this &ldquo;valley of weeping&rdquo; into a well. We do this by us, the  Child of God, ever making the Cross of Christ the Object of our  Faith. In other words, we praise the Lord in spite of our problem, and  in spite of our circumstances. We never move away from what Christ has  done for us. Without the Cross of Christ as the Object of our Faith,  this valley will only be a &ldquo;valley of weeping,&rdquo; with very little chance  of ever getting out of this valley.</p>
<p>These  valleys that we will go through are put there in our path so that we  may come to an end of ourselves, in other words, not depending upon  ourselves, but ever depending upon Christ and the Cross. What this means  is simply that Christ is the ultimate Source of everything, the Cross  is the Means by which we receive these Blessings, Faith is the key that  will unlock this door, and the Holy Spirit oversees everything. These  wells that we dig can bring refreshment, rejoicing, and will be a place  of refilling. Once again, the Cross of Christ, and our Faith in that  Finished Work will bring refreshment, rejoicing, and will be a place of  refilling. Depending upon ourselves will bring the opposite, but  depending upon Christ and His Work on Calvary&rsquo;s Cross will bring about  what is needed.</p>
<p>As  we go through this life and we encounter the &ldquo;Baca&rsquo;s&rdquo; of our lives, we  need not stay there, but we will go through these &ldquo;valleys of weeping&rdquo;  as long as we &ldquo;dig a well,&rdquo; i.e., keep our Faith ever anchored in the  Finished Work of Christ.</p>
<p>In Him, Pastor Gabe</p>
				
				
				
				<h2 class="title"><span>The Arrow of the Lord&#8217;s Deliverance (Part 2)</span></h2>
				<p>II Kings 13:17 – &ldquo;And he said, Open the window eastward (why  eastward? The sun rose in the east; therefore, the Lord, through Elisha  and this symbolism, was telling the king of Israel that if true  Repentance would be forthcoming, Israel&rsquo;s sun would not be setting, but  rather rising). And he opened it (thus far, the king operates in  faith). Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of  the LORD&rsquo;s deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for you  shall smite the Syrians in Aphek, till you have consumed them (what a  promise!).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>THE CROSS IS THE DIVIDING LINE</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Once  again, we must stress that the Cross of Christ is the dividing line, and  has always been the dividing line, between the true Church and the  apostate church. You can read about this &ldquo;Dividing Line&rdquo; in the very  first pages of human history, in the story of Cain and Abel. Abel, a  type of the true Church, offered his sacrifice that came from the  flock. The lamb was inspected minutely, and was declared pure and  spotless, and was offered as the sacrifice upon the Altar. The Altar was  a Type of Calvary, and the lamb was a Type of Christ, Who was Pure,  without spot or sin, and offered as our Substitute upon the Cross, to  satisfy the demands of a thrice-Holy God. With this sacrifice, the Bible  tells us that God accepted his offering.</p>
<p>However,  Cain, knowing that this was the type of sacrifice that God wanted and  would accept, chose to do things his own way. He chose to offer a  sacrifice that was less gory and bloody, and which came from his own  labor. Cain believed that God would accept his sacrifice because it came  from his own hands and ingenuity. The problem is that the Lord did not  accept this sacrifice, which caused the anger of Cain to be felt with  the murder of his brother. </p>
<p>Much of the modern Youth Groups are  trying to do the same thing, they have brought before God a &ldquo;way&rdquo; that  is not the Way of God, but it is a way, nonetheless. With this &ldquo;way,&rdquo;  they might bring in many young people, and they might become the most  popular Youth Group in town, but God will not recognize it at all. That  &ldquo;way,&rdquo; which is being presented, is a &ldquo;way&rdquo; that leads to destruction  and death. It is a &ldquo;way&rdquo; that leads to bondage unparalleled. But, the  Way of God, which is the Way of the Cross, leads unto life, and life  &ldquo;more abundantly&rdquo; (Jn. 10:10). It is the Way, and the only Way to  unlimited Victory in one&rsquo;s life, regardless of age. The Cross is what  our young people need, for it still works today!</p>
<p>The reason why  we preach the Cross, teach the Cross, and sing the Cross is that it is  through the Cross of Christ Alone, where we can find true peace of mind,  and true Victory over the world, the flesh, and the Devil. Without the  Cross, we have to rely on self, which can never bring the desired  results. And that is why the Cross is the dividing line, for it exposes  what self really is and what self really can do, which is nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>THE PROMISE OF DELIVERANCE WAS GIVEN, BUT JOASH FELL SHORT</h6>
<p></p>
<p>There  was one more thing that the Holy Spirit demanded from Joash, and that  was to take arrows and smite them on the ground, not once, but several  times. However, Joash only smote the ground with the arrows three times,  which caused Elisha to grow angry with the king. Why did Joash stop at  three, and why did Elisha grow angry? The Ways of the Lord are not  always understandable, but Joash, not being a Follower of the Lord,  probably felt somewhat foolish for doing this, so he smote the ground  only three times. Now, he thought that striking the ground that many  times was somewhat big in his eyes, but not in God&rsquo;s Eyes. This was a  test of Faith and in reality the entirety of the Nation of Israel was at  stake. If Joash would have turned to the Lord and smitten the ground  more than three times, it would have meant the total destruction of  Syria, and every other enemy who would dare attack Israel. But, because  of a lack of Faith on the part of Joash, he would smite the ground three  times. This caused Elisha to grow angry at Joash&rsquo;s lack of Faith, for  it only guaranteed a partial victory for this king.</p>
<p>How many of  us now are satisfied with having only partial victory in our lives? In  fact, the majority of young people living today are living their lives  with experiencing only partial victory. The reason is that there is no  understanding of what the Cross can do, in regards to our  Sanctification. It is impossible for anyone to live a victorious life  outside of the Cross of Christ. Remember, it does not matter how good  you might be, or how many good deeds you might accomplish, if your Faith  is not ever anchored in the Cross of Christ, then the very best that  you can have is partial victory, if not defeat as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>DOES THE CROSS WORK?</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Some  of you might say that you&rsquo;ve tried the Cross and it does not really  work. Well, that&rsquo;s not correct, for the Cross always works, but it&rsquo;s you  and I that do not work too well. We must ever go back to the Cross,  even every single day, for Christ said, &ldquo;. . . If any man will come  after Me (the criteria for Discipleship), let him deny himself (not  asceticism as many think, but rather that one denies one&rsquo;s own  willpower, self-will, strength, and ability, depending totally on  Christ), and take up his cross (the benefits of the Cross, looking  exclusively to what Jesus did there to meet our every need) daily (this  is so important, our looking to the Cross; that we must renew our Faith  in what Christ has done for us, even on a daily basis, for Satan will  ever try to move us away from the Cross as the Object of our Faith,  which always spells disaster), and follow Me (Christ can be followed  only by the Believer looking to the Cross, understanding what it  accomplished, and by that means alone)&rdquo; (Lk. 9:23).</p>
<p>Once again,  the Cross of Christ is something that we must look to on a daily basis  for complete and total Victory in our everyday lives. If we do not want  sin to have dominion over us, then we must go by Way of the Cross, for  Christ Won the Victory at the Cross of Calvary, and we can be partakers  of His Victory through our Faith in what Christ has done for us at the  Cross. I do not want to settle for a partial victory, but I want to  experience total Victory in my life, and the Cross is what will bring  this about.</p>
<p>In Him, Pastor Gabe</p>
