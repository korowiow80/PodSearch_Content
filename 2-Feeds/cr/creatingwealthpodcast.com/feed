		<itunes:summary>Countries around the globe are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, with our own country no exception. Jason Hartman interviews Dr. Kirk Elliot, Ph.D., investment advisor with ICA, on monetary and fiscal policy and the irresponsibility of governments around the world. For more details, visit: www.JasonHartman.com. Using Greece as an example, Dr. Elliott states that when governments run out of money, they start doing crazy things. The one fundamental issue in Greece is public debt, over which they lost their autonomy and are now under the rules of the EU. Italy, Iceland, Portugal, France and others are on the verge of bankruptcy and due to that, the EU has been unable to bail out Greece.
Across the pond in the U.S., we have lost our credit rating and are losing the reserve currency status with a lack of interest in our Treasury bills and notes. The definition of inflation is an increase in the money supply, and price increases are a symptom of inflation. As more money is printed, it loses value and nobody wants it, which is sending the U.S. down the same tube as other countries in economic crisis. People around the world have lost faith in the U.S. dollar and the country’s ability to repay its debt. Dr. Elliott says when interest rates go up, it will open a whole new can of worms with the bond market, which will come crashing down hard on retirees and insurance companies. But it’s not all doom and gloom. There are countercyclical investment strategies that people should take advantage of that are attached to physical assets, such as precious metals and real estate investments (commodities with universal need.)

Kirk Elliott has been an investment advisor with ICA in Durango, Colorado since January of 2002 and has been working in the financial services industry since 1994. Dr. Elliott is passionate about educating and equipping his clients with the information they need to safeguard their hard-earned assets.

Dr. Elliott earned his Ph.D. in Public Policy and Administration from Walden University. His dissertation is entitled, “An Empirical Identification of an Appropriate Inflation Definition and an Inflation Targeting Monetary Policy.” Dr. Elliott also earned a Master of Arts in International Studies from the University of Denver, and a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of Colorado.

Dr. Elliott has served as adjunct faculty for Fort Lewis College, Liberty University and Walden University in the areas of Economics, Public Policy, and International Business.  In addition he makes frequent appearances at economic and geopolitical forums and has been interviewed on radio talk shows across the country such as Family Talk with Dr. James Dobson, and Freedom it’s up to Us with John Michael Chambers.  Dr. Elliott has also appeared on local and national television networks including Daystar, SkyAngel and local networks in Columbus, OH and Orlando, FL.

Dr. Elliott is founder and president of Philanthropia, a non-profit 501(c)3 charitable foundation established to care for those in need around the world. Dr. Elliott also serves on the board for Patrick Henry College in Purcellville, VA.

Dr. Elliott lives in Southwest Colorado with his wife and two children.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman interviews research scientist, Heidi Grant Halvorson regarding the science behind human motivation and success. There are many successful people in the world who are highly motivated and have concise goals, but how many actually understand why they’re successful or why they fail? The common belief is that certain people are just genetically wired to succeed or fail. Heidi states this is not entirely the case and shares the findings of scientific research on achievement. She talks about strategies that people use, principles that people can count on and apply to their own life, and states that our own intuition about what helps us succeed or causes us to fail can often be incorrect. It's not about ability or IQ. Listen at:  www.JasonHartman.com for additional details. Heidi explains the psychological factors behind how people react to challenges, the beliefs and mindsets that people have as they try to reach a goal. Defining success is personal, dependant on an individual’s sense of well-being, lasting happiness and autonomy. She says it's important to be specific about goals, to break them down into manageable, specific pieces that are planned out with when and where, and taking the time to define success for ourselves.

Jason and Heidi also discuss the relationship between money and happiness, expressing that there is a money point where it does make it easier to make choices and pursue the things individuals find interesting in life, plus containing a sense of accomplishment and opening the door to help others. Unhappiness comes about when a person makes and uses their money for the wrong reasons, lacking sensibility, leading to dissatisfaction. Heidi emphasizes motivation and realistic goals are important. Jason shares his own opinion on wealth, noting that, on the one hand, having more “things” can actually become a burden, but it does allow a person to help others and create experiences and memories. Heidi states that what people do with their wealth is the important factor for fulfillment and happiness. Heidi Grant Halvorson is a rising star in the field of motivational science.   She is a an Expert Blogger for Fast Company, The Huffington Post, and Psychology Today, as well as a regular contributor to the BBC World Service'sBusiness Daily, the Harvard Business Review, and SmartBrief's SmartBlog on Leadership.  Her writing has also been featured on CNN Living and Mamapedia. Heidi is also Associate Director of the Motivation Science Center at the Columbia University Business School. In addition to her work as author and co-editor of the highly-regarded academic book The Psychology of Goals (Guilford, 2009), she has authored papers in her field’s most prestigious journals, including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,European Journal of Social Psychology, and Judgment and Decision Making.   She has received numerous grants from the National Science Foundation for her research on goals and achievement.  Her work has been praised by Carol Dweck and Matthew Kelly, among many others.

Dr. Grant Halvorson is a member of the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science, and the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and was recently elected to the highly selective Society for Experimental Social Psychology.  She gives frequent invited addresses and speaks regularly at national conferences, and is available for speaking and consulting engagements, primarily in education, marketing, and management.  She received her PhD in social psychology from Columbia University.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman and returning guest, Dan Amerman discuss federal policies and interest rates, which hurts the savers and fixed income folks. The artificially low interest rates are not working and create higher prices through inflation. Listen at: www.JasonHartman.com.  They also discuss inflation rates, in which the federal numbers are glossed over and do not match true inflation as experienced by the American citizens through food, fuel, and utilities. Manufacturers hide inflation by making products smaller. Jason and Dan then talk about rental housing and how to arbitrage the inflation. Dan explains how to turn the fed policies around to our advantage. It starts with understanding cash flow investing and setting your safety margin. When looking at cash flows, rather than being all about the price, it’s more about the interest rate when it comes to a mortgage. In the process of creating non-free-market interest rates for banks and for the federal government, the federal government has accidentally made available subsidized mortgage rates that are available if you can get the lending. It goes directly to your bottom line as the investor, resulting in much higher cash flows than you would see in a free market.
Dan and Jason illustrate how the sharp decline in housing costs and the interest rate levels causes the floor to drop out and provides an unprecedented opportunity to obtain mortgages and have inflation pay them off.  While rates have been dropping, rents have been going up, thus making real estate investing even more profitable and sensible.
Daniel R. Amerman is a Chartered Financial Analyst with MBA and BSBA degrees in finance.  He is a financial author and speaker with over 25 years of professional experience.   Years of studying the costs of paying for over $100 trillion of US government retirement promises, as well as the costs of cashing out an expected $44 trillion of Boomer pensions and retirement accounts, have convinced him that too many promises and too much paper wealth chasing too few real resources will likely lead to substantial inflation in the years ahead, with potentially devastating implications for many savers and investors, a problem that will also apply to many other nations.
Mr. Amerman spent much of the 1980s as an investment banker helping Savings &amp; Loans and others try to survive the effects of the last major bout of inflation in the United States.  There is a basic economics principle that much of the public is unaware of – inflation doesn't directly destroy the real wealth of goods and services, but rather, redistributes the rights to that real wealth (a principle which unfortunately will likely destroy much of the investment wealth the Boomers plan on enjoying in retirement).  The author worked with the effects of billions of dollars of such wealth redistributions, and saw how there was not only a loser for each dollar of wealth redistributed – but a winner.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We are all confused about economic indicators and it’s critical that we understand the real figures, the direction of the economy, interest rates and their consequences, and much more. On this episode, Jason Hartman interviews Bernie Baumohl, author of Secrets of Economic Indicators, in regard to the numerous economic indicators and what is most useful. Bernie explains what a “business cycle” is and what happens during the cycle, how it comes full circle over time. For more details, listen at: www.JasonHartman.com. Bernie gives examples of stress points in the business cycle. People make mistakes, such as buying more inventory than they need or the economy can’t handle the demand of the people. More recently, we have seen longer periods of economic growth, but at a closer look, the mistakes that caused the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression are apparent. It was a “cauldron of fraud and wrecklessness,” says Bernie. Jason and Bernie touch on the subject of the Federal Reserve and the Gold Standard, citing what has been happening in Greece as an example of the limitations of a currency that is fixed and unmovable. Bernie feels that a country in economic trouble needs to have the flexibility to lower interest rates. They also discuss market sensitivity, the index, and the source of the leading market indicators.

Bernard Baumohl is chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group. He is well known for being ahead of the curve in assessing the direction of the U.S. and world economy. Mr. Baumohl began his career as an analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank specializing on international affairs. He later served as an economist at European American Bank with responsibilities to monitor the global economy and develop forecasts. Mr. Baumohl was also an award-winning reporter with TIME magazine who covered the White House, Federal Reserve and Wall Street. Apart from his role as chief global economist, Mr. Baumohl also teaches at the New York Institute of Finance and is a regular commentator on Public Television's Nightly Business Report. A sought after international speaker, Mr. Baumohl has been recognized for his forecasting accuracy. He has lectured at New York University and Duke University, and is often cited in the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New York Times, Business Week, Barron's, and the Financial Times.

Mr. Baumohl is author of The Secrets of Economic Indicators: Hidden Clues to Future Economic Trends and Investment Opportunities (Wharton School Publishing, 2nd edition). The best-selling book is winner of the Readers Preference Editor's Choice Award for Finance and has been translated into several languages, including Russian and Chinese.  He is also a recipient of the John Hancock Award for Excellence in Financial Journalism, and is a member of the National Association for Business Economics and the American Economic Association. Mr. Baumohl holds an M.A. from Columbia University.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman is joined on this episode by Greg Farrell, author of Crash of the Titans: Greed, Hubris, The Fall of Merrill Lynch, and the Near Collapse of Bank of America, for a discussion of the economic crash and the resulting bailouts, as well as some of the inside dealings with some of the major banks, such as the buyouts by Bank of America. Greg explains how these banks that participated in the buyouts grossly underestimated the depth of problems in their own banks and in those they acquired. Listen at: www.JasonHartman.com. Greg relates his research on Merrill Lynch’s attempt in the 1980s to become more like Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, which was to their detriment because they lacked the expertise for such business practices, and became involved in and in the middle of many of the scandals of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. Like CitiGroup, they were in over their head. Jason and Greg discuss Wall Street in general and then specific financial groups regarding the recklessness and risky businesses, funds, etc, that they entertained to give the impression of higher rates of returns. As the plot unfolded, large bonuses to CEOs and high-producing brokers came into play, which encouraged an all or nothing attitude toward the company and fostered a “me” attitude versus long-term stability of the company. Greg also talks about what he calls the “Charlotte Mafia,” the clash of company cultures.

Greg Farrell is a correspondent for the Financial Times. In January 2009, he broke the news that Merrill Lynch had paid out its 2008 bonuses a month ahead of schedule, in December, even though Merrill was in the process of losing $28 billion for the year, and Bank of America needed an extra $20 billion in taxpayer funds to complete its acquisition of the firm. That story sparked an investigation by New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo. Greg is a past winner of the American Business Press’s Jesse Neal Award for investigative reporting and a recipient of the Knight-Bagehot Fellowship for business journalism. He earned a BA from Harvard University and an MBA from the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman interviews returning guest, Bryan Calderon, Director of Business Development with Accuplan Benefits Services, for a timely discussion on breaking out of 401k jail and putting your retirement money to better use. Bryan explains the differences between the various retirement plans, such as IRAs and 401ks, and though a 401k is a great way to save money, there are some pitfalls as well. Some of those traps have been scams, employers stealing funds from employees and the concerns over business failures. Jason reminds listeners of why it’s so important to be in control of your money. For details, listen at:  www.JasonHartman.com.

Bryan says there are less than 2 percent of plans that are self-directed. That’s a scary figure with all of the current economic uncertainty. Bryan talks about how people are concerned enough about the funds in their retirement plans that some still employed ask for early termination in order to get control of their money by putting it into a self-directed IRA or solo 401K. One of the best methods of control is investing in prudent real estate. Jason includes a recorded audio explanation of the manipulation by fund managers and how to break free from the 401k jail by becoming a real estate investor. Bryan shares options for getting out of their current plans, and he also explains how a solo 401k works for the self-employed. Unlike a sponsored plan, a solo 401k or self-directed IRA can be directed into real estate, promissory notes, trustees, etc. Bryan says that there is about $20 trillion in retirement plans across the nation, with only $4 trillion of it self-directed, and the Social Security sector funds are about $5 trillion. Bryan wraps up with some valuable advice on getting your funds freed up.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman discusses the return of construction jobs, new home development, the Indianapolis rental housing market, Wall Street/hedge funds getting into the landlord business, how investment and vacation home sales surged last year (National Association of Realtors NAR survey and Lawrence Yun commentary), developers selling homes in La Costa, California and a Memphis, Tennessee market profile. More at http://www.jasonhartman.com.

Is it a sign of a turnaround when the nations top homebuilders increase advertising and production? Keep an eye out for big names like - Pulte Homes (PHM), Centex (CTX), Kaufman and Broad (KB Homes) (KB), Ryland Group (RYL), Del Webb (DEL), Lennar (LEN), Richmond American Homes, Beazer Homes (BZH, BZU), Hovnanian (NasdaqGM HOVNP), Toll Brothers (NYSE - TOL), Shea Homes, D.R. Horton (DHI) and the others as the ramp up their marketing and production.  When construction comes back, that is a very good sign that you, our client, is making excellent investment choices when buying below the cost of construction. Jason's key phrase/metric is "Regression to Replacement Cost(TM)" http://www.jasonhartman.com/2011-trend-predictions-in-real-estate/ and it will serve you well in these changing times.
Some market profile information from Wikipedia: Memphis is a city in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Tennessee, and the county seat of Shelby County. The city is located on the 4th Chickasaw Bluff, south of the confluence of the Wolf and Mississippi rivers.

Memphis had a population of 662,897 at the 2010 census, making it the largest city in the state of Tennessee, the third largest in the Southeastern United States, and the 20th largest in the United States. The greater Memphis metropolitan area, including adjacent counties in Mississippi and Arkansas, had a 2010 population of 1,316,100. This makes Memphis the second largest metropolitan area in Tennessee, surpassed only by metropolitan Nashville, which has overtaken Memphis in recent years. Memphis is the youngest of Tennessee's major cities. A resident of Memphis is referred to as a Memphian, and the Memphis region is known, particularly to media outlets, as the "Mid-South".</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman interviews returning guest and founder and CEO, Harry Dent, Jr., of HS Dent, an economic think tank and research company, about the next coming crash. For more details, listen at:  www.JasonHartman.com. Mr. Dent accurately predicted the boom of the 1990s, which was contrary to what many other forecasters predicted. He explains why America is on a path to the next Great Depression through its mounting debt to boost the economy. He talks about how the U.S. creates bubble after bubble in all areas, such as the housing bubble, the gold and silver bubble, the commodity bubble, etc. Trillions of dollars in stimulus money has poured forth from the government, along with the lowering of interest rates, thereby inciting inflation that will continue to grow with the current system of bailouts and lack of lending. He also discusses the peaks and deflation of spending with the switch between the Baby Boomer and current generations, and how this will affect America's economic future. Mr. Dent also paints the dark picture of China’s future, where they are overbuilding just to keep their workers employed, which will become a worldwide crisis when their building bubble bursts. Jason and Mr. Dent talk about the condition of other countries and how everything interplays to lead to the next crash that Mr. Dent forecasts. He suggests some strategies for investors and what people might expect.

Using exciting new research developed from years of hands-on business experience, Harry S. Dent, Jr. offers a refreshingly positive and understandable view of the economic future. As a bestselling author on economics, Mr. Dent is the developer of The Dent Method - an economic forecasting approach based on changes in demographic trends. In all of his past books since 1989, Dent saw an end to the Baby Boom spending cycle around the end of this decade. In his book, The Great Depression Ahead, (Free Press, 2009), Harry Dent outlined how this next great downturn is likely to unfold in three stages, with an interim boom stage between 2012 and 2017 before the long-term slowdown finally turns into the next global boom in the early 2020s. He continued to educate audiences about his predictions for the next and possibly last great bull market, from late 2005 into early to mid 2010. Since 1992 he has authored two consecutive best sellers, The Roaring 2000s and The Roaring 2000s Investor (Simon and Schuster). In his latest book, The Next Great Bubble Boom, he offers a comprehensive forecast for the next two decades and explains how fundamental trends suggest strong growth ahead, followed by a longer-term economic contraction. Mr. Dent also publishes the HS Dent Forecast newsletter, which offers current analysis of economic and financial market trends.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and Investor Watchdog, Jack Waymire, for a discussion concerning the ethics of the financial services industry. According to Jack, the frequent lack of integrity undermines the achievement of investors’ financial goals. For more details, listen at:  www.JasonHartman.com. Companies do not do what is best for you. They are very good at hiding information that they do not want their investors to know. Investor Watchdog investigates these companies and products, acting as a go-between for investors and advisors, answering frequently asked questions, such as, “How do I know I’m getting the right financial advice?” Jack shares examples of deceptive practices by various companies and how the executives that run the companies, i.e. Goldman Sachs, are insulated from accountability simply by paying fines rather than serving jail time for unethical and illegal practices.  Jason and Jack touch on the subject of the Madoff Ponzi Scheme, where Jack talks about some of the evidence that was found, as a glaring example of unethical sales pitches and conman tactics. Jack also informs listeners of what deceptive sales practices to watch out for when dealing with financial advisors.

Jack entered the financial services industry as a financial consultant in 1976 for Warburg, Paribas Becker. He provided financial advice to companies, public entities, Taft-Hartley funds, endowments, and foundations with assets exceeding $7 billion. After spending two years with an investment firm, Jack co-founded Lexington Capital Management in 1983, a money management firm that wholesaled its services through wirehouses and regional broker-dealers. In 1989, Jack also founded a broker-dealer and built a national retail distribution system to market its products and services. Between 1996 and 2003, Lexington was sold to two larger financial service and technology companies. In his last position, Jack was President of Sungard Advisor Technologies. During these 20 years, Jack worked with thousands of investors and financial advisors and was responsible for providing services to individual investors with billions of dollars of assets.

In 2004, Jack left the financial services industry to market a book he authored: Who’s Watching Your Money? The 17 Paladin Principles for Selecting a Financial Advisor. Published in December, 2003, by John Wiley &amp; Sons, his book was widely regarded as the first to provide an objective process investors could use to select higher quality advisors and to avoid the risks and consequences of bad advice from lower quality advisors. In 2004, Jack co-founded PaladinRegistry.com, a website that took selected content from his book and made it available to investors over the Internet. Later in 2004, a Registry of pre-screened, five star rated financial planners and financial advisors was added to the website. Paladin became the first online firm that vetted financial professionals for investors and provided comprehensive documentation for their credentials, ethics, business practices, and services. In 2008, Jack was instrumental in the development this blog site (InvestorWatchdog.com) that reports on investment risks that result from ethical conflicts in the financial services industry. Jack has appeared on CNNfn and over 100 national, regional, and local radio shows to talk about the subject matter of his book, the risk and consequences of bad advice, and Paladin’s free online solutions. He is also widely quoted in the print media including Forbes, BusinessWeek, Worth, and Kiplinger and is a columnist for Worth Magazine.

		<itunes:summary>Despite popular belief, China is no longer a cheap place to do business with labor costs and real estate costs soaring. Join Jason Hartman as he interviews Shaun Rein, author of The End of Cheap China and Managing Director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai, about debunking common myths, such as China is stealing U.S. jobs. Many companies have begun doing business in China, due to what Shaun refers to as “capitalism on steroids.”  Tune into www.JasonHartman.com for more details. Labor costs have increased in China to the tune of around 20 percent, and the government is trying to increase wages yearly over the next five years. Another factor affecting manufacturing costs over time is that fewer of the younger generation wants to be employed in manufacturing jobs, wanting to realize their white class dreams. China is also pushing middle class development to offset the manufacturing issue.
Shaun Rein is the Managing Director of CMR, the world's leading strategic market intelligence firm. He is one of the world's recognized thought leaders on strategy consulting.

He is a columnist for Forbes on Leadership, Marketing, and China and for BusinessWeek's Asia Insight section. He is often featured in the Wall Street Journal, the Harvard Business Review, The Economist, The Financial Times, Newsweek International, Bloomberg, Time, and the New York Times. He is regularly interviewed by American Public Radio's Marketplace and NPR. He frequently appears to deliver commentary on CNBC's Squawk Box, Bloomberg TV, CBS News, and CNN International TV. Before founding CMR, he was the Chief of Research for venture capital firm Inter-Asia Venture Management. He also was the Managing Director, Country Head China for e-learning software company WebCT where he also ran the company's Taiwan and South Korean operations. He also served as the Assistant Director of the Centre for East Asian Research at McGill University. He earned his Master's degree from Harvard University focused on China's economy and received a BA Honours from McGill University.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and consulting economist, John Williams, for a discussion about how government statistics don’t paint the whole picture of economic conditions.  Listen at: www.JasonHartman.com for more details. Many years ago, John realized that GNP (now GDP) numbers were faulty, causing his clients’ sales forecasting models to no longer work. This eventually led John into lengthy research of the history and nature of the government’s economic reporting. John explains how the numbers reported by the government hide important information; for example, true unemployment rates, which fail to include the unemployed no longer receiving unemployment benefits and those who are underemployed. Inflation statistics are misrepresented, which affects GDP. Following changes in CPI methodology, the Consumer Price Index understates inflation significantly. John points out that cost of living increases were based on inflation data, but with the numbers so skewed, the increases are no longer representative of the actual costs. He provides a history of how these changes came about and how it has affected commerce, social security and payroll. John feels roughly seven percentage points should be added to real inflation rates in our current economy.
Walter J. "John" Williams was born in 1949. He received an A.B. in Economics, cum laude, from Dartmouth College in 1971, and was awarded a M.B.A. from Dartmouth's Amos Tuck School of Business Administration in 1972, where he was named an Edward Tuck Scholar. During his career as a consulting economist, John has worked with individuals as well as Fortune 500 companies. He has been doing private consulting for nearly 30 years and is a specialist in government economic reporting.
John’s research into the government’s statistics took place over a number of years, during which he conducted surveys among business economists as to the quality of government statistics, and his results led to front page stories in the New York Times and Investors Business Daily, considerable coverage in the broadcast media and a joint meeting with representatives of all the government’s statistical agencies. Despite minor changes to the system, government reporting has deteriorated sharply in the last decade or so.
At the request of his old friend, the late Doug Gillespie, John wrote a series of articles on the quality of government statistics. The response to those writings (the Primer Series) was so strong that he started Shadow Government Statistics in 2004. He publishes a newsletter as part of his private economic consulting services.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and co-founder and director of Neuro Leadership Institute, Dr. David Rock, as they explore conceptual issues of the brain as it pertains to work, such as focus, managing distractions, why our brains feel taxed, and how to maximize mental resources. Listen at: www.JasonHartman.com. Dr. Rock explains how being able to get a mental picture makes it easier to process and hold information, but when you can’t come up with a mental picture, you’re more likely to lose your train of thought or have more difficulty retaining connections, causing the brain more stress.  Dr. Rock also discusses optimal times for scheduling work, meetings, and undisturbed workspace.  He stresses that creative work needs a lot of space in the brain, as well as a lot of quiet. “Creative work first, urgent/important second, and everything else after,” says Dr. Rock. Dr. Rock also shares the many types of quirks of the brain, such as a blue room with high ceilings increases creativity, or changing rooms actually makes it difficult to access memories formed in the previous room. His suggestion is that people need to create their own workspace.  Additionally, he talks about the unconscious and conscious brain and how breakthrough moments tend to happen when trying to solve a difficult problem.  The quiet brain is most important for solving problems. Dr. Rock delves into the five domains that the brain is always tracking. It is very important that we don’t get a “threat” response in any of these domains because they activate the brain’s pain network, leading to defensiveness.

		<itunes:summary>Many demographic changes are taking place, with the Baby Boomers, a large generation, retiring, and Generation Y, a larger generation than the Baby Boomers, consuming at record levels.  Join Jason Hartman and demographer, Ken Gronbach, as they discuss this upcoming “storm.” Listen at: www.JasonHartman.com. Ken describes Generation Y as an exciting generation, where the United States is the only country with this large of a group at the present time, and that it is very important that businesses recognize and anticipate their markets as Generation Y grows up. Generation X is more of a mystery generation because of its smaller size, which makes it less of a valuable market.  Ken believes that the United States’ best days are ahead as people bail out of the European Union. He also believes that China’s economic future is bleak due to artificial tampering with the population, with demographic numbers showing China in trouble economically within ten years, struggling to feed themselves within 15 years.

Ken shows how the housing market is being held hostage by big bank foreclosures and why this log jam will soon correct and precipitate a restoration of the United States economy. Ken also talks about how manufacturing will return to the United States with a vengeance because the United States is the only industrialized nation with a huge young highly skilled workforce. Kenneth W. Gronbach is a gifted keynote speaker and a nationally recognized expert and futurist in the field of Demography and Generational Marketing. Ken entertains his audiences with his own special brand of wit, humor and clear communication. He makes the science of shifting demography come alive with real life examples that make it relevant to today’s culture, business climate and economy.  In his book “Age Curve, How to Profit from the Coming Demographic Storm”, published by The American Management Association, Ken takes you through a fascinating common sense understanding of shifting demography and the related opportunities and challenges. The demographic landscape in the United States is made up a series of waves that are about twenty years in duration. It would follow that business will rise and fall according to the critical mass of customers heading toward it. Ken’s latest book “Decades of Difference, Making it Work” (HRD Press), about the United States workforce, was released in October 2010. Ken also writes for the CNBC Guest Blog.

Ken's perspective is macro, a view from 30,000 feet, and very big picture. Demographers are able to forecast markets, societal phenomena, and economics with uncanny accuracy because they count people, not money or things. For example crime has been down in the United States for the last twenty years because the number of high risk crime committers (men 15 to 30 years old) has been low and fully employed. This is because the fertility in the United States dipped sharply between 1965 and 1984 creating a deficit in our population of about nine million people. This shortage of young people in the labor force also drove labor costs up and manufacturing off shore. Ken says the Age Curve will change the way businesses market to consumers and that a sea of entrepreneurial business starts will rule as the economy turns around.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman as he opens with some thoughts on buying far below construction or replacement costs sharing an email from Allstate Insurance, then a discussion of an Orange County Register article citing Marcus &amp; Millichap's 2012 National Apartment Report. You'll hear  Michael LeBeouf's best-selling book, The Greatest Management Principle in the World, where he discusses human behavior and how "What Gets Rewarded, Gets Repeated." In the news: Underwater borrowers eligible for settlement write-downs. A calculation by a Brookings Institution economist narrowed down a pool of underwater homeowners to 500,000 who could qualify for principal reduction from the $25 billion mortgage settlement. Using the parameters of the settlement, Ted Gayer found just 5% of the nation's 11.1 million underwater borrowers could get the principal reduced on their mortgage, first reported by The Washington Post. About $10 billion of the settlement, in the form of credits, will go toward principal write-downs made by the five
banks. Only homeowners delinquent on their mortgages are eligible. Gayer eliminated others according to underlying requirements, including Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans and homes not owner-occupied. It's a rough calculation, Gayer warned, and he made some assumptions in the process. He eliminated any loans not held on the banks' balance sheets, as well as any with a second loan. Mortgage bondholders may not take kindly to principal write-downs, he said.

		<itunes:summary>Whether you’re trying to get a raise at your job, solve a relationship problem, or deal with a stubborn child, negotiating is a daily part of our lives, and every human interaction is affected by emotion and logic or rationalization. Jason Hartman interviews the author of Getting More, Stuart Diamond on improving negotiating skills and interactions with others in order to “get more.” Stuart stresses the importance of making the human connection and finding the pictures in people’s heads, knowing them better in order to better meet their needs, which gives a person a more competitive edge and adds tremendous wealth to any deal. Listen at:  www.JasonHartman.com. Emotions play a huge part in all interactions. “Emotions destroy negotiations because they distract people from their goals,” says Stuart. When people get emotional, they stop listening, and it becomes a priority to find out a person’s emotional temperature before proceeding on any deal. Stuart talks about key points in how people should treat one another, stating how people today have a lack of trust in one another and have a tendency to demonize one another rather than using simple solutions to solve conflicts. “Fighting is the last choice; not the first choice,” explains Stuart. Stuart Diamond has taught and advised on negotiation and cultural diversity to corporate and government leaders in more than 40 countries, including in Eastern Europe, former Soviet Republics, China, Latin America, the Middle East, Canada, South Africa and the United States. He holds an M.B.A. with honors from Wharton Business School, ranked #1 globally by The Financial Times where he is currently a professor from practice. For more than 90% of the semesters over the past 15 years his negotiation course has been the most popular in the school based on the course auction, and he has won multiple teaching awards. He has taught negotiation at Harvard Law School, from which he holds a law degree and is a former Associate Director of the Harvard Negotiation Project. He has directed a negotiation consulting firm in Cambridge, MA.

Mr. Diamond is president of Global Strategy Group, which advises companies and governments on negotiating foreign investment and devising strategies, structures and marketing to compete effectively on an international scale: essentially the skills of planning and persuasion. He advises senior corporate and government officials on building internal coalitions and harmony to be more effective and competitive in an environment of constant change. He has analyzed competitive and persuasive strategies for organizations as different as Merck, Citibank, General Electric, BASF, Prudential, the Government of Colombia, a $16 billion petrochemical company in China and scientists in Ukraine. He advises U.S. and foreign companies on developing more effective communications and media relations, strategic focus, problem-solving, creative options, and persuading vendors and customers. He is an expert in cross-cultural negotiation and has advised on the subject to executives of some of the world's leading companies. He has consulted extensively for the United Nations. In a prior career Mr. Diamond, who also holds a B.A. in English from Rutgers University, was a journalist. He wrote extensively, including at Newsday and The New York Times, where he won the Pulitzer Prize as a part of a team investigating the crash of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. He covered many major crises including the Bhopal chemical leak in India, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania and the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the former Soviet Union. He has written two books, two documentary films and more than 2,000 published articles, dozens on page one of The New York Times. He has appeared on Today and Good Morning America and lectured widely about the problems and prospects of emerging markets, and international business challenges in an environment of change.

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman interviews author, Amity Shlaes, about her book, “The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression.” Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke of the forgotten man as the man at the bottom of the economic pyramid, the poor man, the homeless man. Miss Shlaes explains that there is another forgotten man, the taxpayer, based on an algebraic description by William Graham Sumner. For more details, listen at: www.JasonHartman.com. Jason and Miss Shlaes explore the concept that the Great Depression was man-made, that the Federal government suppressed the economy and the markets, which slowed recovery. A zombie-like economy has ensued in America, very similar to what happened with Japan’s economic downfall, which is still recovering two decades later. Miss Shlaes also shares how the collective or community aspect, particularly farms, encouraged and funded by the government, did not work because of bad stewardship – nobody cared about anything because nobody owned anything. In order for people to care and succeed, they must be allowed to own property, own businesses, and own their homes. Amity Shlaes and Jason move on to discuss “The Greedy Hand,” as it refers to taxation. As Miss Shlaes researched the history of The Greedy Hand, she found that Americans initially resisted tax withholding, that it was not just accepted. Over time, taxation has become extremely complex, and the best solution would be to simplify it again. Miss Shlaes also shares her predictions on inflation for 2012. She encourages people to read, to educate themselves and their children. Amity Shlaes is a syndicated columnist for Bloomberg and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. In addition to writing on political economy, she writes on taxes. She is a contributor to Marketplace, the public radio show. She has appeared on numerous radio and television shows over the years. Miss Shlaes was formerly a columnist for the Financial Times and, before that a member of the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, specializing in economics. In the early 1990s she served as the Journal's features, or "op ed" editor. Prior to that, she followed the collapse of communism for the Wall Street Journal/Europe. Over the years she has published in the National Review, the New Republic, Foreign Affairs (on the German economy), the American Spectator, the Suddeutsche Zeitung and Die Zeit. In 2002, she contributed an article on the US tax code to the thirtieth anniversary anthology of Tax Notes, the scholarly journal.

Miss Shlaes has twice been a finalist for the Loeb Prize in commentary, her field's best known prize. In 2002, she was co-winner of the Frederic Bastiat Prize, an international prize for writing on political economy. In 2003, she spent several months at the American Academy in Berlin as the JP Morgan Fellow for finance and economy. In 2004, she gave the Bradley lecture at the American Enterprise Institute. Her essay, titled "The Chicken vs the Eagle" looked at the effect of the National Recovery Administration on the entrepreneur in the New Deal. She is the author of The Greedy Hand (Random House/Harvest paperback), a national bestseller on America's experience with its tax code. She is also the author of Germany: The Empire Within (Farrar, Straus), a book about German national identity. In 2004, she was, with the late Robert L. Bartley, co-author of the contribution on tax philosophy to "Turning Intellect to Influence," an anthology chronicling the progress of free-market ideas as advanced by the Manhattan Institute. Amity Shlaes is a trustee of the American Institute in Contemporary German Studies; she sits on the jury for the American Academy's fellows as well as the jury for the Bastiat Prize.

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and client, Patrick, for a timely discussion about the benefits of real estate investing. Patrick shares his experiences working with Jason Hartman and Platinum Properties Investor Network’s investment counselors. For details, listen at:  http://www.JasonHartman.com. Patrick tells younger people, “If you can have ten houses by the time you’re 30, you’ll be set when you’re 60.” Staying power – a buy-and-hold philosophy – is the key to successful real estate investing. Patrick and Jason talk about the importance of having all of the facts about local markets before purchasing a property so that the property makes sense the day you buy it. Due diligence includes such factors as property taxes, employment, location to schools and shopping centers, crime rate, and in- and out-migration from an area, just to name a few. Patrick talks about the downside of speculating on properties, using his own experience with a rental home in California as an example, and encourages due diligence and diversification. The current economy is producing a larger number of tenants as more and more homeowners are forced out of their homes through foreclosures. This is creating a larger market for rental property, but not all markets are viable.

Jason and Patrick also discuss the importance of going where the customers are going to have the easiest time and a good experience, rather than being loyal to a market that is no longer providing a good return. Jason is a firm believer that the investment has to work in real life, not just on paper. In the latter portion of the show, Patrick discusses the pros and cons of a college education and how true learning takes place in the real world. It seems that many young people go to college for the wrong fields and find themselves in massive student loan debt, with a limited number of jobs in their field and with an entitlement attitude, which sets them up for disappointment in the real world. Jason and Patrick encourage entrepreneurship and adopting an attitude of gratitude. Be sure to check out our prior shows with Richard Kiyosaki, G.

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman interviews author, former Wall Street senior banker, and best-selling investigative journalist, William (Bill) D. Cohan on the events that led up to the current economic crisis. Bill explains the choices that the big firms, such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc, made regarding what type of institution they were going to be, the path of these firms that led up to the current crisis, and how they used the bailout money gifted to them. He said it was one big party on Wall Street, during which brokers were to bring in revenue using a lot of whacky products, until everything came crashing down. Huge bonuses were paid out from the revenue collected from unsuspecting clients. For more details, listen at:  www.JasonHartman.com. Bill and Jason also discuss the Occupy Wall Street Movement. Bill expressed disappointment in the message of the movement, saying it isn’t clear and they need to learn how Wall Street really works so that they can be more effective in bringing about reform. Wall Street has been influencing what goes on in Washington and paying lobbyists and donating to congressional coffers so that they can get the regulations, or lack thereof, that they want, i.e. the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Bill talks about how the expansion of Wall Street into Middle Class America was not an accident, using the example of Merrill Lynch being a public company. This ultimately led to broken trust between Wall Street and Main Street, as people have now shied away from risk taking.

To solve the problems, Bill suggests changing the incentive system on Wall Street, in that it can no longer be okay to take huge risks with people’s money or get paid big bonuses whether they lose money for the firms or not, as well as going back to having to use their partner’s capital to operate. William D. Cohan offers audiences a unique, close-up perspective of the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. He combines deep knowledge of the investment banking world with the fine storytelling skills of an award-winning investigative journalist. Bill’s new book is titled Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came To Rule The World, a revelatory history of Goldman Sachs. His previous book, House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street, lays out in gory detail how the financial crisis began with the collapses of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. The Last Tycoons: The Secret History of Lazard Frères &amp; Co. won the 2007 Financial Times/Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award for its candid revelations about how Wall Street works. He should know; he spent six years at the firm. Bill Cohan has a long-time insider’s in-depth knowledge of investment banking—he was a Wall Street banker for 17 years. In addition to his years as Associate and then Vice President at Lazard Frères, he was a Director in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Group at Merrill Lynch and a Managing Director at JPMorgan Chase. He left JPMorgan to write The Last Tycoons, which appeared on the bestseller lists of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today. It edged out Alan Greenspan’s Age of Turbulence to win the FT/Goldman Sachs award. Bloomberg.com and The Evening Standard named it Book of the Year. William D. Cohan writes regularly for The New York Times, Vanity Fair, Fortune, The Daily Beast, ArtNews, and The Financial Times. His columns have also appeared in The Washington Post. He is a contributing editor for Bloomberg TV and is a contributor to Bloomberg View. His series of articles on the controversy of the ‘recently discovered’ Degas plaster casts in ARTNews won the Silurians 2011 Excellence in Journalism Award.

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and returning guest, Ellen Brown, author of Web of Debt, for a discussion of the United States’ debt ceiling, QE2, inflation, as well as a brief explanation of how money came to equal debt. Ellen explains why the debt ceiling is unconstitutional, how the government is legally committed to paying its debts. She points out the contradiction that has been for more than 100 years, since WWI. The easing put into place at that time was only to be a temporary measure. For more information, listen at:  www.JasonHartman.com. Ellen also talks about shadow banking causing the crisis by money being lent into existence, slight of hand. The only real money are coins, which are one-tenth of the total money in circulation. Ellen also discusses QE2 , where the government agreed to pay the interest on borrowed money in order to maintain control of the Federal Funds rate. She said there are a lot of reserve funds on the books in certain foreign banks, including bond dealers, that is just being held.  Ellen also touches on the national debt, Glass-Steagall, and proposes state-owned banks as part of the solution, with the basic idea that we take care of our own, much the same way that Japan is reliant on their own Central Bank.

Ellen Brown developed her research skills as an attorney practicing civil litigation in Los Angeles. In Web of Debt, her latest book, she turns those skills to an analysis of the Federal Reserve and "the money trust." She shows how this private cartel has usurped the power to create money from the people themselves, and how we the people can get it back. Brown developed an interest in the developing world and its problems while living abroad for eleven years in Kenya, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. She returned to practicing law when she was asked to join the legal team of a popular Tijuana healer with an innovative cancer therapy, who was targeted by the chemotherapy industry in the 1990s. That experience produced her book Forbidden Medicine, which traces the suppression of natural health treatments to the same corrupting influences that have captured the money system. Brown's eleven books include the bestselling Nature's Pharmacy, co-authored with Dr. Lynne Walker, which has sold 285,000 copies.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and relationship expert, Gay Hendricks as they discuss relationships in the 21st Century, both personal and business.

It starts with making a formal commitment to bringing the ideal relationships into your life. Gay also talks about his work with entrepreneurs, from getting focused on what you love to do and putting creative exhilaration in first place, from which you will figure out how to make what you do produce revenue. In addition, Jason and Gay discuss the definition of integrity, as well as the steps to becoming a person of integrity.

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman invites prior guest Joel Grasmeyer  back on the show to talk about updates to one of the greatest software tools for property investors, Property Tracker.  For more details, listen at:  www.JasonHartman.com. Joel started PropertyTracker.com in 2004 after creating and using this software himself to evaluate and keep track of his own investment properties. Property Tracker is a two-part tool, like having a property analysis tool in your pocket. The Property Evaluator tool allows you to analyze and compare properties in which you’re interested, providing a one-year projection on cash flow, cap rate, and return on investment, and a multi-year projection on true rate of return. The Property Tracker tool help keep track of the performance of properties you already own, based on actual income and expenses rather than projections. It also provides an “instrument panel” to let you see when it’s time to buy, hold, sell, or even do a 1031 Exchange. At the end of the year, this tool allows you to print up a Schedule E. Recent enhancements allow the investor to email PDFs to lenders or investment partners directly from your iPhone. Real estate agents can add their own branding to the cover page, heading and footer of the report and email it to potential investors.

With the introduction of the iPad, Property Evaluator became even easier to use, with the ability to input more information with full-screen PDF capabilities to email reports directly from the iPad, as well as print the reports from the iPhone and iPad. Available products are the web-based Property Evaluator and Property Tracker, and the standalone apps for iPad, iPhone, and Mac, which is just a one-time fee. There are three versions for the iPhone and iPad:  Standard, Premium and Pro editions. Jason highly recommends the software for its multiple uses and benefits at such an affordable price. Jason and Joel also discuss other investment related issues, such as the Affordability Index, cap rates, interest rates, and the different approaches to valuation of properties.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>With an insurmountable national debt and a disastrous worldwide economy, could the United States still come out top dog? Join Jason Hartman and returning guest, Daniel Ameduri, inflation expert and Chief Strategist of FutureMoneyTrends.com, as they examine the possibilities and talk about Daniel’s predictions for the new year. Daniel explains the difference between price inflation, which, though we have inflation, we aren’t seeing it in everything yet, and hyperinflation, which is a total loss of faith in currency. He talks about how if we have deflationary shock, it won’t matter what the Federal Reserve does. People around the world will lose faith in America and the dollar will become worthless, and feels there will be some type of quantitative easing. Daniel notes that, in his opinion, the $20 trillion mark in our national debt will be the psychological level at which people stop buying our debt. Jason and Daniel also talk about resource wars as resources are becoming scarce. According to real data, oil has peaked, silver has peaked, as well as many other natural resources.
Jason and Daniel also discuss this possibly being the year of Ron Paul, whether he wins in the Presidential primaries or not, simply based on his foreign policy solutions. One thing Daniel notes is that our government redistributes our taxed incomes all over the world. Americans get caught up in the debate over a tax base, but Daniel says, “Hey, you’re fighting over your own money!” But Daniel is also optimistic in saying that the U.S. still has an advantage over the rest of the world due to our business base, large military, and the largest store of gold. We’re still going to go through hard times, but it’s still possible the U.S. can come out on top. The dollar is losing its value as other countries trade in their own currencies. Daniel expresses that a complete currency crisis now is to the U.S.’s advantage. The U.S. needs to do a currency reset and back the dollar with gold again. He also feels gold will be higher due to quantitative easing, the Euro crisis, and Iran. Visit: www.JasonHartman.com
Jason and Daniel’s final words of advice are don’t be distracted by pop culture. Pay attention to what is really going on in our country and around the world.
Daniel Ameduri is a free-market thinker and inflation expert. His market calls are firmly rooted in free-market economics theory - the theory master economist Dr. Ludwig von Mises brought the world decades ago. Like von Mises, Daniel understands that government's monopoly over money and banking is utterly misguided and is distorting credit markets. Its intervention is disastrous and dangerous as it churns out more dollars and generates unsustainable booms and busts. Daniel carries on von Mises' legacy, bringing investors eye-opening, no-holds-barred analysis, market calls that are dead-to-rights, and strategies for investing that protect personal wealth during turbulent times. Daniel has been featured on RT TV, Power Hour, Financial Sense and on over 100 radio shows. He is currently the editor of FutureMoneyTrends.com and was formerly with NIA. Appearing on MSNBC, CNBC and KTLA News, inflation expert Daniel Ameduri calls it like he sees it... and he sees it pretty clearly. Daniel was one of the first to call the market crash of 2008... and the collapse of both Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. Daniel went on to start Future Money Trends in 2010... and it has quickly become one of the top websites for the gold and silver markets. In addition to providing cutting edge research about macro-economic trends, Daniel regularly profiles micro-cap companies with explosive upside... rare gems with the potential to make investors rich.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman as he interviews author and financial journalist Roger Lowenstein regarding the history of Wall Street’s demise. Roger talks about the increases in choice, risk, hedging, more volatility, and how free markets are open to speculation, greed, fear and manipulation. There are more markets today susceptible to booms and busts. In the old days, local bankers determined loan eligibility. Today, bankers internationally, who don’t know anything about their clientele, determine eligibility, often to the detriment of the borrowers. For more details, listen at: www.JasonHartman.com. Roger and Jason debate whether Wall Street needs more regulation or deregulation, and discuss the consequences of government interference. They also talk about many of the Wall Street mistakes and the corporations that were rescued by the bailouts and the unprecedented number of failed mortgages.  They end their discussion with observations of the Occupy Wall Street movement.

Roger Lowenstein graduated from Cornell University and was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal for more than a decade, including two years writing it’s “Heard on the Street” column. He has published five books, including The End of Wall Street, When Genius Fails, and Buffet: The Making of an American Capitalist. He is also the director of Sequoia Fund. Roger is the son of Helen and Louis Lowenstein. His father was an attorney and Columbia University law professor who wrote books and articles critical of the American financial industry. Roger himself has also written numerous financial articles.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and Andrew “Ranting Andy” Hoffman, Miles Franklin’s Marketing Director, as they discuss the new game on Wall Street with its evil derivatives and destructive investment advice. Andy says Wall Street is no longer in the business of destroying retailers. Ever since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, they’ve been in the business of destroying countries and taking power. Andy talks about Goldman-Sachs infiltration into political positions in other countries, and the infiltration into municipalities by other big Wall Street thugs, such as JP Morgan. For more details, please visit: www.JasonHartman.com. There is no more retail stock market and the consequence is record unemployment numbers. The government has been in bed with Wall Street and pushing out propaganda for years, but people are fed up with the game and the government is on the defensive.

Andy also shares his expertise about the Gold Cartel and explains how the COMEX is a charade, controlled by the likes of Goldman-Sachs, causing people to lose confidence in the trades due to the wide spread between paper and physical gold. Andy warns that we need to protect ourselves as people become more disgruntled and distrusting, while the potential exists for the government to respond by tightening down the shackles with economic and perhaps even military martial law. Andy calls this the “end game” and people need to be prepared as citizens and nations lose their sovereignty. The paradigms that everyone has been taught about stock markets and home ownership don’t apply anymore. Things are falling apart right now as the dollar continues to lose value through the non-stop printing presses.  The only real money is in the form of gold and silver, and only if you own it physically. It’s time to simplify.

Andrew ("Andy") Hoffman, CFA, joined Miles Franklin as Marketing Director in October 2011.  For a decade, he was a U.S.-based buy-side and sell-side analyst, most notably as an II-ranked oil service analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.  Since 2002, his focus has been entirely on Precious Metals, and since 2007 has written under the moniker "Ranting Andy."  Prior to joining the company, he spent five years working as an Investor Relations officer or consultant to numerous junior mining companies.  An archive of Andy's "RANTS" can be found on the Miles Franklin Blog.</itunes:summary>

When should you walk away? How can you minimize foreclosure consequences? Please visit: www.JasonHartman.com.  Chad R. Ruyle has been interviewed by journalists for CBS 60 Minutes, ABC Nightline, The Today Show on NBC, Dylan Ratigan, and NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams to name a few.  Ruyle is also a partner at the Law Firm of Ruyle&amp; Ruyle in San Diego and has incorporated his extensive legal background into YouWalkAway.com.  He sees mortgage defaulting as a business transaction not an emotional decision.  Mortgage contracts are written with addressing potential foreclosures – clearly stating if the borrower ceases to make payments, the bank will take the house back. Ruyle focuses his practice on all areas of trusts and estates, business planning, and real estate transactions.

Wikipedia definition: A derivative instrument is a contract between two parties that specifies conditions—in particular, dates and the resulting values of the underlying variables—under which payments, or payoffs, are to be made between the parties.[1][2]

Under U.S. law and the laws of most developed countries, derivatives have special legal exemptions which make them a particularly attractive legal form through which to extend credit. [3] However, the strong creditor protections afforded to derivatives counterparties--in combination with their complexity and lack of transparency--can cause capital markets to underprice credit risk. This can contribute to credit booms, and increase systemic risks. [3] Indeed, the use of derivatives to mask credit risk from third parties while protecting derivative counterparties contributed to both the financial crisis of 2008 in the United States and the European sovereign debt crises in Greece and Italy. [3][4] Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives--including greater access to government guarantees--while minimizing disclosure to broader financial markets. [5]

One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the Dojima Rice Exchange since the eighteenth century.[6] Derivatives are broadly categorized by the relationship between the underlying asset and the derivative (e.g., forward, option, swap); the type of underlying asset (e.g., equity derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, interest rate derivatives, commodity derivatives, or credit derivatives); the market in which they trade (e.g., exchange-traded or over-the-counter); and their pay-off profile.

Derivatives can be used for speculating purposes ("bets") or to hedge ("insurance"). For example, a speculator may sell deep in-the-money naked calls on a stock, expecting the stock price to plummet, but exposing himself to potentially unlimited losses. Very commonly, companies buy currency forwards in order to limit losses due to fluctuations in the exchange rate of two currencies.

Third parties can use publicly available derivatives prices as educated predictions of uncertain future outcomes, for example, the likelihood that a corporation will default on its debts. [7]

Derivatives are used by investors to:

provide leverage (or gearing), such that a small movement in the underlying value can cause a large difference in the value of the derivative;[8]
speculate and make a profit if the value of the underlying asset moves the way they expect (e.g., moves in a given direction, stays in or out of a specified range, reaches a certain level);
hedge or mitigate risk in the underlying, by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out;[9]
obtain exposure to the underlying where it is not possible to trade in the underlying (e.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and Doug Casey of Casey Research for a candid discussion about the condition of America and what is to come. Doug feels we needed a depression, but it doesn’t have to be as long and dismal as it’s going to be for most people. The U.S. government has gone about everything completely opposite of the right way; it’s totally bankrupt. They’re selling money/debt to the Federal Reserve because no other country in the world wants to buy our devalued American dollar. Doug feels for the average American because he/she is not going to profit from it and is going to be turned into a common serf. Pension funds are in trouble and are nothing more than the government’s scheme to finance its debt. Listen in for more information at www.JasonHartman.com.

We may see more wars in the future as politicians look for someone to blame, as happened in the Great Depression of the 1930s. The rich will be those that own real estate around the world. Doug feels it’s too early to buy U.S. real estate unless it’s bought with low-interest, fixed-rate mortgages because the debt will be inflated away. Sharing a position with Jason, Doug is not a fan of the stock market and feels that commodities are going to eventually bottom out with all of the new nanotechnology. While he’s still bullish on commodities because he’s bearish on the dollar, Doug recommends buying real estate in other parts of the world, using Rothschild’s philosophy of buying when blood is running in the streets. Our biggest enemy is our government, so people must diversify politically, geographically, internationally, and most Americans don’t know anything about it. Looking at stocks, while Doug wants nothing to do with them for the most part, he sees mining stocks moving. They’re relatively cheap right now and while they’re a speculative venture, with thorough research, one can find a few good mining companies that are seeing strong returns.

Inflation is going to get a lot higher because the government has no choice but to print money to pay its debts. It’s the 11th hour and now is the time to act, to position yourself to ride out the storm. Doug’s guess is that when all of this bottoms, mortgage money will not exist and people the world over will have to purchase property with cash. They will be paying real value versus the inflated values of mortgage companies. Doug expresses his concern that our current economic situation is very serious. As he looks around, he doesn’t see any real bargains. We’re still in the eye of the hurricane, and he forecasts that as we go back into the storm, it’s going to be a lot uglier than it was in 2008. He calls this the Greater Depression. This is a time when you don’t want to be rooted to a spot like a plant. In turbulent times, plants usually get eaten up. Doug is a widely respected preeminent authority on “rational speculation,” especially in the high-potential natural resource sector. He is a high respected author, publisher and professional investor, and graduated from Georgetown University in 1968. Since that time, Doug has literally written the book on profiting from times of economic turmoil. He is the author of Crisis Investing, which spent multiple weeks on the New York Times bestseller list in the No. 1 position, and became the best-selling financial book of 1980. Doug also authored Strategic Investing, breaking the record by receiving the largest advance ever paid for a financial book at that time. Doug’s next book, The International Man, was the most sold book in the history of Rhodesia. Doug Casey has been a featured guest on such TV shows and radio shows as David Letterman, Merv Griffin, Charlie Rose, Phil Donahue, Regis Philbin, Maury Povich, NBC News and CNN. He has also been the topic of numerous features in periodicals, such as Time, Forbes, People, and the Washington Post.

Doug divides his time between homes in Aspen, Colorado, Auckland, New Zealand, and Salta Argentina.</itunes:summary>

Hannah Holmes has led an adventurous life since graduating from the University of Southern Maine. She was an editor at the New York-based Garbage Magazine in the late 1980s, after which she returned to Maine to start a freelance writing career. She was a contributor in a variety of magazines.

In the late 1990s, Hannah was recruited by the Discovery Channel Online for an experiment called live internet reporting. This grand experiment led her to distant and uncomfortable parts of the world, from hunting dinosaurs in Mongolia's Gobi desert, to the Montserrat Volcano Observatory, where fine volcanic ash ruined her computer and left her hair like a ball of jute twine. She also piloted the Alvin submarine around "black smokers" a mile and a half under the ocean. It was a glorious era until Discovery.com's plug was pulled. Hannah then went on to author several books, "The Secret Life of Dust," "Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn," and her recent book, "Quirk," about the many fascinating personality types. Hannah's blog can be found at www.HannahHolmes.net.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman interviews Apple’s former Sr. Vice President of Operations and author of The Steve Jobs Way, Jay Elliot about the true legacy of Steve Jobs, discussing real-life examples of Jobs’ leadership and triumphs, and how these principles can apply to other’s lives and careers. More at: www.JasonHartman.com or on iTunes. Apple icon, Steve Jobs, was deemed the “Boy Genius” that transformed with technology the way we work, play, consume, and communicate. For over 35 years, Jay Elliot has practiced his own leadership in the technology, entertainment and health care industries. In his book The Steve Jobs Way, Jay shares with us his first-hand experiences as Apple’s Sr. Vice President of Operations where he worked side-by-side with Steve Jobs on a daily basis. His experience as an executive at both IBM and Intel helped him to recognize how Steve Jobs’ extraordinary leadership propelled Apple Computer to become the most valued brand on earth.

Steve Jobs charged Jay Elliot with the responsibility for running the operations at Apple. That tenure lasted from 1980 to 1986, during which time he was responsible for all corporate operations, including Human Resources, Facilities, Real Estate, IT, Education and Pacific Rim Sales. He was also responsible for Apple’s Corporate Business Planning and was a member of the Macintosh organization. During these years, Apple sales grew from $150 million to more than $3 billion. Prior to his time at Apple, he served as a Site Director at IBM and headed a 16,000-person software division; overseeing several key projects in the disc drive development business. Mr. Elliot left IBM to join Intel where he also served as a Site Director and was the creator of the Intel Foundation (reporting to CEO, Andy Grove and chairman, Gordon Moore). After leaving Apple, Mr. Elliot served as the CEO of San Francisco Studios where he produced the Academy Award-nominated documentary, "Berkeley in the Sixties;" as well as the NBC television series, "Midnight Caller" and numerous sports programs for NBC, CBS, and ABC, including the Barcelona Olympic Games. Later, he served as President of Acclaim West, producing programs for Fox, UPN, the Playboy Channel and Telemundo. Before returning to the technology/software industry, he also served as the Chief Executive Officer of New Health Systems, a network technology company connecting physicians and vendors to patients and affiliated hospitals.

Jay Elliot returned to his technology roots when he founded and served as Chairman of Migo Software, Inc., a mobility software company, where he invented its flagship product, Migo. He is currently the Founder and CEO of Nuvel, Inc. based out of Los Gatos, CA. Nuvel offers the emergency smart phone applications vSOS and vSOS Medi-Vac Plus; and is introducing Data Tunnel, allowing accelerated data transfer, and NuVault, a virtual safety deposit box utilizing smart phone bar code readers.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with Bill Whittle, host of Afterburner, regarding poverty levels in the United States and the strategies that undermine democracy and free markets.  Bill’s opinion is that America has the richest poor people in the world, versus countries like Africa, where millions of people live in dire poverty, with starvation and lack of healthcare. Bill discusses how everything people in the U.S. have ever needed in life is present at birth, including food, shelter, and healthcare. There's no need to want for anything.  Yet people accept their lot in life as the natural order of things. With history on his side, Bill Whittle challenges widely held misconceptions about politics and society. Frequently asking the difficult ethical questions, Bill attempts to underscore conservative values and philosophy through logical reasoning.  Bill Whittle is a writer, pilot, and TV editor who lives and works in Los Angeles, where he hosts Afterburner on PJTV.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman hosts a two-part show where we start with some reflections on the recent "Meet The Masters of Income Property Investing" event at The Hyatt Regency in Irvine, California. Investment Counselors, Ari and Sara join Jason as they discuss the following:

1)   Establish 5 year plan for where you would like to be in 2016

2)   26-27% real unemployment rate

3)   Decline of standard of living for America (ask tenants)

4)   Which entry point are you?



a. Beginning Investor – Optimize rapid growth that can be re-invested for long term compounding

b. Growing Investor – Optimize for stable long term (inflation protected)

c. The short path to retirement - Optimize for low risk and high stability



5) Prime age for spending is 46 years old

6) Gen X is 40 million

7) Gen Y is 80 million people (early 20’s now)

8) New investors should seek returns in the 20-25% range

9) The big problem now is that people are running out of money before they die

10) Social Security will not work (look at Greece). People are living longer too now.

11) Young Investor



a. Huge impact on higher returns early in your investing career (bell curve)

b. New Investors also have the opportunity to cherry pick high return small deals to start their career



12) Investing $1,000 annually (9k) from age 21-30 and letting it compound, or $1,000 per year after 30 years old (35k). Early investor will win.

13) Invest while young and seek safer investments when older.

14) The growing investor



a. Stability matters

b. Inflation creates volatility by disconnecting the nominal (name only) value or real value of assets

c. Income properties are best positioned to create inflation protected, stable growth



15) Investors need to leverage and make debt work for them (redistribute wealth)</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman takes a unique middle ground on the Occupy Wall Street protests since Wall Street doesn't represent capitalism as the right-wing media would have us believe while the left-wing media who supports big government and big unions doesn't represent capitalism either. Both sides are promoting a fairy tale. A recent Facebook post sums it up fairly well: This whole issue really isn't that simple. I assume that most of the protesters are clueless folks who need haircuts; however, so is the conservative media (that I mostly agree with) in saying that Wall Street represents "capitalism" - nothing could be further from the truth, Wall Street, banks and mega-corporations are mostly ANTI-CAPITALISM in that they are playing a rigged game with lobbyists, government cronyism and insider dealings at every level. They use lawyers, accounts and PR firms to commit their crimes. There is very little capitalism on Wall Street. If you're looking for capitalism, look at Main Street, where small business operates under far too much government interference. Jason discusses the powerful "Qualified Written Request" (QWR) letter and how it can be a tool for loan modification, short sale, deed-in-leiu of foreclosure and foreclosure litigation. More info at: http://www.jasonhartman.com/loan-modification-short-sale-q-w-r-letter/ and more on RESPA at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_Written_Request#Qualified_written_request

You'll also hear a short article from Jason's newsletter, The Financial Freedom Report, on that all to upsetting topic of "Too Big to Fail."</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman discusses the destruction of America's great middle class and how to avoid it. Let's not let the USA become a banana republic. Jason recommends the book War on the Middle Class by Lou Dobbs and his interviews with Rich Dad author Garrett Sutton and Jim Rogers and then he talks about and article received from Chris McLaughlin:

Middle class down this decade

The first decade of the 21st century will go down in the history
books as a step back for the American middle class. Last week,
the government made gloomy headlines when it released the latest
census report showing the poverty rate rose to a 17-year high. A
whopping 46.2 million people (or 15.1% of the US population)
live in poverty and 49.9 million live without health insurance.
But the data also gave the first glimpse of what happened to
middle-class incomes in the first decade of the millennium.
While the earnings of middle-income Americans have barely budged
since the mid 1970s, the new data showed that from 2000 to 2010,
they actually regressed. For American households in the middle
of the pay scale, income fell to $49,445 last year, when
adjusted for inflation, a level not seen since 1996. And over
the 10-year period, their income is down 7%.

Unlike the richest Americans, middle class families have most of
their wealth tied up in the equity of their homes, which took a
beating in the recession. And high unemployment has left many
people with little or no other income at all. At the same time
that Americans had less cash to spend, they were also being hit
with rising prices for some crucial items. Even accounting for
inflation, it still costs more to buy a home, fill your gas
tank, go to the doctor and put food on the table than it did
only 10 years ago. And not only is it more expensive to live a
middle-class life, it costs more to get there too. The price of
a college education -- still considered the ticket to higher
wages and a better lifestyle -- has surged over the last decade,
even in spite of the recession. Facing these burdens, the
American Dream is undergoing stark changes, with fewer people
choosing to buy homes and more young people postponing their own
independent lives. The census data showed about 14.2% of all
young people ages 25 to 34 are still living in their parents'
homes this year, compared to about 11.8% before the recession
began in 2007.

		<itunes:summary>At a period in America’s life when all seems insurmountable, what with an astronomical national debt, high unemployment and underemployment, failing small businesses, and controlling corporate interests that don’t seem to have American citizens’ best interest in mind, it’s hard to believe that America is truly rich.  Join Jason Hartman as he interviews Dr. Nick Begich, founder of Earthpulse Press, regarding the true wealth of America.  Only looking at the profit and loss statements of our country and of many businesses conjures up a sense of failure and hopelessness, but Dr. Begich shares his optimism about America’s profitable future, encouraging people to look at the assets sheet, i.e. the vast resources our country boasts.  The mineral wealth alone in this country is enough to retire the national debt, as well as put Americans back to work for a very long time.  Listen in at  http://jasonhartman.com/podcast/ for more details, including practical methods to dispel the environmental concerns of tapping into our natural resources.

Dr. Nick Begich is the eldest son of the late United States Congressman from Alaska, Nick Begich Sr., and political activist Pegge Begich. He is well known in Alaska for his own political activities. He was twice elected President of both the Alaska Federation of Teachers and the Anchorage Council of Education. He has been pursuing independent research in the sciences and politics for most of his adult life. Begich received Doctor of Medicine (Medicina Alternitiva), honoris causa, for independent work in health and political science, from The Open International University for Complementary Medicines, Colombo, Sri Lanka, in November 1994. He co-authored with Jeane Manning the book Angels Don't Play This HAARP; Advances in Tesla Technology. Begich has also authored Earth Rising - The Revolution: Toward a Thousand Years of Peace and his latest book Earth Rising II- The Betrayal of Science, Society and the Soul, both with the late James Roderick. His latest work is Controlling the Human Mind - The Technologies of Political Control or Tools for Peak Performance. Begich has published articles in science, politics and education and is a well known lecturer, having presented throughout the United States and in nineteen countries. He has been featured as a guest on thousands of radio broadcasts reporting on his research activities including new technologies, health and earth science related issues. He has also appeared on dozens of television documentaries and other programs throughout the world including BBC-TV, CBC-TV, TeleMundo, and others.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Whether it’s your spouse, significant other, family, friends, or even business associates, each individual speaks his or her own love language.  “The Five Love Languages” are:  Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.  Understanding which of these languages makes that special someone feel loved can be essential to the success of any relationship.   Join Jason Hartman and renowned author, Dr. Gary Chapman as they discuss these timeless concepts and how our primary language affects our interactions in our relationships.  Please visit: http://www.jasonhartman.com/podcast.

Dr. Gary Chapman seeks to fulfill his call to the ministry as a pastor, speaker, and author. He speaks extensively throughout the U.S. and internationally on marriage, family, and relationships. The government of Singapore invited him to present his marriage seminar there and the Chaplain’s Office of NATO issued a special invitation for Dr. Chapman to speak to the NATO forces in Germany. Other engagements have taken him to England, Africa, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Mexico and Hong Kong. Sales exceeding 5 million copies earned him the Platinum Book Award from the Evangelical Publishers Association for The Five Love Languages, which has been translated into over thirty-six languages. Twenty-seven other books and five video series are also among his publications.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman starts this episode with an update on and new fixed-rate mortgage financing program for IRA investors and foreign nationals. In addition, you'll hear about a change the RSS feed for this podcast in hopes that the change will be seamless and you won't even notice it; however, you know how technology goes sometimes. You'll get an overview of a few properties, a few thoughts on the greater Atlanta, Georgia real estate market and an update on Jason's "Meet The Masters of Income Property Investing" event slated for October at The Hyatt Regency in Irvine, California visit: http://www.jasonhartman.com/meet-the-masters-of-income-property-investing/ for complete details.

The main focus of this episode of The Creating Wealth Show will be: Defending Against The Demons of Investing.

The world of investing involves many considerations. Chief among these are the two "Demons" of investing that must both be defeated in order to realize success. The first demon is risk, and the second is inflation. Risk comes from the fact that future returns are uncertain, and it is not possible to foresee all future events. Investments that seem 'safe' may turn out to have hidden dangers that we did not notice. Risk can never be eliminated, it can only be managed. The best way to do this is by properly diversifying your investments so that they are not all subject to the same market shocks. The second demon of investing is inflation. Inflation is especially difficult because it erodes the value of your dollars. Defeating the demon of inflation requires investment in multi-dimensional assets that are optimized to defeat inflation. Income properties meet this criteria well because the property itself holds real value by nature of the replacement cost of the structure, the loan allows you to have a fixed cost of capital for three decades, and the cash flow is pushed up by inflation while you cost structure remains flat because of the fixed-rate financing.

		<itunes:summary>Join Jason Hartman and coauthor of Aftershock, Robert Wiedemer as they discuss the fundamental underlying problems of printing money, the inevitable results, and how investors can still profit as the world heads toward yet another global economic crisis.  Robert talks about the effects of the government bubble and the dollar bubble, when we can expect these to pop once again, and how these events will affect our government and the world.  To learn more, visit:  http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Mr. Wiedemer is a Managing Director at Absolute Investment Management and co-wrote the landmark book that predicted the current downturn in the economy in 2006, America’s Bubble Economy, published by John Wiley.  As Paul Farrell, Senior Investment Columnist at Dow Jones MarketWatch recently said, “In short, America's Bubble Economy's prediction, though ignored, was accurate.”  Kiplinger’s chose it as one of the best business books of 2006.

His following book, Aftershock, was published by John Wiley in November 2009.  It was chosen by Smart Money magazine as one of the five best investment books of 2009.  Aftershock and America’s Bubble Economy have been the subject of articles in the major press including the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The Hedge Fund Journal, Euromoney, Barrons, Reuters, AP, Bottom Line and others. Aftershock is in its 16th printing and has sold over 250,000 copies. He speaks to groups of investors, financial analysts and economists including the New York Hedge Fund Roundtable, Association for Corporate Growth, The Turnaround Management Association, the World Bank, the CFA Societies of Chicago and San Francisco, and the National Press Club.  He is a frequent commentator on TV including CNBC’s Squawk Box and Fox Business News.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with Daniel Amerman about the likely results of the recent multi-trillion dollar increase in the debt limit. Dan is a Chartered Financial Analyst with MBA and BSBA degrees in finance.  More at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. He is a financial author and speaker with over 25 years of professional experience.   Years of studying the costs of paying for over $100 trillion of US government retirement promises, as well as the costs of cashing out an expected $44 trillion of Boomer pensions and retirement accounts, have convinced him that too many promises and too much paper wealth chasing too few real resources will likely lead to substantial inflation in the years ahead, with potentially devastating implications for many savers and investors.  A problem that will also apply to many other nations.

Mr. Amerman spent much of the 1980s as an investment banker helping Savings &amp; Loans and others try to survive the effects of the last major bout of inflation in the United States.  There is a basic economics principle that much of the public is unaware of – inflation doesn’t directly destroy the real wealth of goods and services, but rather, redistributes the rights to that real wealth (a principle which unfortunately will likely destroy much of the investment wealth the Boomers plan on enjoying in retirement).  The author worked with the effects of billions of dollars of such wealth redistributions, and saw how there was not only a loser for each dollar of wealth redistributed – but a winner.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman gives you a free one hour segment from his Creating Wealth Home Study Course as he discusses "The Ten Commandments of Successful Investing." More at http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/

1. Thou shalt become educated.

Knowledge is a powerful tool. Do your due diligence so that you are your own best advisor.

2. Thou shalt have a professional Investment Counselor.

Only invest with investment professionals who stay with you for the long-term so that you have a single point of contact to coordinate your entire investment plan. Advisors should buy for themselves what they sell, putting their money where their mouth is, and get paid for producing results rather than simply for advice.

3. Thou shalt maintain control.

Never leave your financial future in the hands of incompetent, unethical or greedy brokerage houses, fund managers or corporations. Always be a direct investor.

4. Thou shalt use prudent financial planning techniques.

Always invest with your goals in mind (retirement, financial freedom, creating wealth) and abide by your risk tolerance and investing style.

5. Thou shalt not gamble.

Be a prudent long-term value investor, never a get-rich-quick gambler, speculator or flipper by investing only in properties that make good financial sense the day you buy them.

6. Thou shalt diversify.

Reduce risk and maximize returns by investing in several areas as every market is different.

7. Thou shalt be Area Agnostic™.

Only invest with an advisor who is not partial to any one area or investment to avoid a conflict of interest. Consider a variety of opportunities.

8. Thou shalt borrow to maximize leverage and accelerate wealth creation.

Use as much borrowed money and as little of your own money as possible so long as the borrowed money can be repaid by the tenant. Let other people’s money work for you, reduce your risk and make you wealthy.

9. Thou shalt only invest where there is universal need.

No one needs stocks, bonds or gold but EVERYONE needs a place to live and with growing affluence around the world, consumption of raw materials will continue to cause upward price pressure on improved real estate.

10. Thou shalt invest only in tax-favored assets.

Non-cash write-offs and deductions are money in your pocket and real estate offers the best of both.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with James Anderson, managing director of GoldSilver.com, about the historical cycles of gold and silver and other precious metals, against the monetary cycles.  As the world’s fiat currencies continue to be debased through inflation, regulation, and irresponsible spending, precious metals investing is on the rise.  But do you physically own your gold?  Join Jason and James as they revisit the history of market cycles, talk about where the future of precious metals is heading, and discuss why people must take physical ownership of gold and silver .  Learn more at:  http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/.

Surely, many of you have seen and heard the ads, “We Buy Gold.”  What do these gold buyers know that the public doesn’t?  James explains why you should NOT sell your gold or gold jewelry now. After his first exposure to Austrian Economics at the Loyola University New Orleans with his favorite business professor, Dr. Walter Block, James Anderson received his BA in Finance in 2002. He spent two years traveling and working throughout Latin America where he witnessed first-hand the dramatic effects of the 2001-2002 Argentine currency collapse. In 2007, James became heavily involved with Dr. Ron Paul's 2008 presidential run where he further awakened to our monetary history and the fractional reserve banking. James has since been very interested in free market economics, tangible assets, and sound money investing, seeing his work as a humanitarian effort to educate mankind on the importance of gaining financial independence and freedom.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman starts off with a recap of his Phoenix Distressed Property Tour last weekend, then a quick rant about crooked banks, Wall Street scams and how to get a loan modification or short sale approved with the help of a Q.W.R. Qualified Written Request Letter, a new product at: http://jasonhartman.com/loan-modification-short-sale-q-w-r-letter/. After this, Jason welcomes Doug Ottersberg for a discussion on mobile home park investing. In 1994, Doug and Ana Ottersberg made a decision that changed their financial future forever... After investing a small amount of time and money to learn about real estate investing and then taking action with what they learned, this newly married couple discovered a tremendous “Cash Flow Creator,” and soon watched their personal net worth quickly grow from below zero to well into the millions.

Since then they have become experts at helping others achieve financial independence using the very same virtually recession proof investment. Doug and Ana Ottersberg are dedicated making money work and creating the freedom to stop working for money, the confidence to pursue one's passions, enjoying financial security and peace of mind.

In addition to volunteering at their children’s school and other activities, this busy couple finds time to give back to the community as well. They each serve on various Board of Directors, help out with the Cub and Boy Scouts and other community activities.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman profiles 30 investment markets nationwide. What does the future hold? The unique characteristic of our market forecast is that we go beyond the traditional method of forecasting appreciation only to profile the income property return on investment for each market area. More at: http://JasonHartman.com/. There are three basic components to return on investment with income properties.  The first is value appreciation.  The second element is leverage, since most real estate assets are purchased with financing.  The third element is cash flow, which represents the impact of rent revenue, management fees, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other costs associated with owning and renting an income property.  One of the key inputs into our return on investment model is the mortgage payment.  Since income properties are not owner occupied, they typically involve higher interest rates than traditional mortgages.  Our models assume a 6.6% interest rate in 2011 to build the return on investment estimates.  Other key elements in the return on investment model is the closing costs, leverage ratio, and rent to value ratio.  For most markets, our model assumes a 20% down payment and 4% of the purchase price in closing costs. By profiling each market from the standpoint of its health for investors, we are seeking to provide insight that exceeds that of traditional reports from mainstream media publications.  When evaluating income properties in a given area, it is important to understand that each market contains sub-markets that exhibit unique characteristics that can impact the return on investment for an individual deal.  Our forecasts are intended to be overall estimates that are representative of an overall market segment, but will not necessarily represent every opportunity available.
Case-Schiller Market Predictions

The first twenty market predictions will center on the component markets Case-Schiller Composite 20 index.  This represents the top 20 statistical metropolitan areas in the United States.  One of the primary factors that many of these markets share in common is a generally high rate of taxation and regulation.  The reason for this is because regulation and taxation both tend to be the most intense in densely populated areas.  In addition to this, the valuation bubble that collapsed in 2008 drove up many of the top 20 metropolitan markets.  The net result is a value contraction that is continuing into 2011 for many of the major market areas.  Each market area has been evaluated for both its revised 2010 and forecasted 2011 value appreciation plus estimated return on investment for people who purchase an average property at the beginning of the year.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Investors with the foresight to recognize prime "Buy!" opportunities should be poised to quickly take advantage of this bottomed-out market. Conditions are perfect to generate historical profits for someone in the near future and we hope it's you. Visit: http://jasonhartman.com/events/. Consider this your engraved invitation to join Jason Hartman and The Platinum Team at The Ritz Carlton in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an educational, fun-filled, profitable tour (if you choose to buy) of distressed area properties via a luxury motor-coach we like to call the Foreclosure Bus. The weekend starts on Friday with dinner in the lap of desert opulence at the ultra-swanky five-star accommodations of The Ritz Carlton in the Biltmore area. Saturday morning kicks off with an educational briefing, after which we board a luxury tour bus for an up-close and personal look at the area's most exceptional bank-owned, REO, distressed, and foreclosure properties.

Then it's back to The Ritz's private banquet room for a debriefing on exactly how you can profit from the deals. We'll break for a short time, reconvening for dinner later in the evening. Fill the peaceful moments before sleep overtakes you that night reflecting on how few opportunities a property investor has to be a true bottom feeder. Jason considers the Phoenix timing perfect. The Platinum Properties Team recommended the area back in 2005, but we saw a real estate mess coming and jumped to the sidelines just in time. We've stayed out for five years, waiting for the perfect storm of bailouts, foreclosures, and political incompetence to pass.

It's looking good again for investors in Phoenix right now. Real good.

Back to the itinerary. On Sunday morning we'll enjoy a relaxing educational session and hold individual meetings to review deals you're interested in. Our Phoenix Local Market Specialists, lenders, and property managers will be on hand all weekend to answer questions. These are the people who can get deals done at the lowest cost to you.

The weekend tour includes:
-Two nights at The Ritz Carlton (Friday &amp; Saturday)
-Six meals (put your wallet or purse away - we got it)
-Complimentary Internet access in your room and our meeting room
-Luxury motor-coach
-Small group setting
-Education by Jason and Phoenix Local Market Team

The Ritz Carlton rate is $300 per night ($600 total) + taxes for hotel only but tour members get two nights, meals, tour, private meetings and educational sessions for just $597! Tour members should make travel arrangements to the hotel on Friday afternoon and back home Sunday afternoon. As a sincere thank you, the entire cost of the tour will be REFUNDED if you decide to buy a property over the weekend (Yes, this is how your ticket to the tour can be no cost to you).

* Please note the refund will take place at closing of your property purchase!

Did we mention that Phoenix in May is about as perfect as weather gets on this planet? Register today to accompany Jason Hartman and The Platinum Properties Team on the Foreclosure Bus in Phoenix!</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>As is customary on every 10th episode, Jason Hartman, your host, takes on a non-financial topic as he talks with Dr. Geoffrey Simmons, a physician who is Board-certified in Internal Medicine and Disaster Medicine. He has a B.S. in Zoology and has completed the course work for a Masters degree in Microbiology. More at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/.  As a Fellow with the Discovery Institute Center for Science and Culture, he has studied the theory of evolution for over forty years. For thirty of those years he was an ardent supporter of Darwinian ideas. Now, however, the data supporting this theory scientifically untenable. As of this date, his seventh book, What Darwin Didn't Know, is in its sixth printing and his eighth book, Billions of Missing Links, is in its second printing. Both books show how the incredible complexity of the human body and all other living beings cannot have come about through evolution. Some reviews:

"A well-researched and open-minded analyses." -- Stephen Meyer, PhD, Dir. of the Center for Science and Culture, Discovery Institute

"You've posed all those "break-down complexities" that Darwin worried about, and you've done it with flair!" -- Jody Sjogren, Illustrator for Icons of Evolution

A wonderful book...clear and accessible to the nonspecialist -- John Patrick, M.D., Prof. of the History of Science, Medicine and Faith, Augustine College, Ottawa, Canada.

Geoffrey Simmons is a rarity (referring to the types of books written). His book holds evolution, as he sees it, to the standard of scientific observation and finds evolution lacking -- Dan Hays, Salem Statesman Journal, May 20, 2007
Dr. Geoffrey Simmons focuses on the millions of structures and systems on the Earth that came about all at once, entire...with no preceding links, no subsequent links, no “sideways” links.

To illustrate, he surveys examples like...

the hummingbird and its circulatory system
insects and insect–eating plants
the role of the thousands of species of viruses
chemical signals and the sensory apparatus that detects them
the self–regulating capacity of the Earth’s ocean/air/soil system
It’s clear: Nature containsonly leaps, not links. Only the intelligence and purpose of an all–powerful Designer can explain the intricate creatures, connections, and “coincidences” everywhere.

We'll be back to our usual investing, business and financial topics in the next episode #211. Be sure to join Jason and his team for the upcoming Phoenix Foreclosure Tour http://jasonhartman.com/store/events/ where we'll explore distressed property / REO opportunities and enjoy first-class accommodations at The Ritz Carlton Hotel in The Biltmore area of Phoenix / Scottsdale, Arizona.</itunes:summary>

Atlanta, GA: 25.2% Return on Investment (2011)

Atlanta represents an investment gem in the southeastern United States.  It has spectacular economics from a development and employment perspective that make it a tremendous opportunity for income property investors.  With a wide diversity of employers, many universities, and a vibrant cultural presence in the city, Atlanta has attracted a tremendous amount of in-migration from young professionals seeking employment opportunities.  Since many of these young professionals choose to rent, the Atlanta market has very healthy rents relative to values.  Currently, approximately 31% of listings in Atlanta are from foreclosures.Atlanta’s experience during the real estate bubble and financial crisis has been somewhat unique.  Prices in Atlanta started from a much lower baseline than many other major markets.  The prices escalated to a peak in advance of the financial crisis and have subsequently fallen back to the same levels that they were 10 years ago.  Most of the other markets that experienced an inflation and deflation of prices like this are bubble markets that typically exhibit high prices relative to rents.  In contrast to this, Atlanta represents more of a linear market with attractive rates of return available from cash flows that result from rent revenues.  This is one of the primary reasons for Atlanta’s strength as an income property investing market.

The favorable business and economic environment in Atlanta make it one of the more likely places for an economic recovery to emerge.  Our models estimate a return to modest rates of appreciation in 2011, which combines with attractive rates of cash flow to produce a tremendous opportunity for astute investors.  By investing in Atlanta, it places you in an advantageous situation where you can afford to wait out market volatility and sell when it is optimal for your long-term strategy.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>On this episode of the Creating Wealth Show, Jason Hartman talks with author and editor, Janet Portman, about becoming a landlord. Whether or not you call yourself a “landlord,” when you rent out a house, you’ll want to do it right! More at http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Ninety percent of small properties are owned by individual landlords, and millions in this group are balancing their landlord responsibilities with their daytime careers. Tune in as Jason and Janet discuss everything from landlord business basics and finding good tenants, to complying with applicable rental laws and dealing with problem tenants.  Janet Portman, author, attorney, and nationally recognized specialist in landlord/tenant law, is managing editor at Nolo, the nation’s recognized leader in providing legal information for consumers and small businesses.

Portman oversees editorial work on all Nolo books and software. She is the author or co-author of Every Landlord's Legal Guide, Every Tenant's Legal Guide, and LeaseWriter Plus software, plus six other books, all published by Nolo.
As an expert in legal issues related to landlords and tenants, Portman has appeared on national television and radio and has been quoted in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger’s, Smart Money, the Los Angeles Times, and other publications. She has also spoken on related topics such as disputes involving neighbors and pets. Before joining Nolo in 1994, Portman was a public defender for the California State Public Defender’s office, representing clients at the trial, appellate, and state Supreme Court levels. Portman received undergraduate and graduate degrees from Stanford University and a law degree from Santa Clara University.</itunes:summary>

Most people are associated with one or two people whom they would consider to be “high-maintenance” or demanding of your time and attention. These people are the ones who call to ask why you haven’t commented on their Facebook post. Sometimes this type of person is referred to as a “diva” or a “drama queen.” For some reason, these folks seem to seek out dramatic encounters that draw attention to themselves. In contrast to this, most of us know people who are “low- maintenance” or perfectly content to do their own things. These people are frequently engaged with what is happening, but exhibit a much lower propensity to become “crazy makers” who create drama for no other reason than attracting attention to themselves. In light of this, consider that the way you earn the income that is necessary to support your lifestyle. Do you have high-maintenance income or low-maintenance income? It is important to understand that a job, a business, or an investment can be either high-maintenance or low- maintenance. Because of this, understanding the difference becomes quite important.
High-Maintenance Income
• • •
Many hours and extensive effort are required. Reliance on expert ability limits your ability to scale revenue upward. Your physical presence is required, limiting your mobility to infrequent vacations.
Low-Maintenance Income
• • •
Fewer hours and minimal management are necessary. Reliance on systems and automation allow revenue to scale quickly. Income can be produced and managed remotely, allowing greater freedom to travel.
Upon reading this, most people will reach two conclusions . . . the first being that they would prefer low-maintenance income and the second being that their main source of income is high- maintenance. This is where we need to implement some premeditated planning. Most “jobs” tend to produce relatively high-maintenance income. Some have the flexibility for remote working, but even that requires significant effort to achieve successfully. Many businesses also produce high-maintenance income, and the business models that are low-maintenance tend to be much more difficult to get off the ground due to intense competition. Even some investment income is high-maintenance in nature if your success depends on scouring the financial markets each day to find and scoop up deals. Consider that a person who earns $200,000 per year, but works 80 hours per week must invest 20 hours per $1,000 in earnings. This equates to $50 per hour . . . not too bad, but still requires 4,000 hours per year of work time. It’s difficult to have much mobility in that scenario. (The same principle holds true for many highly compensated professionals who earn high hourly rates, but must work large numbers of hours . . . they produce lots of income, but it requires large amounts of effort and is not very flexible.) Conversely, consider a person who starts a small web marketing business that produces a modest $5,000 per year of income but only requires 1 hour per week of management. This equates to $100 per hour of work time and is much more mobile. Low-maintenance income frequently comes in much smaller chunks than high-maintenance income, but can allow us to leverage our time much more effectively. The key to long-term success is to slowly offset your high-maintenance income from a job, business, or investment with low-maintenance income. Practically speaking, this means that you will most likely end up building up low-maintenance income “on the side” while working at your primary occupation. The advantage of this strategy is that it allows you to test some business ideas that may fail,</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman presents a followup to show #205 with some additional information on "The Big D" - that's Dallas Texas, including a forecast for 2011 and a market overview. More at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Dallas experienced a series of moderate appreciation followed by a gradual contraction that has resulted in much less price volatility than has been experienced by other market areas.  The area is expected to hit the bottom of its mild contraction in 2011 and then resume a course of modest appreciation.  Dallas has a very strong business community, and a large population of renters.  This results in a much slower rate of value appreciation, and a large supply of potential tenants.  Currently, approximately 40% of listings in Dallas are from foreclosures.

The primary strength of Dallas as an investment market is the strong cash flows that it generates.  By building your investment on top of rents that are sufficiently large to pay for the expenses and mortgage on the investment, it will give you the power to hold strong until market conditions are optimal.  In the case of Dallas, there is a ‘perfect storm’ of factors that combine to make it a very strong investment market.  The city has a very strong business sector that attracts skilled employees.  The relatively high property taxes influence many people to rent their homes instead of buy them.  This works to suppress price increases and place upward pressure on rents, since there is a relatively high percentage of the population who rents.

One of the things that some people say about Dallas is that they don’t care for the heat and humidity of summers in Texas.  This dislike of the weather convinces them that Dallas is not a place that they would want to invest.  This sentiment also demonstrates a great income property investing folly where people think that they should only invest in a place where they would want to live.  Just because you would personally choose to live in one place or choose not to live in another doesn’t mean that everybody else shares your sentiment.  Many people have moved to markets like Dallas or Atlanta because of their superior employment opportunities.  Based on this analysis, Dallas represents an excellent opportunity for income property investors.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with Robert Frank, author of The Winner Take all Society, The Economic Naturalist: In Search of Solutions to Everyday Enigmas; Falling Behind: How Rising Inequality Harms the Middle Class and many more!  In his The Winner-Take-All Society, Bob Frank discussed the fact that more and more of current economy and other institutions are moving toward a state where very few winners take very much, while the rest are left with little. More at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Part of it is attributed to the modern structure of markets and technology. This view can be seen as a call for serious changes in policy, because the well-being of the average citizen is by most accounts the main goal of social and economic policy.

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with T. Harv Eker about Secrets of the Millionaire Mind which reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it. Listen at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?

The shocking answer is: None of the above!

T. Harv Eker states: "Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!" Eker does this by identifying your "money and success blueprint." We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.

Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and "revise" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.

In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen "Wealth Files," which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.

If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too.

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman welcomes Ronald Reagan to the show to share a moving Christmas story. Next, some mortgage financial planning illustrated by "A Tale of Two Brothers" by Ric Edelman who has educated his clients for years on the benefits of integrating their mortgage into their overall financial plan.In his book, The New Rules of Money, Ric tells the story of two brothers, each of whom secures a mortgage to buy a $200,000 home. More at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Each brother earns $70,000 a year and has $40,000 in savings. The first brother, Brother A, believes than half the nation's banks failed and millions of homeowners, unable to raise the cash they needed to payoff their loans, lost their homes. Out of this the American Mantra was born: Always own your home outright. Never carry a mortgage. The reasoning behind America's new mantra was really quite simple: if the economy fell to pieces, at least you still had your home and the bank couldn't take it away from you. Maybe you couldn't put food on the table or pay your bills, but your home was secure. Since the Great Depression laws have been introduced that make it illegal for banks to call your loan due. The bank can no longer call you up and say, We're running a little short on cash and need you to pay off your loan in the next thirty days.Additionally, the Fed is now quick to infuse money into the system if there is a run on the banks, as we saw in 1987 and Y2K. Also, the FDIC was created to insure banks. Still, it's no wonder the fear of losing their home became instilled in the hearts and minds of the American people, and they quickly grew to fear their mortgage. In the 1950's and 60's families would throw mortgage burning parties to celebrate paying off their home. And so, because of this fear of their mortgage, for nearly 75 years most people have overlooked the opportunities their mortgage provides to build financial security.

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with David Fagan. Whether it is working with Inc 500 Infusionsoft or as CEO of Guerrilla Marketing, David T. Fagan knows the sales activities and attributes needed to bring major opportunities, accounts and profitable relationships to an organization. More at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. That’s what the former CEO of Guerrilla Marketing David Fagan is all about – the right changes at the right time with the right people. The Icon Builder and Guerrilla Rainmaking programs will show you what “hired gun” David Fagan has successfully done for others and what he can do for you, too.
The recessionary economy has taken its toll on businesses around the country, leaving behind the remains of once-profitable companies. Those business owners didn’t know how to change. They didn’t know how to reposition their business. They did not find new customers, products, or services to satisfy the demands of the new market. They didn’t know how to make rain during a drought.

The Guerrilla techniques of Rainmaking and Icon Building help you fight the war against a bad economy and other circumstances once believed to be beyond our control.

The Icon Builders program turns YOU into the person everyone talks about… YOU become the Product… YOU become an Icon… YOU make it Rain profits once again. Guerrilla Rainmaking helps you harness the power of marketing, the 9 Law of Multiplication Power Plays, and the 3 GR philosophies that bring them all together.

David Fagan has shared the stage with such notable industry icons as Mark Victor Hansen, Michael Gerber and Jay Conrad Levinson, to name a few. His recent books include Secrets of Peak Performers with Dan Kennedy and Guerrilla Rainmakers: How to Make Your Business Rain Profits through the Law of Multiplication with Jay Conrad Levinson. His next book, How to Raise an Entrepreneur: 15 Business Plans for Kids and Teens to Make Money Now will be available soon.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman profiles one of his favorite markets, Atlanta.  Visit: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/.As the capital and most populous city in the state of Georgia as well as the urban core of one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the United States.  Considered a top business city and transportation hub, Atlanta is the world headquarters of The Coca-Cola Company, AT&amp;T Mobility, and Delta Air Lines.  Visit: http://www.jasonhartman.com/ The surrounding area contains additional corporate headquarters, including Home Depot and UPS.  Atlanta has the nation's third largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies, and more than 75 percent of the Fortune 1,000 companies have a presence in the Atlanta metropolitan area.

Our analysis of Atlanta as an investment opportunity will focus on demographics, the overall property market, and the emergence of attractive micro-markets. Three key attributes make Atlanta a tremendous opportunity for investors.  These are favorable demographics, superior quality of life, and an attractive business climate.  Any of these three factors can help an investment market, but the combination of all three create an unparalleled opportunity like that is available in Atlanta.

The combined metropolitan area for Atlanta has a population of 5.4 million people, which represents growth of 1.1 million people from 2000 through 2008.  The population of Atlanta is expected to grow to 7.7 million residents by the year 2025.  The driving force behind this rapid growth is the strong business environment and employment opportunities in and around the city.

The median income for a household in the city was $47,464 and the median income for a family was $59,711.  About 21.8% of the population and 17.2% of families lived below the poverty line.  When combined with the low cost of living in Atlanta, many residents have significant amounts of disposable income that help support vibrant culture and entertainment options throughout the city.

Atlanta is growing very quickly, and has a very sizeable affluent population that will only grow in relevance as more commerce concentrates in Atlanta.  As an ideally placed business and transportation hub for the southeastern United States, Atlanta is ascending on a growth path while many former industrial cities are experiencing significant economic contraction.

Atlanta is home to one of the largest concentrations of colleges and universities in the country.  The city has more than 30 institutions of higher education, including the Georgia Institute of Technology, a predominant engineering, and research university that has been ranked in the top ten public universities since 1999 by US News and World Report, and Georgia State University.

Atlanta is also the home to four major league sports teams, plays host to the PGA player’s championship, and contains the world’s largest aquarium in downtown Atlanta.

One of the key attributes that attracts so many people to Atlanta is its superior quality of life.  With a strong business environment, reasonable commute, extensive culture, and educational institutions, there is no shortage of opportunity for people of varying interests.

As the unofficial capital of the southeast United States, the Atlanta represents a shining gem of opportunity.  An example of Atlanta’s importance is its $270 billion GDP, which represents nearly 2/3 of the Georgia Economy.  This is largely why Atlanta is among the top-3 major cities in relocation/growth.  People are choosing relocation to Atlanta because of its superior business environment.

The importance of Atlanta’s business climate cannot be under-stated, as there will be many companies redeploying resources out of high tax states and into more business friendly environments over the coming years.  Atlanta is standing directly in the middle of this progress trajectory, and investors who are positioned to ride this wave can realize tremendous gains.

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with Daven Michaels about a hot and controversial topic, outsourcing.  These days, a lot of businesses have figured out the advantages of outsourcing their administrative support projects. More at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Here are just a couple of the benefits one will get if one’s projects are effectively planned:

Reduces expenditure on wages, office equipment, and employee benefits.
Saves precious time and money on training.
Get assistance precisely when you need it.
Existing employees will spend less time on dealing with mundane tasks, so they can all apply their individual expertise to boosting the business.
But you need to understand that in order to take great advantage of these outsourcing advantages, you will need to first spend some time planning out precisely what you intend to achieve.

How to Effectively Outsource an Administrative Support Work – The Basics

One needs to know that a complete project planning exercise will need to be completed before they even think about their administrative work. First, take a pretty good look around your office ask yourself these two important questions:

What are the tasks that need to be done pronto?
Can these tasks be done remotely, thus freeing up some members of your staff so that they can concentrate on other important tasks?
As soon as you have identified the work that does not need to be done in-house, you will then write out the clear description of every task, what tasks need to be done, when the work should be completed, and how the completed work will be delivered. When you are done drawing up your project planning guide, you will then need to take the initial step in learning the process of how to outsource to providers that are known to specialise in administrative support.

Effective Project Management

The truth is that Asian countries such as Philippines and India may be able to provide you with good admin support, but you need to understand that although the standard of spoken and written English is high, it is really not the native language. So, it is very important that you provide work instructions in a clear and very precise manner.

When you are learning how to outsource, you will find out that very good communication skills are in fact, necessary to the effectiveness of project management. You will need to agree upon schedules and communication channels. Also keep in mind that the provider that you have chosen may be in a time zone that is totally different to yours, so ensure that you take that into consideration as well.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with Guinness World Record Holder, David Farrow on this "every tenth show" where we'll explore how to improve memory and concentration.  More at: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. If you're like most people, you're constantly forgetting things. People's names. Where you put the keys. Even things you read just moments before. Your mind is like a cluttered attic with information tossed everywhere and little hope of finding anything quickly.  You can create a mental filing system that not only categorizes and organizes information, but also lets you retrieve it instantly, whenever you need it! Who am I? I'm the world's foremost expert on memory and a two-time Guinness World Record holder. His program is designed to teach people like you to do what he can do - remember the names of people I met only once, always know where I put important objects like my keys, recite whole passages from books, word for word, and so much more. Using his techniques, hundreds of people like you are learning new languages, memorizing important scriptures and quotes, and even improving their vocabularies. With techniques that are easy and effective, you can double your reading speed and more.
Never lose your car keys or other valuables again
Get people's names right every time, and avoid embarrassment
Quote scripture, famous people or even song lyrics perfectly
Pick up new languages in mere weeks
Ace exams by retaining everything you study
Deliver flawless speeches and presentations from memory
Impress people with your mental rolodex of phone numbers
Using my breakthrough visualization techniques, I've trained thousands of corporate executives to excel in business, helped military officers and government agents remember critical pieces of information and even taught Academy Award-winning actors how to avoid blowing their lines!

Dave Farrow is the world’s foremost memory expert and a two time Guinness World Record Holder. He invented the MILLIONAIRE MEMORY program to teach people like you to do what he can do: remember names and important numbers, learn new languages, memorize scriptures, quotes and speeches, and more. Dave points to himself as proof that incredible mental improvements are possible.

As a child, Dave was diagnosed with two learning disabilities: ADHD and dyslexia. He struggled in school and had trouble keeping up in class. Out of frustration, he began an intense search for a way to overcome these challenges and, as a result, discovered the breakthrough techniques that helped him become the Guinness World Record holder for memorization. To earn that title, Dave memorized the order of 59 decks of cards. That's 3,068 cards! Dave admits, "Your memory might never be quite that good, but I personally guarantee you'll see dramatic memory improvements using my simple techniques."</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason Hartman talks with the founder of USAWatchdog.com, Greg Hunter, who has nearly nine years network experience as an investigative correspondent.  He worked for ABC News and Good Morning America for nearly six years. Visit: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Most recently, Greg worked for CNN on shows such as Paula Zahn Now, American Morning and various CNN business shows.  Greg is a hard hitting reporter who has a history of getting to the truth no matter how difficult the subject.  Some of his stories include “Dangerous Deadly Depleted Uranium Munitions,” where Hunter uncovered the Army’s lack of warning for radioactive dust exposed to our troops on the battlefield.

In a story called “Produce the Note” &lt;http://youtube.com/watch?v=YUZdANb6UaY&gt; , Hunter uncovered in 40 percent of foreclosures the bankers cannot prove they legally own the property.   If an embattled homeowner knows that fact, it could mean the difference between being thrown out in the cold and having a roof  over his head. And in a report in March of 2008, Hunter exposed the hidden fact the banks were in trouble and the economy was headed for a fall.  Greg warned viewers of the coming problems long before other reporters picked up on the looming financial catastrophe.  In 2009, many in the mainstream media said things such as “no one saw the crisis coming.”

Hunter joined ABC News in 1999 from WTSP-TV in Tampa.  He has earned a “National Headliner Award,” an International “Freddie Award”  for health and medical reporting, as well as investigative reporting awards from both the “Society of Professional Journalists” and the “Radio Television News Directors Association.”</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason provides a unique commentary on the gulf oil spill, firing your investment property manager, buy and hold investing.  Following the monologue, Jason talks with Steve Dexter about his book Real Estate Debt Can Make You Rich and long term investing. Visit: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Housing and commercial property prices the lowest they’ve been in nearly a decade, this classic real estate investment guide is timelier than ever. Dr. Schumacher, who passed away in 2006, found that the way to a lifetime of financial security was to buy smart and never sell, and he built a $20 million fortune using his own savvy advice. The book, updated by Steve Dexter (an expert commentator for CNN/Money, CBS Radio and Fox TV), reveals step-by-step investment techniques that can work in the midst of a slow real estate market or a booming one for first-time buyers or seasoned investors, and for buyers of single-family residences, apartment buildings or shopping.

Steve's latest book is Buy and Hold Forever- How to Build Wealth for the 21st Century, one he co-wrote with the late Dr. Schumacher who was known as the ‘pope” of real estate investing.  His first book Real Estate Debt Can Make You Rich published by McGraw-Hill, was rated one of the top 5 real estate books of the year by Bob Bruss, a nationally syndicated columnist of the Washington Post Media Group. Steve’s second book is Beat the Banks-Prospering in the Rising Wave of Bank Foreclosures. He has been a distinguished speaker at the Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School and their Graduate School of Design and has mentored many of their students about entrepreneurship and real estate investing. He also has spoken at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Business Management located in Chicago. He is also a member and speaker of NAREE (National Association of Real Estate Editors), a professional group of authors and major newspaper journalists who write about the national real estate market.  Upcoming shows will feature, Bruce Norris,  Ric Edelman and "The Podcast Answer Man."</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>A look at Jason's Ultimate Investing Equation followed by Daniel and Gerard Adams for The National Inflation Association (NIA) recently featured on Inside Edition and ABC World News Tonight with Charlie Gibson, The Wall Street Journal, MSNBC, ABC's Nightline, KTLA News and CNBC.  Visit: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshow. After being ignored by  family and friends about the coming stock market decline and recession, he started a youtube channel called VisionVictory with some very interesting predictions on record:

On march of 2008 in his first video, he accurately predicted that the Dow would fall to 8,000 in the fall of 2008. The S&amp;P would fall to 800 in the fall of 2008. And that global stocks wouldn't decouple until after the fall of 2008.

In July of 2008, he updated his prediction and told his youtube viewers that stocks were set to drop on the 3rd week of September and they did, in a big way, from the 3rd week of September to the 3rd week of October stocks fell 33%.

In December of 2008 he made a new prediction, that stocks would make new lows sometime in late February 2009. On the 3rd week of February, guess what? The Dow and S&amp;P made new lows.

in 2008 while Ben Bernanke, Jim Cramer, and college professors around the world were predicting that the U.S. would not enter a recession. Daniel predicted a severe recession that would break all previous records. While Ben Bernanke said a recovery would take place in the summer of 2008, Daniel correctly predicted that the world would acknowledge the recession after the summer of 2008, and they did.

He also correctly forecasted rising unemployment, a collapse of consumer spending and many more well timed predictions.

The VisionVictory Channel is now watched by thousands and has a subscription base of 17,500. The VisionVictory Channel is also part of the National Inflation Association and helped with the documentary, Meltup.

		<itunes:summary>Jason is feeling generous... Enjoy an entire free issue of The Financial Freedom Report.  Here is our source for innovative, forward-thinking investment property and home-based internet business strategies and advice.

Income property investing is the most reliable path to wealth. History has proven it time after time. So, why do people still waste their time and energy with Wall Street’s pitiful selection of junk stocks and laughably inefficient mutual funds? Who knows? http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/.  Our guess is financial media payola and herd mentality – like buffalos following the leader in a  blind charge over a cliff. Finally, here’s your chance to discover how to create real wealth in America today.
Obviously the question is "How do I get there from where I am?" This insurmountable hurdle is what stops most people. They have a hyper-inflated concept of how much money it takes to get started. The truth is,"Not That Much!"

The sky really is the limit when you have access to the right information. Information that tells you whether or not an investment makes financial sense the day you buy it. You need to know:

Why you shouldn’t believe the "national housing market" myth.
41 cities around the country hot for investing right now and the hottest micro-markets within them.
How to tell at a glance if a property is a sweet deal and, more importantly, how to avoid the portfolio killers.
Government policies that are destroying your savings, stocks, bonds, mutual funds and equity every single day.
Secret ways you can grow wealthy from inflation while everyone else is moaning "The Economy is Killing Me" blues.
How to apply unique arbitrage techniques to income property and skyrocket your wealth, while almost completely eliminating downside risk.
These may be pretty bold claims but income and wealth education pioneer, Jason Hartman, has built a career and a company on putting his money where his mouth is. If you want to create the kind of life-changing wealth Wall Street and other investment schemes promise but never deliver, Jason’s team of Investment Counselors would love to tech you how. They decided the best way to get this cutting-edge investment knowledge out to you is in a premium monthly newsletter, Jason Hartman’s Financial Freedom Report.

This newsletter is like nothing you’ve seen before. It vanquishes the guesswork and uses clear language to describe the strategies of how you can implement income property investing the right way. Re-create the exact steps Jason used to become a multi-millionaire. In addition, expect spot-on analysis of the real world of property investing in each lengthy, full-color, wealth creating issue. We strongly suggest that you do not take the risk of investing without it.

If you are exhausted from trying what doesn’t work and ready to create significant wealth in your life right now and protect what you’ve earned, the choice is very simple – Jason Hartman’s Financial Freedom Report.  It's $197 annually for email edition; however, you can enjoy this issue with our compliments.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason talks with Harvey Mackay author of the New York Times #1 bestsellers Swim With The Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive and Beware the Naked Man Who Offers You His Shirt. Both books are among the top 15 inspirational business books of all time, according to the New York Times. In total, Harvey's books have sold 10 million copies worldwide, been translated into 37 languages and sold in 80 countries. Visit: http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows.

Harvey is a nationally syndicated columnist for United Feature Syndicate, whose weekly articles appear in 52 newspapers around the country, including the Chicago Sun Times, Rocky Mountain News, Orange County Register, Minneapolis Star Tribune and Arizona Republic. He also is one of America's most popular and entertaining business speakers. Toastmasters International named him one of the top five speakers in the world. At age 26, he purchased a small, failing envelope company in 1959 which has grown to a $100 million business employing over 600 people. MackayMitchell Envelope Company is one of the nation's major envelope manufacturers, producing 25 million envelopes a day. As chairman, Harvey's philosophy is engrained in the company, beginning with its motto: Do what you love, love what you do and deliver more than you promise.

Harvey is a graduate of the University of Minnesota and the Stanford University Graduate School of Business Executive Program. He is an avid runner and marathoner, and former #1 ranked tennis player in Minnesota.

He currently sits on the board of the Minnesota Orchestra and is a former director on Robert Redford's Sundance Institute and the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management. He has been a guest lecturer at various universities and business schools, including Harvard, Stanford, Michigan, Cornell, Wharton and Penn State.

Central to Harvey's business, and to his books, is the ability to stay competitive in the often cut-throat world of business, to 'swim with the sharks', without sacrificing one's personal integrity or doing it at the expense of other people. He does this by focusing on building strong relationships with both customers and employees.

In fact, Harvey is a master of networking. He believes most people make the mistake of only turning to their network when they need it; for example, when they're looking for a new job. Harvey says that networking is a lifelong practice that provides you with new knowledge and experiences, job security, expanded financial reach, and the strength of the group. The secret to maintaining a great network is, above all, knowing the value of the personal touch.

In spite of his hectic schedule, Harvey still finds plenty of time for family and fun. He's an avid golfer (11.4 handicap) and recently won the Super Senior Men's Championship at his home club in Scottsdale!

He and his wife, Carol Ann, have been married over 45 years, and enjoy spending time with their nine grandchildren. They are avid travelers, taking an annual trip to Italy, and planning upcoming tours of China and Africa.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason talks about "Income Property Bonds™" where you can earn 10 to 12% annually before any appreciation or tax benefits!  Next, Jason talks with 29-year old Yanik Silver who is recognized as the leading expert on creating automatic, moneymaking web sites…and he’s only been online full time since February 2000! He believes almost everything people have been taught about making money online is completely wrong. Listen on iTunes or at http://jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. His Internet success techniques only require a simple web site and you don’t even need to know how to put up your own web page. (In fact, Yanik still doesn’t know HTML).  He is the author, co-author and publisher of several best-selling marketing books and tools including:

• Instant Sales Letters
• Instant Internet Profits
• Mind Motivators
• Web Copy Secrets
• Instant Marketing Tool Box
• 33 Days to Online Profits
• Million Dollar Emails
• Autoresponder Magic

Yanik specializes in creating powerful systems and resources for entrepreneurs to enhance their businesses. When away from the office Yanik enjoys playing volleyball, ice hockey, skiing and working on his terrible golf game. His most important project right now is trying to convince his wife, Missy, to move to the beach so he can play beach volleyball all day!</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>After an debrief on The Masters Weekend, Jason's continues his discussion from show #141 on "The 30 Fatal Mistakes Investors Make." During turbulent economic times, people can become their own worst enemy.  The uncertainty of the stock market creates massive insecurity about our investment portfolios. These doubts are quite reasonable and it is time to stop trusting Wall Street and start being a direct investor by purchasing hard assets which are not subject to the greed, graft and manipulation of CEOs, investment bankers, fund managers and the government. Prudent investing is a prerequisite to The American Dream of financial freedom. Visit http://www.jasonhartman.com/radioshows/. Learn from the mistakes of others rather than “the school of hard knocks.” Tune in to this episode of The Creating Wealth Show as Jason reveals 30 fatal mistakes you must avoid in order to achieve financial independence and investing success.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason's amazingly popular course is now online.  Thousands of people have attended live and zillions have asked for an online version... well, it has finally arrived!  Can’t attend locally, can't attend the live class?  We have the solution you've been asking for!  Go to: http://www.jasonhartman.com/radioshows.

Are you like the many who would like to attend The Creating Wealth Boot Camp but cannot find the time to travel or devote your whole Saturday to learning the best investment advice you will ever hear?  In order to cater to the busy professionals in need of investment education and advice, we have created an online course to fit any schedule! This highly visual and interactive six week intensive will meet once a week for approximately one hour. Your schedule does not allow for you to attend live? Don’t fret, we will send you a recorded version for you to listen at your convenience. Bottom line, there is no excuse why you are living without this worthwhile information.  The #1 piece of advice for growing wealthy is… Pretend the stock market doesn’t exist.

Seriously. That ship left the dock decades ago and won’t be back. If you’re still swallowing the Wall Street lies, we hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you will probably die poor, an unfortunate statistic lumped in with the 99% who will never know the blessed relief of a life free from financial worry. Can you even imagine the sweet taste of financial freedom?  The truth is today’s stock market has devolved into a giant con game where an exclusive gang of unscrupulous slimeballs makes a very nice living picking the pockets of average investors like you.

At The Creating Wealth Boot Camp, we don’t even consider it a real investment unless it does the following:

• Expect at least a 20% annual ROI

• Allows you PROFIT from the economically debilitating effects of inflation

• Cuts the THIEVING middle-men out and allows direct investment

• Provides TRUE diversification

• Is the MOST tax-favored asset in America

• Turns banks profit model against them to practically STEAL money legally

• So conservative your grandmother would love it

We’re sorry but this event is jam-packed with education, not
bushy sales pitches.

1. Six+ hours of innovative education. No esoteric theory. This is a simple, repeatable, conservative approach that can make you VERY wealthy.

2. How to properly use leverage to reach financial independence. You might quit your job in as little as seven years and never work again.

A new feature at The Creating Wealth Online Course is property analysis. Jason and his team of investment experts will lead the class through the process of property selection using actual deals from our network. We’ll show you how we decide whether or not a property is a good buy. You can even bring in outside properties you’re interested in and we’ll show you how to evaluate its money-making potential.

Perhaps the benefits of using The Creating Wealth educational course to put your financial life into high gear can best be told by previous attendees.

		<itunes:summary>In this impromptu show Jason interviews his mother, Joyce, on her simple low-tech approach to investing in income properties.  Listen at: http://www.jasonhartman.com/radioshows/.  Hear Jason's mom share her experiences parlaying a low income job and a small $12,000 investment into a $7,000,000 portfolio that generated a net income of well over $200,000 annually (and rather passively) at retirement... not including tax benefits!  You can create wealth and passive income the old fashioned way or accelerate the process with our modern strategies.  Either way, it's all about passive checks in your mailbox every month.  While the journey of a real estate investor is usually fun and easy, there may be trials and tribulations while buying and managing your portfolio. Like the tortoise and the hare, slow and steady wins the race.  The time will pass anyway, why not put time on your side by holding income properties?  The motto to live by; "Don't wait to buy real estate, buy real estate then wait!"  Remember - life is a marathon, not a sprint; and if you want a surefire road to success, then don't lose sight of the big picture.</itunes:summary>

Visit: http://www.jasonhartman.com/radioshows. The Denver area has been a historically stable real estate market for both owners and investors.  Market values experienced a downward correction following the financial crisis of 2008, but stabilized in 2009 and are estimated to grow modestly in 2010. The principal value to investors of property in Colorado is its attractive cash flow relative to market prices.  With some especially attractive deals available through PPIN, Denver represents a major market area with characteristics that are favorable for Investment. The cash flow generated by properties in the Denver market give investors the power to wait for improvement in market values as the property cash flow exceeds the operating costs and mortgage.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason explores some ways to get out of a bad property then he interviews author/attorney Mark Kohler about his book “Lawyers Are Liars: The Truth About Protecting Our Assets.”  Listen at: http://www.jasonhartman.com/radioshows.  Mark is an attorney, CPA and entrepreneur who has owned numerous businesses since high school, through college and even as a professional. Mark’s principal career has been as a partner in the law firm Kyler, Kohler, Ostermiller, &amp; Sorensen, LLP. He specializes in the areas of business, estate and tax planning. Mark owns several commercial real estate projects and loves the people, transactions, and everything to do with real estate. You will be pleasantly surprised at how exciting and interesting a discussion regarding tax and legal planning can be. Jason and Mark will distill complex legal and tax strategies to common layperson terms, adding interesting stories and anecdotes.

Some lawyers, and others who are not lawyers, use fear tactics to sell the unsuspecting public various asset protection structures or strategies that are outright lies. Until now, no other professional has been willing to call out the frauds and cheats in this powerful industry where self-professed experts and do-it-yourself hacks wreak havoc on the innocent just wanting to protect their assets. This episode we will expose the liars. Undoubtedly, this book will become a desktop resource for not only the average middle income American wanting to protect his or her assets, but attorneys, estate planners and financial professionals guiding their clients through this complex area of the law. Learn the best kept secrets in asset protection planning, learn the truth about Nevada corporations, off-shore planning, land trusts and all of the so called silver bullet strategies!  Mark and many other great speakers will be presenting at "The Masters Weekend: A Gathering of Experts" more info at: http://www.jasonhartman.com/store/events.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We’re putting enough real estate and business brainpower in one room to make Donald Trump flinch. Enjoy this content-rich sampler of "The Masters Weekend" our twice annual powerhouse educational event that can revolutionize how you think about money and wealth.  Listen at: http://www.jasonhartman.com/radioshows/.  Will you be any closer to financial freedom in one year? Listen in and it can make all the difference if you simply have the courage to take action on your dream. The reality is you can fire your boss and live life on your own terms sooner than you think. Wall Street Investing Does NOT Lead to Financial Freedom.

The following information might surprise you:

	Income producing properties are history’s most proven wealth creator. 
	Making money in real estate is NOT just for big spenders. There are investments out there which require very little cash up front, yet have the potential for exciting returns. 
	It’s a fact. The vast majority of wealthy people made their fortune investing in income property. Why do anything else? 
	Learn every skill you’ll need for success: analysis, acquisition, management and wealth preservation techniques.

Our speakers come armed with the latest in shrewd real estate investing techniques, and will address such issues as:

	The smart way to choose your properties
	How to grab every tax benefit the law allows
	How to put together the most creative financing package possible
	The hidden power of the 1031 Exchange
	How to easily invest in dynamic growth markets outside of California

In part two you'll hear one of Jason's articles from his "Financial Freedom Report" addressing Obama's rather scary comment; "we're out of money now" and why this can be great news for investors.  Our next show will be on asset protection and entity structuring with the author of "Lawyers Are Liars."</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Jason talks with real estate "artist" and 5-time international best-selling author, philanthropist, risk-taker and visionary, Frank McKinney, who sees opportunities and creates markets where none existed before.  Listen at: http://www.jasonhartman.com/radioshows/.  McKinney's first job earned him $180 a week digging sand traps on Deerfield Beach golf course.  At age 22, he bought his first $50,000 fixer-upper, selling it a few months later for a $7,000 profit.  Now, over 23 years later, he creates real estate markets where others dare to tread.  He has built spec homes (without a buyer) valued in the tens of millions of dollars.  A true maverick, he is without peer in the risky world of speculative high-end real estate, shattering price records with each new project.  And his latest?  McKinney just completed "Acqua Liana," the world's largest and most opulent triple certified (USGBC, FGBC &amp; Energy Star) "green" mansion at $29,000,000.  Each of the estate homes he creates is a one-of-a-kind work of art, infused with vivid imagination and designed on a canvas of sun-drenched Atlantic ocean.

Prior to the completion of his new multi-million dollar "green" mansion, he sold, with an asking price of $50 Million, the largest and most expensive spec home ever created, containing 72 rooms, 32,000 square feet, 12 bedrooms, 18 baths, and a 14 car garage.  McKinney has created and sold 36 oceanfront properties with an average selling price over $14 million.

In addition to his real estate artistry, Frank McKinney has now become a five-time international bestselling author.  In addition to his first two books, McKinney just released three new books simultaneously, each representing a distinctly different genre.  All three books are published by Health Communications, Inc., best known for the Chicken Soup for the Soul series.  Mr. McKinney's new titles are; 1.) The Tap, 2.) Burst This! Frank McKinney's Bubble-Proof Real Estate Strategies, and 3.) Dead Fred, Flying Lunchboxes, and the Good Luck Circle.

His vision and risk-taking has been the subject of numerous international television, radio and print features.  McKinney was recently featured on ABC's 20/20   with Martin Bashir, the cover of USA Today, the Oprah Winfrey Show, CBS' The Early Show, CNN, Discovery Channel, Travel Channel, HDNet, CBN TV, National Public Radio (NPR), in The Wall Street Journal, NY Times, Bloomberg, Fortune, Barrons, Town and Country, Robb Report, The Nightly Business Report (PBS) and in over 1500 additional TV and print stories.  Several areas are covered in this exciting episode ranging from real estate, motivation, marketing and spiritual growth.  Next up - one of Jason's all-time favorite mentors, Dr. Denis Waitley, on The Psychology of Winning and The Seeds of Greatness.</itunes:summary>
