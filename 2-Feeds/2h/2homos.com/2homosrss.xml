		<title>2 Homos - Lesbian Podcast</title>
		<description>Ever wonder what two Lesbians talk about when they get together?  Well...wonder no more.  The 2 Homos podcast is the show with two Lesbians sitting around talking about whatever crosses our minds.  We're not always politically correct, and no topic is off limits.  Come spend some time and get intimate with us.  We're open-minded, we speak our minds...and sometimes, for better or worse, there's no "edit" button.</description>

			<title>502 Mouth to Snout</title>
			<description>These days there are so many ways to pick up women. You can browse the personal ads, go on match.com or even do it the old fashioned way by picking up some drunk chick at a bar. Why would you even think about tossing some chicken bones down on the ground in front of some lady walking her dog just so you can save her dog and be her hero by giving her dog mouth to snout resuscitation? It just seems like so much more work than is really necessary.</description>

			<title>501 Triple Bypass</title>
			<description>Welcome to America, where fat is now the new thin. We'll take our burgers with a triple stack of meat, ten slices of cheese and fourteen pieces of bacon. If it doesn't have saturated fat pouring out of every crevice, why would we eat it? We don't care if every meal we go out to eat has enough calories to live off for the next two weeks...as long as a hot girl comes out in really tiny shorts and big boobs to serve it to us.</description>

			<description>For the first time in history an American president comes out in support of Gay marriage publicly. More proof that the Aztecs might have been right after all...the world might really just end on December 21st of 2012. Only one thing to do now...party like it's 1999. Game on.</description>

			<title>499 Friendlier Skies</title>
			<description>Unfortunately for many actresses, the retirement age for porn stars tends to be very young. The good news is that the airline industry is happy to do their part in giving these talented young ladies a chance for another career. To find out if your flight attendant is a video porn star or just a telephone sex operator, all you need to do is to look at her boobs. If her boobs are big - TV...if they're small - phone sex operator.</description>

			<title>498 Double D</title>
			<description>There are really only two ways that a tampon can end up on the sidewalk. One is that some dirty pig decided she needed to change her tampon right now and she did it in her car and flung it out the window. The other is that the Gay men that just moved into the neighborhood wanted to sabotage the "dirty dykes" that live next door so that they would have to move away in shame. Then they would be able to have their Gay male friends move into the neighborhood instead of the Dykes.</description>

			<title>497 Tanorexic</title>
			<description>It's been a long time since Crayola packed a Burnt Umber crayon inside one of their boxes. In fact, it's been so long that some people have gotten quite nostalgic about this beautiful shade of crayon and have decided to do something about it personally. One thoughtful New Jersey mom decided to take herself beyond a nice pleasing bronze color and go all the way to burnt umber without passing "go". She liked it so much that she also decided to take her red-headed 5-year old daughter with her. Model mom award of 2012 goes to....</description>

			<title>496 Stoned</title>
			<description>On a scale of painful things, first there are menstrual cramps. Cramps can cause a great deal of discomfort all the way to outright screaming pain. Then there's childbirth. Natural childbirth can really hurt....a lot. Then there's the kind of pain that a scale hasn't been developed for yet. Childbirth through a penis really f*cking hurts.</description>

			<title>495 Coyote Ugly</title>
			<description>Heading up to the lake for a vacation can be a very rejuvenating experience. Lots of fresh air, beautiful wooded forests and the opportunity to become one with nature. That's all fine and well until you realize the woods are jam-packed with coyotes, bears and other vermin set to carry off your pets for lunch. Next time it might be more relaxing to just stay in the city with the muggers, the dope fiends and the crazed lunatics.</description>

			<title>494 Dogaphile</title>
			<description>As it turns out...the extremist right-wing was correct after all. First we allow Gay marriage, which then lead to all other kinds of abhorrent and deviant behavior. Now the Lesbians are obsessed with dogs' buttholes. They follow dogs around and stare at their butts, they study how enlarged the sphincter is at any given time, and even how often the dog takes a crap. Clearly, they've taken this way too far and now the situation is completely out of control.</description>

			<title>493 Taking Our Sh#t Back</title>
			<description>For the straight ladies...you can keep the baseball hats with the ponytail through the back, you can keep the comfy boxer shorts to kick around in and look sexy, and you can keep pretending to enjoy kissing Lesbians. For the straight men...you can keep the goatees, you can keep the Doc Marten's, and you can keep shaving your nutsack. When it comes to the rainbows, however...that's when we have to put our foot down. Just pick a freaking color. You can't have them all.</description>

			<title>492 Dessert Triathlon</title>
			<description>Getting a piece of dessert really shouldn't be so hard to do.  If you have to run a marathon, knock people over and hunt it down like prey in a forest, you really are burning too many calories just to eat a piece of cake.  After all, dessert really should put on more pounds than you take off trying to enjoy it.</description>

			<title>491 Inner Gay Male</title>
			<description>It used to be that we lived in a nice quiet neighborhood, but now I realize that we actually live in a barnyard. The hens in the neighborhood walk around all day cackling and gossiping about everyone else's business in the neighborhood. Then there's the Lesbian pigs that live in the corner house where all the grass is dead and they think that dog poop makes good fertilizer to leave all over the lawn. Moo.</description>

The hens in the neighborhood walk around all day cackling and gossiping about everyone else's business in the neighborhood. Then there's the Lesbian pigs that live in the corner house where all the grass is dead and they think that dog poop makes good fertilizer to leave all over the lawn. Moo.</itunes:summary>

			<description>A message to Gill and Jane: I am extending a heartfelt apology for the evening you spent with Roxanne. I apologize for her unbridled vulgarity, her lack of compassion for other human beings, her outright sense of entitlement, and for embarrassing the United States of America and confirming every ugly American stereotype in existence. We sincerely hope that this doesn't affect the relationship between the United States and the wonderful and warm country of the UK.</description>

			<description>Sometimes you just have to do whatever it takes to to get something you really want. Once you've set you sights on the goal, you just have to go for it. It doesn't matter if you have to pretend to like Axe Body Spray, you have to give not one, but two men boners, and you have to speak four languages. It's all worth it if you achieve your dream in the end.</description>

Now that you're 45 you finally wake up one day and are horrified to think....how did grandma all of a sudden get into bed with you?</description>

Let her just believe that you could not stop thinking about how wonderful she is all day long and that you just wanted to sweep her off her feet and surprise her with the most magnificent bouquet of flowers ever. Why destroy the fantasy by admitting that you simply picked them up like a supermarket rag at the checkout counter on your way out of the store.</description>

Send an email back, without your bank account number of course, and keep them engaged in an endless series of correspondence until they simply give up. This way you can keep them busy and hopefully prevent one more gullible person in the world from giving up their entire life savings.</description>

Maybe you even want to clean up that treasure trail a bit before you hit the surf. Just make sure you use an experienced laser technician so that you don't have an industrial accident where the laser hits a lip by mistake. That could be a life-changing incident that happens in less than one second.</description>

			<description>Becoming a vegan used to seem like so much work. Every meal has to be planned out down to the last detail, you have to shop for groceries on a more regular basis, you have to find exotic recipes to keep meals interesting and you have to interrogate every restaurant server about each dish on the menu just to make sure you can eat it. Nobody wanted to invite you over for dinner because you were such a pain in the ass. Now that we know about meat glue and pink slime...vegan doesn't sound like nearly as much trouble as it used to.</description>

			<title>477 Grow House</title>
			<description>The neighborhood watch is a beautiful thing. Everybody knows about everybody's business, who's beating their wife, where the Lesbians in the neighborhood live, and whose wife is out slutting around. When it comes to stopping real crimes in the neighborhood, however, everyone always knows all the details only after the fact. Once the grow house has run through their series of plantings, supplied all the local dealers multiple times and then moves out...that's when suddenly everyone knows all about it.</description>

			<title>476 Bieber Fever</title>
			<description>Thanks to the advent of technology, driving in the car with children for hours on a long trip is a lost art. Gone are the days when the kids would sit in the back seat taunting each other incessantly, poking each other mercilessly and drooling on your sister as Dad threatened to pull the car over on the side of the road. Now the kids simply put on their headphones, turn on the iPod and watch a movie on the DVD player. Where did all the fun go? Slug Bug.</description>

			<description>You're eco-sensitive about almost everything in your life. You drink out of a reusable plastic bottle, you recycle everything you can and you even have a composting bin in the backyard. Why not take it one step further and just not wear any underwear. That way you can reduce the amount of laundry you have to do and conserve water at the same time. Lesbians will still find you just as sexy as if you were wearing only a thong.</description>

			<title>474 Knuckes Deep</title>
			<description>Going to the gynecologist is a clinical experience. There is nothing sexual about it in any way. Just because the doctor lubes you up, hunts around obsessively for your G-spot and leaves you all wet and messy on the table by yourself after they're done. Of course, that doesn't mean that you and your lady can't play "gynecologist" in the privacy of your own home. Especially if she's the Dildo Whisperer.</description>

We're not just talking about a personal time-out, that you're just in between relationships, or even if you're waiting for the right time. It's when you're approaching 50 and have never had sex with anyone but yourself that it's time for a tall bottle of rum and $150. Don't forget the tip.</description>

May as well get that apology together right now so that you can sound sincere when you really need it. Take a moment now to record your apology in advance, loop it so that it plays over and over again, and then pull it out when you really need to make an apology and you just don't think you can sound sincere.

			<description>Families that shoplift together stay together, even if it's only staying in jail together. So, next time you're out shoplifting, grab the baby, pick up grandma from the home and get all your cousins to join you. Make sure you start in the meat aisle, grab the most expensive cuts of meat you can find, and stick it all in the baby's diapers. Don't forget to pick up a bottle of Cristal on your way out the door. Happy Holidays.</description>

			<title>469 Bleed to Win</title>
			<description>The average woman has a period 520 times in her lifetime. That assumes 13 cycles per year at 28 days per cycle, and bleeding from ages 12 to 52. If the average woman uses 25 tampons per cycle, that works out to about $8 per cycle, for a total cost of $4,200. Add in the cost of panties that had to be tossed out because of an accident or two for another $1,000. Plus, another $1,200 for Midol. Now we have something practical to rally around in the upcoming election season - a tax break for having to menstruate.</description>

			<description>Being a responsible dog owner is a big commitment. You have to make sure you feed your pets every day, give them fresh water to drink and a nice cozy place to sleep. You have to keep up on shots and regular vet visits and give your pet plenty of exercise for a nice, fulfilling life. Most importantly, if someone else's dog takes a crap on your front lawn, you have to pick it up and fling it into their yard to help teach them how to become a responsible pet owner, too.</description>

Once you do, however, you realize that the world has a lot of interesting and new foods to offer. You'll also come to realize that there really is a reason people call Lesbian sex, "bumping clams".The first time you open up a steamed clam...you finally understand that it does look kind of like a vagina.</description>

			<title>465 Black Friday</title>
			<description>It's that wonderful time of the year! Time to go shopping with all the crowds at your favorite stores to pick up a butt load of gifts for everyone on your list. Pack up your kids, the taser, the pepper spray, and maybe a knife just for good measure. Head over to Wal-Mart so that you're there as soon as the doors open at midnight. Then just unload a huge cloud of pepper spray across the crowd blocking your way, pick up that X-Box and head to the cash register. After all that hard work, you definitely don't want to get picked up for shoplifting.</description>

			<itunes:subtitle>465 Black Friday</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>It's that wonderful time of the year! Time to go shopping with all the crowds at your favorite stores to pick up a butt load of gifts for everyone on your list. Pack up your kids, the taser, the pepper spray, and maybe a knife just for good measure. Head over to Wal-Mart so that you're there as soon as the doors open at midnight. Then just unload a huge cloud of pepper spray across the crowd blocking your way, pick up that X-Box and head to the cash register. After all that hard work, you definitely don't want to get picked up for shoplifting.</itunes:summary>

			<title>464 Feels Like the First Time</title>
			<description>Your first time with a boy or a girl should be a special moment and it shouldn't be something you rush into or take for granted. You'll want to wait until you're in love and the moment is right for both of you. You'll know when the moment is right, even if the "moment" lasts only 15 seconds...or it feels like having a watermelon between your legs. Don't worry...it gets better.</description>

			<description>In this modern day and age it's almost unbelievable to imagine that people could have actually cooked a meal before the advent of microwave ovens. It's hard to even fathom that people used to really cook on a stove and wait patiently for water to boil. It's a good thing there are still drive thru's or else we'd all die of starvation.</description>

			<title>462 My Name is Ho</title>
			<description>It's important for every Lesbian to have a set of basic standards for dating women. The standards don't have to be high, they just have to meet some minimum basic requirements. She can be a "three" in the looks department as long as she can rock your socks off in between the sheets. But, if she has the personality of a naked mole rat and she stinks like Limburger in bed, it really doesn't matter if she has the only piece of software you need in the universe to finish your term paper. The Ho has got to Go.</description>

It doesn't have to be a place that smells like sweaty socks and dirty underwear. And, it certainly doesn't have to be the place of Roxanne's depraved fantasies about hot steamy sex.

			<title>459 Dog Jerk</title>
			<description>Masturbation is a natural thing to do. Most people find it to be a pleasurable activity on their own or even with a partner. Sometimes you just want to rub one out to relieve a little stress or to fall asleep. It's even possible that your dog likes to rub one out once in a while. There's no reason to be disturbed if you see the dog rubbing one out. Just tell Rover to get off the couch when he does it, because nobody likes to sit in the wet spot.</description>

			<title>458 The Big D</title>
			<description>When most Lesbians think of the "Big D" they start thinking about the Big Dyke that lives next door. What they should really be thinking about are the 10 signs that they might be headed for a breakup or divorce. One of the most telling signs for Lesbians that a relationship is on the rocks is when your partner suddenly starts wearing matching bras and panties. We're not talking about the six pairs of white ones you picked up for her at K-Mart on sale last week either.</description>

			<description>E-bay is the panacea for buying anything at all you can think of. It doesn't matter what it is...new or used...shipped from anywhere in the world, you can find it on E-bay. Next time you take the dogs on a walk at 5am and one of them gets hit by a reckless driver in the dark and the fog, you can find the murder chalk you need to draw an outline of the dead body on E-bay.

Stop drinking water out of plastic bottles and instead drink it out of paper boxes that require trees to be cut down.

That can be a bit confusing to the younger set because we keep wondering what happens to Gay people when they get older?

As long as the Lesbian dress code continues to include t-shirts, blue jeans and sneakers...we're in.</description>

			<title>452 First Date</title>
			<description>First dates are about getting to know another person. There's no commitment, no obligation and no life-changing decisions that need to be made. It's all about small talk, feeling each other out and figuring out if it's worth having a second date. If that first date turns into more than that, however, it's probably not a good idea to burst out laughing the first time you see his penis.</description>

			<itunes:summary>First dates are about getting to know another person. There's no commitment, no obligation and no life-changing decisions that need to be made. It's all about small talk, feeling each other out and figuring out if it's worth having a second date. If that first date turns into more than that, however, it's probably not a good idea to burst out laughing the first time you see his penis.</itunes:summary>

			<title>451 One Less Hoarder</title>
			<description>Spring cleaning is not just for Spring time anymore. When that urge to declutter comes over you just start bagging up your crap and clean out those closets. Then have yourself a big ol' yard sale and make a little extra cash at the same time. You'll have that satisfied feeling of accomplishment...until it dawns on you that you've just participated in enabling all the hoarders in your neighborhood. Now they just moved all your trash over to their house.</description>

			<title>450 Jumpstart the Economy</title>
			<description>With the country on the brink of a major depression, if everyone would just get out and blow their entire life savings on frivolous crap we would be able to turn the economy back around in no time. Times like this can be challenging and everyone might be feeling a bit of extra stress and tension, so why not take care of both problems at once? Go out and spend a ton of cash on a buttload of sex toys, porn and lube. That way you can release a little stress while helping the economy all at the same time.</description>

			<description>There's a reason why wedding seating arrangements are so important, and it's not about putting interesting, fun people together. It's more about separating people that can't stand to be around each other or people that will cause drama when they are together. You have to be sure to separate the groom's former ex, who is also his aunt's ex together at the same table with the ex's current husband and her girlfriend on the side. It gets complicated.</description>

			<description>Before one can come out as a Lesbian, there are certain basic skills that every Lesbian needs to know. The proper identification and use of duct tape is one of those such skills. No self-respecting Lesbian can come out of the closet without knowing the difference between electrical tape and duct tape, and also how to properly apply it to nipples while marching in Gay Pride parades. Removing duct tape from nipples without tearing off an areola is a much more advanced skill.</description>

			<title>445 To Love and to Cherish</title>
			<description>One of the wedding vows that most people completely skip over about is the one where the minister tells you that you've been entrusted with a vagina, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, for all the days of your life. That means it's your responsibility to always make sure it's in good working condition, that it's not sagging and that nobody leaves a tampon up there and forgets to take it out. It's a lot of responsibility.</description>

Nobody minds waiting a few extra minutes at the checkout stand while grandma goes through her purse to find the Jello coupon that saves her 10 cents on a 6-pack of lime flavor. It only becomes a problem when people start clipping coupons as if it's an extreme sport and then show up at your local grocery store with their coupon encyclopedia filled with 10,000 coupons for 75 cases of yellow mustard and then jump in line in front of you.</description>

There are more things to consider than just whether or not your new spouse will love you 'til death do us part. Now instead of just tossing your crap out on the front lawn, you have to worry about your new spouse getting mad and chopping off your jewels. Better start sleeping with a steel chastity belt...and make sure it's locked tight.</description>

			<description>What's not to like? You get three square (but very salty) meals a day, an enema every other day and someone to sponge bathe your genitals every couple of days. So what if people keep you up with their howling and screaming all night long, the lady next door comes in to your room to tell your visitors that you've been dead for two years or that the cleaning lady withholds toilet paper when you have to take a crap? You're living it up at the lovely Country Villa Convalescent Hospital.</description>

			<title>437 Lesbian Dominoes</title>
			<description>As Lesbians, we don't always have time to look up all our Lesbian culture questions on the Internet. We need those answers now. For example, if you're a vegan and you meet the woman of your dreams at a bar late one night, how will you know whether or not it's ok for you to go down on her? After all, humans are meat, right? We're going to need someone to create an app for this.</description>

			<title>436 Sweating Bullets</title>
			<description>There's a reason why people in LA always travel by car everywhere they go and won't even walk to the convenience store on the corner. The car forms a protective barrier to keep you safe from the homeless people and other nuts walking around in Ugg boots in the middle of summer. It's not that being homeless is a problem, it's just that someone must be absolutely out of their mind if they're still wearing Ugg boots years after Paris Hilton gave them up.</description>

			<title>435 Sporty Straight Chick</title>
			<description>Lesbians get a bad rap. Everyone thinks it's always the Lesbians that are out recruiting unknowing straight girls to join the ranks of Sisterhood. Finally, the truth can be told. After years of trepidation and doubt, it's finally come out that in reality it's the drunk straight girls that are out recruiting new Lesbians. At least that explains where all the toasters went.</description>

			<title>434 I Heart NY</title>
			<description>Congratulations to NY for legalizing Gay marriage! As a public service to help Lesbians across the Empire State, U-Hauls across New York will be shutting down for the next three months. They like to call it a "cooling down" period, but we like to call it insurance for making sure the vagina you touched for the first time last night doesn't become your new wife by next week.</description>

			<title>433 Working Woman Hotel</title>
			<description>Roaches all over the floor, thick black hair in the bathtub, a half inch of dirt in the sink and bedbug stains on the mattress. Despite the fact that most people gave the hotel a thumbs down and would not stay there, still there are at least 21% of people that gave it a thumbs up. Those are the 21% of people I never want to meet in my life.</description>

			<description>It's important for us as Lesbians to make sure that we always uphold the stereotypes people hold about Lesbians. You can do your part by making sure you sport a mullet at least once in your life, buy flannel shirts in three different colors and always be sure to wear comfortable shoes. Whenever possible, hold your wife's hand in public and give her a kiss on the lips in front of a crowd. Why do we need to do this you ask? Because it scares the crap out of straight people.</description>

			<title>429 Rectal Thermometer</title>
			<description>Motherhood sounds all nice and sweet like Winnie The Pooh and lollipops, until you realize that the best way to take a baby's temperature accurately is by using a rectal thermometer. It's bad enough to have your wife staring at you with the phone in her hand ready to dial 911, until you realize that the thermometer you're holding is actually the oral thermometer that you should have been using to take your own temperature earlier that same day.</description>

			<title>426 Lesbian Time</title>
			<description>When people think of cloning they worry about all the horrible things that might happen. Nobody wants to eat meat from cloned animals and we certainly don't want to think about cloning humans. Unless...instead of all the Lesbian clones showing up with the same hairstyles and the same type of blazers with rolled up sleeves they've been wearing since the 80's, the clones were smoking hot replicas of the hottest women you've ever seen.

			<itunes:summary>When people think of cloning they worry about all the horrible things that might happen. Nobody wants to eat meat from cloned animals and we certainly don't want to think about cloning humans. Unless...instead of all the Lesbian clones showing up with the same hairstyles and the same type of blazers with rolled up sleeves they've been wearing since the 80's, the clones were smoking hot replicas of the hottest women you've ever seen. Then everyone would be ok with cloning.</itunes:summary>

			<description>Owning a vagina is a big responsibility. You can't just place that kind of responsibility in anyone's hands and hope for the best. It's important to clean it regularly, to dry it out properly and to make sure no bacteria or mold grows on it. Most of all it's important to pick out a pretty color when you first get one, and to make sure that the carpeting matches the drapes.</description>

			<title>424 Dishpan Hands</title>
			<description>Professionals in all walks of life take care of the tools they use to do their job. Top chefs keep their knives protected and razor sharp, artists make sure they're brushes are in top notch shape for their next masterpiece, and musicians strive to make sure their instruments are tuned up perfectly. It's pretty much the same for Lesbians. We keep our nails trimmed, our hands clean and we declare a national emergency that must be taken care of immediately if the dishwasher breaks and it means we might be at risk for dishpan hands.</description>

			<title>423 Lesbian Finishing School</title>
			<description>Somewhere in the world there must exist an institution where Lesbians can go to learn how to be a proper Lesbian. There will be woodworking classes, workshops to learn all about the different types of denim and flannel, and an extra credit course you can take to help you make your work boots match your outfits. The one class that is required by all attendees will be how to shake hands properly without crushing the crap out of everyone you meet.</description>

			<description>Living with your new wife, having sex every night, your arms behind your back with handcuffs and swinging with other single ladies from time to time. It all sounds like it might be a lot of fun...until you realize you're in prison. Then, just when you think it can't get any worse, you get traded for a tampon to a pretty woman called Diabla.</description>

			<title>421 Dead Beat</title>
			<description>After serving jury duty for just one day, you'll come to realize that the scariest words you'll ever have to hear are that you'll be judged by a "jury of your peers". It wasn't a courtroom full of Lesbians that showed up for jury service that day. Instead it was the man with his pants below his ass, the lady slumped over two seats out cold for the entire morning, the man with rampant melanomas on his bald head and the skinny queen with pants three sizes too small. Well, maybe him.</description>

			<title>420 Time Capsule</title>
			<description>Some things just never need to be unearthed ever again. Instead of being dug up and flaunted out in public, they should simply be burned and tossed in the trash. That goes for the flannel shirt you wore every day of your life from the time you were 4 until you were 10, the boots you thought were so hot every time you wore them to the club, and the dildo that you used on your very first girlfriend until the label wore off completely.</description>

			<title>419 Up All Night</title>
			<description>It's easy to tell the city mouse from the country mouse. The city mouse ignores all the loud noises and unknown sounds that go on at night and just continues sleeping. The country mouse has to get up out of bed, find out what's going on and attempt to save the world with a flashlight and a stepstool. One gets a good night sleep and the other goes from compassionate animal lover to the angry neighbor calling Animal Control when the neighbor's dog won't stop barking all night long.</description>

			<title>418 The Lezford Wives</title>
			<description>They may be lurking in a neighborhood near yours and you don't even know it. It's the Lesbian counterpart to the Stepford Wives...the Lezford Wives. They drive their Gaybies to play dates in their understated, yet overpriced, family-safe Volvo. They're dressed neatly in perfectly pressed khaki pants and a delicately starched pink or baby blue polo shirt with a very comfortable pair of designer shoes with low heels. Of course there will still be football on the TV on Sundays and a cold six-pack in the fridge at all times.</description>

This includes sex, masturbation, breasts and periods.

			<title>414 Flaming Ear Candles</title>
			<description>No need to go through all the trouble and expense of seeing a doctor when you can perform simple medical procedures at home all by yourself. If your ears get clogged simply run down to the Lesbian Hippie drugstore and pick up some ear candles. Torch them on the kitchen stove until the flames are at least 6 inches high and then run through the house, lay down on the couch and stuff it in your ear. Wait for your hair, the sofa and the rest of the house to catch fire.</description>

			<description>There's a reason why some self-help and support groups that help people with alcohol and drug addiction try to stay anonymous. Not everyone wants the world to know about their private business and all their dirty laundry. The last thing they want is to have some lecherous Lesbian showing up at a love and sex addicts meeting gawking and winking at the hot girls while handing out condoms to all the men.</description>

			<title>412 Spring Break</title>
			<description>Almost every little girl has gotten a training bra at one time in their life. Still the question remains...what on earth is a training bra helping you to train? If you don't have a any tits there's no reason to be wearing a bra in the first place. Once you get tits, it's really not that challenging to put on a bra after the first time you snap it in place. The only bra training that really might useful is for Lesbians to get some lessons on how to a quickly unsnap a lady's bra using only one hand.</description>

			<title>411 DWI - Driving While Irate</title>
			<description>Southern California has two seasons, bone dry and flooding rain. During the dry season you can go out of the house any time of the day or night and never have to worry about checking the weather at all. When it rains, however, the National Weather service should not only issue an emergency alert that all of a sudden nobody remembers how to drive, but also to be aware that it's wash day for the homeless river lady. When wash day comes, everything gets washed...even if she's wearing it already.</description>

			<title>410 Flat D</title>
			<description>The average human passes gas at least 14 times every single day. Gas is a just a natural part of the digestion process and everyone does it. Still...you can rest assured that stinkiest toot you'll do each day will occur at the most inappropriate time possible. If it's not in the middle of the meeting with your boss, it will be right at the moment the new girl you just met goes down on you for the first (and possibly the last) time.</description>

			<title>409 Brazilian</title>
			<description>Getting a Brazilian is not just about looking good in a bikini this summer. It's also a good way to help save money during the recession. With a Brazilian you'll need less toilet paper every time you go to the bathroom, which means you can not only buy less toilet paper overall, but you can also buy the single-ply as well. Just think about how many napkins a man with a mustache needs every time he eats...same concept.</description>

We're going to stay on Orange Alert just to make sure that you continue to live in a constant state of low level fear paranoia and chronic agitation.

			<title>407 Misty</title>
			<description>Some people are naturally more sensitive than others. There are those that cry when they see a sad movie. Others are moved by a missing pet getting reunited with an owner. Still others tear up when an 80 year old grandmother comes out to explain how much she loves and appreciates her Gay son. Finally, there are the kind of people that feel the need to write negative comments on the Web because this show wasted 10 minutes of their life.</description>

			<title>406 Slut Club</title>
			<description>College today is so different today from way back in the day. Now instead of having a Chess Club to join for a little extracurricular fun, you have the Slut Club. At least you'll get an education in things that you can use. Everyone needs to learn how to have multiple orgasms, G-spot orgasms and how to do a little B and D the right way. You may as well get something useful out of that college education your parents are spending good money on.</description>

When you're done playing with your toys you need to clean them up and put them away where they belong. Nobody likes to come home after a long day at work to see a lube-soaked dildo drying out on the kitchen counter.</description>

			<title>403 Full Frontal Nudity</title>
			<description>It used to be that going to the theater was a family friendly activity that everyone in the family could enjoy together. You'd take in a show with lions happily singing that get shot by hunters so that the babies have to live as orphans, or a show where everyone is a junkie, lives in sqalor and dies of AIDS. Now when you go the show all you get is straight men's junk parading around on stage, someone's naked but pumping up and down screwing some girl, and the horrified looks of young children that got taken to the show by their parents.</description>

			<title>400 How Did I Survive?</title>
			<description>Selling your old junk on Craiglist may not really be as lucrative as it first seems. Once you take into account the extra insurance you have to take out on your wife that's meeting all the weirdos and then divide the rest of the money you make by the number of hours you have to spend talking to the stalker in you house and cooking him dinner, your hourly wage only comes out to about 50 cents an hour.</description>

			<title>399 Deep Fried Tampon</title>
			<description>Some things you expect to be dirty. The subway toilet, a dog's ass, the sewer at the end of your block and the bottom of your shoes. The things you don't expect to be filthy are produce at the grocery store, ATM keypads and the waiter's hands at your favorite restaurant. What you really don't expect is to find a tampon in your bag of fries when go out to eat.</description>

			<title>398 Dodged a Bullet</title>
			<description>Be careful what you offer to do for a friend just to be nice. There may come a day when you have to make good on that promise, and you might just run out of friends to offer up and throw under the bus in your place. The real test will be when it comes down to the last minute and it looks you may just have to go to the theater to see the live dancing show. At that point do you suck it up and go, or do you get a last minute case of the runs so bad that you can't even leave the house?</description>

Today we need computer technicians that can do the same thing. Every once in while you need to find someone that can carefully clean all the viruses and nasty infections off your computer without letting the new girl you're dating know anything about it.

			<title>396 One Good Friend</title>
			<description>We've said it before, but good advice always bears repeating. It doesn't matter if you have one vibrator or two. Everyone needs to have that one good friend that knows exactly what to do in case of an emergency. If something unexpected were to happen to you, they will simply race over to your house, collect up all your sex toys and secretly take them away to where they can't be found. Your mom will never even know they were there.</description>

Even if your best friend is Gay, this does not mean you gain Gaydar by osmosis. This is a special super power that only Gay People are endowed with. No, George Clooney is not Gay, either.</description>

			<title>394 Clorox Chicken</title>
			<description>It's bad enough when Americans travel to other countries acting rudely and embarrassing every one of us living in this fine country. Now it's gotten so bad you can't even take Americans out of their own neighborhood before they start behaving badly. The best advice there is for Americans that want to leave their homes is simply to stay inside, sit on the couch and don't eat anything that doesn't taste like chicken.</description>

It's important to have a good line of communication going throughout the entire experience where you talk to each other about what feels good and what's too much. In either case there's a possibility that you could wind up with a hand up your ass going for a deep tissue massage if you just lay there quietly like a dead fish not saying anything.</description>

			<description>The holidays are a time for joy and good tidings. It's the time of year to see your good friends, spread some holiday cheer and appreciate all that is good in your life. It's also the time of year to forge your wife's name on Christmas cards, to lie about what's in the packages you're sending through the mail at the Post Office, and the time of year that you hope the sexy UPS girl shows up at your door with boxes full of fun gifts for you.</description>

			<title>386 Bum a Smoke?</title>
			<description>Telling people that it's unhealthy to smoke, showing them ads of smokers talking through a hole in their neck or putting scary warning labels on packs of cigarettes doesn't seem to make a discernible difference in anyone's willingness to light up on a regular basis. The only way to really get people to stop smoking is to raise the price to $50 per pack and to have a case of dynamite explode in their ass every time they light up.</description>

			<description>It's hard work keeping the country safe from evil. That's why we all have to step up and do our parts if we're going to succeed. If that means going through a full body scanner at the airport, showing up in a Speedo with a nut hanging out, or letting Roxanne's mom listen to this show...we just have to suck it up and do what we have to do.</description>

			<title>384 Twenty in Chains</title>
			<description>Sometimes being a good partner simply means putting your own needs aside while you hold your partner's hand to help them through a scary or tough part of their life. It can be a gesture so simple as sitting calmly beside them talking about how hot Rhianna and Beyonce are while your partner is skidding down a treacherous snowy mountain about to careen off a cliff to her death. You can at least leave her with happy thoughts as she goes.</description>

			<title>383 Natasha TS</title>
			<description>There's nothing wrong with looking in the local sex rag for some companionship and love for an evening. Just be sure to read the description carefully. When Sexy Natasha calls herself 36-24-36 and adds and extra 9" at the end...she may be bringing some extra parts that you were not expecting. At that point you can just roll up the newspaper and stuff it in your shoes and jacket to stay warm all by yourself instead.</description>

The unrelenting winter weather is no match for four Lesbians on vacation up in the mountains armed only with an economy rental car, a refrigerator full of beer and a snowblower from before World War II. We can win this even if we have to stay through Thanksgiving deep frying a turkey out in a blizzard.</description>

			<title>381 Bush is Back</title>
			<description>It's true...bush is back. Even if you're not interested in growing a bush for yourself, there is still something you can do to help those in need. For all those ladies that lasered their bushes off back in the nineties and now can't grow a pube if they wanted to, you can grow your own pubic hair and donate it to Locks of Love for pubes. Feel good while helping others to feel good, too.</description>

			<title>379 Never Fall in Love</title>
			<description>Recent studies show that among eighteen to twenty-four year olds, 1 in 10 have had sex with partners of each sex. While young people are doubling their pleasure and increasing the number of sex partners they're having, they're also increasing their risk of STD's. The next time your friend brags about how many girls she has had sex with, ask her how many times she's had crabs. Maybe she also has stock in the company that makes RID.</description>

			<title>373 Run Pee</title>
			<description>Just because you're watching a long movie and you've had a large soda at the beginning of the show, does not mean the answer is to wear adult diapers to the theater so that you don't have to get up to pee in the middle. The answer is also not to run into the bathroom, hover over the toilet like a UFO and then run out as fast as you can leaving sprinkles all over the seat. Piss in a bottle like everyone else and just leave it in the movie theater for someone else to clean up.</description>

			<description>Just because you're a Lesbian does not mean you a license to use tools. You may be a pro with the "tools" you use in the bedroom, but when you start to think that you can wield real tools outside of the house...that's when someone is going to get hurt. Don't even think about using power tools. That kind of work should be left to a licensed Lesbian professional.</description>

			<title>371 Klassy With a K</title>
			<description>Nothing sucks worse than being a young Lesbian without your own set of wheels. You have to rely on your mom to drop you off at your girlfriend's house, only to have her pick you up a few hours later smelling like sex. All you can do is long for the days when you can take your girl out for a date in your own vehicle to a drive-in movie and a pizza in the back of your pick-up truck under the covers. How do you spell Klassy?</description>

			<title>370 Bushwacker</title>
			<description>Now that Fall is here it's time to start thinking about staying in tune with all the new fashions of the season. It's not only important to look good, but you you want to be stylish at the same time. No more of those dated looks from the eighties for you, and that includes your bush. Styling your bush should be just as important as styling your hair. Although not everyone is going to see it, you still want it to look good when they do.</description>

			<title>368 History Is So Gay</title>
			<description>History may be as queer as a three dollar bill, but that doesn't mean you'll find much about Gay history in your school textbooks. Most people probably don't know a whole lot about their Gay predecessors at all, or even where to start looking. Out and About Tours is on a mission to change all that. Hop on board the bus and find out all the great history you've been missing out on.</description>

You need someone that can provide the necessary air cover when you're trying to hit on that really cute guy that you've been staring at all night long at the club. Just be careful who you choose to be your Wing Girl, however. You don't want your creepy Lesbian friend hitting on the hot guy you've been checking out. In the end he might just wind up liking her better than you.</description>

We'll try anything once and even twice if we like. New and interesting foods are no exception. In fact, the more exotic it is...the better.

			<description>So rare is the partner that will take it upon herself to go back to the store she hates more than anyplace else on earth to return an item to get a replacement while you sit out in the parking lot rocking out to the car radio watching all the young hotties walk by with their tramp stamps and moose knuckles hanging out.  Instead of bringing it up on a podcast, you might be better served to simply keep your mouth shut and just say "thank you".</description>

			<description>One thing is the absolute truth.  Lesbians like to be comfortable.  That's why our favorite summer outfit consists of cargo shorts, a t-shirt and some nice comfortable Lesbian sandals.  The only puzzling thing is why straight men enjoy wearing the exact same outfit.

			<description>It's been said that some of the most successful entrepreneurs started their businesses in times of a recession.  All it takes is some out of the box thinking.  If we can have Harry Potter jelly beans that sometimes taste like vomit, why can't we have a "scratch and sniff" vagina candy that most of the time tastes delicious, but then every once in a while you get the one that tastes like vaginosis? Why not?</description>

It's not about how many breakups they've had, but more about how they behave during a breakup.  You don't want to be the subject of  the next Eminem song with all your blubbering voicemail messages crafted into the next hit song making it to the top of the charts on the radio.</description>

If the real reason they can't get up to turn it off at that exact moment is that they're simply in bed with some hot chick getting laid, then maybe you can have a little more sympathy.  After all, would you even want to get up to answer the phone?</description>

			<description>Nicknames are all fun and games until someone gets them all mixed up and calls one girlfriend by the other one's name...all in front of the third one that the first one is having an affair with.  If people would just stop naming their daughters who will eventually grow up to be Lesbians by the name of Sue...none of this would be a problem.  Then we wouldn't need nicknames such as Finger, Moaner, Lips or Tweaker.</description>

			<itunes:summary>Nicknames are all fun and games until someone gets them all mixed up and calls one girlfriend by the other one's name...all in front of the third one that the first one is having an affair with.  If people would just stop naming their daughters who will eventually grow up to be Lesbians by the name of Sue...none of this would be a problem.  Then we wouldn't need nicknames such as Finger, Moaner, Lips or Tweaker.</itunes:summary>

			<title>347 Cinderella</title>
			<description>It's good to have a Cinderella around the house.  Not the kind that stays up partying until midnight, loses her shoe and then falls in love with some guy she just met.  Instead you want the kind that stays home, cleans the house, scrubs the floor, does the dishes and takes care of all the chores.  You want a Cinderella that can be your own personal bitch.</description>

			<title>346 Bargain Basement Baby</title>
			<description>It's probably a good idea that Gay people are not allowed to get married and legally adopt in some states.  Otherwise, they would be doing outrageous things such as selling their babies on Craig's List, putting their kids up for adoption on E-Bay or  worst of all, they might even want to marry their pets.  The worst part about it is...then they would be just like straight people.</description>

			<description>Damn...you thought this show was going to be about something else!  Seriously, if big cities would simply install poles that dispense plastic bags the same way they do at some dog parks, then when you're downtown and you have to take a crap...you can just grab a bag and pick it up yourself.  Wouldn't that make everything a whole lot nicer?</description>

			<description>Sometimes it's hard to know exactly what to do in a difficult situation.  You're not sure what the right course of action migh be or how it will affect your future.  You stress about it, turn it over and over in your mind and still you can't figure out what would be the right thing to do.  So, you think about someone you admire and respect and what they would do in the same situation...and then you do the exact opposite.</description>

			<description>Every day is a new Gay.  It seems that every time we listen to the news or open a newspaper we hear about a new celebrity coming out of the closet.  Some are a complete surprise, some we're happy to have on our side, and others we wind up scratching our head thinking, "what took you so long?"  Then there are those that don't even need to bother announcing themselves.  Barry Manilow.</description>

If you try hard enough and you really put your mind to it, you'll be able to find that one thing that makes you feel completely fulfilled....even if your true love is trimming bushes into mullets and adding extensions to pubic hair.</description>

			<description>It's a beautiful feeling to be a free-shitter.  Someone that can take a dump no matter where they are.  They can be on vacation, at work, at a friend's house or even out shopping.  If the urge comes over them there is nothing stopping them from pinching a loaf wherever they are.  Until one day when divine retribution finally comes calling...and their world is forever changed...</description>

			<title>334 Vegetables Are Your Friend</title>
			<description>When someone asks you what ethnicity you are, what they really want  is where you and and your relatives are from originally.  They don't want to hear that you've had some Italian in you because you slept with some hot Italian chick that put her fingers or tongue inside you.  Of course, when you ask your parents that question, you don't want to hear that you're from somewhere other than where they've been telling you for your whole life up until now either.</description>

			<title>333 Red Eye</title>
			<description>There is a certain protocol to taking the red-eye when you fly at night.  After going through the obligatory safety speech the flight attendants ask everyone to pull down their window shades and dim the lights so that everyone can sleep.  Despite all the relevant clues...there's always bound to be some dimwit that continues to stay up chatting and laughing loudly all night long.  You sit there getting more and more annoyed...until you realize that person is with you.</description>

			<title>329 Shake the Troll Head</title>
			<description>This is not your grandmothers game of Bingo.  There are no lucky charms, no magic troll heads or any other OCD rituals in an attempt to make the next ball be the winning one for you.  Instead you have campy, biting queens, a gaggle of straight women at a bridal shower and tweaker waiters.  The one thing that does remain the same, however, is that when the bill comes to the table, somehow you still wind up $40 short after everyone puts in their money.</description>

			<description>When you really want to get some in-depth, accurate information on a subject the best person to consult is an expert.  Ideally, you'll find someone that has a degree in the subject, someone that has studied it extensively or even someone that has personal experience in the matter.

If you're a 911 operator, an air traffic controller, or a semi-truck driver, there's no better time to get your kid acquainted with what you do every day at work.  So, put them right behind the wheel, let them land planes and let them take the next emergency call to deliver a baby.</description>

So, put them right behind the wheel, let them land planes and let them take the next emergency call to deliver a baby.</itunes:summary>

			<description>With age comes wisdom.  When you're young you might think that a woman with two vaginas sounds like a rockin' good time.  As you get older, however, you start to think about the down side of having two vaginas.  Not only will you have permanent hand cramps and a swollen tongue trying to get her off, but you'll have to spend twice as much on menstrual supplies and you'll have to protect yourself from two bouts of PMS every single month.</description>

You have to think about the plot line, character development and all the details that keep readers interested enough to continue turning the pages.

			<title>308 Miss Communication</title>
			<description>Scientists have very specific techniques they use when examining foreign substances for the first time.  They never stick their nose in it and take a direct whiff and they never touch it to take a taste of it until they know wether or not the substance is safe.  You never know if what you're examining might be what the dog excreted from its anal glands earlier that day.</description>

			<title>307 Mumblina</title>
			<description>The Sims has always been a Gay friendly game.  You can create same sex couples, have them kiss and be affectionate with each other, and even live together.  If you've ever played the game, you're familiar with the unique brand of mumble-speak Sims use to communicate with each other.  What you may not have known is that some of the Sims have left the game and are now working at CVS Pharmacy.  There's a reason some people never leave the house.</description>

			<title>306 Hot For Teacher</title>
			<description>Learning institutions should be safe and protected environments where everyone is free to learn.  Within those austere walls it's completely inappropriate for a teacher to even consider having  sex with a student.  The rules, however, may not be so clear for the teachers when it comes to having sex with each other.   Either way, you'd at least think they would have enough common sense to lock the classroom door before taking their clothes off.</description>

			<title>305 First Time Etiquette</title>
			<description>First time jitters are natural the first time you're with a woman. You may be confused about what to do once you get into that situation, you may be nervous that you won't know how to please her, and you definitely don't want to look stupid once her clothes come off. As usual we've got some good advice for you that includes not shaving her entire body in the bathtub on the first date.</description>

			<title>304 Cranky For a Reason</title>
			<description>If your lady has been cranky for no reason lately, your first reaction may be that she is PMS'ing...again.  Maybe she's not getting enough sleep, maybe she's not getting enough sex or maybe she's just a plain old bitch.   Once you get beyond all of that, there may actually be a medical reason for her short temper.  It could be that she is low on electrolytes or possibly her iron levels are deficient.  Time for a doctor check-up.</description>

It's OK if you take gift cards from needy children, smoke crack with funds from the city you work for, or buy prostitutes by using your government spending account.  It's only when you get a blow job at your place of work that it becomes an issue...even if you're multi-tasking and getting work done at the same time.</description>

			<title>300 Lesbian Bra Shop</title>
			<description>It's not that Lesbians don't want attractive bras to wear.  We just need them to be attractive, yet still functional.  Sports bras are functional, but not necessarily attractive.  18-hour bras are functional, but not necessarily attractive.  Worst of all, you don't want to pick up a woman you think is "double D" who happens to really be a "nearly A" when you get her home.</description>

Next time your partner wants to do something that you hate doing, simply send them on a play date with a friend and you won't have to deal with it.  Then you can stay home and fall in love with fake characters in a video game all by yourself.</description>

			<title>297 Not Over Yet</title>
			<description>December 1, 1988 marked the first official World AIDS Day, but it's a pandemic that we have all been living with for more than 25 years.  We may have drugs and cocktails that help slow down and even reverse the effects, but they're not accessible, affordable or tolerable for everyone that needs them world-wide.  The long-term affects are also unclear.  This fight is far from over, so speak up, speak out, communicate with your partner and make sure you're protected.</description>

			<description>Adults are not that much different from babies.  When you want to get a baby to stop crying, you try to divert their attention to something else.  Maybe it's food, a different toy or a funny face that you make.  When Lesbians start getting into a heated conversation, simply try pointing out a nice looking lady with big boobs.  That should do the trick and get everyone into a happier place.</description>

			<title>295 Mature Adults</title>
			<description>As a parent it's important to keep track of who your kids are hanging out with, what kind of music they're into and what bad things they might be getting up to.  Adults should be good role models for their children by exhibiting appropriate behavior at all times.  Encouraging 10-year olds to share ring tones with bad words and sexual references might not be a good example of being a mature adult role model.</description>

			<itunes:summary>As a parent it's important to keep track of who your kids are hanging out with, what kind of music they're into and what bad things they might be getting up to.  Adults should be good role models for their children by exhibiting appropriate behavior at all times.  Encouraging 10-year olds to share ring tones with bad words and sexual references might not be a good example of being a mature adult role model.</itunes:summary>

			<title>294 Nipple Finder</title>
			<description>Next time you're online looking for your new ex-wife at one of the Lesbian dating sites, you may want to update your profile about what you're looking for in a lady.  Add that you're looking for someone who is a breast technician at a mammogram center.  This is someone that fondles breasts for a living, they understand the importance of warm hands, and they've got a lot of experience picking up and fondling all kinds of breasts.  That's what they do for a living....so they get a lot of practice.</description>

			<title>293 Dispose of Properly</title>
			<description>Once the relationship has ended and it's time to dispose of all those fun sex toys you acquired over the week that your latest long-term relationship lasted, it's important to know how to dispose of your toys properly.  If you can't donate your used toys to the local Goodwill, you can always spread some good will of your own by depositing them in your neighbors' mailboxes.  Just make sure they don't have a dog that likes to chew things.</description>

			<title>292 Tongue Joy</title>
			<description>Good friends are always there when you need them, but it's your best friends that you can really count on to tell you all about the best sex toys to use with your new girlfriend.  When you make that new purchase, just try not to leave it at your parent's house when you spend the night.  Even if they don't use it...just the thought that they touch it is enough to throw it right into the trash.</description>

Now the secret is out that you'll find dancers with stripper poles in furry boots at the Hard Rock, there are valets parking cars who are older than 50, you can score less than 80 in bowling and still have a really good game, and it is possible to find bad bread pudding on the Strip.</description>

			<description>There's nothing wrong with dressing up for Halloween, handing out candy and having a little fun.  It's when you start offering candy to everyone in the  neighborhood, including the parents, that you're starting to cross the line.  Thinking that you may decorate the entire house and the whole backyard to become a haunted house for everyone to walk through is really going  too far.</description>

			<title>287 While You're Down There</title>
			<description>Today's Lesbians are entirely too busy to be wasting time.  We need to make every minute count.  As long as you've got a doctor's appointment you may as well have them check your blood pressure, do a full physical and get that pap smear out of the way all at the some time.  Don't forget a pair of tassels so that you can make a little extra money on the side while you have your mammogram done.</description>

It might be more comfortable to get it done in the Lesbian nail salon where they have a refrigerator full of beer, the game is being shown on a giant flat-screen TV, the latest issue of Curve is available to flip through, and the ladies from Clinique have a booth to show young Femmes how to apply the latest colors for Fall.</description>

			<title>285 Just Trying to Help</title>
			<description>It may not be immediately obvious, but "help" really is a four-letter word.  "Help" should not cost you extra money, require more of your time than if you were to do something yourself, or aggravate you to the point where you need pills to keep you calm.  Next time someone tries to help you...help yourself instead and just say, "no".</description>

			<description>In tough times it's good to have an entrepreneurial spirit to help kick start the economy once again.  The key to success is to find that one unique idea that has a good chance of success.  Sponsoring drug dealers near high schools or using condom companies to sponsor school sports teams may not be examples of winning formulas.</description>

			<title>280 Ken and Barbie Go Camping</title>
			<description>Before you go camping, it's a good idea to make a list of the things you'll need.  First, make sure you drive your Porsche to the camp ground.  Don't forget the beer cups that you can write your name on, the portable Uno game, the travel stripper pole and a couple of Lesbians to take pictures of your camp site when the bear comes to visit.</description>

			<title>279 Losing Track of Time</title>
			<description>You know you're an old married Lesbian when to have "fun" you head to the nearest Sears and fantasize about buying new appliances for your home.  It might be time to break up and start dating someone 20 years younger who wants to party all night and have sex all day.  One thing is for sure...she'll be more expensive than the shopping trip to Sears.</description>

			<title>276 My Fair Lady</title>
			<description>The LA County Fair is not any different from a country fair you'd find anywhere in the U.S.  We have animals, carnival rides, cotton candy, silly games and crappy fried food.  We also have half naked women walking around in tank tops that are too small for them and daisy dukes that go half way up their asses.  The only difference is that in LA you might have to question whether their boobs are real or plastic.</description>

A few tips to keep in mind - take a shower before you go, don't show up in your sweatpants, wear some deodorant, and tits out is optional...although not always recommended.</description>

			<title>274 Banana Boat</title>
			<description>If you don't kiss someone that is standing under mistletoe, it means you will have bad luck for the rest of your life. Whether you believe that superstition or not, it's probably worth taking a chance by walking away if an ugly Lesbian with halitosis is standing under that mistletoe. Having bad luck for the rest of your life just has to be a better outcome.</description>

			<title>273 The Real Deal</title>
			<description>It's never easy to ask for help when you're not able to take care of yourself as well as you used to, but if that time ever comes, you may as well do it in the best possible style you can think of.  Get the wheelchair with the spinning hubcaps and gold plated rims.  Deck it out with Italian leather seats with temperature controlled seat warmers.  And, make sure it has a cup holder on the side to hold your diamond encrusted Pimp Cup.</description>

			<title>269 Paranoia</title>
			<description>There's a reason why restaurants have signs in their restrooms that insist employees wash their hands before returning to work.

It's so that they don't stick their nasty fingers up their asses and then stir your latte with that same finger.  If it wasn't a problem....they wouldn't need the signs.</itunes:summary>

			<title>268 Automaton</title>
			<description>In an ongoing effort for companies to save money and cut back on expenses, live operators are being replaced by automated phone systems.  As long as they're going down that path, it's comforting to know that they've put a lot of time and effort into making those automated systems as exasperating and annoying as talking to a real live customer service agent.</description>

			<title>267 Power of the Va Jay Jay</title>
			<description>It's a lot of power to wield to be the proud owner of a Va Jay Jay.  You have the power to make grown men stop in their tracks cold, to start blathering like idiots, to render them unable to think with anything except the smaller version of themselves between their legs, and to make them do things they might regret for the rest of their lives.  What a bitch when they find out you're a big 'ol Homo.</description>

			<title>263 Sanctity of Marriage</title>
			<description>Since the sanctity of marriage is so important, it's time for straight couples to take some responsibility in this area. From now on, every time a straight couple gets divorced, 10 Gay couples will be allowed to get married. If one commits adultery, that means 20 Gay couples can get married. And, for each politician that has an affair, that automatically gives 100 Gay couples the opportunity to get married.</description>

Not only will your house make it on to the cover of "House Beautiful", but you won't have to worry about taking down the decorations after the holiday either.</description>

			<description>Straight people are looking at the issue of Gay marriage all wrong.  The money spent on Gay weddings, including the wedding planners, the party decorations, the tux and gown rentals, flowers, cakes and honeymoons alone are enough to bring this country out of the worst recession we've had in more than 50 years.  Throw in the amount of money that will also be made on divorces, and the government will in the black in no time.</description>

Instead of spending tons of money on an acupuncturist, why not just grab a friend and do it yourself?

			<description>Nothing says, "I love you" like shopping generic.  Next time you hit the grocery store don't forget to pick up the generic six-pack of beer in the white can with nothing, but the word "beer" on it, the generic cigarettes and the generic tampons.

Next time you hit the grocery store don't forget to pick up the generic six-pack of beer in the white can with nothing, but the word "beer" on it, the generic cigarettes and the generic tampons.  She couldn't love you more, unless you also brought home the generic green beans.</itunes:summary>

			<title>255 Laker Girls in Thongs</title>
			<description>A major recession across the country, 11% unemployment in California, teachers getting laid off because of budget cuts and more people struggling to make ends meet since the Great Depression....  Still, the City of Los Angeles can somehow find $2 million dollars to throw a parade to celebrate a basketball team.  Of course if the Laker Girls showed up in thongs, dancing on fire engines with stripper poles attached to them none of us would have complained no matter what they paid.</description>

			<title>254 Lesbian Lingerie Chic</title>
			<description>Nothing says sexy like a set of mismatched bra and panties, unless that same sexy set has a hole the size of a quarter in it.  Instead of sitting there laughing and shaming your partner, why not turn it into a sexy shopping date where you pick out a few new sets of lingerie together?  Or, you can just shame her even more by tossing her in the car, dropping her off at the store and making her buy it herself.</description>

			<description>There comes a time in every relationship when the best thing to do to maintain harmony is to suck it up and do something you don't like just because your partner enjoys it. At times like that all you can do is take some extra medication, grab a huge cup of coffee, break out an extra six-pack, and man up...even if it means going to the theater.</description>

			<description>Perhaps when parents give their children the talk about the "birds and the bees", they might add that the birds and the bees masturbate, too.  That might be a way to prevent accidents, such as getting a fish stuck in your penis or having power tools inserted into your vagina.  It might also help every straight women know what an orgasm feels like before they have to go and find their first Lesbian experience.</description>

			<description>Almost everyone has had a crazy ex, but not everyone has one that crosses the line into psycho ex.  It's hard to figure out exactly where that line is, but comes somewhere after the point where they change their last name to yours after you break up, they start stalking you from three states away, and you need to take out a restraining order to protect your entire family, including your dog.</description>

			<title>248 Ribbed For Her Pleasure</title>
			<description>The rules of successful one night stands are: never sleep with your friends, never sleep with her twice, never take her home to your house so that she knows where you live, never spend the night, and never take off any jewelry that you want to see again.  As Lesbians we are simply doomed to break every single one of these rules no matter how hard we try.  The least you can do is to bring your own dental dams.</description>

			<description>There's a reason why the U.S. postal rates are going up in price.  It now takes four postal employees, three hours, three post office locations and one self-service postage machine to mail one single package.  The cost of the employees to handle all that time, effort and customer service is not nearly enough to cover the amount spent in postage to mail one simple package.</description>

			<description>When she tells you "I need space", what she really means is that she's really not that into you and that she intends on whoring around with anyone she can find.  Of course, she won't actually break up with you, and you can plan on her living with you and sleeping in your bed for at least the next 12 months.  That's just the mutant Lesbian gene at work.</description>

			<title>238 Out, Loud and Proud</title>
			<description>Studies show that LGBT youth are 2 to 3 times more likely to commit suicide compared with straight youth.  Sometimes life can be overwhelming and you may feel like you're all alone.  When you start to feel like you're the only one, just count 20 people that you know and realize that at least 2 out of 20 are likely to be Gay or Lesbian.  Since you're one of them...all you need to do now is figure out who is the other one.  If you need more help, call the Trevor Helpline at 866-4 -U-TREVOR.</description>

In reality those things have nothing to do with the biblical plague of crickets that's now driving us crazy.  The real cause is the fact that Gay people are now allowed to get married in several states in the U.S.  Congratulations Iowa!</description>

			<title>230 H8: Still Angry</title>
			<description>One universal truth stands the test of time for Gays and Lesbians all over the world. The one thing that can put a smile on our faces no matter how angry we are is to hear the Gay anthem "We Are Family" from Sister Sledge. Go to iTunes right now, download the track and then play it at top volume from every speaker in your house. Make sure the windows are open and that you're singing along.</description>

			<title>229 Sea Monkeys and Mouse Dicks</title>
			<description>It's a guinea pig's wet dream.  Living next door to 24 hot girls who all come into heat at the same time.  It doesn't really leave a guy a lot of choice, but to take care of business and then sleep for the next two days.  Next time you think about getting a pet try Sea Monkeys instead.</description>

			<title>228 Sexting</title>
			<description>Back in the day it used to be easy to share naked photos of your friends.  All you needed was a cheap camera and a friend at the drugstore who would develop the pictures for you.  Now all you have to do is snap it on your cell phone and text it off to all your friends.  The only difference is that now you can get arrested and have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.</description>

			<description>It only takes one time for you to tune into late night TV with the plethora of infomercials for countless products you've never heard of before to turn you into a believer.  All of a sudden your skin can be clearer, your tomatoes will grow even larger, you'll build muscles you didn't even know you had...and you'll be able to shit out every toxin that ever inhabited your body.   You've been warned.  Listen at your own risk.</description>

			<title>226 Respect Your Elders</title>
			<description>Even if you travel all over the world you'll notice that there are certain signs that we all intuitively know and that transcend language.  We all know the blue sign with a traiangular shaped woman that signifies the ladies room or a red hexagon sign that means "stop".  Then why is it that more  people don't recognize the universal message you're sending out when you put on a pair of headphones when someone sits next to you and seems like they want to talk?</description>

If you're looking for that perfect girl...the one that let's you treat her like shit, the one who lets you spend all her money, the one that likes it when you leave beer cans and take-out food all over the house until it rots...you'd better hurry up and answer that personals ad.  She probably already has a line around the block waiting to take her out on a date.</description>

Now we have to take our dog, Lulu, to a therapist so that she can use the stuffed therapeutic dog toy to show the doctor where she's been touched.</description>

			<title>215 Homo For The Holidays</title>
			<description>The mother-daughter bond is unique in many ways.  Whether she was the one who squeezed you out of her birth canal, the one who brought you up or the one you simply lean on for support, she'll always be "Mom".  She's the one who knows exactly how to push your buttons, how to make you feel guilty about almost anything and the one who makes sure that therapists will always have a job.</description>

			<title>214 Little White Lies</title>
			<description>Sometimes we wonder where today's kids went wrong...why they lie, why they have trust issues, or maybe even why they have psychological problems or other trauma in their lives.  It never occurs to us that all those lies we told to them when they were growing up might have something to do with it.  Instead, we keep propogating the myth of Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and some overweight rabbit that lays eggs.</description>

Next time you're pet sitting, make sure you have some compliments ready to go just in case you need them. Here's a handy one to use on just such occasions: "Oh!

			<description>Statistics show that more relationships come to an end during the holidays than at any other time of year.  This year you can make a difference and save your own relationship by not being a selfish pig.  Forget the practical, useful gift that she can use all year.  Get her something useless and expensive instead.  You're welcome.</description>

			<title>209 Vegan For a Day</title>
			<description>Becoming a vegan seemed like such a good idea at first.  You were going to save the world, end hunger and stop global warming.  Next time, instead of being so self-centered and selfish, think about your friends who can't stand going out to dinner with you, who can't ever invite you over for a meal and who have to think of new and exciting ways to serve up Quorn just because you won't eat anything with eyes.</description>

You'll find lots of lots attractive Lesbians down at the protests...and they already know they want to get married.</description>

			<description>Now Lesbians can live forever in the comfort of knowing that they will never have to part with their favorite cats even after they've passed on.

Don't do it because your vote can change the course of this country for the next four years.  Do it because once you're done you can get a free cup of coffee at Starbucks and a free donut at Krispy Kreme.  Otherwise...why leave the house at all?</description>

			<title>197 Giving White Trash a Bad Name</title>
			<description>Some White Trash is easy to spot.  It's the way they know how to serve Spam in 25 different dishes, the way they can leave the cigarette ash hanging while they feed the baby, or the fact that a dentist doesn't live anywhere within a 100 mile radius of town.  Then there's the kind catch you by surprise by paying the bill at a restaurant and never leaving a tip.</description>

			<description>Our elders lived their lives leaving nothing to waste.  When they went out hunting for food they used every single  piece of the animal all the way down to the toenails.  Next time you think about shaving your pits and letting the remnants go down the drain, think twice about that selfish act and instead donate it to women who have no underarm hair.  You'll love yourself for it.</description>

			<title>189 The Next Big Disaster</title>
			<description>It's been over year that we've been talking about it and still nothing has happened.  Not one bit of progress has been made to assemble all the basic necessities of an earthquake kit.  Obviously, a little temblor last week hasn't provided the necessary motivation either.  Perhaps a major holiday where we give earthquake kits to all our loved ones as gifts will help with the kick in the ass we need...but we doubt it.</description>

Not one bit of progress has been made to assemble all the basic necessities of an earthquake kit.  Obviously, a little temblor last week hasn't provided the necessary motivation either.  Perhaps a major holiday where we give earthquake kits to all our loved ones as gifts will help with the kick in the ass we need...but we doubt it.</itunes:summary>

			<title>188 The Perfect Prenup</title>
			<description>Planning a wedding used to be easy.  You only had to think about a location, flowers, catering, decorations and which exes to invite.  Nowadays you have to think about putting together the perfect prenuptial agreement, too.  Or, you can just skip the whole thing and become the typical Lesbian couple that continues to live together after they break up.</description>

			<description>When you've been romancing a local restaurant for years and selflessly sharing all your love with them, you feel like your in a relationship.  They have a responsibility to you as their loyal partner not to just pack up all their things and leave you in the middle of the night with no forwarding address, no reasons why and no explanations.  Like a jilted lover, you'll be nursing a broken heart and wondering what you did wrong for the rest of your life.</description>

			<description>All those girls who desperately wanted to make it onto the cheerleading squad in high school, but were just a bit too plump to be accepted by the other mean girls have finally found a place they can call their own.  It's called Weight Watchers.  Now they have all become meeting leaders so they can jump and yell to pump you up and cheer you on as the pounds fall off.</description>

It's called Weight Watchers.  Now they have all become meeting leaders so they can jump and yell to pump you up and cheer you on as the pounds fall off.</itunes:summary>

			<description>Should you have multiple wives or just get whores...it's a tough choice.  Sister wives are there whenever you need them, they take care of the kids all day, but then you have to deal with all of them PMS'ing at the same time.  Whores come over only whenever you need them, you pay them only for the time they're with you, but you always take the risk of picking up a new STD when they come over.  Either way...it's going to cost you a lot of money.</description>

			<title>167 The Miracle of Plastic</title>
			<description>Physicians in ancient India were doing reconstructive work using skin grafts as early as the 8th century BC.  In 1855, English inventor, Alexander Parkes, created the earliest form of plastic.  In 2006, nearly 11 million plastic surgeries were performed in the U.S. alone.  One can only imagine how many tries it took to get the nipple to look just right after plastic breast implants.</description>

			<title>161 Happy Mistress Day</title>
			<description>Next year when February 13 rolls around, don't forget to honor that special woman in your life.  She's the one who really understands you, she pays attention to you, she knows exactly what you need even before you do and she knows how to make you feel good.  Best of all, she's the one who will actually let you try all those funky positions your wife just rolls her eyes about.

			<description>It could happen...  Two ordinary Lesbians might just wind up with the girliest little girl on the planet.  She may be into lipstick, dresses, heels and everything "princess".  The worst part is that she may not even want blue jeans and fleece to ever adorn her body!  Not to worry...we have the way to balance out the universe once again and put the world back at peace.  It's Lesbian Barbie.</description>

			<description>With the Hollywood writers stike in full effect, there's no better way to fill up all that dead TV air time than to take a bunch of D-list celebrities, throw them into rehab and point a camera at them.  Don't forget the gallon sized Ziploc bags.</description>

			<title>144 Going Postal</title>
			<description>Going to the post office is not that complicated.  You only have a few different options of things you can do there.  You can send a letter, pick up some mail or buy some stamps.  You would think that most people probably know what they're going there before they even get to the post office.  Yet people still get up to the window and stand there staring  at the post office clerk wondering what to do, while the line gets longer and longer and people get angrier and angrier...including the post office workers.</description>

			<description>It's almost tax time. That means that you need to start pulling out all your receipts and paperwork, desperately trying to find enough deductions and tax credits so that you don't go bankrupt on April 15. This year, rather than giving all your hard-earned money to the tax man, why not start you own "church" instead?</description>

			<title>142 Red Flag Warning</title>
			<description>Red flags dot the hillside, blowing and flapping madly in the wind.  Still, we pay no heed and rush right into relationships with all kinds of psychos.

We've already made all those bad choices and lived to tell about it.</description>

			<title>137 Lesbian Breakup Etiquette</title>
			<description>It may be hard to believe that Lesbian couples would break up at all, especially since you knew you would marry her and be together forever after the second date...or maybe the third date for the committment phobic.  Stranger things have certainly happened, so it's best to be prepared in advance...just in case.  You want to be ready if you decide to break into her house to get back all the gifts you ever gave her, or if you just simply want to drain the joint bank account ahead of time.</description>

			<title>135 Employee of the Year</title>
			<description>This year when the boss asks you to complete a self-evaluation for your annual performance review so that they can figure out what you've been doing all year, make sure you let them know that you've been the Employee of the Year.  Be sure to rate yourself "excellent" in every category.  Who cares if you've been late to work almost every day, you leave early, you don't get anything done on time and you're generally a pain in the ass to everyone in the office.  Make sure that that the hour you spend completing your review is worth the hour of your life you'll never get back by wasting your time on this crap.</description>

			<title>134 Knife Snob</title>
			<description>Back when we were young kids, mom would always warn us not to touch sharp or dangerous objects. Of course, we would ignore her, get hurt and then cry until she gave us a lollipop to make it all feel better. Now that we're adults, it's clear that we haven't learned anything at all. We still ignore mother's stern warnings and can't stop ourselves from playing with sharp, shiny objects in the kitchen.  It's a good thing there's a hospital not too far away.</description>

We've all had woken up in the morning and had our breath smell like ass...maybe you had too much garlic at lunch...or maybe you just smoke cigarettes.  But when you have to drive down the freeway in the middle of winter with the car window wide open and your head hanging out like a dog because the person next to you has insane halitosis...that's just ridiculous.</description>

			<description>Leave it to Hallmark to make sure that you always have a reason to buy cards and gifts in any month of the year, for almost anyone you know, for almost any reason at all. When "Bosses Day" comes around, make sure you run out and get a gift for someone who makes eight times as much money as you do...and who you probably don't like anyway.</description>

Not to worry... we'll take you through the official list of bands whose music you should immediately go out and buy so that you can stop other people from listening  to them and having them become homosexuals, too.</description>

			<title>128 Driving Miss Maggie</title>
			<description>Now that the market is flooded with relatively low-priced GPS navigational systems, there is no excuse for anyone to get lost while driving ever again.  But, there is one important thing  missing.  It's the attitude you get from your navigator when you make a wrong turn or head the wrong way.  If someone can create a downloadable set of new voices with some attitude and personality for the GPS, I'm ready to download it from i-Tunes right now.</description>

			<title>119 Vegas Baby</title>
			<description>We trek off to Vegas for the weekend to celebrate Beth's birthday and enjoy a weekend of offensive t-shirts, karaoke and pawn shops.  As they say in Vegas,  "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas".  But, even with that...sometimes you still want the people to just leave and go home.</description>

			<title>117 Chick With a Dick</title>
			<description>It's not exactly penis envy...it's more like penis curiosity.  If you could take a pill that gave you a penis of your very own for just one day, you need to make sure you get your money's worth out of it.  Roxanne's niece, Ashley, joins us for this important topic.  We definitely needed the straight girl perspective on this one.</description>

			<title>116 I'm Not a Gyno, but I'll Take a Look</title>
			<description>If men had to get the equivalent of a mammogram on their penis once a year, you can be sure that there would all of a sudden be incredible advances in technology.  Instead of having your organ squished and squeezed, and flattened out across a set of cold plates the length of the room, men would invent a soft, mouth-shaped cup that would gently grip their penis and move rhythmically back and forth to scan for any abnormalities.  Every machine would come equipped with a soft towel for "cleaning up" afterwards.  Men would be lining up around the block for their exams.</description>

			<title>115 Porn Capital of the World</title>
			<description>Lots of different cities and states have a unique claim to fame. In California, the San Fernando Valley is considered the Porn Capital of the World due to the number of studios and production houses cranking out skin flicks. Next time you visit this great state, you can head down to Disneyland to see Pocahontas and then travel to the Valley to see Poke-A-Hot-Ass....all in the same day.</description>

			<title>114 Mirror, Mirror, On the Wall</title>
			<description>Mirror, mirror, on the wall...what the fuck is that thing coming out of my face?!  After Lasik, Virginia could see the hair on a gnat's ass from 2 miles away.  The only downside was that her close-up vision got so bad that she finally had to break down and get a 50x magnification mirror.  Now we need therapy to work through the issues of strange hairs popping out on our faces, wrinkles we  couldn't see before and dark pores we didn't even know we had.  All this due to that evil mirror invented by some sick, cruel sociopath.</description>

			<description>In every neighborhood there is the creepy house that you don't want to walk too close to when you go by.

I'm proud to say...it's that time of year, and now....that's our house!</description>

Then there's the people who relax by picking up whores in video games, having fake sex with them in the game and then paying them with fake money.</description>

It will cause you to do bad things such as going into chat rooms to have cyber sex with people you can't see, you'll take on a secret screen name to hide your true identity, and you'll pick up rimming as your new favorite pasttime.</description>

			<title>098 The Simple Life</title>
			<description>Back in the day...life was hard.  You had to walk 10 miles inthe snow to get to school, and it was uphill both ways.  You had to shovel coal until it was dark just to stay warm in the winter.  And, you had to go out hunting for food just so that you could eat.  Now you can just go to Costco and stock up on enough bagels to get you through the entire winter without ever having to leave the house again.</description>

			<title>091 Losing My Religion</title>
			<description>Just because you scream out the name of the Lord while having sex doesn't necesarily mean that you've got religion.  It could actually mean that you're losing your religion right at that very moment.  It's an added bonus when your mother hears it and finds out at the very same time.  That way you don't have to go through the agony of breaking her heart later.</description>

That way you don't have to go through the agony of breaking her heart later.</itunes:summary>

			<description>Going to church just isn't what it used to be. Now they have full-length concerts with a full band and Gay back up singers, videos with the words roll across the the TV so that you can sing along with the bouncing ball, and they have Ad Libs you can work on throughout the sermon to keep it interesting. With all that going on, how is it possible that anyone could get irate in the middle of all that love, kindness and happiness?</description>

One thing I do understand, however, is that if I ever find myself out of Roxanne's "top eight", I'll know that we've broken up and it's time for me to move out of the house.

			<title>083 Fetishes 'R Us</title>
			<description>When you're new to a town and you're just getting started on the road to coming out, it's good to have a caring supportive guide to help you out. It's better to ease into a new lifestyle, rather than having someone drag you to a fetish club with people giving lap dances and stripping for free drinks. Of course...some people may actually appreciate that.</description>

			<title>078 Top Secret: The Gay Agenda</title>
			<description>Those Gays are up to something, and it takes an undercover reporter to get to the truth about what really goes on at Gay Pride in San Diego. To do the job right takes plenty of hands on research, including hours spent at the S&amp;M tent to make sure you understand how it's done, and careful monitoring of the Pride Parade, including trying to get a picture of the man on roller blades in a body thong. It's also important to inspect the free packets of lube and 19 different types of condoms so that you don't miss a single clue.</description>

			<description>Summer means it's time to be fashionable, ladies, and Tyra says that handkerchiefs are "in" for this season. Before you just shove your favorite bandana into your back pocket there are some things you need to know, however. Picking the wrong color and putting it in the wrong pocket with the knot going the wrong way can have someone tying you up, shrimping your toes and trying to shave you if you're not careful. We're here to help.</description>

Roxanne has discovered that it's not only convenient to pee standing up, but it's a lot of fun, too.</description>

			<title>063 The Burning Bush</title>
			<description>Fires raced across two areas of Los Angeles last week. Roxanne thinks it's the work of twisted pyromaniacs, but Virginia is convinced that the Griffith Park fire was started by a meth-head cruising for a blow job in the park. As for the Catalina fire, we're both convinced that the fire is a sure sign for the woman about to get married in Catalina that she really shouldn't get married at all. It's a sign that she should come out as a Lesbian instead.</description>

			<description>It starts off innocently enough when you get the new girlfriend.  At first you want to spend every moment together, then you forget about all your old friends, then you start wearing her clothes...and before you know it, you have the same haircut.  You've become the Lesbian Clones.</description>

			<title>045 Jury Duty</title>
			<description>It happens to all of us. We're innocently checking the mail, and there it it...the dreaded jury duty notice. As the panic spreads through your veins, do you think about running it through the paper shredder to pretend you never got it? Do you toss it into the street and hope that it gets sucked into the sewers? Do you make endless excuses and continue to reschedule until the end of your life? Or, do you step up to the plate like Roxanne, and perform your civic duty like a true American hero!</description>
