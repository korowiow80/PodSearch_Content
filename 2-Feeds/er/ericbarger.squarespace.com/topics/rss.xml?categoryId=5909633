This message includes many quotes from Emergent leaders illustrating the very problem true Christians face in these last days. Eric also points out one of the core issues - Emergent leaders continually describe themselves and what they advocate as "Evangelical." The action needed here is "test everything" (I Thess. 5:21-22) matching all teaching against the one and only true Gospel (Gal. 1:8-9).</p>]]></description><enclosure url="http://www.ericbarger.com/tasradio/errors_of_emergent_part_3.6-2012.64.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/><wfw:commentRss>http://ericbarger.squarespace.com/topics/rss-comments-entry-16515982.xml</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>The Errors of the Emergent Church part 2 (revisited)</title><category>Biblical Apologetics</category><category>Doctrines of the Faith</category><category>Emergent Church</category><category>Emergent Podcast</category><category>Liberalism</category><category>Podcast</category><category>Podcasts</category><category>Postmodernism</category><category>Seeker</category><category>Universalism</category><dc:creator>Eric Barger</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2012 00:04:38 +0000</pubDate><link>http://ericbarger.squarespace.com/topics/the-errors-of-the-emergent-church-part-2-revisited.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">317460:9880985:16447762</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This week Eric sheds more light on definitions as it becomes more obvious that Emergent thinkers use many terms familiar to Christians - but have attached radically different meanings.

<p>In part three, Eric's guest, <strong>Jay Seegert</strong>, of the <a href="http://www.cecwisc.com">Creation Education Center</a>, addresses the origin of life and species and obliterates the possibility that life came about through a process of natural selection (a mere accident). Seegert points out the incomplete and unscientific reasons that the majority of those in the scientific community have chosen evolution. Jay then adds dynamic and important insight as to why many scientists and educators have chosen natural explanations (chance) for the origin of life, while completely and purposely ignoring any suggestion of divine creation.<br /><br />This is another important program to help you give answers concerning this bedrock issue.

But as Jay points out, this really isn't an academic issue or debate. Its really not about the facts and science. Its actually a spiritual issue.<br /><br />Seegert also defines the very term "evolution," speaks to the issue of origins of the universe, and together with Eric Barger, debunks the popular yet misguided idea that an authentic Christian can believe in the theory of evolution and yet be true to New Testament Christianity and the claims of deity by Jesus Christ.

Besides fulfilling each and every biblical prophecy that Scripture mandates of the Messiah, Jesus&rsquo; crowning triumph was that He indeed DID raise from the dead - and not just spiritually, as so many liberal theologians, heretics, and uninformed religionists have postulated. The God-man from Nazareth beat death, he defeated Hell, and He conquered the grave, and He offers the same to whosoever places their trust in Him as Savior, Messiah, and Lord. This is perhaps our greatest reason for our hope as Christians. However, many Believers fail to confidently present reasons and evidence for this, the lynchpin of our faith.<br /><br />This week on Take A Stand Radio we&rsquo;re going to examine the <strong>"Proof and the Power of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ"</strong> and why every Christian has great reason to celebrate and give bold witness of His triumph over the grave each and every day!
