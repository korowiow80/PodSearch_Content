<br />this is normally where notes go for a show. but this show was a bit of a blur to me, so i am not sure what kind of notes to put here. 
<br />at the end of the show we take a short break from the usual fare to get real about some things, it can't be farts and boners all the time. 
<br />thank you to the nation for listening all these years and supporting us. 
<br />special offer this weekend from fumo.biz:
<br />promo code " july4" gets 35% off all orders over $100.  This will last until july 4th at 11:59pm. Carbon kit is well under a $100 now! Sweet time to buy!  Mediocre code still works as well at 20% off  for after sale ends. Both codes are for listeners only , stores don't get this offer.

<br />this is generally where the notes would be. 
<br />instead of notes, i would like to stress that it is VERY important that you get your tickets to the philly live show on 8/13 in advance. 
<br />go to www.worldcafelive.com and buy your tickets now. 
<br />ALSO, you should be ordering your mike vader limited edition shirt asap, since the order will be closed on the 20th and they will not be reprinted. 
<br />thank you for supporting the show, we really do appreciate it. 
<br />also, mike can make sculptures with his poop.

<br />this is the place where i would normally tell you what we talked about on the show, but i figure this space is better used to tell you about the entire weekend in salt lake. never in my life have i felt so welcomed in a city i had never really been to before. never have i felt more important than i did when visiting salt lake city. no amount of voicemails or emails can ever compare to seeing faces in the crowd, and hearing laughs come back at you. in the nearly 6 years i have been doing this show, nothing has ever compared to all the events in utah this past weekend. and as i always say, without you we wouldn't be doing this, and i mean that more than ever. you people gave us an even bigger drive to succeed, because we can't bear the idea of letting you all down. you are an amazing group of people, and we are so lucky to have you as part of the nation. thank you for everything you do for/to us. and thank you for being such an amazing and caring group of people. i wish we could do that every day. 
<br />/eric
<br />now please to be enjoying the live show from SLC we had a great time doing it and i hope you all enjoy it too. 
<br />thanks to everyone involved in making this happen. we will have a list and talk more in detail about it next week.</p>]]></description>

<br />let's get this right out on front street, we had a bit of a software meltdown on this show, and lost the entire recording. thinking that all was lost, in steps our newest sponsor to the show www.fumo.biz who happened to be recording the live stream from his home. if that doesn't start off a sponsorship on the right foot and make the nation fall in love with him, i don't know what will. please send them a note of thanks for not only supporting the show, but also saving episode 347. 
<br />that being said, the audio quality is not quite what you are used to but the show is 95% there, and we can be thankful for that, this in the month of thanksgiving. also, please do not follow any advice given by eric during this episode, it was not sound advice.

<br />I'm glad that your team has one small victory. I hope that has sustained you through years of abject pity and what can only be expected to be years of continued irrelevance. It must be nice for you to have one victory with a quarterback that won't be there in 2 years, for a team run by a meglamoniacal imbecile, who will not EVER have a viaible team due to his meddling. Your team  Is the goofus to the cowboys gallant. I hope this win will sustain you through your lack of a playoff run, you won nothing, it was used to you by our temporarily  inept team. Happy day. F*** your life.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>this is yet another solo mediocre show with eric tomorrow. 
<br />the mediocre show's favorite kid ever had surgery on 9/22/10 to have her tonsils removed, and because mike is a great dad, he took the week off from the show to be with her and take care of her. you will all be glad to know she is doing great and feeling much better, because she is a total trooper. that being said, i thought i would make a solo show for you guys to enjoy, or at least endure, so at some point in the future you can tell your grandkids you did in fact listen to every episode of the mediocre show, that is, if you have heard episode 1. there are a few still listening who have, but the vast majority of you have not heard it, and truthfully, you are better off having not heard it. 
<br />at any rate, in this installment, eric tackles such hard hitting issues as: amish contractors, the film industry, jeff vice, the word retard, buick vehicles, the SLC listener party. and so on.
<br />please enjoy, and join us at our regular time next week on areciboradio.com</p>]]></description>

<br />here's what you need to do to comply with matt's assignment
<br />"i am the mediocre ... and i am the nation" call them in to 206.666.5900
<br />it's just that easy. also, let's all try to work on our live calls to the show, script them if you have to. 
<br />another thing we could use is some itunes 5 star reviews, so get on that as well. and while you are feeling like helping out you can buy some merch or even send a donation like kate g from the UK did. afterall, we are doing this for free, and we are certainly poor.
<br />so thanks for listening every week while we do it live, it's fun for us too.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>mediocre 96 (junk riders)
<br />it's been a few weeks. you know that, we know that, let's get past it. 
<br />we had some computer trouble. hardware/software/then hardware again. 
<br />it's not as though we took a vacation, in fact it has been more stressful than normal for us. so, it seems as though you survived the time without it, and for that i applaud you. 
<br />now, on to the business: 
<br />as you can imagine, we had quite a backlog of voicemails. we do our best to wade our way through them. we also had a special guest on the show, by the name of alex, he's a tattoo artist. 
<br />also, we had some corrections.
<br />some beautiful singing from the mediocre nation.
<br />some confessions, and believe it or not, that took over 2 hours. so i guess we'll save the love/hates, and trucker buddy for episode 97. which will be coming when taylor gets back from riding his new motorcycle from arizona to portland. 
<br />thanks for sticking with us, and we have some exciting announcements coming very soon. but in the meantime you should donate to the show so we can get some new gear and avoid delays like this in the future. 
<br />call us, we miss you as much as you missed us.

to the both of you who read this far, have you written a review for the show on itunes? please do, it makes us smile. and when we smile we make better shows. and that's what you want, better shows. and a sandwich, because everyone loves sandwiches, well except terrorists, they hate our sandwiches. so don't let the terrorists win, go get a sandwich, and leave a review while eating the sandwich, but be careful not to drop bacon in the keyboard, it's hard to clean out. <br>
