Also we have another interview from Kevin, this week it&amp;amp;#39;s with Suki and Jet, and well it&amp;amp;#39;s odd but very good. Check it out and enjoy!Program Note: A small technical glitch here is present from the impromptu segment on when Dylan&amp;amp;#39;s voice is about 20 seconds or so ahead of everyone else&amp;amp;#39;s. This is a glitch with the recording program Dylan has an he&amp;amp;#39;s working on a fix.

            <description>Our new format is here! Included in this podcast are co-hosts Dylan, Kevin (alternatecoppa from DH Forums), and Jason. This week the guys discuss the issues of the Avatar State vs. no Avatar State. There is also a new impromptu segment where we jokingly voice the characters and make up fictional scenes. Then we have another discussion on bending (part 2), a Fan Creation review segment (we review a fan fiction article this time). Also the seventh episode title of season 3 will be released and a special  interview  with Toph and Sokka by our own Kevin! And one quick correction in light of the new interview of the creators.  Avatar Escape from the Spirit World  is in fact canon. That is contradictory to info we had previously and apologize for the error in this podcast! Now enjoy the podcast already!   This week&amp;amp;#39;s Fan creation is a fanfiction located here: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3265310/1/ (http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3265310/1/).

            <description>We are terribly sorry for the delays in releasing this podcast. Again scheduling conflicts prevented us from releasing one the past 3 weeks or so. Anyway, this week Jason (aka JasonG96, who won live trivia once during Elemental Week and is an active member of the DF community) co-hosts with Dylan. This week we start character discussions, the first one being Aang. Then we delve into Fire Nation propaganda that the creators talked about at PMX for season 3! This podcast is about 34 minutes in length, much short than our previous ones.   Also we want to really apologize for the quality of this one audio-wise. Unfortunately we caught some really bad feedback in the recording process (which is almost impossible to remove during editing) so we have periods of echoing throughout the discussions. There was nothing we could really do fix it after the fact and we weren&amp;amp;#39;t aware of it at the time. Another podcast will be released later this week, and we hope to have more success with that one! Thanks for listening!
