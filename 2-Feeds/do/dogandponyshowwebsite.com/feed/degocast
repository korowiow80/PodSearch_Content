<p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s show features some of the best musicians we know. <a href="http://www.mattwilsonmusic.com/" target="_blank">Matt Wilson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/RoryMerola" target="_blank">Rory Merola</a> join us at the Full Cup for a wacky time!</p>
<p>We learn about the things that make a musician tick, like music they hate, ultimate frisbee, and peanut butter on testicles. It gets wild!</p>
<p>We also introduce a new segment where we encourage our listeners to <a href="mailto:dapscast@dapsmedia.com" target="_blank">email us</a> their sex questions to be answered by our resident <a href="http://sexpertjaneblow.com" target="_blank">Sexpert Jane Blow</a>.</p>
<p>Our song this week is by our guest Matt Wilson, and it&#8217;s called <em>When You Find Out</em>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: There is a weird audio hiccup during Matt&#8217;s song. Don&#8217;t fret, It&#8217;ll adjust shortly!</p>

<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Sorry for missing last week, but I was violently ill!</p>
<p>Joining your hoarse-voiced host this week is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mikeshanephoto" target="_blank">Mike Shane</a>, who is filling in for Mickey Lavender, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/timduffy" target="_blank">Tim Duffy</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnthescullin" target="_blank">John Scullin</a>.</p>
<p>Our guests, both &#8220;funny men&#8221;,  have one of the most high-minded political conversations in the history of this podcast. Now that doesn&#8217;t mean that we were high, it means that we were talking about real stuff! But don&#8217;t let that scare you, we are having a great time.</p>
<p>We also mark the triumphant return of <em>Jeoparody!</em>, track last night&#8217;s Rangers game, and learn all about the Leviathan.</p>
<p>Listen soon and listen often! (I&#8217;ve also resolved an issue that prevented <a href="http://dogandponyshowwebsite.com/dog-and-pony-cast-12-miles-kahn-and-joe-so-delicious/" target="_blank">Episode 12</a> from downloading in audio players.)</p>

<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s episode is pretty impressive, for a number of reasons. First, we have <a href="https://twitter.com/mileskahn" target="_blank">Miles Kahn</a>, a producer, writer, and director for the Daily Show. That&#8217;s right! Another guest that is a part of real television! He tells us about his storied history on television (though he&#8217;s a bit more modest).</p>
<p>We are then joined by comedian/professional wrestler <a href="https://twitter.com/joesodelicious" target="_blank">Joe &#8216;So Delicious&#8217;</a> who shares with us tales from his romantic life with his best gal, and a bit about his professional wrestling career.</p>
<p>After a throwback jam I picked for nostalgic reasons, we play the IMDB game and the show comes to a grinding halt! Carlo&#8217;s lack of preparedness reveals itself and the guests let him have it!</p>
<p>All in all it&#8217;s a great show, and I implore you to listen to it multiple times.</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s episode is, without a doubt, our loudest (in a good way)! Mickey Lavender had the day off, and was more than competently filled in for by our new booker Danidisaster. Our guests for the entire show are <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thebarnyardboys" target="_blank">The Barnyard Boys</a>!</p>
<p>We had such an amazing time with these guys and their music, so much so that I was actually entranced by the pseudo-hypnotic and spiritual vibes. <strong>Things got <em>really</em> weird.</strong> I also learned that I need to learn how to mic the studio for live music!</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t yet know, The Barnyard Boys &#8220;are a group of cousins who hail from the back water town of Tiny Creek, Los Cerrillos on the outskirts of White Sands, New Mexico. Their traditional music, handed down from a generation of story tellers convey tales of mysticism, longing, repentance, love and exploration.&#8221; From my experience, this is all true.</p>

Hey there!
This week’s episode is, without a doubt, our loudest (in a good way)! Mickey Lavender had the day off, and was more than competently filled in for by our new booker Danidisaster. Our guests for the entire show are The Barnyard Boys!
We had such an amazing time with these guys and their music, so much so that I was actually entranced by the pseudo-hypnotic and spiritual vibes. Things got really weird. I also learned that I need to learn how to mic the studio for live music!
For those of you who don’t yet know, The Barnyard Boys “are a group of cousins who hail from the back water town of Tiny Creek, Los Cerrillos on the outskirts of White Sands, New Mexico. Their traditional music, handed down from a generation of story tellers convey tales of mysticism, longing, repentance, love and exploration.” From my experience, this is all true.

<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>This week we&#8217;ve got a brand new booker and we start off her run with a humdinger! Joining us in the studio this week is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/KevinWham" target="_blank">Kevin Rogers</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Keith_O_Lambe" target="_blank">Keith Lambe</a> of <a href="http://backslashbomb.com/" target="_blank">Backslash Bomb Productions</a>. They share their experience as a music video production company, karaoke hosts, and even tell a few raunchy stories. We also have them sing a fan favorite <em>Cuban Pete</em> right in the studio.</p>
<p>We are then joined by <a href="http://twitter.com/danielleward" target="_blank">Danidisaster</a> who regales us with the most unsettling party story we&#8217;ve ever heard. As usual we have a Chill Sesh and play Jeoparody. Standard Fare!</p>
<p>Our musical guest this week is <a href="http://twitter.com/mattreevesmusic" target="_blank">Matt Reeves</a>. We play his track <em>Be Seen</em> which features <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/higherconcept" target="_blank">Matty J </a>from <a href="http://thehigherconcept.com" target="_blank">The Higher Concept.</a></p>

<p>Hi ya&#8217;ll!</p>
<p>This week marks the return of Mickey Lavender to the show, and boy is he upset over last week&#8217;s show. Not only that, we read Dave Herman&#8217;s Post about his experience on the show. I still don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m overreacting to it.</p>
<p>Our guests on this episode are <a href="http://twitter.com/RyanAntiHero" target="_blank">Ryan the Anti-Hero</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pradogod" target="_blank">Prado God</a> from the <a href="http://anti-libsyn.com" target="_blank">Anti-Semantic Show</a> (follow them on <a href="http://twitter.com/AntiSemanticShw" target="_blank">Twitter</a>). We had a great time chatting with them, and even they even brought some news-items for us to discuss. This was also one of the most revealing Chill Sessions we&#8217;ve had, and the BEST game of Jeoparody ever played. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR6RNRi7gSs" target="_blank">You can see Prado God&#8217;s eHarmony video here</a>.)</p>
<p>This is definitely a &#8220;Don&#8217;t Miss&#8221; episode.</p>
<p>We also have a track from <a href="http://hotwatermusicdotcom.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Hot Water Music</a>&#8216;s new album. Thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/reybee" target="_blank">Reybee</a>!</p>

Hi ya’ll!
This week marks the return of Mickey Lavender to the show, and boy is he upset over last week’s show. Not only that, we read Dave Herman’s Post about his experience on the show. I still don’t know if I’m overreacting to it.
Our guests on this episode are Ryan the Anti-Hero and Prado God from the Anti-Semantic Show (follow them on Twitter). We had a great time chatting with them, and even they even brought some news-items for us to discuss. This was also one of the most revealing Chill Sessions we’ve had, and the BEST game of Jeoparody ever played. (You can see Prado God’s eHarmony video here.)
This is definitely a “Don’t Miss” episode.
We also have a track from Hot Water Music‘s new album. Thank you Reybee!

<p>Welcome Back!</p>
<p>After a brief hiatus, the Dog and Pony Cast is back with a vengeance! After explaining our shows imposed hiatus (DAMN THE MAN!), Carlo and Mickey Lavender get right back into it with two incredible guests. We welcome to the show <a href="http://twitter.com/thedaveherman" target="_blank">Dave Herman</a>, who tells us about his <em><a href="http://100jobs1year.com" target="_blank">100 Jobs, 1 Year</a></em> project and his time as an NBC Page. Dave also gives us the pleasure of teaching Carlo a thing or two about Improvisational Comedy. We also welcome one of our oddest guests to date, Mr Puff, a talking cat. That&#8217;s right, a cat, that talks.</p>
<p>Things get a little nasty at the end of the show, which resulted in some self-censorship (and murder). Just a heads up.</p>

<p>This weeks episode will treat your ears like a floozy and make love to them.</p>

<p>Possibly the most offensive episode yet! And we are trying to stop that stuff!</p>
<p>Man, this episode is extreme on very different levels. First off we have Dave, who is suing 4chan.org over the use of his life story in the creating of the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/foul-bachelor-frog" target="_blank">Foul Bachelor Frog image macros</a>. We then confront <a href="http://dogandponyshowwebsite.com/author/chris/" target="_blank">Chris Olivieri</a> (of DAPS fame) over his alleged extreme racism. As always we have a very interesting Chill Sesh, and another lackuster game of Jeoparody.</p>

<p>Our guests this week are great! First is Michael Bongiorno (of the <a href="http://emiliosparks.com/category/emilio-sparks-experience/" target="_blank">Emilio Sparks Experience</a>) to discuss the guest we thankfully don&#8217;t have on this week. Our other guest is Brendan Lyons who has growing concerns about my health and a few things to say about the Baby Boomers. On top of all that we have the most unchill Chill Sesh to date and a rousing game of Jeoparody. As always, the show is featuring Mickey Lavender&#8217;s soothing voice.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s be real here, the internet is a faceless form of communication. Even on &#8220;Face&#8221;book, there&#8217;s little way to accurately express your precise feelings on any given subject. The implications of emotion are driven solely from context and your exact statements alone. However, in the world of instant messaging, our chat clients have provided us with the powerful tool of smilies. They turn a simple :) into an actual yellow smiley face. Heck; on Gmail&#8217;s chat, you can even see your smiley face transform from a colon and closing parenthesis into a wonderful happy face for you chat buddy to enjoy. I mean, you can also watch ~@~ turn into a steaming pile of poop on Gmail&#8217;s chat&#8230; but this still supports the main point: Smiley faces are important on the internet!</p>
<p>This brings us to today&#8217;s IM. Carlo was being a dick, and well, the following instant message tells the rest of the story.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4987" title="picture-21" src="http://dogandponyshowwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-21.png" alt="picture-21" width="400" height="420" /></p>
<p>I mean, I&#8217;m sure he intended for his IM gesture to be a good one, but this is was ultimately a failure on his part that had a *happy ending*anyway. Carlo might say it was a failure on my part to have the smileys displayed on my end of the instant message, but I this is a matter of perception. iPeen failure!</p>
