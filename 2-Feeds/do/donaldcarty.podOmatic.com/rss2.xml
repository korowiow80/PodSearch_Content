    <title>Success Live</title>
    <link>http://donaldcarty.podomatic.com</link>
    <description>Henry David Thoreau once wrote, &quot;it is time that we had uncommon schools, that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women.&quot;  

Through the words of this collection of lectures you are about to enter an &quot;uncommon school,&quot; one designed to provide you with valuable information that will fill a large gap in your life and your instructors are, without question, the greatest faculty ever assembled to teach the subject of success and how to achieve it.

Napoleon Hill, Dorothea Brande, Charles F. Haanel, Wallace D. Wattles, Genevieve Behrend, Thomas Troward, James Allen, Russell H. Conwell, William W. Atkinson, Theron Q. Dumont, Ernest Holmes, Mildred Mann, Kahlil Gibran, Marcus Aurelius, -these are only some of the brilliant minds who have been gathered together for the first time in history in the fulfillment of the dream I have had for many years-to publish the ultimate audio success library were only the acknowledged masters of that subject were made available to counsel and teach and guide you.

Over the weeks and months to follow you will be presented with a myriad of success ideas, suggestions and concepts. History is filled with stories of individuals who dated a new era in their lives from a single idea.  May your name, youthful listener, eventually be added to that already impressive and glorious list.  But-it's all up to you.  No one else can live your life for you.  No one else can succeed for you! </description>

This stranger is close to you, closer than a wife a husband or significant other, or a child, or a parent, or a friend. It is the stranger within you. The reason it is a stranger is that you don&amp;rsquo;t know it. You are unaware of its presence, unaware of what its function is.

      <title>Beyond Belief - a New Reality</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/42578/600x600_1586995.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people don&#8217;t take personal responsibility for their present results. They honestly believe the cause of their current results lies outside of themselves, due to conditions or circumstances they have no control over.

The key is to understand that you are responsible for everything in your life. EVERYTHING. At some level - consciously or unconsciously, you attracted every person, every job, every idea, every illness, every joy and every bit of pain into your life.

Once you Accept that You are the Maker of Your Own Reality, You Will See that You Have the Power to Change That Reality into Anything You Wish. A new reality

We generally let our outside world control our inside world. We have to reverse this. Our beliefs dictate what we see! We&#8217;ve got to let the inside world take charge of our outside world!
 
The &#8216;Beyond Belief&#8217; teleclass will examine personal development and spiritual growth by exploring a wide variety of ways in which to change, grow, and achieve one&#8217;s creative potential.  The focus is on the discovery of self and the authentic search for meaning in one&#8217;s own life through a collection of uplifting and  sometimes spiritually challenging metaphors, paradigms of reality, fundamental world views, and conceptions of the nature of being human. 
 
Donald Gordon Carty will serve you at this telecast as a sort of catalyst; just as, hydrogen and oxygen will react to form water, this reaction will occur much more quickly (and at a lower temperature) if platinum is present as a catalyst. Donald will use his skills and techniques to induce a sort of spiritual alchemy on the mind and soul, to help you see the contradictions or disconnects that block you from the discovery of your true self and your potential.
 
Donald Gordon Carty is a scientist, philosopher, spiritual explorer, author and president of the Personal Development Institute.  He is also a man on a mission; to awaken people to a new way of thinking about what it is to be human and what it takes to make life and work more rewarding and fulfilling.

      <itunes:summary>The Master Key System; Introduction &amp; Part One. One of the great works that inspired &quot;The Secret&quot; and the &quot;Law of Attraction' With The Master Key System, you don't have to read hundreds of books... just one! Now, for the first time since Charles Haanel first introduced this enlightening home study course material, you can now study it the way it was originally intended and distributed: one lesson per week.
We do not need to laboriously shovel the darkness out of a room before letting in the light. All that is necessary is to turn on the light and the darkness vanishes. 
As you progress through the 24 &quot;The Master Key System&quot; lessons, follow the instructions and master the exercises you will begin to show the characteristic signs of a general Awakening. 
You will find optimism shining through the mist of doubt and unrest. The secret to all you need to get what you want out of life; Health, Wealth, and Love, is already within you. Now is time to open It!

Wattles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Just as it is true that it does not profit a man to gain the whole world if he lose his own soul, so it is true that good health, wealth, talent and success become valueless to the person who fails to attain happiness and satisfaction in the love-relations of the home. To live in happy love relationships with those near to us is the one thing needful.  

&lt;p&gt;Failing to accomplish this, we fail in all. Health, wealth, talent and success are, to a very great extent at least, without value to a person whom nobody loves. 

&lt;p&gt;How to get what you want in love is, then, the most vitally important of all studies in attainment.
