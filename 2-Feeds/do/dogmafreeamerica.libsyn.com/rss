            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: large;">Rich in Baltimore with Rob and Flynn, with a bonus:&nbsp; all the music from George Hrab's new CD, <em>Trebuchet</em>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Rich and Flynn talk College Football, and a teacher in Mississippi who was fired for leading students in prayer, and then re-hired in the same 24 hour period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Rich and Rob talk about an Irish woman sentenced to 7 years in the Middle East for throwing a Koran on the floor, and also about Lars Vilks joining anti-Lars Vilks groups on Facebook.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Then we play all of Trebuchet, in stereo (usually our show is in mono).&nbsp; Because the show contains music, no high speed version will be provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Here are the tracks for Trebuchet:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">featuring Phil Plait, Peter Gregson, Slau, and The Skeptical Shoe Horns.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">1. God is Not Great</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;2. Everything Alive Will Die Someday</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;3. Ms.Information</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;4. Fifty Stories</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;5. FAR</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;6. Remora</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;7. Sviatoslav Lobster</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;8.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Rich in Baltimore with Rob and Flynn, with a bonus:&nbsp; all the music from George Hrab's new CD, Trebuchet.&nbsp; 
Rich and Flynn talk College Football, and a teacher in Mississippi who was fired for leading students in prayer, and then re-hired in the same 24 hour period.
Rich and Rob talk about an Irish woman sentenced to 7 years in the Middle East for throwing a Koran on the floor, and also about Lars Vilks joining anti-Lars Vilks groups on Facebook.
Then we play all of Trebuchet, in stereo (usually our show is in mono).&nbsp; Because the show contains music, no high speed version will be provided.
Here are the tracks for Trebuchet:
featuring Phil Plait, Peter Gregson, Slau, and The Skeptical Shoe Horns.1. God is Not Great&nbsp;2. Everything Alive Will Die Someday&nbsp;3. Ms.Information&nbsp;4. Fifty Stories&nbsp;5. FAR&nbsp;6.

            <description><![CDATA[Fast speed version of Episode 120.  People with some types of .mp3 players can play podcasts at high speed, but with the same pitch as normal speech.  For some time I have been experimenting with coming  out with an alternate version of each podcast in a quicker speed so everyone can enjoy fast speed listening, not just those of us with fancy versions .mp3 players.

Since this is an experiment, I would really like to know your comments on this.

In this episode:

Rich and Flynn ring in the new year.

Rich describes his really bad Christmas.

Cowardice at Google?  Say it ain't so!

More ultra-orthodox protests in Jerusalem.

Ultra-orthodox hypocrisy.

Someone in Denmark allegedly tries to murder a cartoonist.

Lars Vilks gets a death threat.

An historical group in Maryland is against a monument to the U.S. Constitution.

This is a very brief follow-up to Episode 66, specifically the story of the anti-atheist smears that have been launched against North Carolina senatorial candidate Kay Hagen.

Rich plays a recent ad launched by the Republican National Senatorial Committee and makes some brief comments.

If you have not yet listened to the full Episode 66--we suggest that you listen to that episode first.

            <description><![CDATA[Sorry for the long wait!  Work got in the way, but here we are with a brand new episode.

A pseudo victory for freedom of speech in Canada.

More of the "Dog Wars" from the UK.

Instead of illegally teaching religion, a Colorado school district tries to use it to instill "values" and then gets sued. 

How appeasing religious zealots only creates a culture of entitlement.

A kooky "cult" leader in New Mexico says that his prosecution for child sex assault will bring about the End of the World.

And, just to get in on the action, Pat Robertson ask for prayers to prevent just the same thing (funny, I thought he was praying for the apocalypse all along).

Your emails. 

And much, much more.

Additional material added 10/21/08 (or for you Non-North American listeners, 21/10/08):

A commenter requested that I mention my favorite podcasts.  Here they are (not in any particular order--all are available in Itunes):

Dogma Free America Podcast
Scientific American Podcast
The Skeptics Guide to the Universe
Nature Podcast
Guardian Science Podcast
Common Sense with Dan Carlin
Hardcore History with Dan Carlin
Sunday Night Safran on Triple J
Point of Inquiry (depending on the guest).

            <description><![CDATA[Flynn joins us for some very interesting news stories, including:

A mother in Texas protests the Jolly Roger flag as a symbol of the local "Pirates" high school football team--because she incorrectly thinks that it is a satanic symbol.

90 Honor killings in Pakistan in the first quarter of this year.

The Obama campaign starts a special clothing line intended for "people of faith."

Sarah Palin blessed by Bishop Thomas Muthee (pictured), who has led campaigns against withcraft in his homeland.  Note, this story was recorded before we learned of another Palin-Muthee story where he actually blessed her to be free of witchcraft.

Ultra-Orthodox newspapers in Israel will not show photographs of the new leader of the Kadima party--and possibly the next Prime Minister of Israel if she can form a coalition government--Tsvpi Livni--because she is a woman.  They won't even print her first name!

All this and much, much more.
