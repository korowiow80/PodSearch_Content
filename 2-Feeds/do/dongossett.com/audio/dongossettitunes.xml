        <title>Don Gossett Ministries</title>
        <description><![CDATA[God has something extraordinary for you in the dynamic ministry of DR. DON GOSSETT, preacher, teacher, author, broadcaster, missionary evangelist, family man, and one of God's "generals of the faith."<br />
<br />
Raised in a godless home, Don hungered for the purity of Jesus and was born again at age 12.  Five years later, he answered the Lord's call to spread the Gospel and his goal was to win his own unbelieving family members to Christ.  The Lord delivered Don from a life-long speech impediment and launched him into preaching ministry.  While a teen-aged Bible college student, Don's heart burned with such a passion to win people to Jesus that he began preaching in parks, small churches and anywhere people would listen.<br />
<br />
A naturally gifted writer, Don's abilities came to the attention of his first mentor, William Freeman, one of America's leading healing evangelists of the late 1940's.  Evangelist Freeman invited Don to serve with him for the next seven years as editor of his popular magazine and to travel with him across America as his personal assistant, afternoon service speaker and crusade manager.<br />
<br />
Don apprenticed with famous evangelist, T.L. Osborn.  Reverend Osborn attested to the integrity and growing anointing in Don's life and encouraged him to launch into his own evangelistic ministry.  T.L. Osborn lovingly refers to Don "my friend for a lifetime."                                                                            <br />
<br />
God has used Don Gossett mightily to pioneer and pen life-changing truths and revelations of the power of the spoken word and praise in classic works such as "What You Say Is What You Get, "My Never Again List," There's Dynamite In Praise," "The Power of Your Words" and "Words That Move Mountains " (the last two with E.W. Kenyon) among others.  His writings, translated into 18 languages, now exceed 25 million in worldwide distribution.<br />
<br />
Don's life and ministry has been that of a victor, marked by the humility and boldness of Jesus.  He has recorded this overcoming life message in sought-after audio series such as "I'm Sold On Being Bold  and "Living Without Fear."  His acclaimed daily radio broadcast, BOLD BIBLE LIVING, began in 1961 and has been released in 89 nations.<br />
<br />
Around the world, laymen and national leaders alike have been touched and inspired by Don's life and integrity as evidenced in his preaching and writing ministry.  Many acknowledge him as their "spiritual father," gratefully proclaiming the life-changing influence of Don's writings in launching their ministries.  As a missionary evangelist, Don has personally ministered in 55 nations with signs and wonders following the Word of God. ]]></description>
