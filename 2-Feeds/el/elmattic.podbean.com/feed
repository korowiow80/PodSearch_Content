<p style="text-align: left;">Graffiti, and I guess breaking, were the first prominent aspects of hip-hop&#8230;graf artists were having gallery shows before any records hit the charts, and for sure New York&#8217;s general public noticed their subways turning into riots of tags and burners before they heard &#8216;Rapper&#8217;s Delight.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s skip the whole boilerplate history of graf, what it meant, voice of the disenfranchised, frustration into artistic expression, art as vandalism, claiming part of the city as their own, the word &#8216;palimpsest&#8217; which really gets on my fucking nerves, and <em>FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD. </em>(Also just for the record, this thing about Egyptian hieroglyphs. That wasn&#8217;t graffiti, unless you also want to claim the Sistine Chapel as an end-to-end burner.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s so much you could say about graf, but it&#8217;s been done better by many smarter motherfuckers than me, especially on the sociopolitical steez.  There&#8217;s the creation of a whole new art form&#8211;a wholly original one&#8211;out of raw talent plus what was available: the spraycan, the marker, pop&#8217;s turntable&#8230;and the improvisation to build on that: the caps off your mom&#8217;s oven cleaner, the blackboard eraser, breaks on old records, power from the streetlight.  And the jawdropping results.  How the fuck did you make that detailed, precise painting on the side of a goddamn train, in the dark, with a couple of spraycans?  How did you take some wack disco and old R&amp;B records and make that hard-ass funky beat?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There&#8217;s the exclusionary, internal messages; writing for the initiated.  The rebirth of the anonymous and ignored into superheroes with aliases and powers (you don&#8217;t think doing 3D letters is a superpower? Or spitting a tight 16?)  The repetition of these names, the power of the names. And this obsession with language itself, using letters as an artform, using speech as a musical instrument&#8211;that&#8217;s real interesting to me. It starts with the names and becomes this transformation of language into a medium, an implement itself&#8211;the twisting of letters into wild style, the twisting of words that rhyme.  <a href="http://www.gothicfuturism.com/world/00.html" target="_blank">Rammellzee saw this as graf&#8217;s most subversive aspect</a>, it&#8217;s just that nobody understands what the fuck he was talking about. In 1959 Burroughs said &#8216;writing is 50 years behind painting&#8217; and changed the game. By 1979 painting was 20 years behind writing. Graf caught it up to the year 3000.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyways. There&#8217;s only about 50 songs about graf writing. Why is that? Why isn&#8217;t there an acknowledged classic graf theme besides the Artifacts joint? Maybe because the golden age of graf was over before the golden age of rap started, thanks to the buff, Koch and the MTA. (Imagine if the crackdown on sampling had started in 1987! The entire culture would have been snuffed out in infancy, on some Moses-falls-out-the-basket dolo. Bullrush the show.)</p>

Graffiti, and I guess breaking, were the first prominent aspects of hip-hop...graf artists were having gallery shows before any records hit the charts, and for sure New York's general public noticed their subways turning into riots of tags and burners before they heard 'Rapper's Delight.'
Let's skip the whole boilerplate history of graf, what it meant, voice of the disenfranchised, frustration into artistic expression, art as vandalism, claiming part of the city as their own, the word 'palimpsest' which really gets on my fucking nerves, and FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD. (Also just for the record, this thing about Egyptian hieroglyphs. That wasn't graffiti, unless you also want to claim the Sistine Chapel as an end-to-end burner.)
There's so much you could say about graf, but it's been done better by many smarter motherfuckers than me, especially on the sociopolitical steez.  There's the creation of a whole new art form--a wholly original one--out of raw talent plus what was available: the spraycan, the marker, pop's turntable...and the improvisation to build on that: the caps off your mom's oven cleaner, the blackboard eraser, breaks on old records, power from the streetlight.  And the jawdropping results.  How the fuck did you make that detailed, precise painting on the side of a goddamn train, in the dark, with a couple of spraycans?  How did you take some wack disco and old R&#x38;B records and make that hard-ass funky beat?

<p style="text-align: left;">Also, you really gotta give them their due for breaking hip-hop into suburbia, wider audiences&#8211;like it or not, it turned hip-hop into a viable economic genre resulting in labels, radio play, tours&#8230;you want hip-hop to have stayed in the park with power from the streetlight, you do that and tell me if it would have survived to see 1990.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">You can&#8217;t really make a good MCA tribute mix, because the 3 MCs wove so tight on almost every track.

You&#8217;d have to be some atomic structure laser DJ, and then it&#8217;d turn the tracks into something totally different.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The way the Beasties&#8217; work as MCs together on tracks is tighter than anyone else I can think of. Run-DMC maybe, but with 3 MCs it was on a whole other level. EPMD, but they rhymed slower (PMD could go and grab a sandwich and still be back on stage in time to parry Erick). The Wu structure for example is so different&#8211;each MC gets a verse or a whole track, very little playing off each other that way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So if some DJ tries to extract essence of MCA and turns a mix out of it, I&#8217;m down, but it&#8217;s not my lane.  Peace to the King of the Ave.</p>

I always thought this was his best, most blistering set of rhymes.

By the time of Hello Nasty I moved away from the Beastie Boys...I just thought other cats were doing more interesting stuff, felt like the jokey, clever, party-hearty thing was getting old compared to, say, Heavy Mental. Couple of years ago I revisited and saw how much craft there is in their rhymes and music, a lot of interesting experiments happening. In the MCA obits I don't think the musical innovation gets enough play. No doubt they got kinda stale but they never got lazy, pandering or repetitive.

And they get props for being there from the start of the Golden Age. Def Jam's second release (DJ002) was the Beastie Boys' Rock Hard EP.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I been feeling kinda guilty that I don&#8217;t post, or even listen to, 95% of the music people send me.  This cat spammed up Soundcloud with his track and it&#8217;s totally ridiculous, but I kinda like it.  And c&#8217;mon son: who&#8217;s gonna post Siberian homegrown hip-hop 100% VHS Quality if not me?</p>
<p>

</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span>I&#8217;m Sam from Siberia, not Serbia! </span> <span>Do you know where it is? </span> <span>Oh c&#8217;mon! Everyone knows that Siberia is a snow desert somewhere deep in Russia. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span><a></a>We still got internet, but for the rest it&#8217;s a beat complicated. </span> <span>However I managed to setup a studio using a lot of cardboard, Soviet synthesizers and iMac G4 </span> <span>Besides I borrowed a camera from my next-door buddy. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Wonder what we could make using all these garbage? </span><span>Imo tell ya!! </span> <span>Dude, garbage is the trendiest thing possible nowadays! </span><span>We got lucky with that. </span> <span>See what we did with our own powers </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh9JuLsdX5c" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh9JuLsdX5c</a><span> </span> <span>It was a bitch to record in a cardboard box size of a jail cell, a beat stuffy. <img src="http://www.podbean.com/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) </span> <span>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m looking forward to fixing the whole &#8216;&#8217;studio'&#8217; situation. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span>If it blew your head off or at least didn&#8217;t leave you emotionless I would like to ask for your support: </span> <span>Buy it via iTunes - </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sibirskaya-zima-single/id518142734" target="_blank">http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sibirskaya-zima-single/id518142734</a><span> </span> <span>or PayPal Donate - </span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=YZUR4G2EBBFWA" target="_blank">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=YZUR4G2EBBFWA</a><span> </span> <span>Also check out my guestbook and leave a post if you would like: </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sam321.com/" target="_blank">www.sam321.com</a><span> </span></em></p>
<p><em></em><em></em><em><span>Or simply buzz my office: +7 926 251 4440 </span> <span>I speak some English and Chinese, besides there are German and French speakersin da house. </span> <span>That&#8217;s why I truly believe we can find common language and exchange opinions. </span> <span>Stay in touch!</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Uh&#8230;yeah. Word up my Siberian brother.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how many people he spammed on Soundcloud, but he&#8217;s getting mad views and comments right now:</p>
<blockquote><p><span><em>To me this sounds like a joke. I&#8217;m still wondering if it is one&#8230; Nevertheless it seems as if you found people who like whatever it is that you&#8217;re doing. Referring to me, I&#8217;d﻿ be happy if you don&#8217;t send me your stuff again.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>I&#8217;m confused&#8230; I don&#8217;t know it I like it or not&#8230;. very interesting though&#8230;. I feel hypnotized.﻿ I think I love this video now, I do love this video! its the best!&#8230;.. I think I&#8217;ll go kill myself now&#8230;</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>i wonder what drugs they﻿ take in siberia</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><em><span> </span></em>

Roundup of the best of 2012 so far.  Because fuck it, that&#8217;s what most podcasts do, and agonizing over finding that perfect James Coburn sample gets real old.
I&#8217;m gonna guess you already heard that new Nas joint and El-P going full retard though.  If not, maybe that cave you live in is not what&#8217;s popping.

<p style="text-align: left;">New York&#8217;s always been a big advertising target for Roach Motel.  On the subway they used to run them in every car: <em>Roaches Check In&#8230;But They Don&#8217;t Check Out.</em> In Spanish it always seemed extra ominous to me: <em>Las Cucarachas Entran&#8230;Pero No Pueden Salir. </em><em>(That&#8217;s probably the only complete sentence in Spanish I know that doesn&#8217;t start &#8216;Tu madre&#8217;.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And what is a subway car but a moving roach motel.  What is New York but a big stack of roach motels.  &#8221;All American cockroaches were immigrants,&#8221; notes Roach Facts.  According to the <em><a href="http://www.observer.com/2008/hey-where-have-all-cockroaches-gone" target="_blank">Observer</a> </em>in 2008, New York&#8217;s roach population has fallen as a side effect of gentrification.  Four years further into the recession, I bet that&#8217;s not true anymore.</p>

		<itunes:summary>New York's always been a big advertising target for Roach Motel.  On the subway they used to run them in every car: Roaches Check In...But They Don't Check Out. In Spanish it always seemed extra ominous to me: Las Cucarachas Entran...Pero No Pueden Salir. (That's probably the only complete sentence in Spanish I know that doesn't start 'Tu madre'.)
And what is a subway car but a moving roach motel.  What is New York but a big stack of roach motels.  "All American cockroaches were immigrants," notes Roach Facts.  According to the Observer in 2008, New York's roach population has fallen as a side effect of gentrification.  Four years further into the recession, I bet that's not true anymore.
I don't need to draw you a map.  Dehumanization is always the first step in exterminating people.  And reclaiming epithets is what hip-hop has always done best.

<p style="text-align: left;">Big up to Danny at <strong><a href="http://thefindmag.com/" target="_blank">The Find </a></strong>for running <a href="http://thefindmag.com/?p=14387" target="_blank">the first one of these</a>.  Thought I was done versifying on the topic, but some of the comments were interesting:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a></a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Although I&#8217;d argue that jazz-hop has become just as sampled as old funk records by now (even though the depth to which producers have been digging through jazz has been pathetically unimpressive, in which I totally agree with you), jazz and hiphop music are completely non-compatible in all but a surface aesthetic or instrumentation. Jazz is inherently a music of improvisation and melody, hiphop is one of repetition and beat. Sampling a jazz record to transform it to a hiphop beat is akin to straight-jacketing it, basically killing everything which is vital and alive within it. Producers sample jazz-records the same way they sample funk records, which is completely the wrong approach.</em></p>
<p><em>Adversely though, Rap (the spoken word) is probably spiritually closer to Jazz, which has always been closely related to poetry. A free improvisation by a talented emcee within the fabric of a tight jazz group is a wonderful and natural thing, no different from the solo-ing of any instrument, and not too far from Scat Singing. Its a shame that few emcees have been really confident enough to put their ego aside and allow themselves to meld into the fabric of a improvisational jazz group, but the results can be spectacular.  -Mladen</em></p>
<p><em>Dope article.  But when discussing this subject I think it&#8217;s important to stress that what it boils down to is that hip hop and jazz, though sharing some qualities, are two different animals.  I think jazz and hip hop can play nicely together and at times borrow textures and aesthetics but unless one sets out to make a true fusion then we&#8217;ll simply have hip hop music with jazz under/overtones and vice versa. -Stidak</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">I feel as a non-musician or beatmaker personally I can&#8217;t judge if Mladen is 100% right or not.  Maybe the improvisation aspect of jazz is being overemphasized?  I mean, lots of musicians jam out&#8230;that&#8217;s one (of many) reasons to avoid Grateful Dead shows, right?  Isn&#8217;t there some kinda improvisation involved in creating beats on an MPC or whatever, or even in turntablism?  These are really not rhetorical questions: I&#8217;m not a musician, so I have no idea.  The idea of freestyling/ciphers vs. that element of improvisation in jazz is definitely on point though.  I also think there are some pretty varied beatmakers who use a great deal of elemental interplay which is beyond straight jacketing a sample into repetition.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what a &#8216;true fusion&#8217; of hip hop and jazz would sound like&#8230;Buckshot Lefonque and that Easy Mo Bee/Miles Davis thing gave pretty piss-poor indications.  Most definitely the best beatmakers are using a wide range of timing and textures, but can they really &#8216;improvise&#8217; when every decision requires a conscious, technical aspect (i.e. &#8216;now I&#8217;ll sample this Ornette Coleman right here&#8217;&#8230;loads up WAV file, clicks around to find the sample, uses mouse to move it into place, etc.)?</p>
<p>Finally I think there is a common element to (certain kinds of) jazz and hip-hop, which is directed chaos, organized confusion: weaving together layers of discordance and finding a groove in there.</p>
<p>Anyways though, my main mission is to keep you on the cool out with another hour of good jazz/hop tracks. Got enough for another mix but hit me up with any tracks I mighta missed.

Breakups</a></p>
<p>So a couple of months ago I saw a headline in the <em>Onion AV Club&#8211;&#8221;</em><a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/what-makes-music-boring,65075/" target="_blank">The Big Question: What makes music boring?</a>&#8220;  I was all, neighbour please. (That&#8217;s the culturally appropriate variant of &#8216;nigga please.&#8217;)  Music is definitely not boring right now.  Then the article is all about a bunch of indie-rock bullshit which is by definition boring.  So, that&#8217;s your problem right there holmes.</p>
<p>Then the esteemed <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Dart_Adams" target="_blank">Dart Adams</a> did his Abe Simpson of Rap thing with <a href="http://bastardswordsman.tumblr.com/post/12918058404/why-there-more-than-likely-wont-be-another-golden-era" target="_blank">&#8220;Why There More Than Likely Won&#8217;t Be Another Golden Era Of Hip Hop.&#8221;</a> No, Dart, there won&#8217;t.  There won&#8217;t be another Renaissance or Enlightenment either.  Hip-hop, like any human endeavour, progresses and adapts and changes.  And right now it&#8217;s accelerating and smashing shit on a Large Hadron tip.</p>
<p>2011 was the Year Shit Got Weird.  The bar for weirdest-ass hip-hop LP was set by <em><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dr.-octagonecologyst/id310121423" target="_blank">Dr. Octagonecologyst</a></em> in 1996, and no one&#8217;s ever made a freakier, more insane record.  But this was the year when weird-ass shit was everywhere and universally acclaimed.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p>Yeah, &#8216;11 was also about human tampon Drake and <em>Hold The Phone</em>&#8230;and &#8217;90s innovators sounding pretty stale (Jedi Mind, Immortal Technique).  But the collapse of the music industry and the rise of net-based DIY means cats are doing whatever the fuck they want.  The underground vs. bling schism collapses when there&#8217;s only room for a handful who can move units&#8230;no point trying to hustle a record contract or radio play any more.  So dowhatchalike like Shock G.  (Brandon Soderberg of <a href="http://no-trivia.com/" target="_blank">No Trivia</a> breaks it down <a href="http://www.spin.com/articles/live-new-underground-spin-celebrates-hip-hops-diy-moment" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>End of &#8216;10, everyone was all about Kanye&#8217;s<em> <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ion=1#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=stupid%20fucking%20pop%20bullshit&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=&amp;aq=&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=&amp;gs_upl=&amp;fp=1&amp;ion=1&amp;ion=1&amp;fp=dc72ab6b1b03c4ac&amp;biw=1377&amp;bih=783&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;cad=b" target="_blank">My Beautiful Laundrette Fantasy Island</a></em>&#8230;I mean, everydamnbody jizzed themselves behind that.  About two of us were shouting Super Chron Flight Brothers instead.  2010 was all about Lil B and Odd Future too&#8230;OF, I feel the beats: the beats are really fucking weird.  But the rhyming is mediocre and the lyrics are just pointless teenage nonsense.  Both of them got outshone this year, maybe as Yayo says they <em><a href="http://nojumper.com/articles/best-of-11-yayos-top-30-future-trackstop-50-single-tracks/" target="_blank">&#8220;fell to the wayside due to a struggle to be taken serious (B), and what feels like an overall laziness (Odd Future).&#8221;</a></em> I&#8217;d say they were trying too hard to be weird, and have been eclipsed by more innovative, more honest, nuttier shit.  Das Racist is another one of those.  I don&#8217;t feel all that Adult Swim rap, but if it opens up kids&#8217; ears so they&#8217;re ready for Shabazz Palaces rather than skateboarding down the road to hell that is frat rap, it&#8217;s all good.</p>
<p>Some cats trace the Rise of the Weird-Ass through Lil Wayne, Outkast etc.  Dave Bry&#8217;s article in <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2011/03/rap-music-is-good-now-because-rappers-arent-afraid-to-be-weird" target="_blank"><em>The Awl</em></a> makes a good distinction between the &#8216;I&#8217;m crazy&#8217; lean of Eminem (or the Geto Boys), which really means &#8216;I don&#8217;t give a fuck&#8217; rather than &#8216;I should seek professional help.&#8217;  Prefix similarly notes that <em><a href="http://www.prefixmag.com/features/asap-rocky-big-krit-danny-brown-lil-b-ofwgta-shabazz-palaces-yelawolf/hip-hop-2011/59445/" target="_blank">&#8220;Even the most successful of today&#8217;s emcees seem cagey, apologetic, paranoid.&#8221;</a></em></p>
<p>A lot of what we call hip-hop now is not only damn strange-sounding, but pushes the definition of hip hop.  Take Open Mike Eagle&#8211;<em><a href="http://mikeeagle.net/albums/" target="_blank">Rappers Will Die of Natural Causes</a></em> took trophies on a lot of lists, and aside from really odd-ass sounding production, he doesn&#8217;t really rap: he kind of talks/sings.  He, like, salks.  He tings.  Death Grips&#8217; <em><a href="http://thirdworlds.net/exmilitary.php" target="_blank">Ex-Military</a></em> got huge love in the underground, and that crazy ass hardcore punk shit is not Kurtis Blow&#8217;s hip-hop.  Peep out the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/uncommon-radio/id251561695# " target="_blank">Uncommon best-of podcast</a>: NASA wonders whether his top four picks can really be called hip-hop.  Most definitely envelope-pushing shit has been around since Anticon dropped <em><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/anticon-music-for-advancement/id273129956" target="_blank">Music for the Advancement of Hip Hop</a></em> in &#8216;99, but this year it hit the big time.</p>
<p>Even <a href="http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/asap-rocky-2011-11/" target="_blank"><em>New York</em> fucking <em>Magazine</em></a> sees this, calling out ASAP, Clams Casino and eXquire as New York rappers pushing boundaries away from <em>&#8220;the insular mentality of the city&#8217;s rap revanchists&#8221;</em> like Joell Ortiz. (Oh snap! Joell! Son! They just called you a&#8230;revanchist?)  Even the goddamn <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2011/12/05/111205crmu_music_frerejones" target="_blank">New Yorker</a></em>&#8211;in an article about fucking Drake, no less&#8211;sees that <em>&#8220;hip hop&#8230;is in a period of transition in which formal constraints have dissolved almost entirely.  How do you even know whether something is hip hop?&#8221;</em> (No doubt, but I do know this: Drake isn&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>In an era where the music industry is dead, hip-hop has once again adapted to stay ahead of the curve and survive, creating a wider scene.  There&#8217;s a greater diversity, and more cross-hybridization and less statification&#8211;it&#8217;s not just Dirty South vs. East Coast, or backpackers vs. superstars.  Check out the rap nerdery of <a href="http://www.spin.com/articles/insanely-obsessive-infographic-tries-vain-diagram-hip-hop-galaxy" target="_blank">this chart in SPIN</a>.  A lotta cats were pissed off because they weren&#8217;t on it or their favorite MC wasn&#8217;t on it or whatever.  I think the problem is that it&#8217;s too small.  MORE BUBBLES, GODDAMN IT.  There&#8217;s no bubble for <a href="http://elmattic.podbean.com/2011/02/25/revolution/" target="_blank">all the hip hop what came out of the Arab Spring</a>&#8230;fear of a rap planet, holla.  (Side note: <a href="http://elmattic.podbean.com/2011/03/26/libyan-technique-ibn-thabit/" target="_blank">Ibn Thabit</a>, has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcOkDxjC1RI&amp;list=UUUKwxam1qLjn1izfvPef3WQ&amp;index=2&amp;feature=plcp" target="_blank">hung up his mic</a> now that Qaddafi&#8217;s gone.)  Where&#8217;s the mighty Midwestern cats?  The Overintelligent White MCs Who All Sound The Same?  The M.O.P.-for-Vendetta, Public Enemy Meets <em>Farewell My Concubine</em> sound of <a href="http://theblackopera.com/" target="_blank">The Black Opera</a>?</p>
<p>Nah, dun.  You finna make a bigger chart.</p>
<p>Past few years, everyone&#8217;s best-of lists felt lazy and boring to me.  This year, I ain&#8217;t seen one single list that didn&#8217;t have something on it I was feeling.  (And here&#8217;s a couple of lists with joints I mighta slept on and need to check out from <a href="http://scratchedvinyl.com/?q=node/683" target="_blank">Scratched Vinyl</a> and <a href="http://thedjjazzpants.blogspot.com/2011/12/best-hip-hop-albums-of-year.html" target="_blank">DJ Jazzpants</a>.)  A lot of critics/bloggers managed somehow to like Drake and <em><em>Watch Me Drone</em></em> AND <em><em>XXX</em></em> or not forget the Muthafuckin&#8217; (like the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/arts/music/music-of-heartache-mortality-and-success.html?_r=1" target="_blank">NY Times</a></em>).  How the fuck does that happen?  I mean, aside from the <em><em>Village Voice</em></em> maybe, I don&#8217;t remember anyone putting <em><em>Fear of a Black Planet</em></em> on the same best-of list as Bon Jovi.  A lot of cats I don&#8217;t really like got end-of-year love, like Action Bronson and ASAP Rocky and whatever the fuck (and <em>XXL</em> managed to do <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/tag/best-of-2011/ " target="_blank">a dozen lists</a> which were all clueless), but the biggest champs of weird-ass hip hop in 2011 were:</p>

<p><a style="font-weight: bold; " href="http://itsbruiserbrigade.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Danny Brown: The Tigger of Rap</a></p>
<p>Everybody loves this dude, no question.  He hands down snatched the crown.  And dukes is fucking weird.  The waterfall hair and jumble-of-chiclets teeth goes with his intense, nervous slanging.  He&#8217;s the Constant Consonant Eater.  Revanchist of the Gangster Duck Flow.  Brown takes the overboard getting-high-and-eating-pussy of Ol&#8217; Dirty but combines it with a paranoid sense of mortality, and gives us flashes that his crazed behaviour emerges from the ruins of Detroit, still waiting for Robocop&#8217;s redemption.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://soundcloud.com/blackmilksoundcloud/sets/black-and-brown" target="_blank">Black &amp; Brown</a></em> with Black Milk is my shit over <em><a href="http://www.foolsgoldrecs.com/xxx/" target="_blank">XXX</a>.  XXX</em> definitely picks up the last third, when it becomes painful and honest, and I&#8217;ll revisit the rest while waiting to see what he gets up to next.</p>
<p><a style="font-weight: bold; " href="http://mishkanyc.bandcamp.com/album/mr-muthafuckin-exquire-lost-in-translation" target="_blank">Mr. Muthafuckin&#8217; eXquire: Bringing Back The Stupid</a></p>
<p><a style="font-weight: bold; " href="http://mishkanyc.bandcamp.com/album/mr-muthafuckin-exquire-lost-in-translation" target="_blank"></a>eXo brought back the gleeful don&#8217;t-give-a-fuck: he&#8217;s broke, he&#8217;s flabby, he&#8217;s drunk.  It took balls to straight-up jack El-P and Necro&#8217;s beats&#8211;and then lace them with odes to late-night fried chicken spots and general miscreant R&amp;R.  But co-signs came fast and furious, and no doubt I had &#8220;Huzzah&#8221; on repeat for a month straight.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see what he builds off the back of <em><a href="http://" target="_blank">Lost In Translation</a></em>, but if <a href="http://soundcloud.com/exqomania/the-gold-watch" target="_blank">&#8220;Gold Watch&#8221;</a> is any clue, he might give Roc Marciano a run for his money.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://shabazzpalaces.com/" target="_blank">Shabazz Palaces: Wow, These Are Some Really Good Mushrooms</a></span></p>
<p>Shabazz Palaces went pretty much ignored for their first two (far superior) self-released EPs, pretty much by their own doing.  Once they hopped to Sub Pop they got a bump, and also because everyone wanted to know what Ishmael Butler (formerly known as Butterfly of Digable Planets and now calling himself Palaceer Pink Gators or some shit) has been up to for the past decade.  (Besides that godawful Cherrywine thing.)  Answer: studying up, thinking hard, and eating a lot of hallucinogens.  Possibly also Afrofuturist sweat lodges were involved.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.subpop.com/artists/shabazz_palaces" target="_blank"><em>Black Up</em> </a>is confounding, demanding and challenging.  It&#8217;s totally discordant yet addictively compelling&#8211;seeking, chasing, laying back in the swirl.  It creates its own world and trades in backpacks for paperbacks.  Like in <em>The Terminator,</em> it came across time to love you.  If the bar for a truly avant garde hip hop LP was set by <em>The Cold Vein,</em> a decade later <em>Black Up</em> raises the stakes.  Its amazing success will hopefully crack ears open for overlooked acts like Elucid, DJ Spooky and Dälek.</p>
<p>2011 felt like the end of <em>The Wire,</em> where the central characters were replaced with their younger figuras.  The new decade&#8211;and a new Atomic Age&#8211;has just begun.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ddayone.com/" target="_blank"></a>The jazz/hip-hop relationship hasn&#8217;t been nearly as fruitful or   long-established as you&#8217;d think it woulda; if funk and soul are  hip-hop&#8217;s parents,  jazz is kinda like an uncle who drifts into town now and  then, sleeps on the  couch, bums hip-hop&#8217;s cigarettes and tells stories about  the good old days.  Trouble is, we look at him like he&#8217;s a  played out rummy bum-ass, but back in the day uncs had skills, scared  people just as much as hip-hop does/did, and had seriously bad-ass  musical chops.</p>
<p>The much-maligned &#8216;jazz rap&#8217; thing never really  made it to a full-fledged genre, I don&#8217;t think&#8230;its original history  was really only a handful of songs: various scattered cuts by  Stetsasonic, Gangstarr, Tribe, De La and other Native Tongues cats.  As  far as albums, there&#8217;s only really Guru&#8217;s hugely uneven<em> Jazzmatazz</em> series, the first Digable  Planets LP (which actually isn&#8217;t as jazz-sample-heavy as we think), and that Buckshot LeFonque record with Premo and Marsalis, which nobody really listened to.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d say jazz sampling came about&#8211;innovated by Premier pretty much&#8211;from the desire to make more cooled-out, chilled tracks, delve into  jazz&#8217; rich musical crates, and get away from soul and in particular  James Brown sampling, which by the early &#8217;90s had pretty much jacked the entire catalogue.  Also, those fat basslines son!</p>
<p>Mighta been, as the homie <a href="http://mobbdeen.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Mobb Deen</a> pointed out, that the huge rise in sampling costs and lawsuits sprung  up at the same time as jazz-rap was making moves.  By &#8216;94 (the Silver Age),  jazz rap had been consigned to Brooklyn dinner party background music.  Jazz samples and  the odd jazz track definitely pop up as much as any other genre in  hip-hop&#8217;s paintbox&#8211;opera or <a href="http://elmattic.podbean.com/2011/02/10/how-the-bronx-was-won" target="_blank">spaghetti westerns</a>, say&#8211;but no artist really makes it their signature sound. From there, you got the odd Dolphy or Mingus remix LP tribute, and the eighty gazillion Japanese DJs instrumental jazz-hop LPs, driving in the lane DJ Krush made. (Like that Digables, we think Krush is all jazz-hop, but most of it isn&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Trouble is, jazz as a sample source, like any other, is a house with many mansions&#8230;I mean, that human tooth-whitening strip from <em>Entertainment Tonight</em> made a jazz album; on the other hand you got Eric Dolphy, whose stuff is so batshit I know a professional sax player who won&#8217;t fuck with it.  But there&#8217;s definitely a few things that can ruin jazz-hop: pathetic flutes, weak females on the hooks, ambient meditation whalesong noises, and weak as fuck beats.  Also, beatnik sunshine spoken word bullshit rapping.</p>
<p>Mostly the problem is their sampling studies don&#8217;t take on the really rough, hard-ass crazy be-bop shit of Mingus, Sonny Rollins, <em>Africa/Brass</em>-era  Coltrane, Ornette Coleman etc.  Jazz musicians themselves have either  bitterly resented and violently hated hip-hop or expressed a  pretty mild interest.  Even collabos that you&#8217;d think would be stupid  fresh, like the El-P/Matthew Shipp <em>High Water,</em> flunked the dope  test because of a weak jazz side; the Easy Mo Bee/dead Miles Davis LP was too&#8230;shiny.  Dday One, DJ Krush and Mumbles all have great jazz/rap cuts, but not whole LPs which are famous for being the definitive jazz/rap LP.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s no definitive jazz/rap LP because hip-hop&#8217;s never been about being definitive.  Is there a definitive hip-hop anything LP?  Hip hop&#8217;s more about being interpretive, allusive, and using whatever&#8217;s at hand.</p>
<p>Start curating good jazz/hop cuts though, you end up with enough for three or four mixtapes&#8230;so today we got the first of a new series.  (Which is good, because I&#8217;m all out of super chicken.)</p>
<p>Wait, what the&#8230;it&#8217;s International Jazz Rap Appreciation Month or some shit&#8211;check out <a href="http://musicalschizophrenia.blogspot.com/2011/11/find-mag-20-years-of-jazz-hop-2011.html" target="_blank">The Find Mag :: 20 Years of Jazz-Hop</a>.  Not one duplicate track neither, but yes, including the dreaded US3 I hoped to avoid mentioning.  (It&#8217;s some kind of video mix, and no, I won&#8217;t be doing one of those unless it&#8217;s <em>Totally Batshit Killing People, The VideoMix (feat. Crank, Crank 2 &amp; Natural Born Killers</em>).)

<p>I could be wrong in naming <a href="http://lroneous.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">L*Roneous</a> a Most Overlooked of All Time&#8230;maybe he&#8217;s huge in the Bay and I just don&#8217;t know about it.  I&#8217;ll tell you what though, I didn&#8217;t discover 1998&#8217;s <em>Imaginarium</em> until this year, and it is a certified classic.  Definitely a high water mark for late-&#8217;90s hip-hop, and I can&#8217;t believe I slept on this jaw-dropper draws-hopper.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t do the whole biography blahzay blahzay (he runs it down his own self <a href="http://lroneous.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/as-we-proceed/" target="_blank">here</a>), but let&#8217;s just say Da Versifier&#8217;s credits stretch back to 1990.  On the meaning of the name:</p>
<blockquote><p><span><em>I was reading some ancient Roman stuff and my nickname is L-Ron, “Eous” of course means the nature of something. My name means the nature of L-Ron. That’s what my music has been all about. I was always reading about cats like Maximus, my friends starting joking around saying I was L’Roneous, and I decided to keep that. </em>[<a href="http://ugsmag.com/2001/04/lroneous-da-versifier/" target="_blank">UGSmag interview 2001</a>]</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Now don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s on some Rammellzee tip, L*Ron isn&#8217;t one of those psycho/mystical rappers, he&#8217;s just a highly intelligent scholar type for real.  <em>Imaginarium</em> picks up maybe where Digable Planets left off, but dips into introspection, the re-invention of conscious/underground hip-hop of the late &#8217;90s, and what you might call a friendly raised fist a la Black Star.  <em>This is dedicated, to those who view hip-hop as a voyage&#8230; </em>begins the LP, and damn if he don&#8217;t take you on one.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p>I think what makes the LP so superlative is that it&#8217;s a cohesive whole&#8211;not a concept album, but all the songs add up to something larger; think <em>Blowout Comb</em> or <em>Fear of a Black Planet</em>&#8230;hell, any of your favorite LPs have the same aspect.  But <em>Imaginarium</em> has a definite progression, depth and scope.</p>
<p>Musically, it takes in the whole scope of Black music, from African, neo-African, jazz, funk, boom bap, uprock bass loops&#8230;you hear a bit of Last Poets in there, a bit of Premier, some De La&#8230;but then he&#8217;ll hit you with a track like &#8220;Oral Exercise&#8221; which sound like a Muggs or Onyx beat, and &#8220;Regimens&#8221; which could just as well be Mobb Deep.  Lyrically and vocally, he sounds a lot like Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, but it&#8217;s no contest he&#8217;s a better lyricist with a lot more to say.  In 1998 he was doing the fractured word mosaic thing that cats didn&#8217;t understand until <em>Cold Vein. </em><em>Look, peoples: you owe it to yourself to check this album out.</em></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t checked out this 2001 Dreamweavers project he did with Elusive, but I&#8217;m finna get on that.  Solo, L*Ron came back in 2004 with <em>Purposely Powerful,</em> working with a range of producers which made for a lesser album; it&#8217;s a collection of songs, rather than the opus of <em>Imaginarium</em>.  No doubt cuts like &#8220;Hop&#8221; and &#8220;From Under A Cloud&#8221; are ill standouts though.</p>
<p>Six years later, the free <em>Roller Coaster</em> EP went deep into the funk/soul sound of the &#8217;50s, &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s.  Cotdamn what a comeback.  Some of the strongest shit from start to finish I heard in &#8216;10, no doubt&#8211;it might feel a bit like a throwback, but it sure sounds fresh to me.  This year he dropped <em>Notes of the Righteous Outlaw</em> and some free tracks&#8211;it&#8217;s all pouring out after a long dry spell, and thank God for the rain to wash the trash off hip-hop&#8217;s sidewalk.  The LP&#8217;s standouts are &#8220;Full Metal,&#8221; &#8220;Sacks Piff Avenue&#8221; and &#8220;The Sound of Color&#8221;&#8230;I seriously fuck with those three cuts, and am digging the recent free joint, &#8220;Present Progressive.&#8221;  Man, it&#8217;s really hard to pick just one track to represent.</p>
<p>Yeah, just another rapper right?  Wrong kid.  You can peep out his audiobook Sketches of a Straight Line <a href="http://lroneous.bandcamp.com/album/sketches-of-a-straight-line-audio-book" target="_blank">here</a>.  Now that&#8217;s some heaviness.  That&#8217;s representing Oaktown to the fullest.  L*ron is having a late-career renaissance.  He&#8217;s gonna take this itty bitty world by storm.  And he&#8217;s just getting warm.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">About this photo (by Richard Drew), theologian Mark Thompson wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Perhaps the most powerful image of despair at the beginning of the twenty-first century is not found in art, or literature, or even popular music. It is found in a single photograph.</em></p>
</blockquote>

I don't think it's an image of despair.  But it is a more powerful image of 9/11 than any I have found in art, or literature, or music.  Like so many of the thousands of images, we simply can't comprehend it wholly.

<p>I don&#8217;t remember when I first came across DDay One&#8217;s stuff; I used to spend hours and hours scouring rap blogs for new shit and just hoover it all up.  See, I came up in the record store days with no pockets.  I&#8217;d agonize over which records I could afford to buy, and dream about being in an endless record store where they had everything and you could listen to anything.  Hey presto, papi: internet.</p>
<p>I got really into instrumental hip-hop a couple of years ago, and it seems like the &#8217;00s were definitely their peak period.  Problem has always been separating the great from the meh. Partially,  we got eighty gazillion Japanese DJs putting out   so many instrumental jazz-hop LPs you could have a whole website built   around nothing but.  Led by the late Nujabes and Fat Jon&#8211;to get   opinionamated now&#8211;this shit mostly sounds the same, goes for the   noodly-sounding bullshit, and when it does get a groove on ruins it with   pathetic flute loops or weak-ass female vocal hooks.  And the beats?    The beats are weak as fuck.  Some of it is good, no doubt, but it&#8217;s not   head-nodding.</p>
<p>Remember when illbient and trip-hop were actually a thing?  That made it easier, I guess, because the line&#8217;s really blurred between &#8216;electronic&#8217; and &#8216;instrumental hip-hop.&#8217;  If I&#8217;m on the fence, I listen closely to the beats.  Do they go dit-dit-dit-dit-dit?  Electronic, get the fuck outta here with that.  Do they go boom-bop-bop-boom-bop-bop-boom?  Hip-hop.</p>
<p><a></a>Anyhow, in 2005 came DDay One&#8217;s <em>Loop Extensions.</em> And in 2008, <em>Heavy Migration.</em></p>
<p>

</p>
<blockquote><p><em>DDay One was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. He has a double  major in hip-hop as a turntablist and samplist. He also has a minor in  graffiti art (as do most b-boys), noticeable by his signature. His  obsession with manipulating vinyl records started in the early 1990′s,  when at the age of 11 he began exploring the depths of Los Angeles&#8217;  thrift shops and record stores. </em></p>
<p><em>Without a sampler at the time,  his first compositions were made by engaging in sessions of &#8220;dropping  the needle&#8221; (placing the needle repeatedly in the same spot of a record  to emulate the repetition of a break in a song) and repeatedly looping  the desired sample segments on a tape deck. After using this method of  creating beats and amassing stacks of records from years of beat mining,  he furthered his manipulation of vinyl and love of music by utilizing  the sequencing capabilities of a sampler.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Whoally shit.  This is one of those records I didn&#8217;t know I&#8217;d been waiting for until I&#8217;d heard it.  Taking on the dusty analog sound of old jazz records, weaving together jazz&#8217; ability to move you and also mourn, DDay One doesn&#8217;t just move the soul but the body.  Because the beats?  The beats are hard as fuck.  The way he constructs his beats is really his greatest talent&#8211;the way he uses them as a real instrument, not just an underlying loop.</p>
<p>DDay lays down recognizable hip-hop loops, African layers, ambient noise&#8230;but I would say through it all runs an obvious primary influence of be-bop jazz, on which he&#8217;s both building and commenting.  There&#8217;s tracks like &#8216;Seeds of Revolution&#8217; which come from some mystery  196X, where rock &amp; roll never happened and jazz just kept growing  and the first MPC has just hit the scene.  It&#8217;s the fat basslines, ma.  It&#8217;s those warm, unprocessed pianos.  It&#8217;s the scratching.  This is chill <em>and </em>head-nod isht, in actual fact it moves more than it cools.</p>
<p>I like a good amount of instrumentalist stuff, it&#8217;s part of a complete breakfast, but not many artists have such a defined sound that can&#8217;t be mistaken for anyone else&#8211;let&#8217;s give them the French honorific of <em>instrumentaliste.</em> There&#8217;s a distinct warmth and depth to DDay One&#8217;s tracks which doesn&#8217;t just come from their whole origin in vinyl samples, but some other alchemy from the man&#8217;s fingertips as well.  They are whole and organic in a way that makes them feel more recorded in session than built of samples.</p>
<p>A lot of instrumentalists&#8211;and there are more these days than you can shake a bandcamp at&#8211;don&#8217;t get that a loop is not a song.  A song builds, fades, weaves, ducks, bobs; elements are played off each other, there are counterpoints and melodies.  DDay One knows this.</p>
<p>The &#8217;00s era of strong instrumentalists seems to have ended, and for me a handful have stayed relevant, had their sound stand up and stood out&#8211;I&#8217;d put DDay One in the crew with Mumbles, Villain Accelerate, Sixtoo, Odd Nosdam, PSY/OPSogist and maybe a handful more.  He keeps it fresh on his <a href="http://www.rhythm-incursions.com/category/podcast/dday-one-in-session-series/" target="_blank">Rhythm Incursion podcasts</a> as well.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.ddayone.com/update-loop-extensions-deluxe/" target="_blank">Loop Extensions Deluxe</a> </em>drops soon.  Peep it out, you cannot miss.</p>

So in Greek mythology, you had the Titans who ruled over the Golden Age.  Cronos was the king Titan, but because he heard this prophecy his kids would overthrow him, he&#8217;d eat them as soon as they were born.  This one time his wife gives him a rock instead and raises the kid in secret.  [...]]]></description>

<p style="text-align: left;">So in Greek mythology, you had the Titans who ruled over the Golden Age.  Cronos was the king Titan, but because he heard this prophecy his kids would overthrow him, he&#8217;d eat them as soon as they were born.  This one time his wife gives him a rock instead and raises the kid in secret.  When Zeus grows up he cuts his pop&#8217;s stomach open and frees his siblings, who all grew up in there with only that baby-Zeus-sized rock to play with.  (That must&#8217;ve pretty much sucked.)  They establish the Olympic pantheon of the Greeks, Romans and all those paintings and sculptures of swan rape and flying sandal wearing naked muhfuckas from your high school art history class.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Where was I going with this?  Uh&#8230;shit.  Oh, right: if we cast El-P as the Zeus of the millenial indie-rap pantheon, the best and most overlooked MC from there is <strong>C-Rayz Walz</strong>.  He&#8217;s like the Hephaestus of that click, the blacksmith god: he stays underground steady pounding iron and steel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Growing up in the Golden Age Titan&#8217;s stomach of the BX&#8211;you know what, I think that&#8217;s enough with the Greek shit now&#8211;Walz has steady dropped bombs on your moms for over a decade.  He never disappoints and always comes hard, with LPs chock full of lunchables and few deletables.  Even on guest shots he usually outshines his host and when he has guests of his own you just want them to pipe down so the man can spit.  When he goes mid-tempo he sorta sounds like Redman +100 I.Q. points but mostly his shit is unmistakeable and unfuckwittable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Walz&#8217; freestyle skills are legendary and his rhymes are packed tight with gems.  Peep this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Walking Cerberus with a Raising Hell t-shirt</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Crackheads get snatched up for stem cell research</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aside from knowing that Cerberus is the three-headed guard dog of the underworld in Greek mythology (see, I knew there was a reason I went with that), you need to know what a stem is&#8230;it&#8217;s on some cleverly complex shit, plus the ill rhyme scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Is Walz unknown enough to qualify as Most Overlooked of All Time?  He most definitely gets a lot less shine than he deserves, so yeah.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">His best LP by far is 2005&#8217;s <em><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/year-of-the-beast/id65904859" target="_blank"><strong>Year of the Beast</strong></a>,</em> which got a nice free <a href="http://hulkshare.com/z6w5tb3wuglt" target="_blank">remix treatment by the Beatnikz</a> earlier this year.  The new free LP with Dub MD, <em><a href="http://dubmd.bandcamp.com/album/all-blvck-everything-the-prelude" target="_blank">All Blvck Everything</a></em>, officiakally knocks&#8230;<em>&#8220;an amuse-gruel for the main course </em>All Blvck Everything <em>LP&#8221;</em> which is supposed to drop in the fall.  Amuse gruel?  Is that some kinda Greek thing?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Get yourself those and you&#8217;ll be straight.  Below is &#8220;All Blvck Everything,&#8221; produced by Labrinth.  Which is where the Minotaur used to hang.</p>

		<itunes:summary>So in Greek mythology, you had the Titans who ruled over the Golden Age.  Cronos was the king Titan, but because he heard this prophecy his kids would overthrow him, he'd eat them as soon as they were born.  This one time his wife gives him a rock instead and raises the kid in secret.  When Zeus grows up he cuts his pop's stomach open and frees his siblings, who all grew up in there with only that baby-Zeus-sized rock to play with.  (That must've pretty much sucked.)  They establish the Olympic pantheon of the Greeks, Romans and all those paintings and sculptures of swan rape and flying sandal wearing naked muhfuckas from your high school art history class.

<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve been meaning to do a series on M.O.A.T.s-the most overlooked LPs and artists of all time.  Not talking about ‘oh Black Moon is so underrated&#8217; or ‘oh Biz Markie is actually a very accomplished lyricist by Keatsian standards&#8217; but cats who are incredibly talented and so under the radar they&#8217;re like those cyborg housefly Predator drones the C.I.A. wants to fly up Ahmadinejad&#8217;s nose.  At the top of the M.O.A.T. list was Autolect: the greatest MC/producer you never heard of.</p>
<p>So I felt mighty blessed when Autolect himself reached out to me.  I&#8217;m amped to be the DJ Whoo Kid of the underground, but for reals there aren&#8217;t many others I&#8217;d be this lucky to hook a mix up for.  For one thing, not many have a catalog this deep-everytime people get wood over a new Jay Constipatica song I&#8217;m all baffled, because Autolect&#8217;s been doing that since 2004 and has about literally 15 times as much material.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been feeling Autolect&#8217;s stuff for about three years, and between <a href="http://urbansufimusic.bandcamp.com/album/every-mans-universe" target="_blank"><em>Every Mans Universe</em></a> and <a href="http://urbansufimusic.bandcamp.com/album/between-god-and-the-deep-blue" target="_blank"><em>Between God And The Deep Blue</em></a> I was no doubt finna collect every last track.  This meant some Mickey Spillane isht to hunt him down under his different monikers-AHMM (Autolect &amp; His Meltdown Movement), BSML77, Hasan and even that one record where he called himself Velox Nur (after his favorite housepaint and/or alien reptilian overlord).</p>
<p>The namechanges are a reason why you maybe haven&#8217;t caught on to his genius yet.  But in the mains it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s a true iconoclast.  I don&#8217;t do the whole bio-blazhay-he&#8217;s-from-he&#8217;s-influenced-by-blahzay; it don&#8217;t really tell you nothing about the work, and the work speaks for itself.  You want a logline?  OK, imagine Butterfly or Jay Elecetcetera over <em>Marcberg</em> beats.  If you like DDay One, Shabazz Palaces, Saul Williams (pre-rock star), Flying Lotus or RZA&#8217;s <em>Ghost Dog</em> score, you are feeling Autolect.</p>
<p>The flow.  Autolect doesn&#8217;t really rap.  He&#8217;s not singing, he&#8217;s not talking.  I don&#8217;t know what to call it.  You just gotta listen.  It&#8217;s serious business.  It has some Digable Planets flavor with a dash of Mos Def.  It&#8217;s spiritual in the real sense, not the patchouli-smelling PM Dawn sense.  It&#8217;s intelligent and conscious without being didactic or preaching.</p>
<p>The production.  Dusty.  Intricate loops and samples.  It shimmers, not on some fairydust isht but like rain on concrete.  Like neon through a tumbler of scotch on the rocks.  Hard jazz, deep funk sounds, but taken so far and so deep from the source as to be absorbed and transformed.  From some alternate reality where Dolphy and Mingus invented the MPC and jazz never ended, kept on going.  Or some time traveler went back with a sampler and crafted some parachronistic Dendera light grooves, <em>Bebop On The Edge of Forever.</em></p>
<p>So Autolect is being retired, as the man moves on to a new era of music under Bil Basmala.  As per usual, he&#8217;s got a huge slew of material lined up which is bound to be dope.</p>
<p><em>Autology</em> both celebrates and closes the books on the Autolect era.  What you got here is 13 of his greatest tracks with some interview snippets which give you a little taste of his larger thought.</p>
<p>Soon enough we&#8217;re gonna drop a Volume Two to give a full flavor of his instrumental productions, but for now, sit back and marinate in this.  Then pick your jaw up off the floor and hit his Bandcamp.  Welcome to Autolect.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thisiselmattic" target="_blank">joined the Twitter</a> this month for some reason.  It&#8217;s got some good peeps on it but <a href="http://elmattic.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> has more breasteses.</p>
<p>The thing is about the Twooter is that you get more insight into rappers&#8217; lives than you might want.  I mean, these guys are like superheroes or demigods, I don&#8217;t really care what they think about the new X-Men movie.  And sometimes they drop straight crazy shit.  Shit that seriously fucks with my mentals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="ratweet.png" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/umwmuz/ratweet.png" border="0" alt="ratweet.png" height="150" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Uh&#8230;you&#8217;re the guy who had that one skit on that album <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flv-YhmL6x4" target="_blank">where you made your girl pistolwhip you while you jerked off</a>, right?  But you also have a deep appreciation for Woody Allen&#8217;s late-period oeuvre?  OK then.  Just checking.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="paztweet.png" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/cg4vih/paztweet.png" border="0" alt="paztweet.png" height="150" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yeah, that line on &#8216;On The Eve Of War&#8217; when you said &#8216;THOSE WHO DARE OPPOSE US WILL STAND KNEE DEEP IN THE BLOOD OF THEIR CHILDREN&#8217;?  I was all: that&#8217;s totally a Hall &amp; Oates reference.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Serious Paz?  Phil <em>Collins?</em> My wife listens to that Van fucking Morrison shit.  I look at her iPod and start weeping.  But even she don&#8217;t fuck with Hall &amp; Oates.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="blueprinttweet.png" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/tyssxi/blueprinttweet.png" border="0" alt="blueprinttweet.png" height="75" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Blueprint&#8211;triple threat: he can MC.  He can produce.  He offers sound auto maintenance advice.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I seem to be following the wrong Joell Ortiz, since this one is obviously a database manager from Scranton.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Following Flavor Flav is pretty much what you&#8217;d expect.  He, uh, wrote a book apparently.  Or allegedly wrote.  Or this book supposedly exists.  But anyway his Twooter I can deal with, it&#8217;s endless tweets of YEAH BOYEEE!!! and the above gnomic koans.  It&#8217;s having him pop up on Facebook&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="flavfb.png" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/62jup7/flavfb.png" border="0" alt="flavfb.png" height="100" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8230;saying shit like this, in between pictures of people&#8217;s babies, that fucks with my mentals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the other hand though, I didn&#8217;t know that on the Twooter you get steady drops of the fat comedy gold chain that is Kid Mero of <a href="http://victory-light.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Victory Light</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="merotweet.png" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/a5rm9/merotweet.png" border="0" alt="merotweet.png" height="150" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that I wouldn&#8217;t wanna miss on the regular.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For reals though, to be a musician right now you gotta grind this shit 24/7.  You gotta &#8216;connect with your fans on multiple platforms.&#8217;  Just seems like a drag&#8230;why not be in the studio instead?  Because you can&#8217;t.  Everybody&#8217;s competing for your attention.  Pampers.  Wendy&#8217;s.  Al-Qaeda.  Groupon.  Starbucks.  Sarah Palin.  That girl you went to high school with on Facebook.  The Revolutionary Council of Libya had a website before they had a council.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Everybody wants to be a trending topic.  Everybody wants to go viral.  I mean, why the fuck are <em>The New Yorker</em> and NPR covering hip hop all the time now?  To broaden their base and up the eyeballs.  Why do so many hip-hop blogs update 400 times a day with the same shit?  Gotta get those page views.  Shit is competitive as a motherfucker out there.</p>
<p>Not to get all Malcolm Gladwell on your asses, but it&#8217;s like we live in an information tornado.  You could call it an INFORMADO.  THAT&#8217;S RIGHT BITCHES: INFORMADO.  Shit rolls in outta nowhere, consumes everything in this huge fucking maelstrom, and then disappears.  What happens when you&#8217;re the informado and it dissipates?   You be sitting in your wrecked-up double-wide crying and shit.  Like Odd Future gonna be doing this time next year.</p>
<p>Me, personally?  I gotta tone down all the chatter and stick to business, cause too much of it fucks with my damn mentals.</p>

<p>Used to be rappers didn&#8217;t cover each other&#8217;s songs.  That was biting.  (Even if the &#8216;original&#8217; hip-hop song, &#8220;Rapper&#8217;s Delight,&#8221; was entirely bit lyrics.)  Fresh was the word.  DJs soaked the labels off their LPs so other DJ&#8217;s wouldn&#8217;t know what song it was.</p>
<p>Times moved.  MCs started out learning lyrics of whoever was at the top of their game.  Then you spit over another MC&#8217;s beats until you could get your own.  That was your apprenticeship, word to Johnny Tremain.  But hip-hop cover versions didn&#8217;t really start until the mid-&#8217;00s, because a cover is an homage, history for a previously ahistorical and new format&#8211;one which was always referential but not reverential, except for its dead.  And the &#8217;00s was about that hip-hop nostalgia.  Hip-hop had no elders when it started out, just succession from one Crown Prince to another; until the &#8217;90s there weren&#8217;t even long-term careers, you just fizzled away and went back to the car wash or accountancy school.</p>
<p>A cover version is usually a transformative homage&#8211;when Hendrix does Dylan or Sid Vicious does Sinatra, it&#8217;s a totally different song, <a href="http://elmattic.podbean.com/2010/08/10/close-cover-before-striking/" target="_blank">like those cover versions by white people in their indigenous styles I forced on you last time</a>.  Because hip-hop&#8217;s based on beats not bands, it&#8217;s hard to transform a cover, that&#8217;s why the remix is more paramount.  Even so, constant innovation causes expansion.  You don&#8217;t see 2 Live Crew tribute bands at your local bar off the interstate.</p>
<p>So now we got this Elzhi and his mixtape called, erm, <em><a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/05/download-elzhis-elmatic-now/" target="_blank">Elmatic</a>.</em> This is the second take on Nas&#8217; Illmatic after Fashawn&#8217;s poorly received and all-around ass version, <em>Ode To Illmatic</em>.  Some cats think it&#8217;s <a href="http://bloggerhouse.net/2011/05/11/review-elzhi-with-will-sessions-elmatic/" target="_blank">an instant classic</a>.  Others are <a href="http://cantstopfanatics.blogspot.com/2011/05/no-comment.html" target="_blank">not so sure about that, B</a>.  I agree most with <a href="http://passionweiss.com/2011/05/10/elzhi-elmatic/" target="_blank">Weiss&#8217; succinct account</a>.</p>
<p><em>Elmatic</em> has got nice live versions of the beats by Will Sessions, but they&#8217;re not as interesting a take as the El Michels Affair Wu-Tang covers.  Elzhi hews pretty close to Nas&#8217; cadences and a lot of the lines themselves, so it&#8217;s much more of a cover than a new take or transformation.  The whole enchilada tastes nice no doubt, but it&#8217;s got tofu not beef and salsa not Tabasco.  I like it, I just don&#8217;t really see the point of it.  I liked <em>Joell Ortiz Covers The Classics</em> and Malcolm &#038; Martin&#8217;s <em>Criminal Minded</em>, both of which took pains to flip the scripts but also underlined the fire of the classics.  What the fuck, is hip-hop having an anxiety of influence moment, word to Harold Bloom?</p>
<p><em>Illmatic</em> was a hood life panorama painted on a canvas of dusty, funky grooves.  A worthy update of that dropped last year&#8211;<em>Marcberg</em>.  As for a heartfelt audiobiography in rhyme which is a watermark for the future, well, that dropped the same day as <em>Elmatic</em>&#8211;it&#8217;s called <em>Goblin</em> (which admittedly has a lot, lot more in common with <em>The Slim Shady LP</em> than <em>Illmatic</em>.)  So yeah, Elzhi put in work here but I just don&#8217;t get it.  What was he trying to do?  It&#8217;s not updating Illmatic or particularly transforming it artistically.  It&#8217;s a nice little mixtape but I&#8217;m not sure I wanna see more of these.  What&#8217;s next, <em>It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Jay Electronica?  Enter The 36 Sean Priceses?  As Ras Kass As We Wanna Be?  Licensed To Redman?  Paid In Curren$y?  Step In The Marciano? </em></p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s hip-hop covers hip-hop.  Represent, represent.</p>

Times moved.  MCs started out learning lyrics of whoever was at the top of their game.  Then you spit over another MC's beats until you could get your own.  That was your apprenticeship, word to Johnny Tremain.  But hip-hop cover versions didn't really start until the mid-'00s, because a cover is an homage, history for a previously ahistorical and new format--one which was always referential but not reverential, except for its dead.  And the '00s was about that hip-hop nostalgia.  Hip-hop had no elders when it started out, just succession from one Crown Prince to another; until the '90s there weren't even long-term careers, you just fizzled away and went back to the car wash or accountancy school.

So now we got this Elzhi and his mixtape called, erm, Elmatic. This is the second take on Nas' Illmatic after Fashawn's poorly received and all-around ass version, Ode To Illmatic.  Some cats think it's an instant classic.  Others are not so sure about that, B.  I agree most with Weiss' succinct account.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Man, this month&#8217;s hip-hop internet has been on some hit-chasing gossipy bullshit.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>In a couple of paragraphs out of a 432-page memoir, Ashley Judd says hip-hop is misogynist, provoking hand-wringing and debate, because no one has ever said this before, and because Ashley Judd is a towering figure in the hip-hop community.</li>
<li>Jay-Z, or at least an S. Carter software emulator, interviews Gwyneth Paltrow, who claims she knows all the words to <em>Straight Outta Compton</em> and reveres Eazy-E.  Cover version please.</li>
<li>As funny as the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBa5qp9sUOY&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">&#8216;Fight For Your Right Revisited&#8217; trailer</a> is, I&#8217;m disappointed the Beastie Boys didn&#8217;t go the whole <em>I&#8217;m Not There</em> route and cast Cate Blanchett, a traffic cone, Mr. Sulu, Hulk Hogan, a caterpillar, Harry Dean Stanton, Tilda Swinton and Gilbert Gottfried as themselves.  Also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evA-R9OS-Vo&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">the whole thing</a> kinda drags on and on.  Nobody cares the ridiculous number of famous people you know, just be funny.  I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s the &#8216;international version,&#8217; so maybe it&#8217;s all Herzog&#8217;d up or something.  &#8216;They all start peeing on each other, then they get beat up by cops&#8217;&#8230;that seems kinda European to me.</li>
<li>Legendary DJ Mister Cee is busted for public lewdness in a ladyboy stylee, and mega-shit-talker/walking meme Lil B announces his new LP will be titled &#8216;I&#8217;m Gay,&#8217; provoking hand-wringing and debate about homophobia in hip-hop, which no one has ever talked about before.</li>
<li>25 gazillion more words [note: estimate] are written about Odd Future, of which 50% have nothing to do with the music, 25% complain about the 50% which don&#8217;t talk about the music, and 25% are about Complex&#8217;s very morally and legally dubious tracking down of Earl Sweatshirt.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-04-06/music/can-sadat-x-make-wine-hip-hop/" target="_blank">Sadat X </a>has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thetelathon" target="_blank">wine-tasting show</a>.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/nyregion/27cooking.html?_r=2" target="_blank">Tony Touch and Crazylegs</a> have a <a href="http://www.crazylegsworkshop.com/" target="_blank">cooking show</a>.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a></a>Look, peoples: if Mister Cee likes to unwind by sitting in his car and nutting in a transvestite&#8217;s mouth, and Earl Sweatshirt&#8217;s mom wants to send him to a Samoan bootcamp to be beaten with wet towels instead of enjoying OF&#8217;s supersonic rocket to fame, <em>that&#8217;s their inalienable fucking rights as Americans, goddamnit. </em>Jesus H.

<p style="text-align: left;">Ahhh, a new Tenshun record&#8230;it&#8217;s like slipping into a hot bath.  Of lava.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tenshun doesn&#8217;t fuck with Bandcamp or iTunes.  By the looks of the CDr package he sent me for eight bucks, he doesn&#8217;t fuck with laser printers either.  It looks like this (like <a href="http://tenshun.webs.com/" target="_blank">all his releases</a>) limited edition of 50 is <a href="http://www.accesshiphop.com/store/?itemid=20637" target="_blank">sold out</a>, but I&#8217;ll respect the man&#8217;s strange exclusive vision and not put up any joints.  You can listen to track #12 <a href="http://soundcloud.com/10shun-tenshun/bubonic-plague12" target="_blank">here</a>.  Wait, why am I telling you about a record you can&#8217;t get?  Uh&#8230;wait a month or so and you can probably download it off some Russian forum if you dig hard enough.  Not like I would condone that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I already <a href="http://elmattic.podbean.com/2010/03/07/the-overlook-hotel-mixtape-edition/" target="_blank">talked about this cat before</a>, so let&#8217;s just say the new LP is as strong as 2007&#8217;s <em>Nihilism.</em> The Hollywood pitch would be <em>&#8216;Gaslamp Killer and El-P get dengue fever, are trapped in an abandoned switchblade factory, and collabo on the soundtrack to a Serbian torture porn movie.&#8217;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.uncommonrecords.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Short Fuze &amp; Nasa :: <em>Toxicology Music</em></strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is pretty much a post-record label age, but there&#8217;s still some I keep my eyes on&#8211;Backwoodz, Nature Sounds, Galapagos4, Babygrande, and Rhymesayers releases are usually worth a check.  Uncommon Records has definitely been blowing up the spot with some good shit lately, and this is their latest, a remix set of the <em>Lobotomy Music</em> LP.  Most of the time a remix version isn&#8217;t as good as the original, but this is one of the times it&#8217;s as good/better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a></a>Short Fuze and the W.A.S.T.E.L.A.N.D.S. crew (no, I don&#8217;t know what it stands for, but I&#8217;ll guess: Walking Above Shit Times, Eating Long Andouille, Never Dumb Shit?  I bet it&#8217;s something like that.) haven&#8217;t really hit my radar before, but I gotta say Fuze brings heat on the mic here.  He posts his lyrics on <a href="http://shortfuze.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">this Tumblr</a> which is pretty cool; I wish more MCs would do that, especially those who haven&#8217;t made <a href="http://www.ohhla.com" target="_blank">OHHLA</a> yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nasa&#8217;s beats on the first 5 tracks are really hitting, sharp and punchy like&#8230;well, I guess like that long andouille sausage again, but also some solid, banging evil beats for evil streets.  Willie Green, Megabusive and Lou Cypher handle production on the last three, which I wasn&#8217;t as impressed with, but check this and <a href="http://uncommonrecords.bandcamp.com/album/lobotomy-music" target="_blank"><em>Lobotomy Music</em></a> too.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Instrumental hip hop&#8217;s come a long way from the 12&#8243; dub B-side of &#8220;What Is A DJ (If He Can&#8217;t Scratch)?&#8221;  (Though come to think of it, Davey DMX&#8217;s <em>F-F-F-Fresh</em> still stands up, and was way ahead of its time&#8230;except for the title.)  The latter half of the &#8217;90s took the grimy, rumbling darkness of RZA and Mobb Deep&#8217;s production into trip-hop and illbient, culminating in DJ Spooky&#8217;s and the Anticon crew&#8217;s best efforts.  Post-millenium, El-P shaped the Def Jux sound into solid hip hop beats overlayed with similar brooding crunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since then, Spooky&#8217;s gotten more chin-stroky, Anticon&#8217;s become some kinda indie-rock label, Def Jux has folded in all but name, and others like Blue Sky Black Death have drifted more towards pop or simply run out of good ideas (Prefuse73, I&#8217;m raising my eyebrows at you.)  And DJ Krush went&#8230;where?  Into the sunset with his turntables and a baby strapped to his back like Lone Wolf &amp; Cub or something.  There&#8217;s only been the guerilla underground of Tenshun, Orko and Third Sight out there to keep things going.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Producer A.M. Breakups, née half of 11:00AM with MC Eleven, brings back that staticky, blat/zap/blip crunchtime of Odd Nosdam, The Books, Cars &amp; Trains, D-Styles and all that weird shit I like which hovers between noise and melody, without ever losing a hip-hop base of solid drums, scratching and samples.  <em>The Cant Resurrection </em>is a solid LP bringing A.M.&#8217;s beats on their own and with MCs like Billy Woods, Eleven, V8, Shortrock, Despot and Teddy Faley (yeah, I know&#8211;who?  But he&#8217;s good).  He&#8217;s hooked in with Backwoods Studios, Uncommon Records and has done some ill remixes for Super Chron Flight Brothers, Karniege, Mr. Len, and other cats.  Strong pedigree, we&#8217;ll overlook the vintage pimp coat, Polaroids and chin fuzz.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second half of the 20 tracks are definitely stronger, but &#8216;Amphetamine&#8217; with its wheezing accordion sound, &#8216;Forms&#8217; swirled keys and &#8216;When Yr Eyes Closed&#8217; whirlpool of fuzz all hit well.  The free EP <em>Clink Pieces (A Prelude to The Cant Resurrection)</em> is just as solid; both records end with a rising uplift (&#8217;Substance D&#8217; remix with Despot and &#8216;King of the Hill (Version)&#8217; with Adam Warlock &amp; Shortrock of The Presence, respectively), a crack of dawn after a record&#8217;s worth of the dawn of crack.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look peoples, you heard it on the podcast, you seen it on the computer screen: I don&#8217;t like dubstep or electronica or ambient or trillbient or witchsteptronica&#8211;I like beats, maybe beats that are out there, but beats for reals.  Give the boy a whirl.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Short Fuze &#x38; Nasa :: Toxicology Music
This is pretty much a post-record label age, but there's still some I keep my eyes on--Backwoodz, Nature Sounds, Galapagos4, Babygrande, and Rhymesayers releases are usually worth a check.  Uncommon Records has definitely been blowing up the spot with some good shit lately, and this is their latest, a remix set of the Lobotomy Music LP.  Most of the time a remix version isn't as good as the original, but this is one of the times it's as good/better.
Short Fuze and the W.A.S.T.E.L.A.N.D.S. crew (no, I don't know what it stands for, but I'll guess: Walking Above Shit Times, Eating Long Andouille, Never Dumb Shit?  I bet it's something like that.) haven't really hit my radar before, but I gotta say Fuze brings heat on the mic here.  He posts his lyrics on this Tumblr which is pretty cool; I wish more MCs would do that, especially those who haven't made OHHLA yet.
Nasa's beats on the first 5 tracks are really hitting, sharp and punchy like...well, I guess like that long andouille sausage again, but also some solid, banging evil beats for evil streets.  Willie Green, Megabusive and Lou Cypher handle production on the last three, which I wasn't as impressed with, but check this and Lobotomy Music too.


Check out "Master Peace (Nasa Remix)" here.




A.M. Breakups :: The Cant Resurrection / Clink Pieces EP
Instrumental hip hop's come a long way from the 12" dub B-side of "What Is A DJ (If He Can't Scratch)?"  (Though come to think of it, Davey DMX's F-F-F-Fresh still stands up, and was way ahead of its time...except for the title.)  The latter half of the '90s took the grimy, rumbling darkness of RZA and Mobb Deep's production into trip-hop and illbient, culminating in DJ Spooky's and the Anticon crew's best efforts.  Post-millenium, El-P shaped the Def Jux sound into solid hip hop beats overlayed with similar brooding crunch.

Producer A.M. Breakups, née half of 11:00AM with MC Eleven, brings back that staticky, blat/zap/blip crunchtime of Odd Nosdam, The Books, Cars &#x38; Trains, D-Styles and all that weird shit I like which hovers between noise and melody, without ever losing a hip-hop base of solid drums, scratching and samples.  The Cant Resurrection is a solid LP bringing A.M.'s beats on their own and with MCs like Billy Woods, Eleven, V8, Shortrock, Despot and Teddy Faley (yeah, I know--who?  But he's good).  He's hooked in with Backwoods Studios, Uncommon Records and has done some ill remixes for Super Chron Flight Brothers, Karniege, Mr. Len, and other cats.  Strong pedigree, we'll overlook the vintage pimp coat, Polaroids and chin fuzz.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="ibn_thabit_logo.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/z79a2m/ibn_thabit_logo.jpg" border="0" alt="ibn_thabit_logo.jpg" width="350" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What we&#8217;re seeing across North Africa and the Middle East is a youth revolution, driven by disenfranchisement and a lack of opportunities.  Hip hop has always been the original soundtrack for that.  It started in the city Ford told to drop dead, and since &#8220;The Message&#8221; it&#8217;s been the theme music for angry young people whose rage is against poverty, ghettos and repression&#8211;political, racial and economic.  Public Enemy made politics and fist-up rebellion their sound, and the torch&#8217;s been carried by a handful since then.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hip hop&#8217;s been international for years, go get a late pass.  I remember reading about Polish MCs in crumbling Soviet-era projects saying they couldn&#8217;t understand the words of hip-hop, but the beats and the message still spoke to them.  There are ghettos all over the world, and hip hop is there.  OK, sure, it gets watered down here and over there as party music, gangsta posturing and fake rebellion in fitteds and sagging shorts, but on the real it&#8217;s what Chuck D (in his Hannah Arendt moment) called &#8216;the CNN of the ghetto,&#8217; now more than ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a></a>In the long hot Arab rebellion, more and more of what reaches us isn&#8217;t coming from CNN but from cellphone video and social media.  (Why you think Qaddafi&#8217;s troops have been confiscating SIM cards from those hitting the borders?)  Just as hip hop made itself from available technology and instruments&#8211;the turntable and the mic, in the absence of guitar lessons and studio time&#8211;these kids are using the internet as their mixtapes-from-the-trunk distribution system.  Free, instant and worldwide&#8211;it takes a nation&#8217;s kill switches to hold them back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And this also allows them to provide instant responses to events which are unfolding on the daily; as soon as they cut the track they can pump it out there.  This gives them greater urgency and timeliness than we&#8217;ve ever seen before&#8211;the fourteen months between the first Iraq invasion and P.E.&#8217;s <em>Apocalypse &#8216;91</em> didn&#8217;t make the LP any less hard-hitting, but it&#8217;s not how we roll two decades later.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of all the Arab uprisings, Libya&#8217;s been the most bloody, where the people&#8217;s peaceful protests have had to turn into an armed rebellion. (As of today anyways&#8230;who knows what Syria, Yemen or Bahrain will look like a month from now&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So now would be a good time to hip you to Ibn Thabit, Libya&#8217;s own Immortal Technique.  Not to make a lazy comparison; Thabit&#8217;s flow, spitting and even a borrowed beat or two (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccIf95VyboQ" target="_blank">&#8220;Tripoli Calling&#8221;</a>) and his own acknowledged influence join the parallels.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Technique&#8217;s pretty much the only and best political rapper we&#8217;ve got right now, and he was also the first to give it a more international view.  P.E., Paris, The Coup and dead prez were more concerned with Amerikkkan idols, but Tech always took a broader view, so it&#8217;s only right Ibn Thabit should use him as a model.  The more international hip-hop gets, the more it functions as Chuck D&#8217;s CNN of the ghetto&#8211;what he meant was it was ghetto kids giving reports to each other on what was going on in their hoods.  And the more international joints we hear, the more the gangsta fakery and Twitter beefs of Rawse and Gucci look empty and stupid.  Remember that K&#8217;Naan song, &#8216;What&#8217;s Hardcore?&#8217;  <em>If I rhymed about home [Somalia] and got descriptive, I&#8217;d make Fifty Cent look like Limp Biskit.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">

</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now lemme get this straight for y&#8217;all: I&#8217;m putting Thabit up here because his shit is fire, not for novelty value.  His beats are tight and he spits like a beast.  Of course, I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s saying, but I&#8217;ll put twenty he&#8217;s not extolling the syrup selection at the Misrata IHOP.  (&#8217;Call To The Libyan Youth&#8217; lyrics, and two other songs, are <a href="http://sunduqedunia.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/ibn-thabit-call-to-the-libyan-youth/" target="_blank">here</a>.)  In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Ibn Thabit has been attacking Gaddafi with his music since 2008. He has  never been a member of any organized political group; he is just an  ordinary Libyan speaking the thoughts of many Libyan youth. Of course he  has had to remain anonymous to protect himself and his family in Libya,  and prefers not to give very many personal details.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">In case you thought this all jumped off on Feb 17th, Thabit cut a song called &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJMRHwYeiQ0" target="_blank">Benghazi</a>&#8216; in 2009 and &#8216;<a href="http://ibnthabit.net/site/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=6" target="_blank">Momar The Coward</a>&#8216; in 2008.  He&#8217;s from Tahruna, and his whole family&#8217;s in Tripoli at the moment&#8211;imagine what this cat&#8217;s going through right now, but he&#8217;s still knocking out songs.</p>

Technique's pretty much the only and best political rapper we've got right now, and he was also the first to give it a more international view.  P.E., Paris, The Coup and dead prez were more concerned with Amerikkkan idols, but Tech always took a broader view, so it's only right Ibn Thabit should use him as a model.  The more international hip-hop gets, the more it functions as Chuck D's CNN of the ghetto--what he meant was it was ghetto kids giving reports to each other on what was going on in their hoods.  And the more international joints we hear, the more the gangsta fakery and Twitter beefs of Rawse and Gucci look empty and stupid.  Remember that K'Naan song, 'What's Hardcore?'  If I rhymed about home [Somalia] and got descriptive, I'd make Fifty Cent look like Limp Biskit.

Now lemme get this straight for y'all: I'm putting Thabit up here because his shit is fire, not for novelty value.  His beats are tight and he spits like a beast.  Of course, I don't know what he's saying, but I'll put twenty he's not extolling the syrup selection at the Misrata IHOP.  ('Call To The Libyan Youth' lyrics, and two other songs, are here.)  In his own words:


Ibn Thabit has been attacking Gaddafi with his music since 2008. He has  never been a member of any organized political group; he is just an  ordinary Libyan speaking the thoughts of many Libyan youth. Of course he  has had to remain anonymous to protect himself and his family in Libya,  and prefers</itunes:summary>

Al&#8217;Tarba :: Lullabies for Insomniacs
I kinda stopped paying attention to instrumentals last year, but French beatmaker Al&#8217;Tarba has brought a pretty solid LP here.  Bringing in some guest MCs Q-Unique, Qualm and a few other cats I never heard of, the sound here is reminiscent of Kid Koala, Guts, Chinese Man, and DJ Cam and [...]]]></description>

<p>I kinda stopped paying attention to instrumentals last year, but French beatmaker Al&#8217;Tarba has brought a pretty solid LP here.  Bringing in some guest MCs Q-Unique, Qualm and a few other cats I never heard of, the sound here is reminiscent of Kid Koala, Guts, Chinese Man, and DJ Cam and Blue Sky Black Death (before both disappeared up their own assholes of Enya-sounding suck)&#8211;some swing-influenced, uptempo beats; some Krush/Muggs type of eerie shit&#8230;good stuff.  Give it a whirl.<a></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="ensilencestrangefruit.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/uag5f/ensilencestrangefruit.jpg" border="0" alt="ensilencestrangefruit.jpg" width="325" /></p>
<p><a href="http://ensilence.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ensilence :: <em>Strange Fruit</em> EP</strong></a></p>
<p>Ensilence is a great young MC from the PA area, with the kind of raspy voice and smooth flow of Jean Grae, Ladybug Mecca from Digable Planets, and all the way back to MC Lyte.  She&#8217;s gone from strength to strength on her EPs of the last couple of years, and the new joint brings her spitting over some great beats.  All six tracks are definitely quality over quantity, and be sure to peep out her earlier work up on the Bandcamp too.  A standout track, &#8216;Sweet Confession,&#8217; is up in here, but you gotta hear it all to get her range.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="teaseaokbollywood.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/pn45me/teaseaokbollywood.jpg" border="0" alt="teaseaokbollywood.jpg" width="325" /></p>
<p><a href="http://teasearecords.net/" target="_blank"><strong>Tom Caruana :: <em>Okay Player - The Bollywood Remake / The Rough Versions Remix Series</em></strong></a></p>
<p>This cat caught a lot of love last year over his <em>Wu-Tang Vs. The Beatles</em> remix, but I thought his previous DOOM remixes were better.  Whatever, because now he&#8217;s dumped 7 entire LPs worth of remixes out there.  <em>The Rough Versions</em> includes the DOOM joints, J-Live, Large Pro, D.I.T.C., and Brand Nubian (which I thought was dope as hell).  Nothing too fancy, just straight-up nice new beats.</p>
<p><em>Okay Player</em> is 2 LPs, <em>The Bollywood Remake</em> and <em>Deleted Scenes,</em> scrambling Bollywood beats with Talib, Mos Def, Badu, Jean Grae, Quasi, Black Thought, Q-Tip, Common, Gift of Gab&#8230;sheesh.  I got tired of the whole Bollywood remix thing around the time Madlib dropped <em>Here&#8217;s Eighty-Five Thousand More Loops I Just Shitted Out While Tripping Balls, Bollywood Stylee Edition, Vol. XXIV</em>, but TC really uses them more of a sample base to craft some wistful and/or funky tracks than the whole &#8216;Indian guys talk so crazy&#8217; shit.  Actually, it&#8217;s the tracks with the most curry powder that are the weakest, partially because they make no sense&#8211;there&#8217;s a disconnect between the beat alliteration and the lyrics.  You start to feel like, what I gotta do to get some korma up in here instead of nodding your head.  At 40+ tracks between &#8216;em, there&#8217;s definite sifting needed, but some solid joints for real.</p>
<p>(The <em>Blacula</em> soundtrack was not very interesting, in case you were wondering.  I mean, if you&#8217;re gonna have a song titled &#8216;Blacula Strikes!&#8217;, you better bring more than generic funk.)

<p style="text-align: left;">A  lotta rappers/bands go through that moment when they blow up and have  to stick with their artistic sensibility or go for the dough.  Sometimes  they just feel like doing pop music I guess, but the records are a lot  less interesting.  So imagine if Outkast had never gotten big, and their  sound got rougher and grimier, funkier and stankier, and they went back  to the knowing sly politics of <em>Southernplayalistik</em>&#8230;and then hooked up  with some crazy Orko Eloheem or El-P type beats.  That&#8217;s what you got  here.  Shit is on some flipped grits fatback action.  (&#8217;Fight&#8217; is the cut at the bottom.)</p>

<p>What we&#8217;ve seen across the Middle East and North Africa is inspiring.  After a decade where the only option to fight against hopelessness seemed to be to put C4 in your underpants, the hashtag revolutions of 2011 have been unprecedented and unforeseen.  If anyone had said six months ago &#8216;gee, maybe there will be mass demonstrations which will overthrow governments in half a dozen countries,&#8217; they&#8217;d have been the laughingstock of the Rand Institute, CNN and the State Department.  BREAKING NEWS: MIDEAST ANALYST IS A DREAMY HIPPIE, POSSIBLY HIGH.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little bit dubious about how much social media drove these uprisings.  I mean, I make probably more than a gaggle of Tunisians, and I can&#8217;t afford an iPhone.  I don&#8217;t check my Facebook that regular.  It&#8217;s probably a lot more complicated than that.  But smarter people than me argue about it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/25/twitter-facebook-uprisings-arab-libya" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/02/does-egypt-need-twitter.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://pressthink.org/2011/02/the-twitter-cant-topple-dictators-article/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2011/02/uprisings-media-internet" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, across the US mass protests are taking place at state capitols against budget cuts and depowering unions.  In Europe, the same.  Why are all these cuts taking place and screwing us?  The financial crisis, brought about by the bankers and stockbrokers.  The issue in the Middle East and North Africa isn&#8217;t democracy, it&#8217;s living standards, oppression and corruption.  It&#8217;s the same damn thing, but we&#8217;re falling for the rope-a-dope.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t tell me we live in a democracy in the West.  We live in a kleptocracy.  It&#8217;s just our corruption, greed and stealing from the people is legal.</p>
<p>My beloved, let&#8217;s get down to business&#8211;lemme hear you say&#8230;</p>

		<itunes:summary>What we've seen across the Middle East and North Africa is inspiring.  After a decade where the only option to fight against hopelessness seemed to be to put C4 in your underpants, the hashtag revolutions of 2011 have been unprecedented and unforeseen.  If anyone had said six months ago 'gee, maybe there will be mass demonstrations which will overthrow governments in half a dozen countries,' they'd have been the laughingstock of the Rand Institute, CNN and the State Department.  BREAKING NEWS: MIDEAST ANALYST IS A DREAMY HIPPIE, POSSIBLY HIGH.

I'm a little bit dubious about how much social media drove these uprisings.  I mean, I make probably more than a gaggle of Tunisians, and I can't afford an iPhone.  I don't check my Facebook that regular.  It's probably a lot more complicated than that.  But smarter people than me argue about it here, here, here and here.

Simultaneously, across the US mass protests are taking place at state capitols against budget cuts and depowering unions.  In Europe, the same.  Why are all these cuts taking place and screwing us?  The financial crisis, brought about by the bankers and stockbrokers.  The issue in the Middle East and North Africa isn't democracy, it's living standards, oppression and corruption.  It's the same damn thing, but we're falling for the rope-a-dope.

Don't tell me we live in a democracy in the West.  We live in a kleptocracy.  It's just our corruption, greed and stealing from the people is legal.

My beloved, let's get down to business--lemme hear you say...



The Hashtag Revolutions Mixtape:

Looking For Freedom - Ibn Thabit (Libya) / Last Days - The Arab Summit / We Protest - The Are / Ana Fhemtkoum - Mohamed Ali Ben Jemaa (Tunisia) / Poverty &#x38; Corruption - Ibn Thabit (Libya) / Not Your Prisoner - Arabian Knightz (feat. Shadia Mansour &#x38; Fredwreck) (Egypt) / Wa2t El Thawra Gaya - Revolution Records (Egypt) / Ta7ya Tounes - El General (feat. Mr Shooma) (Tunisia) / Back Down Mubarak! - Master Mimz (Egypt) / Land Of Yemen - Dirty Flame / Yalla Back to Yemen - Loki da Trixta / Ded El 7koma (Against The Government) - Ramy﻿ Donjewan (Egypt) / #Jan25 - Amir Sulaiman, Omar Offendum, The Narcicyst, Freeway, Ayah &#x38; Sami Matar (Egypt) / Awakening - Badawi / Justice Tomorrow - The Arab Summit / To Be Continued - Raz Mesinai / #fightthepower



Peep these out:

	Khalas Mixtape Vol. 1 - Mish B3eed (also at DatPiff): “Khalas” means “enough”, “stop” or “end” in Arabic. It’s also the title of this new mixtape featuring a group of hip hop artists from Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria and Libya who are fed up and have gotten together to spread their message that oppression must end, regardless of nationality and borders. Mish B3eed, or ‘Not far,’ refers to the sense of solidarity that these youth feel across borders, the similarities of their causes and the oppressors they face, their physical proximity and the sense that our ultimate goal is within sight.”

	Hip Hop &#x38; The Tunisian Revolution: A 21st Century Affair

<p>The traditional whitebread Western is antithetical to hip-hop, but the spaghetti Western intersects in a bunch of ways&#8211;the general badassery, stone-cold antiheroes, grimy rough operas, strict codes of honor, a heartless, lawless landscape, and of course Italian guys pretending to be Mexicans vs. Black guys pretending to be Italians.</p>
<p>And of course the gunplay.  Always the gun clappin&#8217;.  Spaghetti Westerns, like most hip-hop, are pretty much about guys shooting each other over money or disses.</p>
<p>If the action in spaghetti Westerns is the lyrics, Ennio Morricone&#8217;s operatic, mournful scores are the beats&#8211;counterpoint and juxtaposed to the cowboy/b-boy attitude.  Think about Mobb Deep&#8217;s beats; underneath the nihilistic braggadocio is the same sadness.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re both stylized forms loaded down with rich imagery and violent, iconic signifiers, like Noh plays, because they don&#8217;t play.  If you think about it, all&#8217;s the same with hip-hop&#8217;s other richly tapped vein, kung-fu flicks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when hip-hop tries to make actual Westerns, it turns out like <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDmJ4RS0mKU " target="_blank">Posse</a>,</em> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ORLq1zSNow&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">this</a>, or God help us, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pypMXSpZDQ" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>So saddle up, motherfuckers.  It&#8217;s the spaghetti Western mixtape.</p>
<p>The Good, The Bad &amp; The Intro / Draw - EPMD / Hang &#8216;Em High - Sadat X / Black Tequila - Ghostface Killah (feat. Cappadona &amp; Trife) / Tequila Sunrise - Cypress Hill / 1-2, Here&#8217;s What We Gonna Do - KRS-One &amp; True Master (feat. The RZA) / For A Few Dollars More - Morricone,  Material / Chamber of Fear - The RZA (feat. Rev. William Burke) / Some Crazy Flamenco Shit - DJ Shadow &amp; Cut Chemist / Dump The Clip - Army of the Pharoahs (Planetary, Esoteric &amp; Celph Titled) / Apache - Incredible Bongo Band (cuts by Grandmaster Flash) / How The Bronx Was Won - B.D.P. vs. Santa Esmeralda / The Ecstasy Of One Mic (DJ Erb Mix) - Nas / Land of the Gun - Immortal Technique &amp; Breez Evahflowin / Raw Is War - Jedi Mind Tricks / The End Intro - Alien Army / Bodyguard - Scotty Hard / Front Page - Compton&#8217;s Most Wanted / Cry Freedom - General Steele (feat. dead prez) / Beneath The Surface (Inna Blends mix) - GZA / Joany Loves Stringy - Animal Crackers / There It Is - Just-Ice &amp; KRS-One / Blue Leaves Showdown - EarDrumz / Wild Wild West - Kool Moe Dee</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So yeah, Wiz Wacka Cudi Kanye Weezy Drake Nicky Minaj blah blah blah.  I just don&#8217;t give a flying fuck about that stuff.  If <em>My Beautiful Laundrette Fantasy Island</em> is your bag, go for it, but my mission is to hype the unhyped and underhyped.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyway I must have listened to about five, seven thousand songs this year.  It&#8217;s like a sickness.  I can&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t stop.  I went kinda overboard sifting out my favorites for y&#8217;all; next year you&#8217;re on your own.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cape-verde/id370296500" target="_blank"><strong>Super Chron Flight Brothers :: </strong></a><em><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cape-verde/id370296500" target="_blank">Cape Verde</a> / <a href="http://www.undergroundhiphop.com/store/detail.asp?UPC=BWZ725CD" target="_blank">DirectTV</a> </strong></em>If you don&#8217;t know how much love I got for SCFB by now, you got rocks in your head.  This third LP has the best beats yet, word to Bond and Willie Green.  <em>Cape Verde</em> is a dissonant, addled and jumbled look at Amerikkka through the lens of TV&#8211;or maybe vice versa.  Woods &amp; Privilege drop more deadly one-liners than there are magic marshmellows in Lucky Charms; the songs are so stream-of-stoned-consciousness that each listen brings out another gem.  Yeah, they let the samples run way long; yeah, the TV concept drifts in and out&#8230;because they were high.  Woods spits every line like it&#8217;s the last, a pissed off, hungover Chuck  D; Privilege brings his sly, sing-songy jokester sound in counterpoint.  This is political rap without sloganeering, ghettoism without nihilism,  intelligence that doesn&#8217;t pat itself on the back (when Woods says it&#8217;s  &#8216;a Titus Andronicus moment,&#8217; he leaves it to you to Cliff Notes that  shit).  Dropping references from Boo Radley to Ally Sheedy, <em>The Shining</em> to Foghorn Leghorn, and about a million other things, <em>Cape Verde</em> is somewhere between <em>PTSD High &amp; Rising</em> and <em>Fear of a Black Sarcasm.</em> Cop that shit and bump it in your soon-to-be-repoed ride.</li>

Eagle brought a more intelligent, thoughtful, playful, diverse and honest record.</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">&#8230;plus <a href="http://elmattic.podbean.com/2010/06/03/across-2010th-street-side-a/" target="_blank">the records I picked in June.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back in the lab, the Large Hip Hop Collider produced some interesting scientifical theorems.  The <strong>Pro-Tools Imbalance</strong> proved that advances in software means you get a lot of records with great beats and mediocre-to-shitty rapping (c.f. eighty thousand white rap duos).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Shame On A Weed Carrier Theorem</strong> a.k.a. <strong>Self-Etherization Phenomenon</strong> had a lot of MCs getting murdered on their own shit by guest spots (see Hell Razah, Virtuoso, Ill Bill et al.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Piff&#8217;s Law</strong> states that the mixtape is always better than the album, which is disappointing ass.  Unlistenable, horrifying, smelly, stinky ass.  But the mixtape is fire.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Joell Ortiz :: <em><a href="http://www.dotgotit.com/?p=16407#more-16407" target="_blank">Project Boy</a>/<a href="http://www.joellortiz.com/blog/2010/9/10/farewell-summer.html" target="_blank">Farewell Summer</a>/<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?m1bkymb2mty" target="_blank">Belly of the Beast</a></em></strong> &gt; <em>Free Agent</em></li>
<li><strong>DJ Muggs x Bambu :: <a href="http://hulkshare.com/c8lyp94zh4pq" target="_blank"><em>Los Angeles, Philippines</em></a></strong> &gt; DJ Muggs &amp; Ill Bill, <em>Kill Devil Hills</em></li>
<li><strong>Cypress Hill :: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/33kdok" target="_blank"><em>The Uprising</em></a></strong> &gt; <em>Rise Up</em></li>
<li><strong>Mr. Dibbs ::</strong><em><strong> <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?3oezmht2mmg" target="_blank">Inducing Panic</a></strong> &gt; Dead World </em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Bandcamp Paradox</strong> encapsulates the unexplained phenomenon of free and inexpensive shit being better than what&#8217;s released by record labels.  Not like you pay for that either.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Malcolm &amp; Martin :: <a href="http://malcolmandmartin.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><em>Criminal Minded</em></a><em> </em></strong>Off the back of the <em>Movement Music</em> mixtape, this track-by-track cover/reimagining of BDP made me stop hating on the &#8216;classic album remake&#8217; concept (since it always just shows the new MCs aren&#8217;t as good).  Definitely feeling this.<strong><a href="http://malcolmandmartin.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><em> </em></a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All :: </strong><em><strong><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=V42298AH" target="_blank">Radical</a> </strong></em>This was definitely Odd Future&#8217;s year.  With that name and the hype around &#8216;em, I was expecting some kinda Panther Moderns/Clockwork Orange/4chan Clan thing, like Burroughs&#8217; Wild Boys but with less salamander butt-fucking.  In reality it&#8217;s a crew of talented teenagers with straight-up teenage attitudes, a lot more debut Beastie Boys than debut Geto Boys.  Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of rapping about rape and other &#8217;shocking&#8217; stuff, but they&#8217;re so obviously fucking around it&#8217;s pretty hard to be offended.  No question Tyler the Creator makes some incredible beats.  The lackadaisical, rambling, drawling lyricals don&#8217;t always meet up to that, but the lack of calculated bullshit and raw honesty bring heat.  Pure energy.  Also, how can you not like a crew whose de facto leader comes with tweets like this:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="tylertweet.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/ycmsjx/tylertweet.jpg" border="0" alt="tylertweet.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Bloody Monk Consortium :: <a href="http://bloodymonkconsortium.bandcamp.com/album/burden-of-truth-ep" target="_blank"><em>Burden of Truth EP</em></a></strong> Sounds like somebody locked Killarmy in a dark basement for five years with nothing but PCP and Chinese opera records.</li>
<li><strong>Two Ton Sloth :: <a href="http://twotonsloth.bandcamp.com/album/siphoning-dreams-lp" target="_blank"><em>Siphoning Dreams</em></a><em> </em></strong>I don&#8217;t know if this is on outer edges of hip hop or not.  Not even sure if it&#8217;s music.  But it&#8217;s dope on that what-the-fuck-am-I-listening-to tip.<strong><a href="http://twotonsloth.bandcamp.com/album/siphoning-dreams-lp" target="_blank"> </a></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>PSY/OPSogist :: <em><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?9c93z89dkkqox2a" target="_blank">All The Absent Voices</a> </em></strong>Honestly PSY/OPS&#8217; best work since <em>The Cathode Ray Tube,</em> and best instrumental shit I heard this year.</li>

		<itunes:summary>So yeah, Wiz Wacka Cudi Kanye Weezy Drake Nicky Minaj blah blah blah.  I just don't give a flying fuck about that stuff.  If My Beautiful Laundrette Fantasy Island is your bag, go for it, but my mission is to hype the unhyped and underhyped.
Anyway I must have listened to about five, seven thousand songs this year.  It's like a sickness.  I can't, I won't, I don't stop.  I went kinda overboard sifting out my favorites for y'all; next year you're on your own.


	Super Chron Flight Brothers :: Cape Verde / DirectTV If you don't know how much love I got for SCFB by now, you got rocks in your head.  This third LP has the best beats yet, word to Bond and Willie Green.  Cape Verde is a dissonant, addled and jumbled look at Amerikkka through the lens of TV--or maybe vice versa.  Woods &#x38; Privilege drop more deadly one-liners than there are magic marshmellows in Lucky Charms; the songs are so stream-of-stoned-consciousness that each listen brings out another gem.  Yeah, they let the samples run way long; yeah, the TV concept drifts in and out...because they were high.  Woods spits every line like it's the last, a pissed off, hungover Chuck  D; Privilege brings his sly, sing-songy jokester sound in counterpoint.  This is political rap without sloganeering, ghettoism without nihilism,  intelligence that doesn't pat itself on the back (when Woods says it's  'a Titus Andronicus moment,' he leaves it to you to Cliff Notes that  shit).  Dropping references from Boo Radley to Ally Sheedy, The Shining to Foghorn Leghorn, and about a million other things, Cape Verde is somewhere between PTSD High &#x38; Rising and Fear of a Black Sarcasm. Cop that shit and bump it in your soon-to-be-repoed ride.


	KRS-ONE &#x38; True Master :: Meta-Historical KRS  meets the Wu-Tang sound...it's like chocolate and bacon, you wonder why  no one thought of this before.  Best KRS in about twelve years. 
	Iron Lyon :: The Foundation EP Just some plain old dope shit.  What can I say.  This ain't Pitchfork.  I ain't gonna go all metaphor on your ass. 
	Greenhouse (Blueprint &#x38; Illogic) :: Electric Purgatory Part 2 I already showed love for Blueprint, and this was a definite top play for the year.
	June Marx :: Body of God / Core of Vengeance Daaaayumn this shit came hard, like some RZA-produced Mobb Deep.  Don't sleep.
	Ski Beatz :: 24 Hour Karate School    Pretty damn dope and not making other people's end-of lists.
	Ghostface Killah :: Apollo Kids Holy fuck, after the majorly lazy Wu-Massacre, Ghost springs back hard with some rock-solid Iron Man shit.  The Wu were kinda on the wane in 2000, but definitely picked up speed the last couple of years and stayed on top.
	Grey Matter :: Grey Matter Straight from the heart, Grey Matter's debut was sometimes too sincere to the point of didactic, but definitely on point and bringing back a deep, deep love of hip-hop.


	Open Mike Eagle :: Unapologetic Art Rap Funny, deft, smart...I wish it had better beats but this was one of the most interesting records of the year.  I know I called OME out on owing Rammellzee, but actually he's more a direct descendent of Basehead (...who I'll get on to next month).  While the hipsterati were all emolliating their privates with Das Racist's Essence of Williamsburg, O.M.

<p><a></a></p>
<p>So this got me thinking about conspiracy theories.  It&#8217;s just a pessimist/paranoid&#8217;s flip on the unified world view of religion&#8211;makes you feel better because everything&#8217;s under one central control, except instead of Jesus it&#8217;s the Annunaki.  It&#8217;s comforting to the extent that all your problems (which if you believe in this shit, are many) can be blamed externally: lost your job?  Socialist conspiracy of the New World Order.  Couldn&#8217;t get a gun permit (because you&#8217;re batshit)?  Illuminati master plan.  Feel like the world is too complicated to understand?  Fear agenda of the reptilian overlords.  Haiti earthquake?  MJ12 experiment.  Can&#8217;t comprehend/process the horror of 9/11?  Bush did it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one reason I can&#8217;t get with conspiracies: human beings are   just not that good at being organized, keeping secrets, and not fucking   up.  I can&#8217;t think of more than a couple of people I&#8217;ve ever met who  could be trusted with Roswell UFO technology.  And they would tell their  wives, no doubt.  Who would tell their best friends.  And then, you  know.  But here&#8217;s one reason I appreciate alien/Illuminati/9/11  conspiracies: takes the heat off the Jews, which makes a nice change  from the past 1,500 years.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still hard to fathom how people buy into this stuff.  I  looked at a lot more &#8216;evidence&#8217; of the reptilian agenda on YouTube than  is really worth it, and it consists of: people sticking their tongues  out, people with bad eye-tuck surgery blinking weird, reflections of  lights in people&#8217;s eyes momentarily making them look slitted, and a  crazy woman who thinks she&#8217;s an alien.  Seriously, that&#8217;s it.  More  evidence: ancient Egyptians didn&#8217;t wear long, egg-shaped hats, <em>their heads were actually shaped that way.</em> Because they were fuckin&#8217; aliens, dog.  Really though.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s all the secret clues which our evil overlords leave around in the most obscure places because&#8230;uh, it&#8217;s not really clear why they do that.  But 9/11, for example, was predicted on the Simpsons:</p>
<p><img title="simpsonsconspiracy.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/yuhkw7/simpsonsconspiracy.jpg" border="0" alt="simpsonsconspiracy.jpg" height="250" /></p>
<p>&#8230;and on your money:</p>
<p><img title="conspiracies.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/2svbhh/conspiracies.jpg" border="0" alt="conspiracies.jpg" /></p>
<p>So let me get this straight.  Bush, or whoever the fuck, as part of the Annunaki bloodline or whatever, planned 9/11 in 1996, and then secretly had our money changed so that when you folded it into a paper airplane just so it would look sort of like what was coming five years later.  In order to&#8230;something or other.  But wait!  <em>What happens if we turn this secret message sideways!?</em></p>
<p><img title="10dollarblunt.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/2mpzud/10dollarblunt.jpg" border="0" alt="10dollarblunt.jpg" height="250" /></p>
<p>Oh.  The Illuminati wants you to smoke blunts.</p>
<p>You feel me?  It&#8217;s easier to believe in a vast evil conspiracy than that the world is all chaos, randomness, hatred, stupidity and greed.  It&#8217;s more  comforting to think that aliens secretly control the world than to face  the frightening fact that it just spins on and on.</p>
<p>Doing this mix, I started thinking maybe the thesis of TV as the means for total brain control is outdated, what with this internet thing I keep hearing about.  Is the internet just another form of extreme zombification?  Yes and no.  Its exponential rise hasn&#8217;t coincided with political apathy: the left and the right have been extremely mobile and active this decade.  But who&#8217;s agenda has that been?  Who&#8217;s driving it?  Well, the left has been driven by intellectual elites.  (Wait, that means Jews.  Damn it.)  The Tea Party has been driven by Fox News, so TV is still brain control.  And the Tea Party has <a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/08/24/4962235-koch-industries-funds-tea-party-really" target="_blank">secretly been driven by corporate interests like Koch Industries</a>.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a battle for your consciousness.  There <em>is</em> a control agenda.  There <em>are</em> conspiracies to control the world, or large parts of it.  Just don&#8217;t buy into the stupid and recognize the real.

So this got me thinking about conspiracy theories.  It's just a pessimist/paranoid's flip on the unified world view of religion--makes you feel better because everything's under one central control, except instead of Jesus it's the Annunaki.  It's comforting to the extent that all your problems (which if you believe in this shit, are many) can be blamed externally: lost your job?  Socialist conspiracy of the New World Order.  Couldn't get a gun permit (because you're batshit)?  Illuminati master plan.  Feel like the world is too complicated to understand?  Fear agenda of the reptilian overlords.  Haiti earthquake?  MJ12 experiment.  Can't comprehend/process the horror of 9/11?  Bush did it.



Here's one reason I can't get with conspiracies: human beings are   just not that good at being organized, keeping secrets, and not fucking   up.  I can't think of more than a couple of people I've ever met who  could be trusted with Roswell UFO technology.  And they would tell their  wives, no doubt.  Who would tell their best friends.  And then, you  know.  But here's one reason I appreciate alien/Illuminati/9/11  conspiracies: takes the heat off the Jews, which makes a nice change  from the past 1,500 years.

But it's still hard to fathom how people buy into this stuff.  I  looked at a lot more 'evidence' of the reptilian agenda on YouTube than  is really worth it, and it consists of: people sticking their tongues  out, people with bad eye-tuck surgery blinking weird, reflections of  lights in people's eyes momentarily making them look slitted, and a  crazy woman who thinks she's an alien.  Seriously, that's it.  More  evidence: ancient Egyptians didn't wear long, egg-shaped hats, their heads were actually shaped that way.

<p>Joell Ortiz is pretty much my favorite normal rapper right now (i.e.  does not rap about the Bilderburgs, spaceships, Halliburton, or just  string beautiful nonsense together).  Dude is always on point, great with little details, has a good flow and one of those fat-guy-boricua voices.  At first I thought he was like a skinnier Fat  Joe, but now I think he sounds more like Immortal Technique’s little brother who didn’t go to college and just likes to hang.</p>
<p>I used to live down on Stanton St. before it got overrun by hipsters (no pomo), and when it rained, the Dominican cats used to set up their dominos under the bus stop.  Ortiz is one of those kinda guys.  One Sunday morning I saw this hungover guy sitting on his stoop with a Heineken in one hand and a Clamato in the other.  Ortiz is that dude.</p>
<p>He reminds me of that kid Mikey from the Life cereal commercials who’ll eat anything.  I wouldn&#8217;t say he kills any beat, but he does his damndest.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Joell Ortiz is pretty much my favorite normal rapper right now (i.e.  does not rap about the Bilderburgs, spaceships, Halliburton, or just  string beautiful nonsense together).  Dude is always on point, great with little details, has a good flow and one of those fat-guy-boricua voices.  At first I thought he was like a skinnier Fat  Joe, but now I think he sounds more like Immortal Technique’s little brother who didn’t go to college and just likes to hang.

I used to live down on Stanton St. before it got overrun by hipsters (no pomo), and when it rained, the Dominican cats used to set up their dominos under the bus stop.  Ortiz is one of those kinda guys.  One Sunday morning I saw this hungover guy sitting on his stoop with a Heineken in one hand and a Clamato in the other.  Ortiz is that dude.

He reminds me of that kid Mikey from the Life cereal commercials who’ll eat anything.  I wouldn't say he kills any beat, but he does his damndest.

<p class="MsoNormal">Sure, you could spend your whole life listening exclusively to Japanese instrumental hip-hop, or digging through Bandcamp, but that&#8217;s a whole lot better than being force-fed Rick Ross like a goddamn foie gras goose, ain&#8217;t it?  Yeah, there’s more out there than anyone could physically listen to, and a lot of it’s garbage, but it gives a voice to anyone who wants to make themselves heard.  And the bigger the digital crates, the more <span> </span>the hidden gems.  As the warrior-poet Ice Cube once said, the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin&#8217;.  So here&#8217;s some beatmakers who begin with &#8216;A&#8217; as a taste.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="http://alphabethead.blog.com/" target="_blank">Alphabethead</a></strong> hit me off with his 33 track instrumental LP, <em><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?tntdmdmizle" target="_blank">N37 Modulations</a> </em>(click to download). Ooh, that&#8217;s fresh.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I haven&#8217;t really been keeping up with the instrumental scene lately; feels like I&#8217;ve copped the best talents and finding it harder and harder to find beats that aren&#8217;t not-quite-good-as-Mumbles/Krush/Son of a Bricklayer/The Nothing/PSY/OPSogist etc.  But I gotta say, this is some dope.  I&#8217;m all obsessive compulsive about pruning tracks off if they&#8217;re not absolute fire, and out of these 33 they&#8217;re all good.  Don&#8217;t let his New Zealand origin fool you, this is no&#8230;uh, what comes  from New Zealand again?  Sheep.  <em>Lord of the Rings.</em> Katherine  Mansfield.  Um, that&#8217;s all I can think of.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You know I likes me some good beats, some funky loops, some good ol&#8217; fashioned scratching, and some wacky vocal samples.  Alph got it.  None of that bleepy bloopy, glitchity-glatchety shit.  Think Cut Chemist, Kid Koala, DJ Shadow, DJ Frane, DJ Cam&#8217;s older shit&#8230;this is right up there.  He&#8217;s got a few other beats over on his <a href="http://alphabethead.blog.com/" target="_blank">site</a> which are worth peeping.  Nice range of sounds, unique samples, good drums&#8211;it&#8217;s all good, my peoples.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img title="AlphabetheadOSTABC.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/e4r3wz/AlphabetheadOSTABC.jpg" border="0" alt="AlphabetheadOSTABC.jpg" height="250" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Alph&#8217;s other joint is a fine, fine mix of soundtrack cuts called <em><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?uennhumt5mi" target="_blank">OST ABC</a>.</em> About 20 minutes in he fucks that <em>Cat People</em> theme right the fuck up, to use the proper medical terminology.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img title="AllahUniversal.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/ktq8c/AllahUniversal.jpg" border="0" alt="AllahUniversal.jpg" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://universallanguage007.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Allah Universal</strong></a> is another master craftsman who&#8217;s resisted the whole dubstep/glitch-hop trend and sticks with hard beats, ethereal samples and haunting loops.  The challenge for this kind of beatmaker is to hold your attention, hypnotize you to feel the spaces between the beats and call up feelings of nostalgia, loss and a larger world of unspoken beauty.  Not every track does that, but the way he rides the beat and acoustic guitar on &#8220;Read Between The Lines&#8221; is as good as anything you&#8217;ll hear from Four Tet, Bonobo or pre-disappearing-up-his-own-ass Prefuse 73.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Peep <em><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/21920" target="_blank">The U-N-I Verse</a></em> and <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/19533" target="_blank"><em>Pro-Me-The-Us,</em></a> and a clutch of others, over at Jamendo.  His newest joint is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/21-days-around-the-universe/id376818783" target="_blank"><em>21 Days Around The Universe,</em></a> over at iTunes, and he just started a <a href="http://allahuniversal.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">bandcamp</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(OK, I&#8217;m not really describing these joints well, but writing about music has only two modes: nonsensical hype (&#8221;Flips the script on the boom-bap for a bap-boom stylee.&#8221;) and overstretched metaphors that might as well be wine writing (&#8221;Hints of Oak(land), traces of (Like Water For) Chocolate, and textures of early Mantronix.&#8221;).  By now you either trust my picks or you don&#8217;t.  Download and decide for yourself.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img title="abnormlchomsky.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/x8uu8b/abnormlchomsky.jpg" border="0" alt="abnormlchomsky.jpg" width="237" height="250" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I could have sworn I hyped <a href="http://abnormlinjustice.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Abnorml Injustice</strong></a> before.  Musta been some Illuminati/MJ12 kill switch that deleted it.  Anyway, nice beats and extensive samples for these hip-hop portraits: <em><a href="http://" target="_blank">Ode to Noam Chomsky</a>, <a href="http://abnormlinjustice.blogspot.com/2010/04/abnorml-injustice-ode-to-hunter-s.html" target="_blank">Ode to Hunter S. Thompson</a>,</em> and an <a href="http://abnormlinjustice.blogspot.com/2010/03/abnorml-injustice-ode-to-bill-cooper.html" target="_blank"><em>Ode to Bill Cooper</em></a>&#8230;what&#8217;s not to like?  Next up an <em>Ode to Slavoj Zizek</em> maybe?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img title="airnino.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/5mums/airnino.jpg" border="0" alt="airnino.jpg" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today&#8217;s hosted track (below/on ya feed) is<a href="http://www.myspace.com/airnino" target="_blank"><strong> Airnino</strong></a>&#8217;s &#8220;Vermont&#8221;.  Listen to what he does with a two-note piano sample, shimmering jazz drums and a scratched horn loop&#8230;it&#8217;s the kind of jazz-hop that&#8217;s gotten buried under the softer, noodly Nujabes/Fat Jon kinda shit. He&#8217;s giving away an LP called <em><a href="http://www.tablist.net/retrofuturism/music/spacesuite.zip" target="_blank">Spacesuite Radio</a>,</em> but I have to say I wasn&#8217;t really feeling it, and there&#8217;s some more tracks on his <a href="http://soundcloud.com/airnino" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This track is so hot I got all inspired to do a Fitty Tracks for Fitty States series, but then I could only think of about three other songs (&#8221;NY State of Mind,&#8221; &#8220;Baking Soda in Minnesota,&#8221; Eminem&#8217;s &#8220;Sweet Home Alabama&#8221; freestyle in<em> 8 Mile</em>) and then wasted a bunch of time on the internet trying to figure out the Alaskan hip-hop scene or if there even was one besides stupid jokes about MC Eskimo and You Gots To Chill.  Then I was all, stop fucking around for Christ&#8217;s sake.  Just play the damn song.</p>

Sure, you could spend your whole life listening exclusively to Japanese instrumental hip-hop, or digging through Bandcamp, but that's a whole lot better than being force-fed Rick Ross like a goddamn foie gras goose, ain't it?  Yeah, there’s more out there than anyone could physically listen to, and a lot of it’s garbage, but it gives a voice to anyone who wants to make themselves heard.  And the bigger the digital crates, the more  the hidden gems.  As the warrior-poet Ice Cube once said, the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'.  So here's some beatmakers who begin with 'A' as a taste.




Alphabethead hit me off with his 33 track instrumental LP, N37 Modulations (click to download). Ooh, that's fresh.
I haven't really been keeping up with the instrumental scene lately; feels like I've copped the best talents and finding it harder and harder to find beats that aren't not-quite-good-as-Mumbles/Krush/Son of a Bricklayer/The Nothing/PSY/OPSogist etc.  But I gotta say, this is some dope.  I'm all obsessive compulsive about pruning tracks off if they're not absolute fire, and out of these 33 they're all good.  Don't let his New Zealand origin fool you, this is no...uh, what comes  from New Zealand again?  Sheep.  Lord of the Rings.

You know I likes me some good beats, some funky loops, some good ol' fashioned scratching, and some wacky vocal samples.  Alph got it.  None of that bleepy bloopy, glitchity-glatchety shit.  Think Cut Chemist, Kid Koala, DJ Shadow, DJ Frane, DJ Cam's older shit...this is right up there.  He's got a few other beats over on his site which are worth peeping.  Nice range of sounds, unique samples, good drums--it's all good, my peoples.

Alph's other joint is a fine, fine mix of soundtrack cuts called OST ABC. About 20 minutes in he fucks that Cat People theme right the fuck up, to use the proper medical terminology.

Allah Universal is another master craftsman who's resisted the whole dubstep/glitch-hop trend and sticks with hard beats, ethereal samples and haunting loops.  The challenge for this kind of beatmaker is to hold your attention, hypnotize you to feel the spaces between the beats and call up feelings of nostalgia, loss and a larger world of unspoken beauty.  Not every track does that, but the way he rides the beat and acoustic guitar on "Read Between The Lines" is as good as anything you'll hear from Four Tet, Bonobo or pre-disappearing-up-his-own-ass Prefuse 73.
Peep The U-N-I Verse and Pro-Me-The-Us, and a clutch of others, over at Jamendo.  His newest joint is 21 Days Around The Universe, over at iTunes, and he just started a bandcamp.
(OK, I'm not really describing these joints well, but writing about music has only two modes: nonsensical hype ("Flips the script on the boom-bap for a bap-boom stylee.") and overstretched metaphors that might as well be wine writing ("Hints of Oak(land), traces of (Like Water For) Chocolate, and textures of early Mantronix.").  By now you either trust my picks or you don't.  Download and decide for yourself.)

I could have sworn I hyped Abnorml Injustice before.  Musta been some Illuminati/MJ12 kill switch that deleted it.  Anyway, nice beats and extensive samples for these hip-hop portraits: Ode to Noam Chomsky, Ode to Hunter S. Thompson, and an Ode to Bill Cooper...what's not to like?  Next up an Ode to Slavoj Zizek maybe?

Today's hosted track (below/on ya feed) is Airnino's "Vermont".  Listen to what he does with a two-note piano sample, shimmering jazz drums and a scratched horn loop...it's the kind of jazz-hop that's gotten bu</itunes:summary>

<p>When people rate their &#8217;90s producers, I never understood why Pete Rock came close second to Premier and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Prince-Paul-DJ-Producer-extraordinaire/115161598527?v=wall" target="_blank">Prince Paul</a> way down the list.  (Not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Paul_of_Yugoslavia" target="_blank">this Prince Paul</a>, or <a href="http://www.princepaul.co.uk/" target="_blank">this one</a> or <a href="http://www.princepaulofromania.com/" target="_blank">this one</a>, though it&#8217;s typical wacky PP stylee that they all share the same name.)  I mean, Pete Rock&#8217;s done some great joints, no doubt, but he kinda defined a sound in the way Nathan&#8217;s defined hot dogs.  It&#8217;s just a type of frankfurter.</p>
<p>Prince Paul produced a steady string of some of the most creative and groundbreaking LPs before going for the gusto and cutting loose with the best (and only successful) concept records in all hip-hop, and some of the most innovative.  And the funniest.  Not too many actually funny cats in hip hop.  And I mean <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Prince+Paul" target="_blank">check the man&#8217;s credits</a>&#8211;Stetsasonic, <em>3 Feet High &#038; Rising</em>, Gravediggaz, Chubb Rock, Big Daddy Kane, Latifah, 3rd Bass, B.D.P., remixes galore.</p>
<p>Anyways, two of his unreleased LPs have seen the light and coming from his best era, they&#8217;re slammin&#8217;:</p>

<p>So for some reason I started collecting acoustic covers of hip hop, some amateur and some professional.  Jet from the <a href="http://theoverdrone.com/" target="_blank">Overdrone</a> hooked me up with some, and others came from <a href="http://coverlaydown.com/2009/03/all-folked-up-gangsta-rap-brsmallsincere-streetsmart-and-straight-up-folksmall/" target="_blank">this insightful post</a> over at Cover Laydown.  Then I found the vast trove of Youtube covers.</p>
<p>A lot of people get really pissed off at these; I guess they think they&#8217;re insulting or mocking.  But it&#8217;s far too much work to learn to play a song just for a stupid joke.  The literally thousands of covers you can find on YouTube are sincere in their own way; they&#8217;re not blackface or wiggery, they&#8217;re covers on the ukelele or $15 Target guitar.  This is not appropriation but, like any good covers, transformation and re-working within the musicians&#8217; (sic) genre, instrument and voice.</p>
<p>There are some covers I don&#8217;t like, like the Ben Folds cover of &#8220;Bitches Ain&#8217;t Shit&#8221; or the Obadiah Parker &#8220;Hey Ya&#8221;, and most heavy metal covers.  There&#8217;s a lack of contrast, or not enough cognitive dissonance, or something, that makes them uninteresting.  Then there&#8217;s Duran Duran&#8217;s &#8220;911 Is A Joke&#8221;, which is just&#8230;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">too</span> what-the-fuck.</p>
<p>I know I said last post these are not hip hop, but transforming music into something your own, and feeling it so much you gotta spit it&#8211;well, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> hip hop.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=521ntA9Jg2M" target="_blank">Look at the ukelele kid</a>.  Holy shit, that is one un-gangsta motherfucker right there.  I especially love the comments:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Fallenknight155: You Fagget motherfucker why would you disgrace that song it&#8217;s a rap song not one of your gay﻿ club songs. If I ever see you in the streets I&#8217;ll deck you you in your chin</em></p>
<p><em>ChrisWestaway: i﻿ am ready to fight you.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But he loves &#8220;Bring The Noise&#8221; that much&#8230;?  That&#8217;s the power of hip hop.  It makes some cats uncomfortable that kids at North Springfield Middle School know all the words to every song on<em> Liquid Swords, </em>but that didacticism is 20 years out of date and does not dilute hip hop one bit.</p>
<p>I keep thinking about that line in Michael Herr&#8217;s <em>Dispatches</em> where he says &#8220;I saw a platoon [of Marines fighting in Vietnam] done up in Batman fetishes, it gave them a kind of dumb esprit.&#8221;  There&#8217;s a dumb gravitas to, say, &#8220;Gangsta&#8217;s Paradise&#8221; which becomes a dumb mournful gravitas when it&#8217;s remade into something off the <em>Liquid Sky</em> soundtrack.  There&#8217;s a root in the blues in &#8220;The Message&#8221; which isn&#8217;t apparent until it&#8217;s covered as a blues song.  Is there an essential quality to &#8220;C.R.E.A.M.&#8221; that is lost, or retained, when it&#8217;s covered in the style of John Cougar Mellencamp Unplugged?</p>
<p>Or, you know, not.  I don&#8217;t know, maybe I&#8217;ve lost my fucking mind.  They are pretty hilarious though.</p>

<p>Beat Bop (1983) - w/K-Rob / Lecture (1987) - w/Shockdell / Equation  (1989) - w/Material / Hisstory (1999) - w/Material / His Stories  Crockery (2002) - w/New Flesh / My Horizon (2003) - from <em>This Is What You Made Me</em> / Sigma 1 (2004) - from <em>Bi-Conicals of the Rammellzee</em> / Beat Bop, Pt. 2 (2004) - w/Shockdell / Revelations Part 2 (2008) - w/Praxis / Uncommon freestyle (2007) / On Iconic Panzerism</p>
<p>Rammellzee, The RAMM:∑LL:Z∑∑, The Quantum Equation, The Gothic Futurist, Iconic Panzerist, The Master Alphabiter, King of the Garbage Gods, All-Around Crazy-Ass, moved from the material(ist) plane to one of pure graffiti on June 30.</p>
<p>Ramm started out as a graf writer and that informed everything he did.  The late &#8217;70s, early &#8217;80s&#8211;there was nothing we&#8217;d call hip-hop.  Just graffiti.  When downtown came uptown he got down with the art scene.  He was in the movie <em>Wild Style</em> and dropped &#8220;Beat Bop&#8221; with Schockdell and Basquiat.  Over the years he moved between making strange records, making strange artwork, and making very strange costumes&#8211;Iron Man by way of the garbage can.</p>
<p>He was one of those autodidact, true original, is-he-genius-or-just-talking-shit types.  Hip-hop&#8217;s Sun Ra, George Clinton or Lee Scratch Perry, except his shit was too advanced to be as well-known and influential.  Why not more famous?  Well, the Museum of Modern Art owns some of his work, but in hip hop as usual the godfathers are left behind.  He wasn&#8217;t really that interested in making records, and I think he was too unironic, too ghetto and too out there for the Soho scene to big him up.  I mean, wine and cheese gallery openings don&#8217;t go well with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/01/10/arts/0111-MASK_6.html" target="_blank">homemade doll-head-covered Kabukitron outfits</a>.</p>
<p>Kool Keith, K-The-I???, DJ Spooky, Killah Priest, Sir Menelik, Buck 65, Company Flow, Cannibal Ox, Super Chron Flight Brothers, Madlib, Lil B, Lil Wayne, all Anticon and Def Jux artists, and anyone who ever rapped about outer space, extreme/supreme mathematics, alien autopsies, Egyptian mythology, or any other kind of weird insane cryptic type shit, or rapped in highly coded messages of fractured language, all these people owe Rammellzee ten million dollars.  Because he invented that shit in Nine. Teen. Eighty. Three.</p>
<p>MF Doom wears a mask?  Rammellzee invented that shit.  RZA stands for Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah?  Rammellzee stands for <em>RAM plus M for Magnitude, Sigma (Σ) the first summation operator, first L - longitude, second L - latitude, Z - z-bar, Σ, Σ - summation. </em>I say it stands for: <em>Rap&#8217;s Ascended Master Mad Eloquent Lectures Landing Zone Earth Elevated. </em>He legally changed his name to Rammellzee, for Christ&#8217;s sake.  Top that, P. Diddly Oodly.  And Wacka Wocka Flame my ass.</p>
<p>Open Mike Eagle just dropped a nice LP called &#8220;Unapologetic Art Rap.&#8221;   R:L:Z invented unapologetic art rap in 1983.  Open Mike Eagle owes him  ten dollars.</p>
<p>The obits keep saying he &#8216;influenced the Beastie Boys and Cypress Hill,&#8217; by which they mean Ram&#8217;s &#8216;Gangsta Duck&#8217; nasal rhyming style made it OK for B-Real and Ad-Rock to be all nasal.  The Beastie Boys and Cypress Hill do not owe Ram ten dollars.  Maybe five dollars.</p>
<p>When you first saw <em>The Matrix</em> and got your mind blown in 1999,  Rammellzee just shrugged and said: &#8216;Told you.&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/06/29/22282138.aspx" target="_blank">While today&#8217;s no-talent rappers cozy up to  cognac executives</a>,  Rammellzee invented some 2083 shit.  You  best catch up.</p>
<p>This concise XLR8R review of his <em>Bi-Conicals</em> LP sums him up  well:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sometimes the album art says it all: some growling  homeboy in a Beijing Opera mask, rainbow ski boots, with what appears to  be a travel version of Connect Four dangling from his belt and, in the  mirror, his opposite reflection. I don&#8217;t know quite how it&#8217;s happened,  but </em>Bi-Conicals<em> sounds exactly like iconic hip-hopper Rammellzee  looks&#8211;not quite insane, not quite clown. This album is full of gothic  videogame hip-hop tunnel-scavengers that aren&#8217;t quite demented enough to  be truly fun, yet crazy enough as to be totally confusing to listen to.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://giovannimarks.net/post/751410857/restinpeacerammellzee" target="_blank">Giovanni Marks</a> sez:<em> The dude was so far ahead of  his time, no one even knew what it looked like when we all caught up to  it. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/rip-rammllz" target="_blank">Will Luckman</a> sez: <em>In a culture born of a desire for fame, RAMM∑LLZ∑∑ put on a mask and forced his way outside—transforming himself into a true god, an unseen force manipulating the world he dominated as he looked down from above, laughing.</em></p>
<p>He was one of those cats who dabbled in lots of media because the artform he specialized in hasn&#8217;t been invented yet: a combo of graffitti, hip hop, sculpture, costumes, lectures, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Q: Music or art? Which inspires you the most?</em></p>
<p><em>A: NEITHER ONE. ARCHITECTURE DOES. THE GOTHICS. I WOULD RIDE THE TRAINS TO CLARA BARTON’S IN BROOKLYN NEAR PROSPECT HEIGHTS &amp; BOTANICAL GARDENS ON MY WAY FROM CUTTING SCHOOL, I WOULD CUT-OUT &amp; TAKE D TRAIN &amp; I WOULD HEAR A GUY NAMED DYNAMITE D ON THE MICROPHONE AS A CONDUCTOR OPENING &amp; CLOSING THE DOORS. I DID NOT CALL THAT INSPIRATION BECAUSE I ALREADY KNEW HOW TO RHYME. I WAS JUST STUDYING THE DIFFERENT ROLLING PAGES ON THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. I CALL THEM ROLLING PAGES, THEY CALL THEM SNAKES.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of the time rappers who act crazy and talk shit, it&#8217;s just an act.  There&#8217;s no thinking behind it.  This is why I got tired of Kool Keith a few records ago and, <a href="http://elmattic.podbean.com/2010/02/10/doom-live-from-latveria/" target="_blank">like I said earlier</a>, get frustrated with DOOM.  Rammellzee thought so much about grafitti and what it could mean, he sounded nuts, but he drops mad science if you listen.  He keeps going until ends up at pure mathematics.  It&#8217;s hard to unpack it.  The <em>Iconic Treatise</em> is as dense and insane and brilliant as P.K. Dick&#8217;s <em>Exegesis</em>.  The ideas about how language uses us, language&#8217;s independence and domination, the need to free it from its own boundaries to reach enlightenment&#8230;these are all Burroughsian-like concepts in a wild style frame.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Q: You initially made your reputation in graffiti? </em></p>
<p><em>A: No, I was involved in gothic futurism and gothic text. Graffiti is a word that society placed on people it did not possibly understand. Before we could grow up and make our own determination of what technique or iconic statement we were doing, they decided - instead of saying we were abstract and have a whole society built on non complete information and these guys are about to scare the shit out of us with the biggest culture since futurism 10000 strong - to call us scribble, scrabble artists which is a contradiction right there. They called us something that eventually wiped us out.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So how does an all-city bomber end up in a handmade robot soundsystem suit making <a href="http://www.gothicfuturism.com/letter/01.html" target="_blank">wildstyle Voltron skateboard sculptures</a>?  Graffiti emerged from the dead zone, the war zone of &#8217;70s New York.  It was the disenfranchised taking back the trains.  You take the trains, you take the city.  They took the trains with their names, with letters.  The alphabet became the weapon.  The trains were the tanks.  The terminology was already there&#8211;bombing, burning.  So trains are &#8216;rolling pages&#8217;&#8211;blank of writing, public transit papyrus.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>My inspiration was my curiosity of why people wanted  to write on trains, the biggest distribution gallery for any art form  known to man&#8230;JESTER did what we should call now, the &#8220;signoverture.&#8221; a  letter with a harpoon on it. I based most of my style on that. I often  wondered why JESTER armored the &#8220;letter&#8221; with a barbed arrow&#8230;</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>The  letter music notes and weather notes that were done down there reached a  point where you didn&#8217;t need to kill a person. The piece itself became a  weapon: the letter itself. So fame was the most interesting to take  out. How do you know George Washington? You know him through a name. You  shoot the letter on the train at the other name and it takes out that  name. So therefore homeboy has no identity. Why should I kill him? He&#8217;ll  just be dead anyway because nobody will know who he is. </em></p>
<p><em>My style did not break away from any traditional art form of the illuminations. I just went further, did what people wouldn&#8217;t. We all painted three dimensional letters. I just finished mines by building them. Those rolling pages in those wind tunnels showed everyone what to do. Those who chose to complete &#8220;that&#8221; competition of the five boroughs of New York City, had their reasons to finish or not their studies. Even if their studies were rolling at the speed of 35 miles per hour.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Wild style.  Three-dimensional letters&#8211;illegible unless you&#8217;re initiated.  Coded language.  Electricity straight down the third rail.  These are also armored letters&#8211;protected from interpretation and exploitation.  <em>&#8220;The letter is armed to stop all the phony formations, lies, and tricknowlegies placed upon its structure&#8230;&#8221;</em> as Ram put it, <em>&#8220;&#8230;how a letter aerodynamically changes into a tank.&#8221;</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Rammellzee is a military function formation… I am ramming the knowledge to an elevation and I am understanding the knowledge behind the Zee. Since we are dealing with Roman letters, we have to go back to the day when the Romans were using the ram to break down doors. Our situation today is to break down a door of knowledge hidden behind society. We&#8217;re going to work our way around it instead of breaking it straight up. Whereas before you&#8217;d be trying to break through and you would be on the bottom of the pile. We&#8217;re talking about where graffiti originated, where hardcore war went down, with markers against markers and letters against letters. You think war is always shooting and beating everybody up, but no, we had the letters fight for us.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>From there it gets even more obtuse.  He started thinking about the connection between graf and illuminated manuscripts (gothic script).  And he decided he was continuing the work of medieval monks whose illuminations were banned by the Catholic Church.  Then he got into the idea that language is mathematics, and electromagnetic forces, and all this is preventing us from moving out into space&#8230;into Burroughs territory but also into <a href="http://www.timecube.com/" target="_blank">Time Cube</a> territory.  But there was always a coded Afrofuturist agenda there, his Five Percenter past keeping it relevant.</p>
<p>In 2001 R:L:Z said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We failed what could have been &#8220;our&#8221; culture. I went to the Puck Building (Guernsey&#8217;s Auction) in June of the year 2000 and offered my services. Everyone who was anyone in this &#8220;subculture&#8221; had works for sale. No one sold, except for a few. I felt that the &#8220;culture&#8221; died right there. There was too much &#8220;mannerism&#8221; not enough &#8220;burner&#8221;!!! Our futurism! We should have only stuck to doing the &#8220;letter&#8221; and joined together to fight the light dwellers. but, we will always be Kings From the Dark Continent. The veins of this Gotham! Remember this the next level, as you said, is the third dimension. I hope.</em></p></blockquote>

Rammellzee, The RAMM:∑LL:Z∑∑, The Quantum Equation, The Gothic Futurist, Iconic Panzerist, The Master Alphabiter, King of the Garbage Gods, All-Around Crazy-Ass, moved from the material(ist) plane to one of pure graffiti on June 30.

Kool Keith, K-The-I???, DJ Spooky, Killah Priest, Sir Menelik, Buck 65, Company Flow, Cannibal Ox, Super Chron Flight Brothers, Madlib, Lil B, Lil Wayne, all Anticon and Def Jux artists, and anyone who ever rapped about outer space, extreme/supreme mathematics, alien autopsies, Egyptian mythology, or any other kind of weird insane cryptic type shit, or rapped in highly coded messages of fractured language, all these people owe Rammellzee ten million dollars.  Because he invented that shit in Nine.

MF Doom wears a mask?  Rammellzee invented that shit.  RZA stands for Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah?  Rammellzee stands for RAM plus M for Magnitude, Sigma (Σ) the first summation operator, first L - longitude, second L - latitude, Z - z-bar, Σ, Σ - summation. I say it stands for: Rap's Ascended Master Mad Eloquent Lectures Landing Zone Earth Elevated. He legally changed his name to Rammellzee, for Christ's sake.  Top that, P. Diddly Oodly.  And Wacka Wocka Flame my ass.

Open Mike Eagle just dropped a nice LP called "Unapologetic Art Rap."   R:L:Z invented unapologetic art rap in 1983.  Open Mike Eagle owes him  ten dollars.

The obits keep saying he 'influenced the Beastie Boys and Cypress Hill,' by which they mean Ram's 'Gangsta Duck' nasal rhyming style made it OK for B-Real and Ad-Rock to be all nasal.  The Beastie Boys and Cypress Hill do not owe Ram ten dollars.  Maybe five dollars.

When you first saw The Matrix and got your mind blown in 1999,  Rammellzee just shrugged and said: 'Told you.'

While today's no-talent rappers cozy up to  cognac executives,  Rammellzee invented some 2083 shit.  You  best catch up.

This concise XLR8R review of his Bi-Conicals LP sums him up  well:
Sometimes the album art says it all: some growling  homeboy in a Beijing Opera mask, rainbow ski boots, with what appears to  be a travel version of Connect Four dangling from his belt and, in the  mirror, his opposite reflection. I don't know quite how it's happened,  but Bi-Conicals sounds exactly like iconic hip-hopper Rammellzee  looks--not quite insane, not quite clown. This album is full of gothic  videogame hip-hop tunnel-scavengers that aren't quite demented enough to  be truly fun, yet crazy enough as to be totally confusi</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>It's been a good year for hip-hop joints so far this year...but not so much albums.  Lotta LPs dropping with only one or two good tracks on 'em (Cypress Hill, I'm looking in your direction...Distant Relatives is too shiny-sounding; Reflection Eternal and Wu-Massacre both got that Same Shit Different Record Syndrome...)  Is it the pressure to keep pumping out product--if it ain't blogged it ain't right?  I don't know.

<p>So Guy Fawkes over at <a href="http://illcuts.com" target="_blank">Illcuts</a> asked me to mix his side of this best of 1988 vs. best of 1994 mixtape.  I told him a duck with the right iPhone app could do what I do (I would pay money to see that.  Especially if it was wearing a fat gold chain.)  But he wasn&#8217;t having it, so I handled the &#8216;94 side.  It came out OK, but I wish I&#8217;d hunted down some shout-outs or barber shop commercials off my NYC radio tapes from that era, but time is time.  <strong><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?mmtmzkthl2m" target="_blank">You can cop the mix </a><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?mmtmzkthl2m" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;88 flipside is handled by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/djgrandman" target="_blank">DJ Grandman</a> for <a href="http://www.dotgotit.com" target="_blank">Dot Got It</a>, and though a) it was only supposed to be 10 songs, so he&#8217;s got more fire to play with than I did and b) I hate DJ drops, he <em>fucking kills that shit.</em> ATL all day, he cuts it up for real.  Like being back with a boombox pumping Chuck Chillout on a Friday night.  No question 1988 was a stronger year&#8211;classics were dropping weekly.   <a href="http://usershare.net/u2jtebns8otm" target="_blank"><strong>Get it here.</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="http://usershare.net/u2jtebns8otm" target="_blank"><strong> </strong></a></p>

<p>We lost one of the greats on April 19th.  Guru had a voice like an oak barrel of Bushmill&#8217;s lined with fine grade sandpaper.  He wasn&#8217;t bling, or gangsta, or mystical or polemical.  He just dropped gems on our melons.  He was a solid MC, and one of the best.  He had a flow that (after the first few joints) became almost metronomic on the beat, but the lyrics were so dense and well-planned&#8211;the def(t) rhyme schemes, the hanging and internal rhymes&#8211;that combined with that voice made him a great MC.  He also was a great storyteller, not something many MCs can do, and it&#8217;s too bad he didn&#8217;t do more of it.</p>
<p>Musicians&#8217; deaths always seem tragic, especially when they&#8217;re young, but even when they haven&#8217;t put out anything good for a while&#8211;because although they only cut the record once, every time we play it it&#8217;s new again; every time we play it, we&#8217;re back to the first time we listened to it.  Music defeats time in a way other art does not.  And because music is timeless and eternal, we infer immortality for musicians.</p>
<p>The Japanese regarded the Emperor as part of the godhead until after World War II, when MacArthur forced Hirohito to publicly abdicate his holy status.  A line from a Yukio Mishima poem about this goes: <em>How can the Emperor now simply be a man?</em> So how can Guru be dead?  Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is.</p>
<p>The story of hip-hop is the story of men becoming gods on the mic and the tables, gods becoming men, and sometimes dying.  It&#8217;s on some Greek tragedy shit.  Mishima&#8217;s suicide note, in its entirety, reads: <em>Human life is limited, but I would like to live forever. </em>Keith Elam is dead, but Guru lives forever.  <em>Step In The Arena </em>and <em>Hard To Earn </em>will live forever, as long as we keep listening.</p>
<p>It seems pretty stupid to cut a Guru mix when Premier and so many other world-class DJs have dropped theirs, but I had to do it.  It&#8217;s part of the hip-hop grieving process for those who don&#8217;t feel like wearing R.I.P. t-shirts.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the Overlook Hotel, because you slept there.  Also, blood coming out of the elevator.  I gotta get the maintenance guy to look at that.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a roundup of some sweet mixes I&#8217;ve been bumping lately.  All of &#8216;em are free and legal, so stay off my dick, DMCA cops.  Click the titles to download.</p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p><img title="tenshun-rs.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/zc5u8t/tenshun-rs.jpg" border="0" alt="tenshun-rs.jpg" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/4s5sia" target="_blank"><strong>Tenshun :: Scabz &amp; Bruises Mix</strong></a></p>
<p>Tenshun&#8217;s beats are sick and grimy on some <em>Natural Born Killers</em> shit.  He makes the Gaslamp Killer look like Mr. Rogers.  All his stuff is released on cassette or 7&#8243; vinyl in runs of 500 for some reason, very punk rock, but also pretty weird for 2010 where there&#8217;s 50 easy ways to get your stuff out there on the internet.  This cat, his shit is so hard, but not devolving into ear-bleeding noise, but it&#8217;s still like&#8230;</p>
<p>TENSHUN: I really like you.  I&#8217;m gonna make you a mixtape to express my love for you.</p>
<p>TENSHUN&#8217;S GIRL: That&#8217;s really sweet, but you know what?  Please don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.myspace.com/10shun" target="_blank">his very sparse Myspace</a><a href="http://www.myspace.com/10shun" target="_blank"> page</a>.</p>
<p>This mix was for <a href="http://vertebraecrew.blogspot.com/2009/12/mixestenshun-scars-and-bruises-mix.html" target="_blank">Vertebrae Records</a> and it&#8217;s a good introduction to his post-industrial turntable sound.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=IEMWPXAU" target="_blank"><strong>Tenshun :: Freestyle Mix</strong></a></p>
<p>Another grimy, deadly mix of his and other people&#8217;s ill beats, recorded in 2006.  Like I said, Tenshun&#8217;s stuff&#8217;s not readily available but you can buy it <a href="http://tenshun.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://vulgar.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/6uxffz" target="_blank"><strong>Jimmy Green :: Brooklyn Dust - The Beastie Boys Mixtape</strong></a></p>
<p>Super fresh mixtape of the Beastly Boys and their beastly toys from <a href="http://jimbojonesconveniencestore.blogspot.com/2010/02/my-beastie-boys-mixtape.html" target="_blank">Jimmy Green</a>. Not a wack track in the house.  Even better, now I don&#8217;t have to do a Beastie Boys mix.</p>
<p><img title="ThePattyHearstBeatTape.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/8968vx/ThePattyHearstBeatTape.jpg" border="0" alt="ThePattyHearstBeatTape.jpg" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p><a href="http://themechies.blogspot.com/2010/02/download-no-tracklist.html" target="_blank"><strong>Waajeed :: The Patty Hearst Beat Tape</strong></a></p>
<p>Fat, grimy beats with news samples telling the story of Patty Hearst.  Serious fire.  Via <a href="http://themechies.blogspot.com/">The Mechies</a>.</p>
<p><img title="chromemix-1.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/3r6kf8/chromemix-1.jpg" border="0" alt="chromemix-1.jpg" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p><a href="http://stonesthrow.com/jukebox/chrome-mix.mp3" target="_blank"><strong>Peanut  Butter Wolf :: Chrome Mix</strong></a></p>
<p>Dope little mixtape of Stone&#8217;s Throw  stuff from 2005, with Madlib, Guilty Simpson, Percee P, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Oh No, Aloe Blacc, Diamond D and others.</p>
<p><img title="100akres.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/iwu2mv/100akres.jpg" border="0" alt="100akres.jpg" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p><a href="http://relativesabroad.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>100 Akres :: Nas &amp; Bob Marley - Relatives Abroad</strong></a></p>
<p>While we wait to see if the Nas/Damian Marley LP is a trainwreck, Soul Train or Soul Plane, <a href="http://100akres.com/" target="_blank">100 Akres</a> has hooked up a superb 8 track mashup.  Blaze one for this.

<p>Run-DMC had the hats.  Flavor Flav had the clock.  Kool Moe Dee had those stupid wraparound sunglasses.  The Fat Boys had their, uh, fat&#8230;ness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.metalfacedoom.com/" target="_blank">DOOM</a> has the mask.  It&#8217;s iconic; maybe <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> most iconic piece of hip-hop regalia.  It&#8217;s like Van Gogh&#8217;s ear&#8211;it defines him, has only a little to do with his work, obscures the work, and everyone reads a lot into it.  But it&#8217;s that killer symbol everyone knows.  I bet you right this minute at a university somewhere, someone is typing a paper about how Doom&#8217;s mask subverts and reclaims minstrelsy (c.f. the<em> Black Bastards</em> cover; sending out impersonators is just like something Al Jolson did or some shit; and <em>&#8220;From their point of the view, we‘re the villains. But I‘m the Super-Villain. All caps.&#8221; </em>see, he&#8217;s commenting on the demonization of the Black male and blah blah blah&#8230;<em>)</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wondered why Doom overtook Kool Keith a few years ago&#8230;every time Doom puts out another re-tread/remix EP/re-release/40-minute-album-where-he&#8217;s-only-on-a-couple-of-songs everyone falls all over themselves.  Kool Keith?  Put out 3 records last year too.  Didn&#8217;t see that on everyone&#8217;s blog or in the <a href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2009/09/doom-in-new-yorker-mask-of-doom" target="_blank">goddamn New Yorker</a>.</p>
<p>See, Van Gogh and Gauguin ran tight like that.  Then Van Gogh cuts his ear off and Gauguin bops off to Tahiti and paints a bunch of naked native chicks.  And who&#8217;s got a whole museum in Amsterdam?  It ain&#8217;t the guy who painted the equivalent of <em>Sex Style</em> and <em>Bikinis N Thongs.</em></p>
<p>Granted, Doom is better at making and picking beats than Kool Keith.  He has one of the best flows in all hip-hop.  He&#8217;s got that Biggie&#8217;s-wino-uncle voice.  Lyrically though, it&#8217;s all beautifully internally rhymed total fucking nonsense.  Yeah, I said it.  <a href="http://prestonhaley.posterous.com/a-new-weekly-hiphop-inspired-series" target="_blank">Listen to this reverent spoken-word rendition and tell me otherwise</a>.  His songs rarely have a subject; they&#8217;re just clever lines strung together (even in his rhyme books, according to the  <a href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2009/09/doom-in-new-yorker-mask-of-doom" target="_blank">goddamn New Yorker</a>.)  Could be reading out his shopping list: <em>Minute Maid for the meter maid, she likes that lemonade, sour, bag up the all-purpose flour; zucchini, macaroni, pass that Rice-A-Roni. </em>(This is also true for Zack De La Rocha: <em>EGGS! AND! DON&#8217;T FORGET! THE! ENGLISH! MUUUUUUUUUUFFINS!) </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look, Ghostface and K-The-I???, to name two, also spit straight up don&#8217;t-know-what-he-said-book, but you always feel there&#8217;s meaning behind it.  With Doom, he just spits.  But as <a href="http://www.cocaineblunts.com/" target="_blank">Noz</a> pointed out, hop-hop was built on incomprehensible gibberish.  Fine.  He&#8217;s the Black John Ashbery.  It&#8217;s free association.  It&#8217;s word salad.  All caps and all tangents.  But there&#8217;s too much talent there&#8211;he could do rap&#8217;s <em>Finnegan&#8217;s Wake </em>if he wanted to.  If hip-hop is Black America&#8217;s CNN (© Chuck D)&#8211;and these days more like QVC&#8211;Doom is, obviously, Adult Swim cartoons.  All good I guess, but I guarantee that schtick is gonna get old&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So I say, Doom: take off the mask.  Give it to us from the heart. Peep it:</p>

		<itunes:summary>Run-DMC had the hats.  Flavor Flav had the clock.  Kool Moe Dee had those stupid wraparound sunglasses.  The Fat Boys had their, uh, fat...ness.

DOOM has the mask.  It's iconic; maybe the most iconic piece of hip-hop regalia.  It's like Van Gogh's ear--it defines him, has only a little to do with his work, obscures the work, and everyone reads a lot into it.  But it's that killer symbol everyone knows.  I bet you right this minute at a university somewhere, someone is typing a paper about how Doom's mask subverts and reclaims minstrelsy (c.f. the Black Bastards cover; sending out impersonators is just like something Al Jolson did or some shit; and "From their point of the view, we‘re the villains. But I‘m the Super-Villain. All caps." see, he's commenting on the demonization of the Black male and blah blah blah...).

I've wondered why Doom overtook Kool Keith a few years ago...every time Doom puts out another re-tread/remix EP/re-release/40-minute-album-where-he's-only-on-a-couple-of-songs everyone falls all over themselves.  Kool Keith?  Put out 3 records last year too.  Didn't see that on everyone's blog or in the goddamn New Yorker.

See, Van Gogh and Gauguin ran tight like that.  Then Van Gogh cuts his ear off and Gauguin bops off to Tahiti and paints a bunch of naked native chicks.  And who's got a whole museum in Amsterdam?  It ain't the guy who painted the equivalent of Sex Style and Bikinis N Thongs.

Granted, Doom is better at making and picking beats than Kool Keith.  He has one of the best flows in all hip-hop.  He's got that Biggie's-wino-uncle voice.  Lyrically though, it's all beautifully internally rhymed total fucking nonsense.  Yeah, I said it.  Listen to this reverent spoken-word rendition and tell me otherwise.  His songs rarely have a subject; they're just clever lines strung together (even in his rhyme books, according to the  goddamn New Yorker.)  Could be reading out his shopping list: Minute Maid for the meter maid, she likes that lemonade, sour, bag up the all-purpose flour; zucchini, macaroni, pass that Rice-A-Roni. (This is also true for Zack De La Rocha: EGGS! AND! DON'T FORGET! THE! ENGLISH! MUUUUUUUUUUFFINS!)

So I say, Doom: take off the mask.  Give it to us from the heart. Peep it:


Q: Has anything ever come close to equaling how you felt when Scott LaRock died, and then Subroc died?

Doom: Everything else is grey. 
Q: Why don‘t you just put out an album that says, Shit is fucked up for twenty-something people of color? Why go through the mask and the characters and outer space?

Doom: Can‘t say it like that. Out here it‘s been so desensitized, that‘s not going to... everybody just turns their back on that shit. I had to figure out a way to get the point across, still make it interesting without making it corny, or making it seem like a race thing. 



Oh.  Right.  Which explains the three-headed outerspace monster Ghidra thing.  You might wanna work on that, Doomy.

Whatever.  Don't overthink it, let the fat guy with the mask do his thing.  The flow is too sick to hate on.

So here we gots some remixes, official and unofficial, released and unreleased.  Big ups to PSY/OPSogist for hooking me up some new ones; props to the Sleepy 5 Orchestra and sorry I couldn't jam your Hoe Cakes in there.

So it turns out that &#8216;dubbing a chicken&#8217; is an actual livestock thing, where you cut off its comb and wattles so they don&#8217;t get frostbite. (That&#8217;s those red crinkly things on their heads.)  Who knew?  The guy at Ultimate Fowl Blog, that&#8217;s who.

		<itunes:summary>Yeah, we all liked Cuban Linx 2 and Born Like This (even Time magazine and the New Yorker showed them love, for Christ's sake). But there was a lot of other freshness this year you might have slept on.  There's many styles in hip hop these days...lotta fingers but it's all one fist.  So many, it's maybe three or four fists.  Punching you!  Right in the fucking piehole!

<p>DJ Spooky, a.k.a. That Subliminal Kid, has got his own iPhone app: <em></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;JG Ballard once said &#8216;history is a stage that needs to be swept clean.&#8217; I agree. When I first heard Grand Master Flash&#8217;s &#8216;Adventures on the Wheels of Steel&#8217; from 1981, I was blown away. Afrika Bambaata&#8217;s &#8216;Death Mix&#8217; was cool, but Flash took things in a whole different direction&#8230;</em><em>Through the prism of my new album &#8220;The Secret Song&#8221; and the app on my cell phone, I just wanted to show how you can rock a party using material from your iTunes library and mix it with your record collection&#8230;Check it and enjoy - remember - it&#8217;s from a cell phone, and records mixed!!!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Talk about clearing the stage, eh!? With mobile media, there is NO stage, it&#8217;s basically about creativity, on the spot, anywhere, anytime&#8230; Check the frequencies!!! You can download the mix from <a href="http://www.djspooky.com/media/infinite_abstraction_2009_12_10_mix_tape.mp3.zip" target="_blank">HERE </a>&#8230;And you can download the App from <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dj-spooky-the-secret-song/id333379657?mt=8" target="_blank">HERE</a></em></p>
<p>No word on whether the app also allows you to GPS-locate grad school girls who get wet down there when you mention Flash and JG Ballard in the same sentence.</p>
<p>The mix has some good shit on it; it&#8217;s a lot better than Spooky&#8217;s latest, <em>The Secret Song</em>, which is not-so-secretly ass.  Spooky&#8217;s problem increasingly is he&#8217;s all:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;it isnʼt really an album: itʼs a manifesto about the place of history in our modern collaged, scrambled, sampla-delic to the core, mega info overloaded digital culture. With references stretching from Thorstein Veblenʼs “Theory of the Leisure Class” and John Maynard Keynes classic in the ﬁeld of economics “The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money” over to hip hopʼs relationship to psychoanalysis and a la Edward Bernayʼs concept of the “manufacture of consent&#8221;&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em>and he keeps going on and on, and on, and on.  People listen to music because it sounds good, not because you&#8217;ve got pomo game.  Spooky: I got love for you, but when I&#8217;m checking your tracks, my man, <em>I can&#8217;t hear the fucking footnotes.</em></p>
<p>Not to over dis.  Spooky&#8217;s made some great records, and he&#8217;s got <a href="http://www.soundunbound.com/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.rhythmscience.com/" target="_blank">books</a> out which look pretty interesting&#8230;though I&#8217;m always a sucker for academic hip hop tomes, even though they&#8217;re usually lame (Michael Eric Dyson, your three names can&#8217;t save you.)</p>
<p>Anyway, in 2010 I predict we&#8217;ll see additional hip-hop iPhone apps, like:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>MF DOOM LYRIC GENERATOR</strong>: Randomly uses a wifi rhyming dictionary, Little Rascals dialogue, and key words like &#8216;meter maid&#8217;, &#8216;pancake,&#8217; &#8216;catsup&#8217;, and &#8216;hoogly-moogly&#8217; to create authentic-sounding Doom lyrics.  If it ain&#8217;t incomprehensible, it ain&#8217;t Doom!</li>
<li><strong>WU-PHONE</strong>: Only Built 4 3GS&#8230;the first smartphone designed by the Wu-Tang Clan. Features Weed Carrier Locator app, iPinky Ring, VirtualDirtyBastard, Raekwon the Chef restaurant locator, and MicrosoftGZA for Wu-Phone.  Fully compatible with Bobby Digital.</li>
<li><strong>iBEEF</strong>: Tracks the latest meaningless rapper beefs from Twitter, Facebook and MySpace feeds.  Get alerts on who&#8217;s calling who a crying little bitch, instantly!</li>
<li><strong>SCARPHACE</strong>: Did you know that there&#8217;s 6.7 seconds of Scarface dialogue that hasn&#8217;t been sampled yet? Find it and drop it into your latest track! (Pacino 2.1 or higher required)</li>
<li><strong>TWIGGA</strong>: This is what Busta Rhymes calls his Twitter followers.  Seriously.</li>
</ol>

That way, if a conflict becomes  necessary, it can be a proxy conflict, thus limiting Jay-Z&#8217;s  vulnerability. And given Jay-Z&#8217;s hegemonic role in the hip-hop world,  there are plenty of talented rappers who&#8217;d happily take up his battles  in return for his eventual favor.&#8221;</em></span></span></p>

<p>In honor of <em>The Seventh Seal</em> dropping-any-minute-now-really-honestly-really-it&#8217;s-coming-out-this-time, here&#8217;s some remixes and rare cuts.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the deal with Rakim?  Greatest MC of all time to anyone not fucked in the head.  Your favorite rapper&#8217;s favorite rapper.  Originator of spiritual MCing and the internal rhyme scheme.  And no new album in ten years.</p>
<p>Reading the few interviews around, all I can tell is: the death of his father really messed him up; he&#8217;s enjoying raising his kids; and Dre really jerked him around.  I&#8217;d bet he also has a really, really bad manager, probably his goofy brother-in-law or something.  I mean, what label is gonna turn down The God Himself?!</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m wondering how come the album is late.  Maybe he&#8217;s giving us time to get the last six straight.</p>
<p>The Coronation of Rakhnaten (Opening Ceremony) / I Know You Got Soul (Dub) / Put Your Hands Together (Parkside Mix) / As the Rhyme Goes On (Pumpin&#8217; the Turbo - Chad Jay In Effect) / Follow The Leader (RJD2 Remix) / Complicatem (Pass The Hand Grenade Pt 2) / You Don&#8217;t Fool Me / Bring It (Turn It Up) / Casualties Of War (Jazz Version) / Don&#8217;t Sweat The Technique (Original) / Let The Rhythm Hit ‘Em (Brixton Upso Mix) / Heat It Up / Run (Freestyle) / Last Resort (a.k.a.

<p>Nas has released 10 albums in 15 years, but everyone pisses and moans because 9 of them weren&#8217;t <em>Illmatic</em>. That&#8217;s like hating on George Washington Carver for not inventing something better than peanut butter.</p>
<p>Compared to a lot of MCs, Nas is still dropping steady heat (Exhibit A: &#8220;Queens Get The Money&#8221;).  But really though, every album has some weak tracks&#8211;and not just the horrible, horrible radio singles.  Nas&#8217; problem has always been beats.</p>
<p>A solo rapper lacks the consistency a DJ brings to the sound and keeps the ego in check&#8211;the strength has always been in the triumvirate (Run-DMC, Cypress Hill) or the duo (Gang Starr, Eric B. &amp; Rakim) or the everyone-into-the-phone-booth-thing (The Roots, Wu-Tang). Relying on beats-for-hire has made Nas&#8217; direction waver all over the place; it&#8217;s that lack of a defined sound that makes people hate. Every Cypress Hill record is pretty much the same (just in ever-decreasing quality); every Nas record is different. To me, that&#8217;s a strength.  It&#8217;s just too bad he didn&#8217;t hook up with the right DJ early on and drop steady solid.  When he does pick a good beat, it&#8217;s fire.  When he doesn&#8217;t&#8230;that&#8217;s when the remixers step up.</p>
<p>So here we got an hour&#8217;s worth of Nas remixes, freestyles and unreleased cuts. Peep it.</p>

Compared to a lot of MCs, Nas is still dropping steady heat (Exhibit A: "Queens Get The Money").  But really though, every album has some weak tracks--and not just the horrible, horrible radio singles.  Nas' problem has always been beats.

A solo rapper lacks the consistency a DJ brings to the sound and keeps the ego in check--the strength has always been in the triumvirate (Run-DMC, Cypress Hill) or the duo (Gang Starr, Eric B. &#x38; Rakim) or the everyone-into-the-phone-booth-thing (The Roots, Wu-Tang). Relying on beats-for-hire has made Nas' direction waver all over the place; it's that lack of a defined sound that makes people hate. Every Cypress Hill record is pretty much the same (just in ever-decreasing quality); every Nas record is different. To me, that's a strength.  It's just too bad he didn't hook up with the right DJ early on and drop steady solid.  When he does pick a good beat, it's fire.  When he doesn't...that's when the remixers step up.

So here we got an hour's worth of Nas remixes, freestyles and unreleased cuts. Peep it.

<p>Really though, &#8220;The Message&#8221; is the well from where all conscious hip hop flows.  27 years later the beat is still tight.  The lyrics drop some serious poetical gems.  It&#8217;s real art and therefore eternal.</p>

But I guess nothing rhymes with things like 'pancreas.'   Except...blancreas.

Really though, "The Message" is the well from where all conscious hip hop flows.  27 years later the beat is still tight.  The lyrics drop some serious poetical gems.  It's real art and therefore eternal.

The Message - Grandmaster Flash &#x38; The Furious Five / Hard Times - Run-D.M.C., Vordul Mega, Onra, Baby Huey / In The Ghetto - Eric B. &#x38; Rakim / Ghetto Misfortune's Wealth - The 24 Carat Black / Dead Homiez - Ice Cube / I Been There - KRS-One / Streetlamp Confessions - WindNbreeze, Cryptic One &#x38; Alaska / Minimum Wage - Redshield / Rent Control - Super Chron Flight Brothers / A Tribute to Melle Mel - Breez Evahflowin / The Message - Nas / The Message (Remix Suite) - Roots Manuva, Cutting Edge, Ice Cube, Richie Rich, El-P, Mobb Deep, Willy Maso</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a new breed of DJ emerging in the subterranean.  In the mainstream, you have these cats making their name off of mixtapes of the latest shitty, ringtone gangstaism nonsense, where they yell their stupid name every 3 seconds with some dumb-ass sound effect.  (Hey, mixtape DJs: you know who thinks the sound of whooshing fighter jets is really cool?  Six year old boys. And what&#8217;s with the air raid siren? Is that like the only other sound effect you have? Are you reppin&#8217; the Blitz? What&#8217;s the story?)</p>
<p>But underground there&#8217;s a new breed emerging.  Like C.H.U.D.s with Technics.  Technichuds?  Whatever, these cats are killing it.  They&#8217;re creating whole soundscapes out of other people&#8217;s tunes, ones which are thoughtful, engaging, rocking, playful, explorative, fascinating, and just plain dope as fuck.  What they&#8217;re doing is long-wave sampling.</p>
<p>Originally DJs took just the best breaks to make records.  Then you had a limitation on the early samplers of 8 seconds or something, so samples got shorter.  Innovators like the Bomb Squad started taking minute slices and making songs with them; RZA took this to another level by using isolated shards of funk.  By legal necessity samples got shook, shrunk, sliced and diced.</p>
<p>These cats do it galaxy-size.  They make cohesive hour-long songs out of other people&#8217;s breaks, songs, movies, what have you.  They&#8217;re not constrained by genre or style or legality.  If it&#8217;s dope, if it fits, it goes in.  Just as old school DJs soaked the labels off their vinyl so no one could jack their breaks, these DJs mix it and lump it and don&#8217;t show off their tracklistings.  Just like when DJs use a sample or a break you recognize but can&#8217;t quite put your finger on right away, these cats do it with songs.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re jumping off from the mixes Steinski, Coldcut and Cut Chemist did, but using a wider variety of stuff, and using the newer, iller sounds that are around&#8211;the illbient, sneakergazer, dubstep, all that other unclassifiable shit.</p>
<p>They ain&#8217;t doing compilations and this ain&#8217;t your Spring Break Party Mix or your Mixtape For Girl I Want To Screw.  This is DJ art in album-length.  I will never be as good as these cats.  I will study them.  I will try to do what they do.  I will ape them.  I will fail.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna talk about Dday One&#8217;s new approach to jazz/hip-hop and Gaslamp Killer&#8217;s fusion of hip-hop, eclecticism and serial killer stylee another time.  But today it&#8217;s DJ Pain.</p>
<p><img title="djpain.jpg" src="http://elmattic.podbean.com/mf/web/49hx8/djpain.jpg" border="0" alt="djpain.jpg" height="250" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Pain brings down a serious vibe, not as heavy as Gaslamp Killer but there&#8217;s a definite hardness and weight to his beats. All of his shit appears to be free, so there&#8217;s no excuse not to check &#8216;em out. His scratching is Grade Fuckin&#8217; A. His mixing is seamless&#8211;you just can&#8217;t hear quite where one song goes into another. He drops some seriously ill samples, mostly movies but just enough hip-hop signifying that you don&#8217;t go, &#8216;wait, this is a bunch of arty Ninja Tunes type of electronic crap.&#8217; I think he&#8217;s dropping beats in there, too, because the beats are superb and hard-ass, and if he&#8217;s actually crate-digging that much ill, moody stuff with such ill beats, well, I want those crates.</p>
<p><strong>The Day The Earth Stood Still </strong>samples a bunch from the original flick, not the dumbass Keanu remake, on top of sick beats.  It&#8217;s almost exhausting, it brings you through so many moods. This is maybe the absolute strongest. Get it <a href="http://www.mrtrick.net/?p=175" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Road To Oblivion</strong> brings the nuclear heat, with samples from <em>Wargames, Miracle Mile, The Day After,</em> Bay of Pigs interviews, and other shit.  Let me put it like this: He drops in samples from those Bush State of the Union remixes I ran earlier over what sounds like a Prefuse73 or Four Tet beat, then drops the beat for a Meryl Streep in <em>Adaptation</em> sample.  Get it <a href="http://www.rhythm-incursions.com/2007/04/24/dj-pain-road-to-oblivion/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hermanos Del Pulpo</strong> (which means brüder der krake or 章鱼的兄弟, for my Chinese brethren) with DJ Chaps One. This one is the weakest, I think, much more eclectic in bringing in rock and more straight electronic type stuff. Enough good shit on there to curse the lack of a tracklist though&#8230;  Get it <a href="http://www.rhythm-incursions.com/2008/06/09/dj-pain-is-back-exclusive-new-mix-to-download/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Odd Side of the Sun</strong> is a megamix of Odd Nosdam beats.  If you like Odd Nosdam, this is like fucking manna.  If you hate Odd Nosdam, well, it&#8217;s probably like sticking a dentist&#8217;s drill in your ear for an hour.  I have to say a lot of it I didn&#8217;t recognize, which might be the weaker ON tracks I&#8217;ve ditched, but he does do some good mixing with it and brings in that large, distorted fuzz-beat sound. Maybe not the strongest outing though. Get it <a href="http://www.rhythm-incursions.com/2009/01/19/dj-pain-the-odd-side-of-the-sun/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>You know what, there&#8217;s not all that much I can say about these except drop a bunch of adjectives, &#8216;cuz he doesn&#8217;t do tracklistings and I can only pick out a few breaks here and there.  If you like that weird, heavy instrumental shit with proper hip-hop flavor, check it.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways these DJs are hipsters of a kind, on the underground, totally eclectic and crate diggin&#8217;, but there&#8217;s something egoless and humbling about being a DJ: you can only be so egotistical when you only speak with your hands, only be so pretentious in crafting a good mix.</p>
