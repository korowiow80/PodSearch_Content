			<title>OnceUponAWorld-Jesus feeds 5000</title>
			<itunes:author>Robert Duncan and John Le Mesurier</itunes:author>
			<description>The apostles asked all the people what they had. No one had anything, except one small boy who had five loaves of bread and two small fishes.

That won&apos;t go very far,&apos; one of the apostles said. &apos;That will only feed two of us.&apos; Jesus looked up, &apos;We&apos;ll feed everyone here, all five thousand of them.&apos;</description>

			<title>OnceUponAWorld-The Ten Dos and Donts</title>
			<itunes:author>Robert Duncan and John Le Mesurier</itunes:author>
			<description>Moses walked through the mighty storm, up the mountain towards God.
The children of Israel watched the lone figure staggering into the blackness, as the thunder and lightning raged. God said, &apos;I am your God, come to me.&apos;
Moses got to the top, and God told him ten things to remember. They were the ten things that make a good or bad person. They were called The Ten Commandments. </description>

			<itunes:author>Robert Duncan and John Le Mesurier</itunes:author>
			<description>When Jesus really started teaching people about God and Heaven, he chose some men to travel with him. They were called the disciples. You probably won&apos;t remember all their names, but here are some of them - Simon, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, who were also brothers. As they all journeyed together, Jesus did lots of wonderful things called miracles - things that no on else could ever do. We know how he did them, don&apos;t we? God helped him.</description>

She was having a few minutes rest when suddenly and angel appeared. &apos;Are you Mary?&apos; he asked. &apos;Yes, who are you?&apos; the startled girl replied. &apos;I am an angel from God, and I have a surprise for you - you&apos;re going to have a baby.&apos; Mary raised her hand to her mouth. &apos;It would be a surprise, I&apos;m not even married.&apos;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
