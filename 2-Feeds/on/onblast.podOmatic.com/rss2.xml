    <link>http://onblast.podomatic.com</link>
    <description>On Blast is an organizing tool for the Philadelphia Student Union. We know that all young people can be leaders. We know that students have deep analysis about their schools and communities. We know that young people's voices need to be heard before real structural change can take place. At On Blast, we choose subject matter that amplifies the voices of those not being heard-- especially young people-- and those who are routinely hurt and misrepresented by the dominant media. We are using media to organize &amp; liberate.</description>

      <title>Students Tell Gov. Corbett: Education is a Human Right. Fund it that Way.</title>

This action came a week after  Gov. Corbett announced his plan for the  next state budget -- a proposal that would carry over last year's $1 billion cuts to education funding. Students  demanded that Gov. Corbett restores the cuts and makes equitable school funding be a  top priority in the next state budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action was organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://phillystudentunion.org&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Student Union&lt;/a&gt;, Project Peace, Chester student leaders, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Students-Engaged-in-Leadership/337819350434&quot;&gt;A+ Schools' TeenBloc&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Should all students wear school uniforms?</title>

But this is not the case across the country, as many rural and suburban districts have yet to require them. On Blast hit the streets of Philadelphia to ask people one question: Should all students have to wear school uniforms? We got some interesting answers from youth, parents and grandparents. While some folks feel that uniforms reduce conflicts, others feel that they stifle young people's self expression. 

This vox pop was recorded by Amirah Williams, Greg Jordan-Detamore and Justyn Williams.</description>

Restorative practices, on the other hand, offer an opportunity to repair &amp;amp; move forward after a problem arises, keeping more students engaged in their education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For almost a decade, &lt;a href=&quot;http://padresunidos.org/ending-school-jail-track&quot;&gt;Padres y J&amp;oacute;venes Unidos&lt;/a&gt; (Parents and Youth United) have been working to change the school system in Denver, Colorado by implementing restorative practices instead of zero tolerance policies. The parents and students organizing to make these changes succeeded in winning a new discipline policy for their school district. After a year of this new policy, which guarantees students' rights, schools have seen dramatic improvements in school climate and a large reduction of violent incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Jones interviewed &lt;span id=&quot;redesign_default&quot;&gt;Lalo Montoya (pictured)&lt;/span&gt; of Padres y J&amp;oacute;venes Unidos to learn more about their strategies and successes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After a year of this new policy, which guarantees students' rights, schools have seen dramatic improvements in school climate and a large reduction of violent incidents.
Dan Jones interviewed Lalo Montoya (pictured) of Padres y J&amp;oacute;venes Unidos to learn more about their strategies and successes.</itunes:summary>

      <title>What's the biggest problem with Philadelphia public schools?</title>

There were a lot of different thoughts about the problems and the solutions for our school district. Students took these answers and created this Vox Pop. Listen and see if you agree with what Philly residents had to say.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Students Stand with Taxi Workers</title>

Instead, they were met with handcuffs and were immediately detained. There are still four drivers being held.

This kind of harassment, especially when looked at alongside the long hours and constant mistreatment faced by taxi drivers, constitutes a form of structural violence similar to the kind faced by young people in our schools and communities.

Rising Freshman and Student Union member Shania Morris spoke at a prayer vigil held for the detained drivers.</description>

      <title>Statewide Connections: Bringing Harrisburg Students into our Campaigns</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_2988516.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members of PSU recently traveled to Harrisburg PA to meet with students from Harrisburg's William Penn High School and engage them in our Campaign for Nonviolent Schools and our Campaign for Equitable School Funding. We led a participatory workshop that explored the root causes of violence in our schools and communities. We also talked about conditions inside our schools, and students from both Philly and Harrisburg agreed that underfunding of schools is a root cause of many of the problems we face. By sharing our experiences, students came to the realization the problems we see in our schools are not isolated to our own districts; that the struggle for a high quality education is a statewide struggle. 

In this piece, we hear from some Harrisburg students about how they view violence and how the Nonviolence workshop changed their perceptions of this issue. Cherelle Reed conducted the interviews, Justin Carter recorded the narration, and Greg Jordan-Detamore edited this piece. </description>

      <title>Temple Nurses Defend their Kids'  Futures</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_2918233.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals (PASNAP) have been striking for several weeks, in order to win a fair contract from Temple University Hospital. One of the main points of contention is that Temple abrubtly took away the tuition reimbursement for nurses' despite the fact that the benefits are part of their current contract. The tuition reimbursement benefit meant that nurses' children could go to Temple University without paying tuition. For many nurses, losing this benefit would be make it very difficult -or even impossible- for their kids to attend college. Gregory Jordan-Detamore spoke with several PASNAP members about how their families are being affected by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: On Wednesday, April 28th, the strike ended with &lt;a href=&quot;http://phillylabor.org/victory-temple-nurses&quot;&gt;a victory&lt;/a&gt;. PASNAP scored major contract concessions on what Temple University Health Services had billed as their &quot;last, best and final offer&quot; and ended their strike. In terms of tuition reimbursement, there was a partial victory. Children and dependents of PASNAP members will receive tuition reimbursements for 6 credits per semester at Temple University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Justin Carter, a member of PSU and a senior at West Philadelphia HS, spoke to the crowd about the connections between students' struggles &amp; nurses' struggles. He called attention to the problems with the 'gag clause' that Temple is trying to put on nurses, saying, &quot;Just like students have the right to speak out about the conditions in our schools, nurses have the right to speak out about  the working conditions in their hospitals.&quot;

      <title>Making Music to Tackle the Drop Out Crisis</title>

The album tells the story of one student who is dealing with Philadelphia's nearly 50% drop out rate. After finishing the cd, students helped design a curriculum that teachers and others can use along with the cd to talk about the drop out crisis. The curriculum engages young people, helps them identify the root causes of why so many students are dropping out, and talks about student-driven solutions.&amp;nbsp; This new curriculum is being used in some of Philly's classrooms and community centers, but PSU is still working towards our goal of copying and distributing the CD to over a thousand public high school students. Visit PSU's &lt;em&gt;Movement &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music &lt;/em&gt;page to listen to the songs or make a donation that will go towards the next album that students will be producing this summer: http://home.phillystudentunion.org/Student-Programs/Soundtrack-Donations-mp3.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this piece, Candace Carter and Koby Murphy talk about the process of writing and recording &lt;em&gt;Pushed Out&lt;/em&gt;. This piece was recorded by Lawrence Jones Mahoney and produced by Othella Stanback.&lt;/p&gt;

This means that, if West is selected as a Renaissance school, West could be subject to 'turnaround' reforms and possibly outside managers.&amp;nbsp; Since West already has a plan for whole school transformation, one that students and community members have spent years working towards (and that has already had big positive effects on the school climate), many people are concerned about what the Renaissance process could mean for the school.

His speech was well received by the members of the School Reform Commission, and Dr. Ackerman stated that she wanted to meet with students to discuss these issues further and learn more about the campaign. This is a successful next step to what began on MLK Day, when 600+ people from all walks of life took the first step towards creating a just and peaceful school system.

We'll also learn about the groundbreaking of the new West Philadelphia High School, and the work that students have done to reach this milestone. PSU members also bring us a report-back from the School District's Renaissance School feedback sessions, and what we can expect from the Renaissance schools plan in 2010. Also, we hear a piece about how the media covers violence at neighborhood and magnet schools differently, which often reinforces stereotypes. Plus, we'll have music and other education news.

The process started in 2003 when Superintendent Paul Vallas announced that there would be a new building. Since then, students have spearheaded a community process that has included over 200 people (community members, faith based organizations, parents, local representatives, and politicians.)

In this piece, two South Philly High students describe the attacks that hospitalized several of their friends, and their feeling that adults in the school district have let them down. 

A few days after these interviews took place, the boycott ended and students returned to SPHS. But students --both SPHS students &amp; PSU members-- are continuing to work toward holding the district accountable and solving the root problems of this violence.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_2123333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show has several segments, plus news headlines and music. One segment is from the B'more Fair in Baltimore, a march for the rights of workers in the Inner Harbor, organized by the United Workers Association. Another story is about the community struggle to keep William Penn High School from being closed. There is also a piece about how we are taught in school versus how we learn best. Finally, there is a segment (which includes Khalif Dobson's testimony from a School Reform Commission meeting) about the struggle to stop our schools from being privatized.

This show was hosted by Azeem, Amber, Simone, Matt, Cherelle, Candace &amp; Dan.</description>

      <title>How We Learn Best vs. How We Are Taught In School </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_1992799.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this piece, several PSU members were interviewed about how they learn best, and about how that is different from how they are taught in school. Their answers are very insightful, and clearly show why so many students dislike school and do not find it to be very educational. This piece also offers clues as to how we can improve things.

      <title>Community Wins Demand for Reinvestment in Wiliam Penn High School</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_1985163.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months ago, when the school district first announced that it would be closing William Penn HS, almost no one doubted that that would be the case. However, thanks to the quick and effective organizing of the community around William Penn, the school is going to remain open and there is a new plan to turn it into a cutting edge career and technical school.

The building, located on Broad and Master Sts., is on prime real estate for developers, and there was a lot of pressure to close it so it could be put up for sale. However, the strong and organized messages put forth by the Committee to Revitalize William Penn made it clear that the district could not get away with ignoring the school's problems for decades and then saying that is was too much to fix.

Congratulations to everyone involved in the campaign to reinvest in William Penn High School!

This piece was narrated by Candace Carter and recorded by Dan Jones for On Blast Radio with the Philly Student Union.</description>

      <title>Private Manager Contracts Renewed Over Community Protest</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_1980016.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 17th, the School Reform Commission voted 3-1 to renew the contracts with all of the private managers running schools in the district. This vote came over loud protest from community groups including the Philadelphia Student Union, who pointed out that there is no proof that the management organizations (EMOs) have been working, and that in fact, many studies point to the opposite. There has been a lot of pressure from the state legislature to renew the contracts, many of which were already operating on a one year probation renewal.

Commissioner Heidi Ramirez was the only dissenting voice against renewal: She also noted that the proof of the effectiveness of EMOs just isn't there.

EMOs have failed thousands of students for 7 years now. At what point do we demand accountability from them and from their supporters in Harrisburg?</description>

      <title>The B'MORE FAIR!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_1895135.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late April, the Baltimore based human rights organizing group United Workers Association held a major human rights march and protest to announce the worst of the worst of the employers in Baltimore's Inner Harbor. 

The Inner Harbor is a major tourist hot spot, with a lot of restaurants and shops. However, despite the apparent affluence of the Harbor, the workers there are treated with a total lack of respect for their humanity. The United Workers Association, fresh off of their recent victory at the Camden Yards baseball field, is leading the charge in organizing these workers to demand their basic human rights.

Student Union was a part of a Philadelphia delegation of over 65 people that helped to support and cover the event.</description>

      <title>Dear District &amp; Teacher's Union, Please make teacher equity a top priority</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_1874590.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 24th, PSU rallied in front of the School District, then traveled to the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers (PFT) and rallied there too. We had the same message for them both: Teacher Quality &amp; Equity Need to be the Top Priority in the Teachers' Contracts!

Here are some of the specific things we want to see in the contract:
1.  Incentive grants to attract experienced teachers to hard-to-staff schools.
2.  Full site selection.
3.  Performance standards and evaluations for teachers, developed in collaboration with teachers.
4.  Teacher-driven professional development.

      <title>Students Stand Up Against Imagine 2014 Plan, Propose Real Solutions</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_1654271.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last week of February, students from each of PSU's chapters held an action to respond to the District's plan, Imagine 2014. This plan is directly based off Renaissance 2010, the Chicago plan for closing and taking over low-performing schools. 

We know that closing schools or having them taken over by Charter Management Organizations or EMOs (private companies) is not the answer for fixing our schools. So at this action we presented a different vision for empowering students and communities to really transform our schools. 

This audio for this piece was recorded by Amendu Evans (SEIU 32BJ) and Kistine Carolan (Media Mobilizing Project). The piece was produced by Candace Carter, PSU.</description>

      <title>Without a Trace: Searching for Students in Teachers' Contract Negotiations</title>

We believe that one solution to this problem is the use of teacher incentive grants, which would help keep qualified teachers at 'hard-to-staff' schools.  Audio from this action was recorded by Amber Felton and Andrew Perez, and produced by Greg Jordan Detamore.

      <title>&quot;We Come Here to Learn, Not to Get Beat&quot;: Students Respond to the Sayre 'Riot'</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_1275929.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 17th, there was an incident at Sayre high school in which 50 police officers brutalized Sayre students. Twenty-two students were arrested as a result of this and one student was hospitalized for several days, yet none of the police officers were reprimanded. 

The press reported that this &quot;riot&quot; was caused by unruly young people. But Sayre students believe that the real root causes include a poor learning environment, isolation of students, lack of community, students' day to day frustration of being in an underfunded school, negative perceptions of neighborhood school students and a tense relationship between students and school police.

On October 9th, Philadelphia Student Union held a press conference in front of Sayre to bring the truth about this so-called &quot;riot&quot; to light. This piece was produced by Dan Jones and Matt Johnson.

PSU's organizing and lobbying efforts also helped put a new funding formula in place; a formula that is based on what students in each district actually need. 
 
Dan Jones spoke to Vince Gordon, School Board Director for Upper Darby, about what the new funding has meant for his district and what we need to do to make sure we get the future increases our schools need.</description>

      <title>&quot;I Don't Want to Be For Sale&quot;: Fighting Privatization of Our Schools</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1154317/600x600_1275937.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story was produced in winter '08, when private companies (EMO's) were running 38 Philly public schools and were trying to get control of more. Now, after months of organizing and outreach by PSU, EMO's lost their control of 6 schools and are on probation for 20 more schools...which means that they will lose their contracts if they don't show major improvements. In this piece, students explore the problems with privatization. Produced by Lawrence Jones Mahoney, Dan Jones, Eric Yates &amp; Matt Johnson</description>
