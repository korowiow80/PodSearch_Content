   <title>Ravecast - Raven von Castenstein: Time Traveller &amp; Johnny Depp Look-alike PART 1</title>
   <description>Here&apos;s the plan... you click this link. It&apos;s a picture:&#13;&#10;http://www.onlinegamingradio.com/wp-content/gallery/staff-whatever-gallery/Leonai%20DarkOrbit%20train.jpg&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Then you look at it and listen to this episode of the Ravecast from the perspective of a time-traveler from the year 2073. Your one clue from the past is this picture, which you know will be taken at some point during this show. Your mission is to observe, to not interfere with the show. When the picture is taken, you&apos;ll finally have discovered its meaning... and with it, you will have discovered something important about yourself. It&apos;s very touching. Also, there&apos;s a big explosion at the end, then you travel back to your own time and you&apos;re welcomed as a hero, later to become president.</description>

   <title>The Ravecast of RECKONING (dun dun DUMM) PART 3</title>
   <description>Part 1 Leonai art &amp; Luxx talk about the console-PC war and a bit about SPORE. &#13;&#10;Part 2 Leonai is replaced by Arnie who was also known as &quot;He Who Displays Peanuts and Must Not Be Named&quot;. That is, until he actually named himself. I hadn&apos;t counted on that. We give some newbie Warhammer talk including some first impressions on our favorite areas in the game.&#13;&#10;Hakuto calls in later and if you weren&apos;t sick of WAR by PART 3. He gives a bit of extra detailed information about some of the classes and the tradeskill system.</description>

   <title>Design &amp; Conquer Interviews Brett from TimeGate Studios</title>
   <description>Tonights show will be a little different. Sheyla and I had the pleasure to interview Brett Norton from TimeGate Studios Brett is the Lead Designer for TimeGate. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The show focused on game design and many of the elements of games design within TimeGate (makes sense, he works there  ). TimeGate has Section 8 coming out. Also, they have done numerous things with F.E.A.R. and won numerous game of the year awards.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;We recorded this interview for tonights show. So, Sheyla and I will start out live and then go to the interview with Brett. At the end of the interview Sheyla and myself will then chat live some more.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Brett sent out this kind follow-up email to Sheyla and I;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Thanks again for the airtime Doug. I had a lot of fun. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As a followup to one of your questions, I&amp;#8217;d thought I&amp;#8217;d also mention I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to a few other games that might make it out in 2008:&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;· Samba De Amigo for the Wii (huge Samba fan, owned the Maracas on Dreamcast)&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;· Fallout 3 (although I hope it&amp;#8217;s more Fallout and less Elder Scrolls)&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;· Project Origin (I liked FEAR and I worked on it)&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;· Aliens: Colonial Marines (because I still love Alien(s))&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Thanks again, and good luck with your show. Let TG know if we can help you guys out in the future.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;I would like to thank Brett, Shawn (the guy who made it happen), Jason (he knows why), and all the rest of the folks at TimeGate that let Brett educate us about game design.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Join for a wonderful interview and fun time. Shows starts tonight at 8pm Eastern and goes until 10pm. Its on every Thursday night from 8-10pm Eastern&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Guntar &amp; Sheyla&#13;&#10;Design &amp; Conquer&#13;&#10;__________________</description>

   <title>The Ravecast - Aug 10, 2007</title>
   <description>Back from Fanfaire, Leonai_art and Luxx are still buzzing from their experience at the convention.  It was an awesome experience and theyre still sharing - but tonight is a bit of a different experience as The Ravecast hosts are joined by 2 members of a fan-driven radio station for the Matrix Online called RMC: Terminal.  Havocide, Co-Producer and DJ ArchDuke join the show and express their experience not only at Fanfaire, but also answer some particulars about what its like to play The Matrix Online as well as running a radio that is specifically dedicated to just one game.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Havocide offered several beta keys that he had picked up at the SOE Fanfaire which were given away during the second half of the show.  Due to the nature of the recording, we arent going to be posting the second half.</description>

Special guests included: Gethani (OGR), Rock from Unrest, Monte from Unrest, Luxx from Unrest, and Korran.</description>

   <description>This week we had quite an uproar about the new tradeskills they put in with Echoes of Faydwer. We brought Mheryl and Valendur on with us to discuss their experiences with tinkering and transmuting/adorning, and what we found wasnt too pretty right now. Related topics which were discussed as part of tradeskills were EQ2 Economy, EQ2/EQ Travel, and the occasional quest praises.  Guests today included: Gethani (OGR Staff Member) from Unrest, Mheryl from Kithikor, Valendur (OGR Staff Member) from Guk, and Kevin from Everfrost.</description>

   <itunes:subtitle>This week we had quite an uproar about the new tradeskills they put in with Echoes of Faydwer. We brought Mheryl and Valendur on with us to discuss their experiences with tinkering and transmuting/adorning, and what we found wasnt too pretty right now. Related topics which were discussed as part of tradeskills were EQ2 Economy, EQ2/EQ Travel, and the occasional quest praises.  Guests today included: Gethani (OGR Staff Member) from Unrest, Mheryl from Kithikor, Valendur (OGR Staff Member) from Guk, and Kevin from Everfrost.</itunes:subtitle>

   <title>EQ2s-day Recorded Show 08-22-06 Part 1 ::Online Gaming Radios EverQuest 2 show::</title>
   <description>This session on EQ2s-day we reviewed over EoFs belief system of what has been mentioned already about it. We also had many good discussions during the process of what the rest of the system could be like and some ideas that SOE should take into consideration. The later parts of the show we headed straight into our Nek Castle 3 discussion and finished with a Arc Quest rant. Special guests today included Gethani and Cineo.</description>

   <title>EQ2s-day Recorded Show 08-08-06 Part 1 ::Online Gaming Radios EverQuest 2 show::</title>
   <description>Finally for this show Akira has taken the lead host again as we start of with our Introduction to Echoes of Faydwer, Everquest IIs new expansion. We went over many aspects of the Fay from what we have heard from the devs including character creation, movement, and which classes they will be able to choose. One of the other major topics we went over is whether this new expansion will be appealing to the current veteran playbase due to the lack of increasing the level cap. Our discussion today included special guests Gethani, Cineo, Motan, and the many people who gave there comments in the in-game chat channel.</description>

This discussion led us into the Fallen Dynasty topic along with talking about some future things that will be coming up with the new Echoes of Faydwer Expansion pack. Additional topics were brought up over factions, items, and once again this conspiracy theory which Dellmon *cough* does not believe in, but I do, Akira. Anyway, Special guests included Motan, Cineo, and Gethani.</description>
