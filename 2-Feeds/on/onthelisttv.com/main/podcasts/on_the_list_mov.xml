            <description>The Westin group took a huge risk at restoring the once famed hotel and turned it into the Westin Book Cadillac Detroit Hotel. From the looks of it, they did an extraordinary job in preserving and giving it style. On the List TV was lucky enough to get a great tour and roam free about the hotel to give a little insight into the history of the hotel while showing off the decor, ballrooms, hotel rooms and even a condo that sits on one of the top levels of the Book Cadillac. There was so much to this hotel that Domenic and Tiffany may go back for seconds in a later episode...tune in to find out.</description>

            <description>Welcome to Season 3 (Episode 28) of On the List TV with Domenic D’Amico and new co-host Tiffany Stone. Sure you’ve seen Tiffany as a guest of OTL on 2 other episodes, but now she’s made it a home! Along with Domenic, they will explore more than just bars and clubs around town. Sure those were exciting and who doesn’t love talking to people hopped up on booze?Ok so Episode 28, we’ve decided to hit up the Russell Bazaar shops at the Russell Bazaar center. Tiffany looks for some new goodies while Domenic fumbles around and stumbles into some lingerie from Bodacious U and Highway Printing’s Detroit Shirts. Tiffany also finds a good cause from one of the shops as they sell products from Africa and send proceeds back to help out. Plus we check out a piece of art and get the scoop on it from the Russell Gallery!</description>

            <title>On The List TV - Ep 27 - Roller Skating Bonanza Bday at Bonaventure</title>
            <description>Episode 27, hosts Domenic D&apos;Amico and Tiffany Stone slip into some skates and slide on the rink for Detroit&apos;s own Jevon Hollywood and DJ Mike Scroggs Annual Rollerskating Disco Bday Bash.
Then go On The Scene to find partiers in costume during the mayhem at Farmington Hills, MI, Bonaventure Roller Rink. Domenic also runs into On The List TV fan, ICE aka Amanda from VH1&apos;s Flavor of Love 3 and I Love Money 2, but she&apos;s disguised, shhhhh.
Incase you didn&apos;t read or notice, Tiffany Stone, local model (Maxim, Greektown Casino, Toyo Tires, etc.) from Detroit makes her second appearance as co-host to Domenic D&apos;Amico. On the List TV asked her oddly enough to do this show on skates, much like the Campus Marius Ice Skating episode. Call it an initiation for Tiffany if you must or simply a coincidence. Either way she holds her own against Domenic and gets in the rough of it during some rowdy interviews. You can also check out her other work and print work at www.tiffany-stone.com</description>

            <title>On The List TV - Ep 19 - The Bank, Mt. Clemens</title>
            <description>After about 2 years, Ronny Masters and Alex Kristoff pulled off something that&apos;s been lacking for a long time in Mt. Clemens, and that was upscale. Mt. Clemens is blessed with a country bar, the 18 and up mega club, an irish pub and many more, but upscale was lacking, let&apos;s face it. Domenic and Tony Finch actually experienced the club first hand while it this &quot;old bank&quot; was being renovated, they even tried to help name the place. After 2 months of being open we finally were able to get a show there, and what a show it was, with the fancy decor, bottle service, pretty people and Domenic&apos;s birthday. The night ended with intense energy to party more. Check out the show with interviews, the talk of the Bank, the large outdoor patio areas and a fun time. Plus we end the show on a surprising note...check it out!</description>

            <description>It took 7 weeks in a span of two months to come to the conclusion in crowning Metro Detroit&apos;s Best Bartender in Real Detroit Weeky&apos;s War of the Pour. On the List TV shot the show Live on Clutch Cargo&apos;s main stage while the competition was going on and this was largely due to Domenic and Tony Finch hosting the 7 week event, so it was fitting. Jenny D joins us as she interviews some of the finalists and hops into the Bacardi Rolls Royce. We also showcase the 6 weeks that led up to the finals, plus we can&apos;t leave a show untouched without putting something on the Pimp List and knocking something off the High Horse. Then we conclude the show with the 2008 Winner from War of the Pour! A fantastic show and it&apos;s always getting better!</description>
