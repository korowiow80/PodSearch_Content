			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Groth, using our beliefs as a lens, helps us understand what it means to be a Police Officer in our world today. God never intended us to experience some of the horrors that are out there, but we live in a fallen world, and this is one of the things our Police Officers help protect us from. Police Officers really do express the love of Christ. And finally, Jeff talks to us about how we can support our first responders: pray, respect and honor them, stand up for them, and say &#8220;thank you.&#8221;</p>
