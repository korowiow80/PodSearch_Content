      <title>A Prayer for You: Financial Breakthrough</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Be warned! This simple audio prayer may change your life! Today I felt like saying a prayer for you, whoever you are, in the area of FINANCES. 

However, be warned, as this prayer may not be for you. It is no accident that you stumbled upon this podcast. Prayer works no matter what you believe. If it's not for you, just trash it; I certainly have no problems with that. You may be here for other reasons. But know this, God has a purpose and plan for your life that only he understands and he'd like to share with you his plan for life. Hogwash you say? Alright, I'll prove it to you. 1. Click the play button and listen to the simple prayer. 2. Ask God if he's "really real" to reveal himself to you in ANY way as a sign because you sought him by simply listenin' to my prayer. Do those 2 things and I guarantee you God will reveal himself to you in such a way that you'll have to come back and tell me what happened to you as a result of your efforts. You see, all you have to do is take a step, God will take two. So holla back and let me know what's up! I don't pray no wimpy prayers so I'm expecting somethin'. Are you?

Foundation Scripture: Matthew 18: 18, 19

18 "I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be[d]bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be[e] loosed in heaven.

19 "Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven."]]></description>
