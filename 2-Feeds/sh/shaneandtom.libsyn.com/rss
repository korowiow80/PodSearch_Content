        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Join this weekly unique and sometimes inappropriate show between two friends Shane and Tom. Listen and laugh with them while they share their lives with you from an odd perspective.

Shane and Tom's Squeezebox is an effortless stream of hilarious consciousness, capable of forcing outbursts that surrounding company cannot ignore. 
Every week, two friends connect on a higher level of humour, setting out to collapse in a glorious heap of laughter that has other humour podcasters gasping for breath between gaffaws.
Listeners do not count the high points of "funny", but rather the moments between stories where they can regain composure. 
For the audio-romp of your week, Shane and Tom are the greatest embodiment of genuine friendship on the internet today.
1 episode per week (posted on Sunday Night)

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello listeners! I regret to inform that...... (you are probably thinking something really bad!)....... we probably will not be doing a show for a few weeks. So, also, you know I am going on a trip for 2 weeks and I leave on Thursday, and due to the two of us not being to get together I don't think there will be a show this week, or next, or the next and maybe we'll do one after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is we will have loads of content when we return, and I am bringing my iphone so I'll be able to record audio and video whilst away, maybe of me falling off a camel or what have you. I'll try to tweet as much as I can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll chat soon folks!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[As you may already know, I (Tom) own a music venue in Windsor, Ontario.<br/>It is special. And not in THAT way.<br/><br/>There's this vote happening on CBC Radio 3 with regards to my music venue, Phog Lounge.<br/><br/>Searchlight has a contest right now which will decide (by votes alone) the Best Live Music Venue in Canada.<br/>
<br/>I think Phog Lounge is that place for a litany of reasons.<br/>However,
as listeners in many countries, and from all over the place, this isn't
necessarily pressing for you to do...to go to <a href="http://cbcradio3.com/" target="_blank">cbcradio3.com</a>
(<a href="http://radio3.cbc.ca/polls/?pollId=31" target="_blank">http://radio3.cbc.ca/polls/?<wbr/>pollId=31</a>) and vote on a daily
basis...BUT...<br/>It would help to forward this cause, this effort to be voted Best Live Music Venue in Canada.<br/><br/>If you would be so kind as to help me out with this project, I would be forever grateful.<br/>Again, the link is - <a href="http://radio3.cbc.ca/polls/?pollId=31" target="_blank">http://radio3.cbc.ca/polls/?<wbr/>pollId=31</a> - and you are able to vote every 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>We
are a 60-capacity venue, going up against places in TORONTO that hold
just short of 1000 people per show. These places are impersonal, yes,
but they have followers nonetheless. I need your votes desperately from
now until February 24th, every day. Is that asking too much?<br/>The most dedicated fan base will win, plain and simple.<br/><br/>So, please help.<br/>I love you.<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Having returned from Kingston, the podcaster conference called <a mce_href="http://www.podcastersacrossborders.com/" href="http://www.podcastersacrossborders.com/">PAB (Podcasters Across Borders)</a>, I have only great things to say, which I will do in future posts.</p>

<p>I want to share the relative success with a t-shirt idea <a mce_href="http://shanetom.com" href="http://shanetom.com/">Shane and I</a> came up with.</p>

<p>I
wanted to make a huge sentence with mentions of all the social media
applications in it, (I Digg when Twits Pownce on del.icio.us ideas...),
and then print it on the front of a t-shirt. I figured it would draw
praise and giddiness from podcasters and social/new media nuts.</p>

<p>But
Shane honed the idea into a giant &quot;Hello My Name Is...&quot; name tag with
all of the fields being the social media applications, and then blank
spaces left to be filled in with a fabric marker or a Sharpie. I loved
the idea, and in a day Shane had a finished design. I burned the image
of the design on the screen at <a mce_href="http://thephogblog.blogspot.com" href="http://thephogblog.blogspot.com/">Phog</a>,
and brought it to Kingston. Shane brought shirts, and we slowly took
orders, and then made them to order in our hotel room during the dinner
break on Saturday night. </p>

<p>And now I think we'll have our hands full printing more, as were are more than willing and able to do so.</p>

<p>The
best part of the &quot;fill in the blank&quot; t-shirt with social media info is
that if you go to conferences (and you need to wear those lanyards with
your name and information on it, which never sit right) you can simply
tell someone to take a photo of your shirt and they instantly have
LOADS of contact info that people today are coming to collect. This
shirt should be a staple for conferences. Heh-heh...<br/></p>

Dan Misener (<a href="http://http://www.collectiveproductions.com/jimdupree/">Jim Dupree: Enthusiast</a>) was kind enough to drag me around his workplace, and give me a day I'll never forget.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.cbcradio3.com">Radio 3</a> has done more for Canadian indie music than the rest of Canadian music stations, as far as I'm concerned. I mean, really, they legitimized a huge portion of talent by existing with strong people at the helm.<br/><br/>So yeah, that might mean we'll get more listeners to the podcast. And if you're one of the people who decided to check out our show because Craig was kind enough to mention it...welcome.<br/><br/>Oh, and uh, hold on to your hats, because this show's content is far more rocky than most.<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[For those of you who tuned into our 100th Episode Live Podcast Extravaganza thank you so much, Tom and I had lots of fun and it was so nice to speak to some of you who were scattered around our fair planet. For those who had trouble listening we are sorry, apparently there are some limitations to the software, but it is way cool we were even able to do it. As for posting the show, you can click on the link to the right (to review past episodes) and listen to it in its entirety (but it is choppy), I'm editing out all the dead space right now but the show was 2 hours so it will take some time, but when I'm done I will post it on the site. <br/>Now for our next 100! Gosh!<br/>shane<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/><br/>Member that time you had your snowsuit on, waiting for daddy to get home from work to take you tobogganing, and he never showed up? <br/><br/>I don't actually (no dad), but it's a metaphor. The proverbial daddies (shane and tom) have missed our quality time with the tike (you guys) and are not able to get a show to you (the tobogganing outing). We are sorry, Mommy has looked down her glasses at us and we will try our best to be less negligent, or Mommy wont put out anymore.....ewww, but I think you know what we mean.<br/><br/>Daddy still loves you very much, here's a 10 spot, go buy yourself some back bacon (that's what my Dad would have said).<br/><br/>shane and tom (the Daddies)<br/><br/>k that sounds very wrong!<br/>]]></description>

Because of work I have less time to edit the show and post it the same day we record. So, I think it will be best to still post the show on Sunday, so it's available to you all on Monday morning like good old times, Plus if Tom and I are not able to meet up we have a few days to make it up before the weekend.<br/><br/>With that being said, you'll have to wait now till Sunday for the new show?&nbsp; But it will be well worth it, we promise.<br/><br/>I trust we are back on track and the shows will be coming out regularly from now on.<br/><br/>Take it easy<br/>shane and tom<br/>]]></description>

			<title>Fake Oakleys</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://shaneandtom.libsyn.com/fake_oakleys]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[I saw this abomination leaving work the other day.<br/>The family thought it would be cute to post a photo of this poor bastard in fake Oakleys on the bumper of his car...on his 50th birthday no less!<br/><br/>Let's get something straight. On my birthday, I'm the goddamn man of the hour. Screw that, I am the Man of the Year on that day. Christ, the man made it to 50 years old! Do you know how hard that is to do these days? In Windsor, Ontario?! Our air is like baby powder, filled with grit and dust, except it comes from broken down shit-bucket cars that lunch-bucket brains can't let go of...so the powder is more like brake powder.<br/><br/>So, back to this poor-man's Tom Selleck...<br/>He's got the gold chain on, he's obviously tanning on a boat at Put-In-Bay for the long weekend. His moustachio is turning a little blonde, and his JOakleys are hiding his bloodshot, Coors-Light-Lakeport-Honey-Brown-and-Lucky-Lager-indicating-eyeballs. Let's get a shot of this, and save it for his benchmark life achievement.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[I saw this abomination leaving work the other day.The family thought it would be cute to post a photo of this poor bastard in fake Oakleys on the bumper of his car...on his 50th birthday no less!Let's get something straight. On my birthday, I'm the goddamn man of the hour. Screw that, I am the Man of the Year on that day. Christ, the man made it to 50 years old! Do you know how hard that is to do these days? In Windsor, Ontario?! Our air is like baby powder, filled with grit and dust, except it comes from broken down shit-bucket cars that lunch-bucket brains can't let go of...so the powder is more like brake powder.So, back to this poor-man's Tom Selleck...He's got the gold chain on, he's obviously tanning on a boat at Put-In-Bay for the long weekend. His moustachio is turning a little blonde, and his JOakleys are hiding his bloodshot, Coors-Light-Lakeport-Honey-Brown-and-Lucky-Lager-indicating-eyeballs. Let's get a shot of this, and save it for his benchmark life achievement. We'll put it in the local paper so all the guys on The Force can laugh and point guns at him for being so lame, and then we'll attach it to his bumper so EVERY a-hole in the city that sees him driving will know that he's a Coors-Light-Lakeport-Honey-Brown-and-Lucky-Lager-swilling-over-the-hill-pretty-boy.And when he gets home, we'll hang him by his nuts and beat him like a pinata until he begs for death. It'll be the best birthday EVER!!Yaaaaaaay!If you can't tell, I'm not a fan of the prank. Most people see this as fun, but I see this as disrespectful.

Well I just buy a rather large turkey, cook it, and then toss it in the tub, and she can chip away at it all week (she doesnt even notice im gone due to all the turkey induced sleeping).

I was with Jhoan (wife), <a href="http://shaneandtom.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=198454">Misener, and Jenna</a>, and they all agreed that it pulsated with Shane-ness. It still wasn't gross enough for Misener...but I couldn't see anything dead or turned inside-out...so this was the winner.<br/>The best part is the little cat in the bottom right corner saying, &quot;Guess which one is mine?&quot;<br/>These are the only kind of gifts I know Shane will like. I do not want to buy him a &quot;personal massager&quot; that he burns out by sitting on them for hours on end. I want something that will ignite his imagination. I want something to take him up into the rear-asses of felines.<br/>They were the most expensive magnets I ever bought, but his reaction was worth every penny.<br/>Meeeoow?<br/>Meeeuck!<br/><br/>]]></description>

There is nothing really on this road except deep, wet ditches and shallow, dry personalities.<br/>I found myself to be walking along it while my car was out of commission recently.<br/>Most of the time, you see skater kids, wearing grimy backpacks, collecting stupidity out of the fuel-stained gravel on the sides of the roads.<br/>I would <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">hope</span> that one of them would get ram-rodded by a truck while wandering down this side road, which would explain the shoe...but that's wishful thinking.<br/>I think this shoe is nothing more than another piece of garbage being dumped alongside old newspapers, bottles, cans, and broken basketball rims (yes I saw one). I just don't know why there's only one! Where is the other shoe? <br/>I actually could see a skater kid moving along at a good click, with those overly floppy shoes that are wider across than they are long, simply continuing along after one shoe bites the dust. These kids are usually pretty lazy, unless you are willing to give them something new for free, and I contest that they might actually leave their abused, battered, putrid pedal-foot shoe in a ditch.<br/>&quot;Screw it, I'll get it tomorrow.

            <description><![CDATA[As you know, the show has been on hiatus.<br/><br/>Shane has been kind enough to ask for prayers and to post on the site.<br/><br/>Above is a picture of my Dad on Sunday, before his heart bypass surgery where he was impaired more than ever during the surgery.<br/><br/>My Dad has gone from bad to worse, and then miraculously, stable and slowly (VERY) improving.<br/>Doctors do not really know how he has made it from one hospital to the other (Tuesday morning) and now that he has been hooked up to 20 machines, pumping his blood, making his heart beat, breathing for him, keeping him sedated, keeping him pain free, keeping his blood pressure regulated, keeping his oxygen saturation regulated, he has drastically reduced his dependance on all of these aids.<br/><br/>His body was on 4 MAJOR doses of 4 MAJOR drugs. He has been capable of being weened off of all but one of them (blood pressure) and he has almost finished needing that one! He had a pump in an artery near the heart, in correlation with a heart medicine (forcing the muscle to work), which doctors thought was the only way his heart would keep beating. They thought his heart muscle could be dead from the massive heart attack he had on Monday. But, he is now competely free of the pump, and the heart-beat-medicine.<br/><br/>The prayers are working. This is what I'm saying.<br/>I am not one who is into hokey beliefs...but I am spiritual. I have been praying to every god (God) there is, and I know that he's been in the thoughts of many reading this, and it IS WORKING. <br/><br/>There is almost no other explanation. Please keep thinking of him.<br/>Every good intention and every strong prayer is helping him heal.<br/>He has a lot to live for and you are helping him.<br/>Thank you from the bottom of my squeezy heart.<br/>His squeezebox needs more help.<br/>Thanks in advance.<br/><br/>Tom<br/>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://shaneandtom.libsyn.com/dream_catchers_in_cars]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[If you look closely, you can see the wonderful dream-catcher hanging from the rear-view mirror. This was one of three cars I saw on that short drive, to the podcast recording, and I happened to have my camera ready. Enough already! I think natives should be able to claim your car on the spot, seize you from within it, leave you on the side of the road, and drive away, wearing huge head-dresses and shooting arrows at random cars on the way out.<br/>How bizarre is it that we (in general) avoid any contact with our native people and their concerns, but we cannot escape the idea of having a ripped-off native symbol (tennis-racket-string, organized to look like a dyslexic spider web, with ANGELS dancing among the beads strung among the dyed-purple feathers) in our vehicles? <br/><br/>We <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">must</span> have this in the car, where we... dream? What? Dreaming in the car? Oh, wait, yeah, that's, ummm, STUPID! Nothing beats the idea of stealing a symbol from natives and adorning it with another spiritual-belief's symbolism (yeah, the angels)...that's just an extra rib-shot.<br/>That said, I have begin an informal data-collection project based on the things that hang from rear-view mirrors.<br/>

So far, I have a very concrete list, that rarely varies, which seems to house every possible thing hanging from these mirrors.<br/>

I will report on some of these items here, in the next little while.<br/>

Look for updates.<br/>

As for now, I want to discuss one of the stranger things I see...<br/>

Hawaiian Lei Necklaces (apparently people win these at hot-body
contests or a lame luau parties or from prom parties). I just don't get why so many people
have plastic flower necklaces hanging from their mirror. Most of the
time, they are hanging in cars of dudes. Dudes who wear mirrored
(fluorescent) sunglasses, with gel-laden hair and personalized plates
like, &quot;HETERO&quot;. So, I'm thinking, if I tried to pull this off, I'd have
the gay finger pointing my way all the time...like that commercial for
<span class="hm" id="misp_compose_2">Arby's</span> when the logo for the meat-sheet-burger-joint hovers over the
people thinking about <span class="hm" id="misp_compose_3">Arby's</span>...my car would have that purple <span class="hm" id="misp_compose_4">Teletubby</span>
constantly hovering over my car...but it's okay for big raging jocks to
hang luscious lei from their mirror. I don't get it. Maybe I'm jealous.<br/>]]></description>

			<title>Neck Warmer</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://shaneandtom.libsyn.com/neck_warmer]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This is me in my Hobo-Neck-Scarf...so aptly named by Shane.<br/>

He's jealous of the fashion craze I've begun.<br/>

I am encouraging hipsters to grow beards, their hair, and wear a broken
down toque as a neck warmer/scarf. In fact, there are already a few
copycats at <span class="hm" id="misp_0_1">Phog</span> Lounge in Windsor.<br/><br/>Shane has been nice enough to even tell me that my hair, on the sides, looks like pubic hair. What are friends for? That might be the worst thing anyone has ever said about my appearance, and it came from my best pal.<br/>Love you too...a-hole.<br/>

<br/>

It started on <span class="hm" id="misp_0_2">Spadina</span> Street in Toronto with my wife. We went into a store and
bought two toques for two bucks. Upon walking out the door, I dug into
the bag and pulled out a new version of the toque. It had NO pom-poms
on it, and it had come completely unravelled on the top, where it
should be sewn shut with pom-poms.<br/>

<br/>

I was incensed! I spent a dollar! What is the value of a dollar
anymore! My wife, <span class="hm" id="misp_0_3">Jhoan</span> rolls her eyes looking at me. &quot;Bring it back
then, don't complain,&quot; she said...or something like that. This coming
from the person who has since learned NEVER to buy &quot;gadgets&quot; from
dollar stores, after&nbsp; we bought a can opener that couldn't have helped
open a can if they were tied together and shot out of a canon against
an iron wall.<br/>

<br/>

Dollar stuff, for the most part is total trash.<br/>

This toque-turned-neck-scarf is how you pull the old <span class="hm" id="misp_0_4">switcheroo</span> on the bastards taking advantage of our thrifty, cheap asses.<br/>

<br/>

At that moment, in the summer, in Toronto, I told <span class="hm" id="misp_0_5">Jhoan</span>, &quot;This is going
to be a <span class="hm" id="misp_0_6">neck</span> warmer,&quot; which she started to laugh at, &quot;and I'm not
kidding! This thing is going to be the BEST neck warmer ever! Just to
spite this store!&quot;<br/>

<br/>

And, voila! It has been so faithful and ugly at the same time, that I
am getting people to follow in my footsteps. &quot;I feel weird without it
on now,&quot; said one follower, &quot;because it's like being hugged the whole
time it's on, and when it's off, you're cold.&quot;<br/>

<br/>

That's right. Gaze upon my mangled woolen nightmare. I love it.<br/>

We might even start selling them...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/>The image above is of one of many birds who died at or near the hands of one Shane Potvin. This little guy, who looks like he's 100 in bird years, was clinging onto this branch like a 14-year-old Olympic gymnast. Nothing Shane could do would provoke this beast to let go. <br/>How can a bird, covered in feathers, have wrinkles? Am I nuts or does he look wrinkly?<br/><br/>Shane was shaking the branches of the tree in my backyard like a grizzly bear trying to release fruit, but this bird wouldn't budge! Wouldn't budgy!! Yeeeaaahaaaaa!<br/><br/>This now-dead bird reminds me of how fleeting our hollow-boned little flightless lives are, and how much we should live each day. I want to send you all the best wishes, on behalf of Shane and myself, to have an enriched New Year. Send a note to that person who made a difference in your week. Get in touch with family more often. Make more of your days than you have in years passed. <br/><br/>Don't end up being a tired old pigeon grasping onto your  bedpan while the orderlies try to shake you off of the ceiling fan. <br/>Bye Bye Birdie.<br/>Happy New Year<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

Yeeeaaahaaaaa!This now-dead bird reminds me of how fleeting our hollow-boned little flightless lives are, and how much we should live each day. I want to send you all the best wishes, on behalf of Shane and myself, to have an enriched New Year. Send a note to that person who made a difference in your week. Get in touch with family more often. Make more of your days than you have in years passed. Don't end up being a tired old pigeon grasping onto your  bedpan while the orderlies try to shake you off of the ceiling fan. Bye Bye Birdie.Happy New Year]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[X-Mas Rebuttal<br/><br/>After venting my dislike for all things insincere around the holidays, I am beginning to feel much more vibrant toward the 25th.<br/><br/>I finally wrapped almost all of my gifts, which has helped buoy my spirits.<br/>The weather in Windsor is wet and not white. No snow. <br/>The temperature has been more like the breath of a farty, exhausted mall-Santa. The lack of snow has been destroying my festive mood.<br/><br/>AndyCast, The Zedcast, Canadian Podcast Buffet, are a few of the podcasts who put out show with the intention of lightening the end of this month, and it was well received by many listeners, including myself. The Rogic crew organized a sing-along skit that made a pleasant dent in my X-Mas humbugging. Barry from Barrie, The Scarborough Dude, and Dave (Two Boobs and a Baby) sent e-cards too...what a great bunch.<br/><br/>With this post, being the only real holiday positivity you'll hear from me, I AM happy to have something small to give Shane for Christmas. He couldn't guess what it is if he tried. Neither could you. But in its simplicity, is its perfection. After he gets it, I'll post images of the items I gifted.<br/><br/>Hey Dump! Shane! If you're reading this, DO NOT GO TO THE DOLLAR STORE! If you show up at my house during the holiday with a sewing kit, sandcastle pails, plastic flowers, a plastic can opener, a box of combs, or a multi-pack of &quot;Goosy Fruit&quot; (Juicy Fruit knock-off gum), I will make you watch me sew a flag for my miniature flower-covered sandcastle, while I comb my hair endlessly, opening cans of beets which I will eat at the same time as my &quot;Goosy Fruit Gum&quot;. What I'm saying is, &quot;Shane, I hope you like your gifts.&quot;<br/><br/>Merry Christmas everyone.<br/>Happy Holidays.<br/>Laugh a lot.<br/>Tom<br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

and voice processor that features an AES/EBU output (digital output up

de-esser and tube simulation. If you are a recording musician,
home/project studio owner, or work primarily in the digital domain and
need to record vocals into a digital system, this is your machine. Key
features include a 24-bit/96 kHz AES/EBU output with selectable
sampling rates or external clocking. The Ultra-Voice has a discrete ULN
mic/line input stage with soft mute +48V phantom power. Authentic tube
emulation circuitry provides for typical tube and tape saturation
sounds, and there is a true RMS expander for smooth noise reduction. An
opto-compressor provides inaudible dynamic control and creative signal
processing options. A voice-optimized equalizer was specially designed

            <description><![CDATA[Podcasts 

Where the whole world can hear you talk 

Windsor’s newest talk radio program can’t be found anywhere on the radio dial — and that’s very much working in its favour. 
   It’s hard to imagine a mainstream station giving air time to two amateurs whose idea of a show involves scribbling a word or two on a scrap of paper and then just winging it when the on-air light goes on. 
   But, as it is for other similar podcasts, that spontaneous, uncensored spirit is the secret behind the growing success of Shane and Tom’s Squeeze Box, an online talk show produced by Windsorites Shane Potvin and Tom Lucier, who sometimes writes for this page. 
   “Essentially, it was a chance for me to run into my friend Shane and actually be able to have the conversations we used to have before we ran out of time,? Lucier said of the show. “So, we basically behave the way we would if we were out with our other friends, except we have microphones.? 
   The guys just completed their 19th episode and recently clocked in their 1,000th hit on their website shaneandtom.libsyn.com That’s quite the milestone considering their first show was posted barely two months ago.

Where the whole world can hear you talk 

Windsor’s newest talk radio program can’t be found anywhere on the radio dial — and that’s very much working in its favour. 
   It’s hard to imagine a mainstream station giving air time to two amateurs whose idea of a show involves scribbling a word or two on a scrap of paper and then just winging it when the on-air light goes on. 
   But, as it is for other similar podcasts, that spontaneous, uncensored spirit is the secret behind the growing success of Shane and Tom’s Squeeze Box, an online talk show produced by Windsorites Shane Potvin and Tom Lucier, who sometimes writes for this page. 
   “Essentially, it was a chance for me to run into my friend Shane and actually be able to have the conversations we used to have before we ran out of time,? Lucier said of the show. “So, we basically behave the way we would if we were out with our other friends, except we have microphones.? 
   The guys just completed their 19th episode and recently clocked in their 1,000th hit on their website shaneandtom.libsyn.com That’s quite the milestone considering their first show was posted barely two months ago. 
   “The numbers are going up so it’s really, really exciting to see that,? said Potvin, a 28-year-old digital art director. 
   The name Squeeze Box spun out of the first episode when Potvin picked up a toy accordion and began to play it as the opening theme song.
