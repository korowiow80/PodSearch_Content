Lamentably this thwarted the usual alacritous distribution of our show, to this we cry pardon. If you do forgive us and listen, in spite of our effronterous laggardness, you are guaranteed to enjoy.This show was conducted around the Arizona/Mexican border and contains: Mexican alien abduction,La Llorona  Underground Lizard folk, American ex-patriot smuggling, and a whole shitload more.OH yeah,the boys will be continuing their trek, alphabetically, across all 50 United States, next stop in Arkansas.They wanted me to thank you for your continued support earthling bitches. </description>

First off,we apologize for the dilatory nature in the release of this episode. As you know, the boys are in the throws of their multi-state excursion resulting in delayed transfer of audio files to the production department.&quot;So what&quot; you ask? Well, that means the people that assemble the show have nothing to assemble until the boys pass the audio onto us, so consequently, you fucks have to wait longer than usual to get your favorite paranormal podcast--so there you fuckers!! Goddamnit here it is!! In this show you will find Goblins shape-shifting into ethereal Ninja Baboons and then attacking school girls, breaking news from the Andromeda counsel,the Reed Family abductions, possessed Gypsy Dolls (minus members), and exceptional new NDEs from February.Thank you once again for allowing shatplan to damage the few good brain cells left residing in your cranium.

P.S. Thank you B.G. and A.W. for your continued contribution to Shatplan. Without your tireless effort we would probably be a much better transmission-and indubitably more original. 

P.P.S The shatplan crew continues their quest to expose the underworld with the next stop in their journey being Arizona.Be sure to tune in.</description>

      <title>Episode 31,900,090- Backhand-- Mufon Loves Ya Baby!!!</title>

Boy has it been a while since your favorite mystical crapcast offered up anything worth while. Well, as the faithful know, the crew embarked on the live transmission trail last summer and things have gone fabulous. As a result, they aren't afforded investigative opportunities often, so when the chance rears its head, boy do they jump at it. Ristopher and Brucie left town on a quest of epic religious proportions-- i.e. the Tebow phenomenon, and Billy Backhand and a special guest popped into the studio to fill in. Rios had his mitts full with mediating, but when the dust settled, an epic was born. A ghost story, and a cute rate B movie review were in attendance to entertain you. Thank you for being a faithful listener all these years, this one won't let you down.


P.S.  OH yeah, go to shatteredplanetlive.podomatic.com to hear a recorded version of your favorite live paranormal podcast. 

P.P.S. We are working on a website @ shatteredplanet.com at the moment. We will be broadcasting live very soon there. Tentatively it will be bimonthly , but you know the assholes @ shatplan-- they work when they want to.</description>

      <title> Episode 300,000,035 -New Years Eve Bash</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1076230/600x600_3866992.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What can we say? It has been an inordinately long time since we posted an episode-yes we received all of your e-mails too, by the way. Everyone at Shatplan would like to apologize for our respite and assure you that we'll be more prolific in the upcoming months. There are oodles of pretexts that we could shovel into your craniums, but we won't. To be honest, everyone kind of needed some rest and we took it-- so there earthling bitches. But guess what? You are here for a damn good reason, that reason isn't to hear us whine about last year. No, it's because we've published a new one, fuckers. In this episode the boys were at a local haunt to ring in the new year, and boy did they have fun. Along with injecting unsuspecting horny drunk broads with their s.t.d.'s they imparted a metaphysical medley. Ristopher began the show with a story of a spirit from down south of the border way. After that Rios exited his makeshift booth for a minute to impart a dandy of chimerical cryptid proportions.Before shaking his semen purse to the dance floor Brucie had one police woman's account of some supersonic silvery bipeds. Sure to entertain your earholes and your genitals alike, take a gander and tell a friend. We appreciate you listening and prepare yourself for a year filled with ShatteredPlanet broadcasting. Oh yeah, about the episode photo.It contains Brucie and Rios in masks, and Ristopher blasted out of his gourde on p.c.p. All got laid and the gene pool is worse of for it. Thank you. 


Love, The ShatPlan Crew

the holiday spirit this season.Consequently, the cast decided to convene this Christmas Eve to gift our faithful with  paranormal tidbits and laughter. Enraptured with bewilderment the crew greeted a well known sleigh driving bigot dropped in to spread some yuletide cheer---concomitantly ,most of the alcohol on hand was consumed with yucks and insight proliferating in the wake of said inebriation .We feel we should forewarn you to grab eggnog and K.Y. in preparation of the earrape you are about to endure.This one is a real humdinger,so  Merry holidays to you and enjoy this gift

Enraptured with bewilderment the crew greeted a well known sleigh driving bigot dropped in to spread some yuletide cheer---concomitantly ,most of the alcohol on hand was consumed with yucks and insight proliferating in the wake of said inebriation .We feel we should forewarn you to grab eggnog and K.Y. in preparation of the earrape you are about to endure.This one is a real humdinger,so  Merry holidays to you and enjoy this gift
heartily ;earthling bitches. 

P.S.---- Save the nasty e-mails , Saint Nick told us to tell you to fuck off!!!!</itunes:summary>
