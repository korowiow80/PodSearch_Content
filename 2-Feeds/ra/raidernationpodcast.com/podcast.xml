            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>TOPICS:</b></p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Plaxico, Plexico, what the heck-sico?"</b></p>

<p>Plaxico Burris told Rich Gannon on Sirius Radio that he would definitely consider playing for the Raiders, among a few other teams. Raider Greg doesn't believe that Dennis Allen or Reggie McKenzie would be interested in either Burris or Terrell Owens, and Raider Greg doesn't think it would be a good idea either.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "Raiders Sign 13 Undrafted Free Agents…and look at 30 "Try-Outs"</b></p>

<p>Raider Greg goes over all 13 of the undrafted free agents that the Raiders signed, and he believes they were all good choices. We also played the audio portion of several training camp interview videos that were posted on Raiders.com….with the following draftees: 3rd Rd. pick OT Tony Bergstrom, 5th Rd. pick DE Jack Crawford, 5th Rd. pick WR Juron Criner, and 6th Rd. pick DE Christo Bilukidi. We also hear from Defensive Coordinator Jason Tarver, Offensive Coordinator Greg Knapp, as well as Head Coach Dennis Allen.In other late news, last night the Raiders fired their head of college scouting for the last 33 years Jon Kingdon. We will cover that story in our next podcast.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "D.H.B. gets a D.U.I. -- how D.U.M.B. is that?"</b></p>

<p>Raider Greg briefly covers the story of Derrius Heyward-Bey being charged with driving under the influence, after being pulled over on the Bay Bridge.</p>

<p><b>Segment #4: "Vikings are staying in Minnesota - Does this increase Raiders chances of moving to L.A.?"</b></p>

<p>The Vikings were one of the teams trying to get a new stadium, and were rumored as a candidate to move to L.A. They have apparently made plans for a new stadium in Minnesota. Raider Greg thinks this makes the Raiders the most likely team to move to L.A.</p>

<p><b>Segment #5: "Our Boneline Voicemail Segment"</b></p>

<p>This week's callers:</p>

<p>1. Nebraska Raider
<br />2. Raider Allen from Redding, California
<br />3. Raider Stud from Oakland, California
<br />4. Raider Tatum from the MidWest
<br />5. Houston Raider Steve

            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>TOPICS:</b></p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders 2012 Draft Picks"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders first pick in the 2012 draft was a compensatory pick at the end of the third round. Going into this draft, we were only slated to have five picks, but Reggie McKenzie got us an extra pick in the 7th round by making a late hour trade. Raider Greg will review our six new members of the Oakland Raiders. We also hear from Raiders Coach Dennis Allen by way of an interview he did on 95.7 The Game's "Wheelhouse" with co-hosts John Lund and Greg Papa. This interview was recorded after the conclusion of round one of the draft.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "Matt Leinart coming to Oakland?"</b></p>

<p>As of our recording of this podcast on Monday April 30th, Matt Leinart was scheduled to work out with the Raiders the following day. Raider Greg was anticipating in this story that the Raiders would sign Leinart as Carson Palmer's backup. LATE BREAKING NEWS: As I am posting these podcast notes and preparing to upload this show to the internet, I see late breaking news that the Raiders have indeed signed Matt Leinart today (Tuesday May 1st). The Raiders have officially confirmed this on their website.</p>

<p>In other late news, last night the Raiders fired their head of college scouting for the last 33 years Jon Kingdon. We will cover that story in our next podcast.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Raider Greg's 2012 Hopes, Opinions, and Predictions"</b></p>

<p>Raider Greg is optimistic about the Raiders 2012 season, in spite of the opinions of many analysts that the Raiders will finish last in the AFC West. Wouldn't we all love to prove them wrong?</p>

<p><b>Segment #4: "Our Boneline Voicemail Segment"</b></p>

<p>This week's callers:</p>

<p>01. Raider Chongo from Copperopolis, California
<br />02. Raider John from Rhode Island
<br />03. Raider Adam from Leeds, England
<br />04. Raider Sid from Moreno Valley, California

<p><b>Segment #1: "Peyton Place"</b></p>

<p>The Peyton Manning saga went on and on until he finally announced he was signing with Denver on Monday. What does this mean for the Raiders and the rest of the AFC West? The Broncos have $30 Million in cap space, enough to offer Manning a $95 Million contract over 5 years, and enough left over to sign a supporting cast of free agents and draft picks. Raider Greg says the Raider Nation is definitely not scared of Denver or Manning, and we welcome the challenge.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "Raiders GM Reggie McKenzie making some moves in Free Agency"</b></p>

<p>Raider Greg reviews all the latest free agent acquisitions by the Raiders and other potential moves on the horizon.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Our Boneline Voicemail Segment"</b></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>TOPICS:</b></p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders and NFL News Stories"</b></p>

<p>Breaking News…..Free Agent Jason Campbell signed a one year contract with the Chicago Bears today. We also cover the story of Randy Moss being signed by the San Francisco 49ers, and we hear some audio from Bay Area radio station 95.7 "The Game" featuring Zack Crockett. Zach is currently an Oakland Raiders scout, and he gives his recollections of what Randy Moss was like as a Raiders teammate.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "The Free Agent Fiasco"</b></p>

<p>The 2012 NFL Free Agency period began today with over 600 free agents! Normally there are around 400, but the lockout has resulted in 50% more free agents than usual. This should mean players being available at relatively lower salaries with all the competition for spots. It will be interesting to see who Reggie McKenzie and Dennis Allen decide to go after. Raider Greg gives his opinion.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "The Cap Crap"</b></p>

<p>The Redskins were recently penalized $36 Million and the Cowboys $10 Million for salary cap violations prior to the 2010 season. Unfortunately the Raiders were found in violation also, to a lesser extent, so they will not be able to share the extra cap money that is being divided by 28 teams. The Saints also will not get the 1.6 Million in extra cap space.</p>

<p><b>Segment #4: "Raiders Shaking It Up In Free Agency"</b></p>

<p>Raider Greg recaps some of the recent moves the Raiders have made in order to clear some cap space and get ready for free agency. We also hear from Raiders insider John Dickinson during an interview on 95.7 "The Game", plus more from Zack Crockett.</p>

<p><b>Segment #5: "Our Boneline Voicemail Segment"</b></p>

<p>This week's callers:</p>

<br />02. Raider Eric from Sacramento, California
<br />03. Keith Smith from London, England

            <link>http://www.raidernationpodcast.com/Podcasts/RNP-Show335-2012-02-22.mp3</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>TOPICS:</b></p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders Executive John Herrara Is Leaving The Building"</b></p>

<p>Longtime Raiders executive John Herrera is no longer going to be "Senior Executive" at Raiders headquarters. John started out at age 16 as a ball boy and running odd jobs for Al Davis, and eventually became the team's spokesperson for media releases. He became infamous during a Lane Kiffin press conference, when an interesting exchange between he and columnist Tim Kawakami was caught on tape (still available on YouTube). Mr. Herrera was not seen in a favorable light by many Raiders fans, and they are not unhappy that he is leaving. Raider Greg will give his thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "Will 2012 Be A 'Rebuilding' Year For The Raiders?"</b></p>

<p>After such a long time without a playoff appearance, approaching ten years, the last word that Raider Nation wants to hear is "rebuilding". Despite the unpleasant sound of that word, it may be a necessary stage we must progress through now that we have a new (and hopefully more effective) management and coaching team in place. We will also hear a few audio clips from local FM sports station 95.7 "The Game". Former Raiders running back and Pastor Napoleon Kaufman gives his thoughts on Stanford Routt signing with the Chiefs. Then Herm Edwards gives his insight into the Chiefs as well as some discussion on wide receivers and free agency.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Our Boneline Voicemail Segment"</b></p>

<p>This week's callers:</p>

<p>01.  Raider Jaime from Bakersfield
<br />02.  Raider Tony from Monterey
<br />03.  OC Raider

<br />06.  Raider Tonga from Copperopolis, CA</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>TOPICS:</b></p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Dennis Allen's coaching staff is almost complete"</b></p>

<p>Coach Allen has his coaching staff almost complete. He retained Al Saunders as "Senior Offensive Assistant", which is being widely regarded as a great thing. His staff is young, and many are from the college ranks, but Raider Greg and many others are optimistic. We also listen to the thoughts of Raiders media man John Dickinson from FM 95.7 "The Game".</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "Reggie McKenzie is moving and shaking"</b></p>

<p>Reggie McKenzie's general manager's sword came down and cut cornerback Stanford Routt. Was it a cap move? Was it performance related? Both? Is he sending a message to the other players? Looks like this off-season will be very interesting. Free agency and the draft are approaching. What other moves will McKenzie make to either pick up free agents or acquire more draft choice possibly? More radio clips from 95.7 "The Game", featuring insight from Rich Gannon, more from John Dickinson, plus Sports Illustrated's Don Banks and NFL executive Mike Lombardi.</p>

<p>After listening to introductory press conference for new Raiders General Manager Reggie McKenzie, Raider Greg was expecting a quick dismissal of many administrative personnel. There has been no announcement of such a reorganization so far, and Raider Greg and others are dissatisfied by that. Greg discusses his feelings on this topic and related issues. He comments on a recent article by Mike Silver of Yahoo Sports where Mr. Silver criticizes the firing of Hue Jackson.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "The Raiders 2012 Search for a Head Coach"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders have made no official announcements of who they are interviewing for head coach, but based on information coming out from "sources", Raider Greg and many others are not happy with the names being mentioned. Marty Mornhinweg, Mike Tice, and Dom Capers are the only ones with NFL head coaching experience, and their combined won/loss record is something like 80 wins, 140 losses.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Oakland's Proposal For Coliseum City"</b></p>

<p>Raider Greg revisits an article that was published in the East Bay Express back on December 14th. It relates to an announcement that was made by Oakland Mayor Jean Quan about a plan to "build a massive sports village at the Oakland Coliseum. Dubbed "Coliseum City," the project is designed to be privately funded and would include a new ballpark for the A's, a new stadium for the Raiders, and a new arena for the Warriors, along with a convention center, hotel, and retail strip." The A's and Warriors are looking into their own plans to move those two teams, but the Mayor wants to try to keep all three teams in Oakland.</p>

<p>Here is the East Bay Express article link:

<p><b>Segment #4: "The Tuck Rule Game Turns Ten Years Old. Why do we have to be reminded?"</b></p>

<p>Raider Greg is tired of being reminded of the Tuck Rule game, so this will be his third rant of the show.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders @ Chiefs Postgame"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders went into Arrowhead Stadium last Sunday and put an end to the Chiefs' playoff hopes by a score of 16-13 in overtime. It wasn't pretty, it took two blocked field goals by Richard Seymour, but the Raiders just won baby. Raider Greg gives his take on the game.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "Chargers @ Raiders Pregame"</b></p>

<p>The regular season winds down this Sunday and the Raiders are still in the playoff hunt. They can win the AFC West with a victory against the Chargers and a loss by the Broncos to the Chiefs. They can also make it as a wildcard with a little help. Raider Greg gives his feelings on this game and we hear a little audio from Hue Jackson (from Raiders.com). We also hear a radio segment from John Dickinson, Raiders beat reporter, via the Bay Area's only FM radio station 95.7 "The Game".</p>

The Broncos pulled off another late game victory to make six wins in a row and took a one game lead over the Raiders in the AFC West with three games to go. Can the Raiders still make the playoffs? They will probably have to win out in order to do it. If they do, they have a good chance at a wildcard spot even if they can't overtake the Broncos. Raider Greg doesn't think they can do it, based on their play of late. Denarius Moore may be back this game. Darren McFadden may be back soon. Can the Raiders pull it together in time? In addition to Raider Greg's take, we hear from others such as Hue Jackson, Bill Romanowski, and others via Raiders.com, 95.7 "The Game", and 1040 "The Fan".</p>

<p>Our Raiders' tidbit of the day is the Rolando McClain incident.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders Living On The Edge"</b></p>

<p>On the edge of a playoff birth that is. The Raiders are 7-4 with 5 games to go. Leading the AFC West, one game ahead of the Denver Broncos. Raider Greg thinks we should make the playoffs, and possibly go deep. Maybe into February?</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "Bears @ Raiders Postgame"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders defeated the Chicago Bears in Oakland by a score of 25-20. The Bears were without their QB Jay Cutler, but it was not an easy victory. The Bears threatened to take the lead right up to the end. Raider Greg was there and tells the story of our pre game tailgate party (with Bears fans) and the game.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Raiders @ Dolphins Pregame Breakdown"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders play the Dolphins in Miami this Sunday. Despite the Dolphins poor record this year, they have a dangerous team and Raider Greg goes over the match ups. We also hear the opinions of Carson Palmer (from "Behind the Shield Online" on Raiders.com) and Greg Gumbel (from the Bay Area's only FM radio station 95.7 "The Game").</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>TOPICS:</b></p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders trade for Carson Palmer"</b></p>

<p>On the final day of the NFL trading period, the Raiders traded a 1st round pick in 2012 and a 2nd/1st conditional pick in 2013 to the Bengals for Carson Palmer. The broken clavicle to Jason Campbell in the Browns game led to this move. Some think the price was too steep, but most of Raider Nation seems happy with the move. Raider Greg is happy and he tells you why.
<br /> 
<br />
<b>Segment #2: "Browns at Raiders Postgame Review"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders defeated the Browns 24-17 last Sunday after losing Jason Campbell to a broken clavicle early in the game. Although the Raiders lead by 14 points late in the game, the Browns made it too close for comfort by scoring a touchdown then recovering an onside kick. Raider Greg gives you his feelings on the game.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Chiefs at Raiders Pregame Breakdown"</b></p>

<p>The Chiefs are coming to town this Sunday. Carson Palmer may actually start the game according to some predictions, although Hue Jackson hasn't made his plans public officially. We break down the game.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders win one for Al Davis in Houston"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders had a VERY emotional win in Houston last Sunday. The game was won on an interception by Michael Huff (being called, "The Immaculate Interception") when the Raiders had only 10 men on the field. Afterwards Hue Jackson told the team that "Coach Davis" was the 11th man on the field during that last play. Raider Greg details the game and we include audio from Hue Jackson in the emotional locker room.
<br /> 
<br />
<b>Segment #2: "Amy Trask - CEO on the Go"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders are in good hands with Amy Trask as CEO. Raider Greg has met her, and tells you his feelings about her. We also include audio of a radio Amy did recently where she speaks of her long relationship with Al Davis and the emotional win in Houston. We also include audio of former Raiders players, coaches, and others who Al Davis' life had touched. We hear reactions from John Madden, Raymond Chester, John Gruden, and Greg Papa.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Cleveland Browns at Oakland Raiders Pregame"</b></p>

<p>The Browns are 2-2 and cannot be taken lightly in this game. It will be a special game. There will be special tributes to Al Davis both before the game and at half-time. Raider Greg breaks down this game matchup.</p>

<p><b>Segment #4: "Our Boneline Voicemail Segment"</b></p>

<p>In this show we have three sections to our Boneline portion of the show. The first section includes callers we had who wanted to pay their respects to Al Davis. The second section is short calls related to the win over the Texans. The third section has ten callers that had a little more to say, and Raider Greg gives his thoughts on their calls.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Patriots @ Raiders Postgame Review"</b></p>

<p>The Patriots defeated the Raiders 31-19 last Sunday in Oakland. The Raiders didn't look as sharp as they looked the previous week against the Jets. Penalties and interceptions were two key things that resulted in this loss. Raider Greg was at the game and gives you his recap, including the great time we had at the tailgate party as usual.
<br /> 
<br />
<b>Segment #2: "Raiders @ Texans Pregame Analysis"</b></p>

<p>The Texans are a tough team, but they will be without their Pro Bowl wide receiver Andre Johnson. If the Raiders can play like they did during the Broncos, Jets, and the first half of the Bills game....they have a good chance of winning this game. Raider Greg gives his thought on this, and details of the Raiders booster clubs that will be partying Saturday night and attending the game.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders @ Bills Postgame Disappointment"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders offense came out unbelievably well in Buffalo. The defense got an early interception. Special teams even blocked a punt! The Raiders led the favored Bills by a score of 21-3 at halftime. But the Bills offense came on strong in the second half, and the Raiders defense allowed 21 answered points. Five straight touchdowns. The Raiders offense kept pace for a while. The lead changed five times in the 4th quarter! But the Raiders fell short at the end. The Bills took the lead with 14 seconds remaining and a hail mary pass by the Raiders on the last play was almost completed but was intercepted. Raider Greg gives his recap of the game.

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders @ 49ers Postgame Review"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders lost in San Francisco by a score of 17-3. Our passing defense was disappointing. Our run defense was really disappointing. Our offense was not very point producing. Raider Greg gives you his view of the game.
<br /> 
<br />
<b>Segment #2: "Stadium Violence"</b></p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "The Raiders Acquire QB Terrelle Pryor in the Supplemental Draft"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders used a 3rd round pick in the 2012 draft to get Terrelle Pryor. He is definitely very fast, but can he become a top quarterback in the NFL? Some people are excited and think the Raiders made a smart move. Others think it was a "reach" and a mistake. Raider Greg gives his opinion.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Is there a possibility of the Raiders moving back to Los Angeles?"</b></p>

<p>A new NFL stadium is being built in Los Angeles for sure. Whatever team ends up playing there will not be a new expansion team, it will be an existing team that moves from their present city to L.A. The Raiders continue to be mentioned as one such possible team. Raider Greg is often asked his opinion on this situation, and he gives us his opinion briefly here.
<br /> 
<br />
<b>Segment #2: "Cardinals @ Raiders Postgame Review"</b></p>

<p>Raider Greg and I were at the game. The attendance at this game is listed on NFL.com as 25,699....but it sure didn't look like there were that many people in the seats. At any rate, we were there and Raider Greg tells you how he saw the game and gives you his opinion of our new rookies and our veterans.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Raiders @ 49ers this coming Saturday - A Must-Win Game"</b></p>

<p>All of Raider Nation is tired of the 49ers defeating us in the annual "Battle of the Bay". Regardless of how poorly the 49ers are playing, they seem to beat the Raiders more often than not lately. Raider Greg is also tired of this, and so he's calling this a "must-win game".</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "What the F&@# is Going On with the Raiders?"</b></p>

<p>Once the NFL lockout ended, Raider Nation was anxious for the Raiders to start making some moves to prepare our team for the 2011 season. We expected them to resign our critical players, do what they needed to do to get under the salary cap, then fill whatever holes were left on the roster. Well, things seemed to be moving slowly in Raiderland. We weren't hearing any news of any player transactions. Other teams were making moves. We tried to be patient. The news broke that Nnamdi Asomugha would be leaving the Raiders for the Eagles. We were disappointed, but not too surprised. As long as we resigned our other important players, maybe things would be ok. Then today Raider Nation was shocked to learn that Zach Miller had signed with the Seahawks. Raider Nation flipped out. Our boneline voicemail system went crazy. Raider Greg went crazy. You'll hear all about it in this story.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "Will the Raiders get a New Stadium? Will they share with the 49ers?"</b></p>

<p>There has been renewed talk about building a new stadium for the Raiders, and possibly sharing one with the 49ers. Will it be in Oakland at the site of the present Coliseum? Will it be in Santa Clara? Will it be elsewhere? Raider Greg gives you the story and his opinion.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "Rest in peace Raiders legend Skip Thomas"</b></p>

<p>A quick segment honoring the passing of Skip Thomas, who passed away on Sunday July 24th of a heart attack. A member of the "Soul Patrol" along with Jack Tatum and George Atkinson, Skip wore the silver and black from 1972 to 1977. Rest in peace Skip.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "The NFL Lockout is finally over!"</b></p>

<p>The owners voted 31-0 to approve their new CBA proposal. The Raiders abstained from the vote due to "philosophical differences". The players association agreed and signed yesterday. Raider Nation is excited. The season can finally get under way!</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "The Next Steps: What do the Raiders need to do to get to the next level?"</b></p>

<p> Now that the lockout is over, many things must get done in less than a week. Free agent signings, free agent acquisitions, start of training camp. What must the Raiders do to move to the next level? What do we need to do to get under the new salary cap? Should we try to keep Nnamdi Asomugha? Can we afford to? Should we go after any free agents? Do you think Al Davis will come up with a big deal on a new player? Raider Greg gives his opinions.</p>

A quick segment honoring the passing of Skip Thomas, who passed away on Sunday July 24th of a heart attack. A member of the "Soul Patrol" along with Jack Tatum and George Atkinson, Skip wore the silver and black from 1972 to 1977. Rest in peace Skip.

Segment #2: "The NFL Lockout is finally over!"

The owners voted 31-0 to approve their new CBA proposal. The Raiders abstained from the vote due to "philosophical differences". The players association agreed and signed yesterday. Raider Nation is excited. The season can finally get under way!

Segment #3: "The Next Steps: What do the Raiders need to do to get to the next level?"

 Now that the lockout is over, many things must get done in less than a week. Free agent signings, free agent acquisitions, start of training camp. What must the Raiders do to move to the next level? What do we need to do to get under the new salary cap? Should we try to keep Nnamdi Asomugha? Can we afford to? Should we go after any free agents? Do you think Al Davis will come up with a big deal on a new player? Raider Greg gives his opinions.

<p><b>Segment #2:  "Chuck Bresnahan is the Raiders Defensive Coordinator"</b></p>

<p><b>Segment #3:  "Interview with Gene Taylor, Ex-NFL Wide Receiver and now Firefighter Co-worker with Raider Greg"</b></p>

<p>Gene sat down and talked with Greg while they were on duty at the fire station on various topics concerning the NFL....least of which was the threat of an NFL Lockout. Gene had just started his rookie year in the NFL in 1987 when the players went out on strike, so he gives Greg his unique perspective on this topic. He also tells us all about his career which included playing for the New England Patriots, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Canadian Football League as well as the "World League" in Europe. Gene also has some Raider connections. Besides growing up in Oakland, one of Gene's college team-mates at Fresno State was none other than Raiders running backs coach Kelly Skipper. Gene also tells a story of how he crossed paths with Hue Jackson while playing in the World League. Hue was coaching for the London Monarchs, Gene played for the Barcelona Dragons, and they faced off against one another in the "World Bowl". Gene gives his personal insight on what it's like to play in the NFL, and I think you'll really enjoy this interview. This will be Part One of a two parts.

Gene had just started his rookie year in the NFL in 1987 when the players went out on strike, so he gives Greg his unique perspective on this topic. He also tells us all about his career which included playing for the New England Patriots, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Canadian Football League as well as the "World League" in Europe. Gene also has some Raider connections. Besides growing up in Oakland, one of Gene's college team-mates at Fresno State was none other than Raiders running backs coach Kelly Skipper. Gene also tells a story of how he crossed paths with Hue Jackson while playing in the World League. Hue was coaching for the London Monarchs, Gene played for the Barcelona Dragons, and they faced off against one another in the "World Bowl". Gene gives his personal insight on what it's like to play in the NFL, and I think you'll really enjoy this interview. This will be Part One of a two parts. Part Two of the interview will be on our next podcast, Show 305. You won't want to miss it.

<p><b>Segment #1: "Rod is God"</b></p>

<p>Pro Football Hall of Famer and Raiders Legend Rod Woodson has been hired as the Raiders Asst. Coach for the Cornerbacks. Some speculate that this may help keep Nnamdi Asomugha in Oakland. At the least, Rod's experience and knowledge will have to be a positive addition to the Raiders coaching staff. Raider Greg gives his opinion.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2:  "Michael Lombardi Speaks on Nnamdi Asomugha's free agency"</b></p>

<p>Former Raiders executive Michael Lambardi made the statement recently that he believes the chances of Nnamdi Asomugha staying in Oakland as being "slim to none"....favoring "none". He bases this partially on the move the Raiders made with Richard Seymour's new 30 Million dollar two year contract. Raider Greg gives his opinion.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3:  "Collective Bargaining Agreement Situation"</b></p>

<p>Will the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the NFL players and owners get renewed in time to have a full NFL season in 2011? Raider Greg goes over some of the issues and gives his opinion.</p>

<p>I borrowed the NFL Players Association banners from their website, where they have lots of information on the possible lockout here:

The Raiders go to Arrowhead Stadium for their final game of the 2010 season. If they win, it would be the first time the Raiders have swept their division since 1976. The Chiefs have said they will play this game to win, even though they are in the playoffs. We'll hear from Coach Cable and Coach Haley, and Raider Greg will give his thoughts on the game.

Segment #3:  "Coaching Changes in Oakland?"

Will Coach Cable remain the Raiders head coach in 2011. Will we even have football in 2011...or will there be a lockout? Will Hue Jackson remain our offensive coordinator and should he? What about John Marshall? Raider Greg gives his opinions on all these matters.

<p><b>Segment #1:  "Raiders @ Steelers Postgame"</b></p>

<p>A very disappointing outcome in Pittsburgh, with a 35-3 defeat by the Steelers. Raider Greg is upset to say the least, so be forewarned that this show is more explicit than usual. The fact that the Raiders lost was not as upsetting as the manner and extent to which they lost. The game started fairly competitively, but three turnovers, two of which turned into touchdowns for the Steelers, quickly turned this game into a one-sided affair. Raider Greg gives his opinion on the game and the state of the Raiders.</p>

<p>If you watch NFL coverage on national television or listen to nationally broadcast sports radio, the Raiders....dispite their resurgence this year.....are not getting much respect from sports media.

<p>Raider Greg gives his breakdown of this Sunday's matchup in Pittsburgh, plus we play some audio of what others are saying about it.

<p><b>Segment #1:  "Raiders Beat Chiefs In Overtime 23-20"</b></p>

<p>The Chiefs got out to a 10-0 lead early, the Raiders had little offensive output in the first half, but the defense was tough the whole game. Special teams started the 2nd half with a kickoff return for a touchdown and Raiders were on their way. The Raiders took the lead, the Chiefs took it back, then the Raiders tied the game at the end of regulation to send it into overtime. Jacoby Ford had one of several huge catches to set up the winning field goal after the Raiders defense held the Chiefs to 3 and out in their opening possession of overtime. We had lots of fun before the game at our tailgate party with visitors from London, Australia, and other places. Raider Greg tells the story.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1:  "The Silencing of the Lambs".... Rams at Raiders Postgame Review</b></p>

<p>The Raiders won their home opener by a score of 16-14 in a "tale of two halves". Jason Campbell played the first half, ending it with an interception and trailing the Rams at halftime 7-3. Coach Cable surprised the crowd, pleasantly, by opening the 3rd quarter with Bruce Gradkowski at the helm, and he led the Raiders to a hard-fought victory. Raider Greg was there and gives you his perspective.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2:  "Raiders at Cardinals Pregame Analysis"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders fly to Arizona next Sunday to take on the Cardinals. The Cards suffered a 41-7 defeat to the Falcons in week two, and Raider Greg is a little nervous about the Raiders having to face a team in their stadium who will want to rebound from such a big loss. But he still thinks the Raiders will win and he will tell you why.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1:  "Raiders at Tennessee Titans Postgame"</b></p>

<p>After a promising offseason and preseason, the Raiders had a disappointing loss to the Titans of 38-13. Greg and I were at the game with our listener and traveling companion Juan Jorge. At LP Field in Nashville we met up with RNP Boneline and Forum contributor Virginia Raider, his dad, Thomas Coke of the Smokey Mountain Raiders Booster Club, and many more great people. The Titans fans were very cordial hosts, even after their big win. They have a very nice stadium, maybe the nicest we've been to. Raider Greg breaks down the game and tells you the story of our experience in Tennessee.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2:  "Silence The Lambs"</b></p>

<p>The St. Louis Rams visit Oakland this Sunday, and Raider Greg gives a pregame breakdown of what the Raiders need to do. This game was reportedly close to selling out, but the latest news reports say that it will be blacked out locally. If you live in the Bay Area, get to the game and help cheer the Raiders to their first of hopefully many victories in 2010.</p>

Then he had to go into work at the fire station yesterday evening. I started editing the show, realized he hadn't responded to the last 4 callers....so in order to finish the show, Greg actually called the Boneline himself (in between running fire calls) in order to record his responses to the last 4 callers. So when you notice the dramatic difference in sound quality on his last 4 Boneline responses, that is the reason. Then the sound quality goes back to normal for the final show wrapup.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1:  "Da Bears Dominated by Da Raidas...32-17"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders starters opened their 2nd preseason gave against the Bears looking very sharp and crisp, moving the ball down the field in big chunks for an opening drive touchdown. Their defense looked very good as well, led by Kamerion Wimbley with his 4 first half sacks. Raider Greg gives you his thoughts on the game.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2:  "Battle of the Bay Pregame - Raiders vs 49ers"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders play the 49ers on Saturday August 28th. Raider Greg gives us a little warm up.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3:  "Raider Greg's Visit to Raiders Training Camp"</b></p>

<p>Greg and I (Randy) attended Raiders training camp along with several groups of Raiders booster clubs from around the area. One of our listeners, Raider Damien, allowed us to use his booster club pass into training camp. We had a good time, although it was HOT.....103 degrees. Greg says it was 106....but you are WRONG Greg....it was 103. I posted some photos I took that day on our forum (www.raidernationpodcast.com/forum) in the photos section. Coach Cable spoke with us after the practice, and the Raiders organization was very hospitable....providing all of us with several coolers full of cold bottled water. We also got to witness Coach Cable's after practice press conference as we were on our way out. Raider Greg tells the story.</p>

Their defense looked very good as well, led by Kamerion Wimbley with his 4 first half sacks. Raider Greg gives you his thoughts on the game.

Segment #2:  "Battle of the Bay Pregame - Raiders vs 49ers"

The Raiders play the 49ers on Saturday August 28th. Raider Greg gives us a little warm up.

Segment #3:  "Raider Greg's Visit to Raiders Training Camp"

Greg and I (Randy) attended Raiders training camp along with several groups of Raiders booster clubs from around the area. One of our listeners, Raider Damien, allowed us to use his booster club pass into training camp. We had a good time, although it was HOT.....103 degrees. Greg says it was 106....but you are WRONG Greg....it was 103. I posted some photos I took that day on our forum (www.raidernationpodcast.com/forum) in the photos section. Coach Cable spoke with us after the practice, and the Raiders organization was very hospitable....providing all of us with several coolers full of cold bottled water. We also got to witness Coach Cable's after practice press conference as we were on our way out. Raider Greg tells the story.

<p><b>Segment #2:  "Richard Seymour - No Long Term Contract This Year"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders gave up a 1st round pick in 2011 in order to trade for Richard Seymour in September of 2009. There was some criticism of this move at the time, with fans saying that it was risky to give up a 1st round pick to get Seymour for possibly just one year. No long-term contract was signed by the deadline, but the Raiders did make Seymour the Raiders "franchise player" for 2010, which means he will play a 2nd year in Oakland at a minimum. Any long-term deal will have to wait until after this season. Raider Greg gives his thoughts.</p>

<p>Raider Nation was excited at the beginning of the off-season in anticipation of possible big name free agent acquisitions, especially considering that 2010 is an "un-capped" year.

<p><b>Segment #1: "Raiders....Making A Move?....McNabb?"</b></p>

<p>The rumors that the Raiders are the "front runners" in the Donovan McNabb derby have been heating up for days, then recently there is no new news. "No Comment" from the Raiders. Everyone is on the edges of their seats waiting to find out what the Raiders will do. McNabb doesn't appear to be crazy about the idea of being traded to the Raiders, the he might not have a choice. Raider Nation is divided on whether or not it would be a good thing. Raider Greg give you the story and his opinion.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "JaMarcus Russell is booted from the Jenny Craig plan"</b></p>

<p>Willie Brown said that we would be "surprised" when we see JaMarcus, because one look at him will tell you he has lost a significant amount of weight. However, Tim Kawakami reported that J-Russ weighed in at 271 when he reported to the voluntary workouts. Then another report had him weighing in at 290. He has not been seen in public, other than the "moving interview" he had as he was driving out of Raiders headquarters after his first day there. What is the real story? Raider Greg gives you his thoughts.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "The NFL Draft Is Coming!"</b></p>

<p>Who will the Raiders draft? Greg discusses the possibilities, and gives his opinion.</p>

<p><b>Segment #1: "A New Suit For Tom Cable"</b></p>

<p>Randy Hanson has filed suit against Tom Cable AND the Oakland Raiders. The suit filed in Alameda County accuses Cable of assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It says the Raiders made only a cursory investigation of the attack and ratified Cable's conduct by failing to discipline him and by not allowing Hanson to remain as an assistant coach. Raider Greg gives details and his thoughts on the matter.</p>

<p><b>Segment #2: "SeaBass Kicked Some Ass"</b></p>

<p>Sebastian Janokowski, who would have been an Unrestricted Free Agent on March 5th, signed a new contract with the Raiders, making him by far the highest paid place kicker in NFL history. The four-year deal totals $16 million, with $9 million guaranteed. Raider Greg tells you why he thinks it's a good deal for the Raiders and for Jano.</p>

<p><b>Segment #3: "Seymour FRANCHISED!"</b></p>

<p>The Raiders placed the "Exclusive Franchise Player" tag on DE Richard Seymour to protect themselves from losing him to another ream without compensation. Seymour was the only one of six franchise players league wide to be given the “exclusive” designation, meaning no other teams can negotiate with him. This move guarantees Seymour $12 million dollars for the 2010 season (if he doesn't sign a long-term contract during the off-season). The franchise tag provides an opportunity for the Raiders to hold on to Seymour while the unstable market shakes itself out. The Raiders can then use the deal signed by other defensive ends to determine Seymour's value. Raider Greg gives you the details and his thoughts on the matter.</p>

<p><b>Segment #4:  The Boneline (our toll-free voicemail line) 1-800-620-7181</b></p>
