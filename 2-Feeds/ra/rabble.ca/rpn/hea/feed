 <itunes:summary>Healing the Earth Radio was produced in Guelph, Ontario, on CFRU 93.3 fm, from 2005 to 2010. Healing the Earth also had a popular podcast on the Rabble Podcast Network. Since the end of the show, producer Matt Soltys has been working on a book that is a collection of Healing the Earth Radio&#039;s most powerful interviews.

Tangled Roots: Dialogues exploring ecological justice, healing, and decolonization is due out this summer, published by Healing the Earth Press. Chosen from more than 100 interviews and hundreds of on-air hours, Tangled Roots explores critical yet marginalized intersections of social and ecological issues, and offers solutions that speak to the depth, complexity, and urgency of the challenges facing us today.

This podcast is a sneak peak at the book, with an excerpt from Healing the Earth&#039;s interview with Waziyatawin, Dakota activist and scholar. The podcast begins with a description of the Tangled Roots, and an audio recording of the introduction to Waziyatawin&#039;s chapter in the book. 

Any fans of Healing the Earth Radio should check out www.healingtheearthpress.org. The book is much more than simply an interview book - each of the 12 interviews comes with an introduction, extensive endnotes, and an original illustration drawn by an artist after contemplating each interview. Altogether, Tangled Roots is a unique project that hopes to build connections between different movements and get more people taking decolonization and ecological justice seriously.</itunes:summary>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a community-led occupation shut down a contentious industrial park in Guelph, five people were named in a $5 million lawsuit by the City of Guelph and a private developer.

 <itunes:summary>After a community-led occupation shut down a contentious industrial park in Guelph, 5 people were named in a $5 million lawsuit by the City of Guelph and a private developer. This is the audio from their press conference from April 23, where they outline their reasons for their actions, how this lawsuit is affecting their lives, and why it should be dropped. The press conference was in front of city hall and attended by upwards of 40 people.

This lawsuit is framed as a SLAPP suit, which stands for Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation. These are heavy-handed legal tactics designed to intimidate and silence people. Please check out the support site of The Hanlon Creek 5, to learn more about SLAPP suits, and their case in general.

The SLAPP suit alleges the 5 community activists are responsible for &quot;conspiracy, interference with economic relations, inducing breach of contract, trespass, nuisance, and intimidation.&quot; The $5 million is intended to hold the 5 responsible for potential lost future investment.

 <title>Defenders of the land: Indigenous survival and liberation in times of collapse</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/2010/03/defenders-land-indigenous-survival-and-liberation-times-collaps</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waziytawin is a Dakota writer, scholar, and activist, who urges Indigenous people as well as non-Indigenous people to think seriously about the threats of collapse and the need for land defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is from The Place Where They Dig for Yellow Medicine, also known as the Upper Sioux Reservation in southwestern Minnesota.  She also holds the Indigenous Peoples&#039; Research Chair in the Indigenous Governance program at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.  She is the author of numerous books on the Dakota nation and decolonization, and has been a strong community activist working on truth-telling initiatives in the Minnesota/St. Paul area.

 <itunes:summary>Waziytawin is a Dakota writer, scholar, and activist, who urges Indigenous People as well as non-Indigenous to think seriously about the threats of collapse and need for land defence.

She is from The Place Where They Dig for Yellow Medicine, also known as the Upper Sioux Reservation in southwestern Minnesota.  She also holds the Indigenous Peoples’ Research Chair in the Indigenous Governance program at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.  She is the author of numerous books on the Dakota nation and decolonization, and has been a strong community activist working on truth-telling initiatives in the Minnesota/St. Paul area.  You can learn more about her at www.waziyatawin.net.

Recently Waziyatawin has been intertwining her interest in decolonization and Indigenous liberation with research around climate collapse and peak oil, and believes that we can&#039;t simply wait for an end to the extreme destruction caused by industrial civilization - we need to take action and help bring it to and end, so that our chances for future survival are the greatest.

Waziyatawin offers something very important with this interview, that is, connecting a recognition of the great changes upon us with an anti-colonial perspective as an Indigenous woman. 

Industrial civilization now threatens not just our individual landbases, but the entire earth, and more than ever we are in need of people who are willing to be defenders of the land.  Waziyatawin talks about some of the cultural myths that colonialism has infected all of us with to varying degrees, myths about the legitimacy and permanence of the US and Canadian governments, myths of technological prowess, myths of passivity to authority, and myths of the moral purity of non-violence.  In a time of such dire need, she urges us to re-consider all of these and seriously consider how we can best serve our landbase, and best prepare our community for an end to an industrial way of life.


As an action plan to base a community&#039;s preparation on, she has put forth several steps: having a spiritual and cultural foundation, 
building a culture of resistance, 
arming yourself and your community, 
building lifeboats of skills, tools, and knowledge to be self-sufficient, 
taking back land, 
halting the industrial infrastructure that is destroying the land, and 
defending the land at all costs.   

She asks questions that need to be asked and answered.  I hope you enjoy this interview and are able to give it some serious thought.

 <title>Interview with Dave Schultz, Manager of Communications with the Grand River Conservation Authority</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/2009/09/interview-dave-schultz-manager-communications-grand-river-conse</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Schultz is the Manager of Communications for the GRCA, and this interview is about the culvert construction for the HCBP infrastructure, and the City of Guelph&#039;s bid to extend the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since one of the goals of the July 27 &lt;a href=&quot;http://hcbpoccupation.wordpress.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;occupation &lt;/a&gt;has succeeded - to make it impossible for the City of Guelph to do this infrastructure work by their deadline - the City now wants to have the rules changed.  There has been confusion abound about when the actual deadline is, some sources have said September 15, others September 30.  This interview clears up some of this, and addresses what is currently happening with regards to a possible extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/2009/09/interview-dave-schultz-manager-communications-grand-river-conse&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>The struggle to protect Guelph&#039;s Old Growth Forest and thwart Guelph&#039;s newest and largest industrial development</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/2009/07/struggle-protect-guelphs-old-growth-forest-and-thwart-guelphs-n</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the heart of Southwestern Ontario, Guelph&#039;s Old Growth forest is under threat of being surrounded by a 675-acre corporate industrial development. Community efforts to protect this land continue, and time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent efforts have been spearheaded by several groups, including LIMITS (Land Is More Important Than Sprawl), which began organizing in the community and raising awareness in late 2008.  This interview with a member of LIMITS gives an overview of the issues at stake, including recent updates on impending construction, the status of Federally and Provincially-protected species on the site, and the connections between colonialism, public health, sustainable growth, biotechnology, and other related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/2009/07/struggle-protect-guelphs-old-growth-forest-and-thwart-guelphs-n&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Guelph&#039;s Old Growth forest is under threat of being surrounded by a 675-acre corporate industrial development. Community efforts to protect this land continue, and time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recent efforts have been spearheaded by several groups, including LIMITS (Land Is More Important Than Sprawl), which began organizing in the community and raising awareness in late 2008.  This interview with a member of LIMITS gives an overview of the issues at stake, including recent updates on impending construction, the status of Federally and Provincially-protected species on the site, and the connections between colonialism, public health, sustainable growth, biotechnology, and other related issues. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The grassroots struggle to protect this land has included, over the years, many public educational events, walking tours of the land, Ontario Municipal Board hearings, standing-room-only town hall debates, packed public hearings, countless meetings between activists and city staff and consultants, camp outs on the land, months of door-to-door conversations, healing ceremonies, and much more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Participation in this struggle has included long-time environmentalists, citizens watchdogs, youth and elders, musicians, dance groups, anarchists, Indigenous People of the Anishnabe and Haudenosaunee, and many many more.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first stage of infrastructure construction is already beginning on the land.  Check out www.LandIsMoreImportantThanSprawl.com for more information.  Also, email guelphlimits@gmail.com for more information.

 <title>Root Force: Examining the Costs of Infrastructure and Industrial Culture</title>

 <itunes:summary>Ben and Toby from Root Force explore many different angles on industrial infrastructure - from major highways, shipping networks, mines, oil and gas industries, etc - and its connections with colonialism in the western hemisphere, labour issues and the state of the economy, its cumulative costs to the earth, and the need to strategically resist industrial projects. 

The analysis of Root Force differ greatly from mainstream environmentalism, in that it offers a systemic look at the foundations the system, and sees the need for a complete overhaul, rather than various reforms. 

Interestingly, though it might seem overwhelming to consider one&#039;s ability to do anything about such large systems of power, Ben and Toby suggest that because these infrastructure projects affect so many different areas and issues, there is more of an opportunity for relationships of solidarity between people from different landbases opposing the same projects.  An example would be the I-69 highway, which travels through Ontario to Indianapolis, via Michigan.

Especially in this time of ecological and economic collapse, amid a flurry of &#039;stimulus&#039; packages and such, you may find their analysis and suggestions relevant and useful to your own life.</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;In this interview with Ramona Africa, conducted on the 24th anniversary&lt;br /&gt;of the May 13, 1985 police bombing of MOVE headquarters, Ramona shares life lessons about freedom, standing up for oneself and one&#039;s family, being true and honest with ourselves and our principles, and her concept of &#039;total revolution&#039; - all learned through enduring violent repression, maximum prison terms, and decades of community&lt;br /&gt;organizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/2009/05/ramona-africa-24th-anniversary-police-bombing-move-headquarters&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

of the May 13, 1985 police bombing of MOVE headquarters, Ramona shares life lessons about freedom, standing up for oneself and one&#039;s family, being true and honest with ourselves and our principles, and her concept of &#039;total revolution&#039; - all learned through enduring violent repression, maximum prison terms, and decades of community
organizing.

MOVE is a revolutionary organization based in Philadelphia, advocating peace, justice, respect for all life, and revolution, for over 35 years.  Ramona was the sole adult survivor of the 1985 police bombing, which killed 6 adults, five children, and numerous animals.

This is an astounding historical conflict between grassroots organizers and the
state, and is entirely relevant to today.  I highly recommend checking out their website, www.onamove.com, and reading more elsewhere from the plethora of articles, about the numerous full-out assaults on MOVE members.  As Ramona describes in this interview, it is truly mind-blowing that 8 people remain in prison for 31 years now, for a crime they did not commit.  

Check out their website, learn about this important history, and consider what you can do to help get the remaining MOVE prisoners out of prison.

Leah has lectured, written about and worked on dolphin protection, education and conservation issues for twenty years, collaborating with individuals and NGOs from a number of countries, including the Jane Goodall Institute’s Roots &amp;amp; Shoots Environmental and Humanitarian program. Most recently she has contributed an essay on Cetaceans and Eco-tourism for The Encyclopedia of Human-Animal Relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In our interview, Leah explains the dark side of the increasinly-popular tourist activity of swimming with dolphins, and touches on the shared issues of captivity that plague humans and many other creatures.  We talk of this issue&#039;s connections with the capitalist system that forces most of us into some form of captivity, and the conundrum of people engaging in destructive activity in order to feed their families and pay rent and mortgages.  Leah sees it being all connected, and thus anything we are doing to help in turn supports other issues for freedom and justice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolphins in particular are a powerful species, who have had brains proportionally bigger than our brains for 15 times longer than us.  Once living as land-based mammals, about 50 million years ago dolphins went back in the water, and have evolved to have an amazingly complex social system.  In many ways dolphins are more communicative and social than humans (or at least industrialized and civilized humans; those still living with a semblance of tribalism may be a different story).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Leah has had the fortune of interacting with wild dolphins in a mutually voluntary setting, where the dolphins were actually there because they want to be, not because they were forced to.  It is these voluntary interactions with wild creatures that can touch something deep inside of us, a part of us that has been smothered with layers and layers of disconnection.  Leah ends our interview with her vision of a path towards a solution, which includes several steps:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; realization of what&#039;s going on, taking responsibility, reconnection with our surroundings, including people and place, and restoration, and getting active. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

Pollution Probe, now in it&#039;s 40th year, focuses on researching and advocating for changes to do with climate change, energy, air, water, environmental health effects, and policy.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering what&#039;s in the air?  Or what&#039;s going on with air pollution these days? Quentin and I talk a whole bunch about air pollution, its main sources, components, health effects, and such.  We also get into the topic of climate change, including how it connects to air pollution.  And we also address the conundrum that the main sources of pollution are industrial operations that people have come to depend on, and have forgotten how to live without.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview focuses on Southwestern Ontario and the Greater Toronto Area, but is still completely relevant to those in other areas.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

 <title>Since the Last Ice Age: Original People In and Around Guelph, and the Proposed Hanlon Creek Business Park</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/last-ice-age-original-people-and-around-guelph-and-proposed-hanlon-cree</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Poulton is an archaeologist based in London, Ontario. He was commissioned to do an archaeological assessment of the proposed Hanlon Creek Business Park, based on the south end of Guelph. It turns out that humans have been using this particular land for as long as 11,000 years ago, since the land shifted from a colder tundra to a fertile garden of eden, that lasted up until European immigrants clearcut the land to create an agricultural colony, now called Guelph. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dana and his crew found things like spear tips, arrowheads, and other stone tools for preparing animal hides and cutting animal bones. Other things that would have been there, things made out of wood, sinew, and hide, have long since decayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/last-ice-age-original-people-and-around-guelph-and-proposed-hanlon-cree&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <itunes:summary>  &lt;p&gt;Dana Poulton is an archaeologist based in London, Ontario. He was commissioned to do an archaeological assessment of the proposed Hanlon Creek Business Park, based on the south end of Guelph. It turns out that humans have been using this particular land for as long as 11,000 years ago, since the land shifted from a colder tundra to a fertile garden of eden, that lasted up until European immigrants clearcut the land to create an agricultural colony, now called Guelph. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dana and his crew found things like spear tips, arrowheads, and other stone tools for preparing animal hides and cutting animal bones. Other things that would have been there, things made out of wood, sinew, and hide, have long since decayed. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dana talks about some of the history of the Neutral nation, the original people who lived around the Guelph area, but who mainly settled around the western shore of Lake Ontario, the headwaters of the Niagara river, and to a lesser extent around the Grand river, near present-day settlements of Fergus and Elora. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Neutrals lived in between the Huron nation and the Haudenosaunee (Six Nations/Iroquios), until they were wiped out and displaced by the Haudenosaunee in 1651. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also on this particular piece of land is a spectacular old growth forest, situated right in the center of the proposed industrial development. The old growth forest and the surrounding land contains more than 100 old growth trees, including 200-300 year old hemlock, beech, yellow birch, blue beech, shagbark hickory, and sugar maple trees, a 400 year old black cherry tree, and a 500 year old hop hornbeam tree. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The proposed Hanlon Creek Business Park is a sprawling 675-acre corporate and industrial development that the city wants to surround this old growth forest with. Besides the old growth forest, it is also home to deer, coyote, fox, salamanders, turtles, snakes, five different species of hawk, and many, many more special creatures. Also, it is a provincially significant wetland and the recharge zone for the Hanlon creek, which supplies 20% of Guelph&#039;s drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A newly-formed group of Guelph locals has formed to oppose the HCBP as it nears it&#039;s date of destruction.

 <title>Tyendinaga: The Struggle for Drinking Water and the Health of the Land Continues</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/tyendinaga-struggle-drinking-water-and-health-land-continues</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I spoke with Dan Doreen, a Mohawk from the community of Tyendinaga, which is located in Southeastern Ontario near Belleville.  Dan has been on Healing the Earth several times before; he is one of many people from Tyendinaga who are fighting a new police station that the band council and the provincial and federal governments are trying to bring in to their community.&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>The Long-Standing Conflict With the Algonquins of Barriere Lake</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/long-standing-conflict-algonquins-barriere-lake</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I spoke with Marylynn Poucachice from the Algonquin community of Barriere Lake, which continues to deal with the problems of colonization of their land and people.  For a preface to the interview, youth spokesperson Norman Matchewan says it best: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; In 1991, Barrière Lake signed a historic trilateral agreement with Canada and Quebec to sustainably develop our traditional territories - a United Nations report called the plan an environmental &quot;trailblazer.&quot; Yet in 1996, the federal government tried to hijack the agreement by replacing our legitimate chief and council with a minority faction who let the agreement fall aside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/long-standing-conflict-algonquins-barriere-lake&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Speaking About Land Reclamations with &#039;Boots&#039; from Six Nations</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/speaking-about-land-reclamations-boots-six-nations</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boots has been living in a teepee on a construction site in Brantford, Ontario, since July. He&#039;s from Six Nations, and they&#039;ve been shutting numerous development sites over the years due to concerns of land rights and ecology.  What most people think began in February 2006 on the edge of Caledonia, the site that blew up into a world-renowned conflict, actually began long before that, and has kept going ever since.  The site Boots has been living on was slated to be a fiberglass insulation factory, right next to a large Hampton Inn hotel, which has also been shut down.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/speaking-about-land-reclamations-boots-six-nations&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Industry and Military vs. Marine Life: Seems They Can&#039;t Coexist</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/industry-and-military-vs-marine-life-seems-they-cant-coexist</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I spoke with Kim Elmslie, a campaign coordinator for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifaw.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Fund for Animal   Welfare&lt;/a&gt;, who spoke about a recently-published report by IFAW, about   the threat to marine life from noise pollution.  It made me recall   reports I had read about whales washing up dead on shores, with blood   coming from their ears and hemmorhaged brains, just after the US military   conducted underwater sonar testing nearby.  It turns out that not only is   military testing killing marine life and ruining the lives of surviving   populations, but all the noise from oil rigs, shipping, and other   industrial activity is also to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/industry-and-military-vs-marine-life-seems-they-cant-coexist&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She was being paid by the FBI   to fish for people at protests who she could convince to conspire with   her to engage in illegal direct actions.  Eric and two others, Zachary   Jenson and Lauren Weiner, were involved in a plot &#039;Anna&#039; led; Zachary and   Lauren decided to plead guilty and testify against Eric, while Eric held   out as not-guilty, maintaining that the whole thing was a trap.

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 100 Innu families who are now occupying and using their   traditional homeland in Newfoundland Labrador recently received eviction   notices from the provincial government of Newfoundland Labrador.  The   Removal Notices direct Innu families to &quot;remove all structures from Crown   land and restore the site to its original conditions within 60 days of   notice.&quot;  Failure to do so will result in the Crown Lands Division   demolishing their homes and charging the costs of demolition to the Innu   families.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/government-newfoundland-labrador-seeks-evict-innu&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>What Does Decolonization Look Like?</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/what-does-decolonization-look</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  What Does Decolonization Look Like?  Minnesota Turns 150 and Nothing Much  Has Changed  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; In early May 2008, the state of Minnesota turned 150 years old.  People   fond of such things sought to have a celebration of this sesquicentennial   anniversary, which included several days of events.  What the organizers   of this anniversary neglected to include in their accounts of history is   the genocide against the Dakota nation, whose homeland was destroyed in   order to create the state of Minnesota.  This involved state-sanctioned   ethnic cleansing, concentration camps, hangings, bounties, massive   displacements, and an overall campaign of violence and fear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/what-does-decolonization-look&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Two Six Nations Men Facing Extraordinary Imprisonment in the US</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/two-six-nations-men-facing-extraordinary-imprisonment-us</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two Six Nations men, Albert Douglas and Trevor Miller, are being indicted   to a US federal grand jury for incidents stemming from the 2006 Six   Nations land reclamation outside the town of Caledonia.  Albert Douglas   was allegedly with Trevor Miller when a US Border Patrol vehicle was seen   on their territory during the height of the land reclamation.  It turned   out that the vehicle was carrying a member of the US Bureau of Alcohol   Tobacco and Firearms and members of the Ontario Provincial Police, and   contained surveillance equipment and confidential documents about   undercover OPP and US agents used to infiltrate the land reclamation.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/two-six-nations-men-facing-extraordinary-imprisonment-us&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Tyendinaga Mohawks Successfully Stop Another Illegal Developement</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I spoke with Dan Doreen, from the community of Tyendinaga, about an   illegal residential development that was stopped from occurring.  The   land in question is part of the Culbertson Tract, which includes the   small town of Deseronto, in southeastern Ontario. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Two developers, Theo and Emile Nibourg, claim title to the Mohawk land,   and had planned to build 220-240 residential units.  On Monday morning,   people from Tyendinaga blocked the main road going through Deseronto, and   after a 24 hour period, the Nibourgs have agreed not to do anymore work   on the land.  Those involved in the blockade are committed to not   allowing any kind of development within the Culbertson Tract.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/tyendinaga-mohawks-successfully-stop-another-illegal-developement&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Native Bumblebees are Going Extinct</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/native-bumblebees-are-going-extinct</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I spoke with Sheila Colla, a PhD candidate at York University in Toronto,   about the extinction of several species of bumblebees who once lived in   Southern Ontario.  Many people are familiar with how honeybees have been   affected by Colony Collapse Disorder, and now bumblebees are experiencing   significant declines in population.  While honeybees have been imported   from Europe and Africa, bumblebees are native to Turtle Island.  Since so   many native plants have co-evolved with bumblebees, requiring them for   pollination, these extinctions could pose serious trouble for the rest of   the ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/native-bumblebees-are-going-extinct&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Courage, Culture, and Sacrifice</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/courage-culture-and-sacrifice</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Healing the Earth Radio hosts Kingston Indigenous Solidarity Network member Matt Silburn&#039;s interview with Mohawk Warrior Shawn Brant.&amp;nbsp;  Shawn is currently facing a multi-million dollar lawsuit from CN Rail, and 12 years in prison, due to the actions him and his community in Tyendinaga have made.  I chose to host this interview because both times I have played it on the air, people have called in to express how inspired and moved they are from hearing Shawn speak.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/courage-culture-and-sacrifice&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Pre-Dawn Paramilitary Raid on Bear Mountain Tree Sit</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/pre-dawn-paramilitary-raid-bear-mountain-tree-sit</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just one week after the first interview with people from the Bear Mountain tree sit, a force dozens of armed RCMP officers stormed the forest to evict them.  As people were being led away in handcuffs, workers were already beginning to cut down the forest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, February 13, everyone in the tree sit camp was arrested. Three people, including two tree sitters, were held and charged with mischief and obstructing a highway. They have now been released.&amp;nbsp; The massive attack by police involved as many as 300 RCMP officers, dozens of them with assault rifles drawn and pointed at the campers.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/pre-dawn-paramilitary-raid-bear-mountain-tree-sit&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Bear Mountain Tree Sit Under Threat</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/bear-mountain-tree-sit-under-threat</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since April 10, 2007, a tree sit and forest squat has been in the way of a proposed highway interchange that is designed to serve the massive Bear Mountain Resort development.&amp;nbsp; It has gathered widespread support from the surrounding community, yet been opposed by those in power in the municipality.&amp;nbsp; They are threatened with eviction beginning in March, and need all the help they can get.&amp;nbsp; You can visit their website at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://treesit.blogspot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Tree Sit&quot;&gt;treesit.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this interview, I speak with one of the organizers, who has some inspiring messages for us all.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a communique recently issued by the people involved in the tree sit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/bear-mountain-tree-sit-under-threat&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>A Hard Look at Agriculture, and Strategies for Collapse</title>
 <link>http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/hard-look-agriculture-and-strategies-collapse</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Lierre Keith is the author of the novels Skyler Gabriel and Conditions of War, as well as the forthcoming The Vegetarian Myth.  In this interview we talk about the topics she explores in that most recent book. I haven&#039;t read Jared Diamond&#039;s work, but I know he also seriously tackles the issue of agriculture. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For me, Lierre&#039;s is the most solid critique of agriculture I have come across. She talks about how it is at it&#039;s most basic level a war against life and the earth, outlining the ecological impacts of agriculture, which includes it&#039;s effects on topsoil, which is the basis of all life.  Sustainable agriculture will always be an oxymoron, and with the fossil fuel era coming to a close, we have to start thinking out of the agricultural box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rabble.ca/podcasts/shows/healing-earth/hard-look-agriculture-and-strategies-collapse&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
