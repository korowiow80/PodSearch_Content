      <description><![CDATA[Bob Zadek interviews Carolyn Ford, candidate for Sausalito City Council.  Are we handling the bike issue  properly?  If not, what would you do to change that?  Are the city's finances in good  order?.  If not, would you increase income (better known as fees and  taxes) or decrease expenses.  Please be specific.    What is your vision for  Marinship?  Please be as specific as you can.   Do we have enough land dedicated  to parks, or would you increase it?  As you know, any increase in park  land has a cost, since the land is no longer producing tax revenue.    "Development" is a hot  button word in town.  What does that word mean to you.  Applying  your definition, identify one development project, actual or planned   which you endorse and one which you oppose, and why?    What level of loyalty do you owe  to those who have supported your candidacy?   What is the one quality of life  in our town which you wish were different?   Comment on the city's  consideration of the use of eminent domain regarding the  Gossage  property.     <br /> ]]></description>
