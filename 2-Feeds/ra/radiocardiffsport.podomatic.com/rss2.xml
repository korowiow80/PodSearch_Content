- Also, we debate the state of racism in the host countries. With Sol Campbell and others warning black fans and families not to travel to the tournament, we ask whether it is appropriate for Ukraine and Poland to be hosts at all.

- The Olympic flame was in Cardiff on Friday and Saturday with crowds of people attending a party in Cooper&#8217;s Field, but how big an impact can the Olympics have here in Wales?

- England have wrapped up a series win against West Indies at Trent Bridge spearheaded by another century from Andrew Strauss and excellent bowling from Anderson, Broad and Bresnan.

- Yousef has his regular UFC update with guest Andy Matthews.

- And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, there&#8217;s studio guest Lee-Ann Falconer from our sponsors Virgin Active Cardiff!</description>

- With more and more allegations of racism in sport, particularly football, surfacing in the wake of the John Terry incident, we discuss the role charities, campaigners, sportsmen and women and the public can play in eradicating the problem. 

- We also hear about peoples&#8217; personal experiences of racism in the sporting environment and about the work of Show Racism the Red Card Wales in schools, local clubs and the community.

- Is the lack of black and Asian managers and coaches indicative of racial problems in football?

- And within Wales and the UK what more needs to be done to eradicate racism once and for all?

      <itunes:summary>- In this special podcast we have special studio guests Sunil Patel and Simon Richards from Show Racism the Red Card Wales and Welsh footballer, Nana Baah, himself a victim of racist abuse.

- With more and more allegations of racism in sport, particularly football, surfacing in the wake of the John Terry incident, we discuss the role charities, campaigners, sportsmen and women and the public can play in eradicating the problem. 

- We also hear about peoples&#8217; personal experiences of racism in the sporting environment and about the work of Show Racism the Red Card Wales in schools, local clubs and the community.

- Is the lack of black and Asian managers and coaches indicative of racial problems in football?

- And within Wales and the UK what more needs to be done to eradicate racism once and for all?
