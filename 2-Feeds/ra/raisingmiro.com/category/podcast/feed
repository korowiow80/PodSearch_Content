<h3>Episode #31  we explore one of the indigenous cultures in Peru&#8217;s Amazon, the Shipibo. This podcast includes an interview with a Shipibo artist who shares with us an emotional song.</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10849" title="Robert_Lainie" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Robert_Lainie-300x268.jpg" alt="" width="200" /></p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Podcast Episode #31</strong>. This podcast  focuses on the culture of the Shipibo people of the Amazon jungle region in Peru. We examine some of the challenges facing the indigenous peoples of the world and specifically at the struggles of the Shipibo. This podcast includes an interview with a Shipibo artisan, in which we only scratch the surface in terms of exploring this beautiful culture. However, our hopes are that this podcast creates inspiration within you, our listeners and readers that you seek more information on this and other indigenous cultures.</p>
<h2>Indigenous Peoples of Our Planet</h2>
<p>Over 95% of the world’s high-biodiversity areas overlap with lands claimed by indigenous peoples, partly because biodiversity is central to indigenous sustenance and partly because indigenous lands have not been subject to the intensive development responsible for destroying the natural biosphere. As a result, today indigenous peoples are traditional stewards of 80% of the earth’s remaining nature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10854" title="Shipibo_art4" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Shipibo_art4.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples throughout the world are as diverse as the places they live. Yet indigenous communities live with an intimate connection with the natural world and commonly share similar values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A deep value and spiritual connection between life and the eco-systems that sustains it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The sense of nature as a teacher.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The unique value of nature as life.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Honoring the interdependence between natural life and the viewpoint that all life is connected.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maintaining a sense of responsibility for their actions as a contributor to the ecosystem of an interdependent world.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>According to <a href="http://holdenma.wordpress.com/culture-and-environment/indigenous-peoples/" target="_blank">Our Earth/ Ourselves</a>  web site, Indigenous peoples of the world characteristically maintain these values:</em></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><img class="alignleft" title="indigenous people" src="http://australia.gov.au/AGOSP/agencies/culture/library/images/site_images/indigenouspeople1.jpg" alt="" height="130" /></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
<li>Gratitude and reverence</li>
<li>Sharing</li>
<li>Cooperation</li>
<li>Reciprocity</li>
<li>Humility</li>
<li>Balance</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The Shipibo</h2>
<p>The modern Shipibo culture consists of around 35,000 people living in over three hundred villages in the Pucallpa region. Their communities are mostly situated along the Río Ucayali. The Río Ucayali joins the Río Marañon to form the mighty Río Amazonas, the longest and largest river in the world. The Río Amazonas flows northward past Iquitos on its long journey north to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The Shipibo people speak a native language, but today, most speak Spanish as well. Despite 300 years of sporadic contact with European and mestizo &#8220;civilization&#8221; and massive conversion to Christianity in the 1950&#8242;s and 60&#8242;s, the Shipibo people maintain a strong tribal identity and retain many of their ancient shamanic traditions and beliefs.</p>

<p>Shipibo artisans are well-known for their intricate designs on their pottery and colorful fabrics depicting their Ayahuasca-based cosmology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the proximity of most Shipibo communities to the burgeoning city of Pucallpa has made it inevitable that their culture has become altered by mainstream trade, exploitation and encroachment of western values. Still, the Shipibo are a resilient people.</p>
<h2>Ayahuasca-based cosmology</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Shipibo_art1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10851" title="Shipibo_art1" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Shipibo_art1-300x242.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="242" /></a>In this podcast, you will hear Robert sharing with us the mythology of ayahuasca in the form of a traditional Shipibo song. Robert sang the song with such emotion. He went on singing for us for almost five minutes, sharing with us the traditional story of his people. The ceremony involved with taking the plant medicine Ayahuasca is not for entertainment purposes. It&#8217;s a healing voyage guided by their deceased ancestors.</p>
<p>Even though we did not understand the words of the song, we understood the voyage shared with us through Robert&#8217;s raw emotions. His singing brought tears to his eyes and in turn, transferred his passion into our experience as well.</p>
<h3><em>What is Ayahuasca? </em></h3>
<p>Ayahuasca is a medicinal tea prepared from Banisteriopsis Caapi, a jungle vine, found in the tropical regions of South America, often combined with other plants, commonly Chacruna/Rainha (Queen); Psychotria Viridis.<br />
<a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Shipibo_art2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10852" title="Shipibo_art2" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Shipibo_art2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="477" /></a></p>
<p>The practice of &#8216;taking&#8217; Ayahuasca has a rich legacy of associated traditions, myths, therapies and rituals , spanning from the primordial roots of the indigenous tribes of South America, including those of the Shipibo. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The brew, first described academically in the early 1950s by Harvard ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes, who found it employed for divinatory and healing purposes by the native peoples of Amazon. How indigenous peoples discovered the synergistic properties of the plants used in the ayahuasca brew remains unclear. While many indigenous Amazonian people say they received the instructions directly from plants and plant spirits, researchers have devised a number of alternative theories to explain its discovery.<br />
<em>Although we have not had a personal experience with ayahuasca as of yet, we found the ancient traditions of this plant medicine to be intriguing. If you are interested in learning more about ayahuasca, we found a wonderful <a href="http://www.ayahuasca.com/" target="_blank">ayahuasca resource online</a> that includes many articles on ayahuasca if you wish to research further.</em></p></blockquote>
<h1>Pucallpa</h1>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pucallpa" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p>Pucallpa (Quechua: puka allpa, &#8220;red earth&#8221;) is a city in eastern Peru located on the banks of the Ucayali River, a major tributary of the Amazon River. It is the capital of the Ucayali region, the Coronel Portillo Province and the Calleria District.</p>
<p>Pucallpa was founded in the 1840s by Franciscan missionaries who settled several families of the Shipibo-Conibo ethnic group. For several decades it remained a small settlement as it was isolated from the rest of the country by the Amazon Rainforest and the Andes mountain range. From the 1880s through the 1920s a railway project to connect Pucallpa with the rest of the country via the Ferrocarril Central Andino was started and dropped several time until it was finally abandoned. Pucallpa&#8217;s isolation finally ended in 1945 with the completion of a highway to Lima through Tingo Maria.</p>

By observing and depicting nature, people &#8211; especially young children &#8211; become more aware of its beauty and richness, and they learn to respect it.

<h2><em><strong>Non-Profit Organizations:</strong></em></h2>
<h3><strong><a href="http://shipiboshinan.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Shipiboshinan (Shipobo thought)</a></strong></h3>
<p>This NGO website in English offers a glimpse of Shipobo life and describes some of the projects it had initiated to respond to the community&#8217;s economic poverty and support cultural preservation. From the NGO&#8217;s first post in August 2011 (last post in September 2011):</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Maybe our biggest originality is that the whole project, since its original idea to the way of achieving our goals, emanates from the medicine, through the visions of ayahuasca. Our project is born from the harmonious meeting of westerner and Shipibo practitioners and beneficiaries of the medicine, working together with the spirits of plants and nature to bring a better future to theShipibo people and the world.</em><em>The NGO’s first objective is overseeing the construction of a large project whose long term goal is the full development of the whole Shipibo people. It will work towards the implementation of various projects in all areas including whatever the Shipibo need today: agriculture with the creation of seed banks to prevent situations of extreme weather, livestock and fish farming, construction, water supplies, education, communication, health and culture.</em></p>
<p><em>The NGO’s strategy for succeeding is by fully valuing and using all the resources of the Amazonian traditional medicine. By advertising a <strong>new tourism</strong> based on education and ecology, but also on the <strong>Shipibo medicine</strong> which is unique in the world, the NGO hopes to contribute significantly to the economic and social development of all the Shipibo communities in the Ucayali region, centred on the city of Pucallpa in Peru. In the long term, this work will contribute to the wellbeing of all Peruvians, including the Indian Mestizos and other communities like Ashaninka.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3><a href="http://alianzaarkana.org/" target="_blank">Alianza Arkana</a></h3>
<p>Alianza Arkana is a Peruvian non-profit, non-governmental organization with offices in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest, in the regional capitals of Iquitos and Pucallpa. Our sister organization in the United States is The Arkana Alliance, based in San Francisco and is fiscally sponsored by SEE (501c3).</p>
<p>Alianza Arkana is committed to raising awareness about the current environmental and social crises in the Amazon; supporting the creation, connection and strengthening of strategic networks and regional and community-based alliances; and inspiring positive change at local, national and international levels to protect and preserve the people, environment, and ancient traditions of the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest.</p>

<p>The Amazon is under siege by destructive and unsustainable practices driven by prevailing social and economic policies. Through community-based projects, field investigations, activism and strategic communications inside and outside Peru, Alianza Arkana is deeply committed to bringing urgent attention to the grave risks we all face if the destruction of the Amazon continues. Through our many partnerships and programs we seek viable alternatives and a new paradigm of sustainable development.</p></blockquote>

We examine some of the challenges facing the indigenous peoples of the world and specifically at the struggles of the Shipibo. This podcast includes an interview with a Shipibo artisan, in which we only scratch the surface in terms of exploring this beautiful culture. However, our hopes are that this podcast creates inspiration within you, our listeners and readers that you seek more information on this and other indigenous cultures.
Indigenous Peoples of Our Planet
Over 95% of the world’s high-biodiversity areas overlap with lands claimed by indigenous peoples, partly because biodiversity is central to indigenous sustenance and partly because indigenous lands have not been subject to the intensive development responsible for destroying the natural biosphere. As a result, today indigenous peoples are traditional stewards of 80% of the earth’s remaining nature.

Indigenous peoples throughout the world are as diverse as the places they live. Yet indigenous communities live with an intimate connection with the natural world and commonly share similar values:

A deep value and spiritual connection between life and the eco-systems that sustains it.
The sense of nature as a teacher.
The unique value of nature as life.
Honoring the interdependence between natural life and the viewpoint that all life is connected.
Maintaining a sense of responsibility for their actions as a contributor to the ecosystem of an interdependent world.

According to Our Earth/ Ourselves  web site, Indigenous peoples of the world characteristically maintain these values:


Gratitude and reverence
Sharing
Cooperation
Reciprocity
Humility
Balance


The Shipibo
The modern Shipibo culture consists of around 35,000 people living in over three hundred villages in the Pucallpa region. Their communities are mostly situated along the Río Ucayali. The Río Ucayali joins the Río Marañon to form the mighty Río Amazonas, the longest and largest river in the world. The Río Amazonas flows northward past Iquitos on its long journey north to the Atlantic Ocean.
The Shipibo people speak a native language, but today, most speak Spanish as well. Despite 300 years of sporadic contact with European and mestizo &#8220;civilization&#8221; and massive conversion to Christianity in the 1950&#8242;s and 60&#8242;s, the Shipibo people maintain a strong tribal identity and retain many of their ancient shamanic traditions and beliefs.
   
Shipibo artisans are well-known for their intricate designs on their pottery and colorful fabrics depicting their Ayahuasca-based cosmology.
Unfortunately, the proximity of most Shipibo communities to the burgeoning city of Pucallpa has made it inevitable that their culture has become altered by mainstream trade, exploitation and encroachment of western values. Still, the Shipibo are a resilient people.
Ayahuasca-based cosmology
In this podcast, you will hear Robert sharing with us the mythology of ayahuasca in the form of a traditional Shipibo song. Robert sang the song with such emotion. He went on singing for us for almost five minutes, sharing with us the traditional story of his people. The ceremony involved with taking the plant medicine Ayahuasca is not for entertainment purposes. It&#8217;s a healing voyage guided by their deceased ancestors.
Even though we did not understand the words of the song, we understood the voyage shared with us through Robert&#8217;s raw emotions. His singing brought tears to his eyes and in turn, transferred his passion into our experience as well.
What is Ayahuasca? 
Ayahuasca is a medicinal tea prepared from Banisteriopsis Caapi, a jungle vine, found in t[...]</itunes:summary>

</ul>
<p><strong>Welcome to episode #30 of  the Raising Miro Podcast.</strong> Episod #30 contains an interview with noted researcher &amp; author, Brien Foerester. (<em>See below for his bio &amp; links</em>) We had the honor of meeting him in person last December when we visited the <a href="http://visitparacas.com/paracas-history-museum/" target="_blank">Paracas History Museum</a>, home of the<a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/06/elongated-skulls-of-paracas/"> largest collection of elongated skulls</a>.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-10450 alignright" title="paracas2" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/paracas2-300x241.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="241" />This episode we talk about the ancient cultures here in Peru and in other parts of the world by examining some of the fascinating clues they&#8217;ve left behind. Miro and I are learning together, and admittedly this is one of my interests, but he can&#8217;t help but to learn too&#8230;.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>&#8220;History cannot give us a program for the future, but it can give us a fuller understanding of ourselves, and of our common humanity, so that we can better face the future.&#8221; </em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>~Robert Penn Warren</em></strong></p>
<h3><em>I am always curious! When we are interested in a subject, we ask questions and that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/category/unschooling-2/">interest-led learning</a>.</em></h3>
<p>I have always been fascinated by the mystique of ancient cultures, and one of the ways I&#8217;ve learned has been through asking questions. On our travels, we&#8217;ve have learned so many things that are not found in academic books about the subject. We&#8217;ve learned through a process of inquiry, asking people to share with us their cultural knowledge as a cultural exchange. In Cozumel Mexico,  we were speaking with a <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2009/07/22/discovering-spock/">man of Mayan descendant </a>who also happened to be<a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/11/28/couch-surfing-%E2%80%93-still-not-sure/"> our host</a>. We talked a lot about the traditions of his ancestors told through lore. He shared with us, a little known fact. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization" target="_blank">Maya Pre-Classic Period</a>  the Mayan people traditionally trained their eyes to permanently be cross-eyed from a young age by placing a bead in between the  of the child&#8217;s eyes and training him to stare for hours.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="cross eyed mayan" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/God_G_Kinich_Ahau_2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="147" />Scholars believed the Mayans trained their eyes to become crossed-eyed for <a href="http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/546604" target="_blank">aesthetic reasons</a>. But we were told that was simply not true. Miro and I learned that purpose of cross-eyes was so that the people could enhance their ability to see peripherally and the Mayans believed the eyes actually limited their vision.  The early Mayans wanted to see the way their ancestors saw, who were believed to have he ability to see beyond their physical eyes. And of course, he told us about the true origin of those ancestors, they came from the stars&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>“The art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge.”</em></strong><br />
<em>~Thomas Berger</em></p>
<p>As we approach 2012, the impact indigenous cultures have left on the modern world is NOT in question. Here in Peru, artifacts have been dated as far back as 11,000 BC.  To believe, there were thriving cultures almost 13,000 years ago blows my mind. (!!!!) Most of the world thinks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire" target="_blank">the Incas</a> as the rulers of ancient Peru, but their culture started around 1300 AD, only about 700 years ago. Before the Incas, lived many highly evolved civilizations with advanced technologies including sophisticated agricultural and irrigation methods, cranial surgery, astrology and astronomy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/megalithic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10454" title="megalithic" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/megalithic.jpg" alt="" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>But one of the most fascinating artifacts left behind was the evidence of highly advanced tools, enabling precision cutting of massive megalithic stones, some weighing over 100 tons. Not only cutting them is a major feat, these ancient civilizations actually moved these stones, in some cases, hundreds of miles from the quarry sites. Then somehow, they managed to build massive structures piecing together these giant rock blocks with such perfection, not even a human hair could fit between the two adjoining blocks.</p>
<h3><em>As always, more questions&#8230;.</em></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>What tools could they have possibly used to build and move these megalithic structures thousands of years ago? Who exactly where these people? How did they develop such advanced technology? </strong></em><em><strong>I wonder if the great pyramids in Egypt were built using the same technology?</strong></em></p>
<p>I have recently read that <a href="http://www.gizapower.com/" target="_blank">pyramids were in fact power generators</a> with no moving parts, only using water to conduct energy and that the great pyramids and other megalithic structures around the globe are build on specific<a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/antigravityworldgrid/ciencia_antigravityworldgrid01.htm" target="_blank"> grid lines</a>. This information blows me away and as we continue to travel, I find myself hungry to find more information. So, Miro and I have been visiting these ancient places, we&#8217;ve been asking as many questions as we can and I&#8217;ve been ferociously reading and watching as many sources as I can get my hands on. This is Mom&#8217;s <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/category/unschooling-2/" target="_blank">interest-led-education</a> and I can say <strong>my</strong> learning never stops.</p>

<h1>Peru</h1>
<p><em>As I shared earlier, I am so fascinated by the clues the artifacts have given us in terms of the culture and ancient civilations here and Peru. Here are some of the highlights from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Peru#Pre-Columbian_cultures" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> about Peru&#8217;s history:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Hunting tools dating back to more than <strong>11,000 years</strong> have been found inside the caves of Pachacamac, Telarmachay, Junin and Lauricocha.</li>
<li>Some of the oldest civilizations appeared circa 6000 BC in the coastal provinces of Chilca and Paracas, and in the highland province of Callejón de Huaylas.</li>
<li>The first known city in all of the America was Caral, located in the Supe Valley 200 km north of Lima. It is the oldest city in America and was built in approximately 2500 BC.What is left from the civilization, also called Norte Chico, are about 30 pyramidical structures built up in receding terraces ending in a flat roof; some of them measured up to 20 meters in height. Caral is one of six world centers of the rise of civilization.</li>
<li>In the early 21st century, archeologists have discovered new evidence of ancient pre-Ceramic complex cultures.</li>
<li>In 2005 Tom D. Dillehay and his team announced the discovery of three irrigation canals that were 5400 years old, and a possible fourth that is 6700 years old, all in the Zaña Valley in northern Peru, evidence of community activity to support improved agriculture at a much earlier date than previously believed.</li>
<li>In 2006, Robert Benfer and a research team discovered a 4200-year-old observatory at Buena Vista, a site in the Andes several kilometers north of present-day Lima. They believe the observatory was related to the society&#8217;s reliance on agriculture and understanding the seasons. The site includes the oldest three-dimensional sculptures found thus far in South America.</li>
<li>In 2007 the archeologist Walter Alva and his team found a 4000-year-old temple with painted murals at Ventarrón, in the northwest Lambayeque region. The temple contained ceremonial offerings gained from exchange with Peruvian jungle societies, as well as those from the Ecuadoran coast. Such finds show sophisticated, monumental construction requiring large-scale organization of labor, suggesting that hierarchical, complex cultures arose in South America much earlier than scholars had thought.</li>
<li>Many other civilizations developed and were absorbed by the most powerful ones such as Kotosh, Chavin, Paracas,Lima, Nasca, Moche, Tiwanaku, Wari, Lambayeque, Chimu, Chan Chan, and Chincha, among others.</li>
<li>The Paracas culture emerged on the southern coast around 300 BC. They are known for their use of vicuña fibers instead of justcotton to produce fine textiles—innovations that did not reach the northern coast of Peru until centuries later.</li>
<li>Coastal cultures such as the Moche and Nazca flourished from about 100 BC to about AD 700: the Moche produced impressive metalwork, as well as some of the finest pottery seen in the ancient world, while the Nazca are known for their textiles and the enigmatic Nazca lines.</li>
<li>These coastal cultures eventually began to decline as a result of recurring el Niño floods and droughts. In consequence, the Huari and Tiwanaku, who dwelt inland in the Andes became the predominant cultures of the region encompassing much of modern-day Peru and Bolivia. They were succeeded by powerful city-states, such as Chancay, Sipan, and Cajamarca, and two empires: Chimor and Chachapoyas culture These cultures developed relatively advanced techniques of cultivation, gold and silver craft, pottery, metallurgy, and knitting.</li>
<li>Around 700 BC, they appear to have developed systems of social organization that were the precursors of the Inca civilization.</li>
<li>Not all Andean cultures were willing to offer their loyalty to the Incas as the Incas expanded their empire, and many were openly hostile. The people of the Chachapoyas culture were an example of this, but the Inca eventually conquered and integrated them into their empire.</li>

<p><strong>The Huaca Pucllana Ruins in Lima</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/04/11/the-huaca-pucllana-ruins-in-lima/">The Huaca Pucllana ruins</a>, located in Miraflores, a suburb of Lima. The ruins at this site were originally constructed by the Lima culture. The Lima culture was a pre-Inca indigenous culture living in the modern day Lima area. The culture flourished in this area from roughly the years 100 AD to 650 AD. The Lima culture was quite sophisticated, employing irrigation methods to bring water to the desert areas surrounding Lima for agricultural purposes. The culture was also socially complex and had several elite and priest classes, which helped administer their population centers.</p>
<p><strong>Tucume<br />
</strong>We have seen the remains of the <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/02/tucume-the-largest-pyramid-complex-in-the-world/">largest pyramid complex </a>in world. Yes, even larger than in Egypt. Can you imagine an ancient land where 26 important pyramids were built, along with enclosures and ceremonial mounds across a 540 acre sprawl? We can, we&#8217;ve seen it and these pyramids date back to 1000 AD. Astounding.</p>
<p><strong>Nasca Lines<br />
</strong>We&#8217;ve experienced the massive geoglyphs, pictures drawn across the sandy desert, images so expertly drawn at an unbelievable scale. So large these earth drawings are only viewable from an airplane or observation tower. These images of animals grace the desert floor and what&#8217;s thought to be ancient landing strips for aircraft make up what&#8217;s known as the <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/10/nazca-lines/">Nasca lines</a>.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mummy of Cao</strong><br />
Then we saw a <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/01/30/tattooed_mummy_of_cao_peru/">tattooed female mummy</a> who, like the Egyptians, was buried in a tomb found deep within an ancient pyramid, just off the northern pacific coast. I was even able to see the fascinating tattoos, which still grace her beautiful mummified body after roughly 1300 years.</p>
<p><strong>Elongated Skulls</strong><br />
We even saw what looks like to be evidence of aliens, when we visited The Paracas History Museum. We were honored to be able to speak with the brilliant Brien Foerester, author, expertand a contributing curator of the largest private collection of elongated skulls. He shared with us the history of the Paracas culture, then proceeded to show a comparison between several elongated skulls, some believed to alien of nature, other believed to be human or human / alien hybrids. We even have an <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/06/elongated-skulls-of-paracas/">article about that trip at our site, including a short video clip</a> we took of Brien showcasing the non-human attributes of some of the skulls.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Meet an amazing unschooled 12 year old. Other than Miro.</h2>
<h3>Episode #29 Miro speaks with Devin Martin, an unschooled pre-teen, who surprisingly, shares many of the same interests</h3>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;I am always ready to learn, but I do not always like being taught.&#8221; </em></strong><br />
<strong> <em>~Winston Churchill</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/devin.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9955" title="devin" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/devin-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>In today&#8217;s podcast you will hear an interview between two 12 year old unschooled boys, Miro &amp; Devin Martin. Unshcooling has always been a part of Devin&#8217;s experience. He has been encouraged to follow his interests and peruse his hobbies. We learn about  Devin&#8217;s interest in &#8220;Steam Punk&#8221; and  we discover his passion for  <a href="http://thesparklingmartins.blogspot.com/2012/02/devins-daggers.html" target="_blank">hand-made projects</a>. Devin currently lives with his<a href="http://thesparklingmartins.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"> family </a>in the United States.</p>
<p>We suppose it&#8217;s  no coincidence that Devin&#8217;s mother <a href="http://daynamartin.com/" target="_blank">Dayna Martin</a> wrote a popular book on unschooling called <a href="http://daynamartin.com/radical-unschooling-book/" target="_blank">Radical Unschooling – A Revolution Has Begun</a>.  (See more about Dayna Martin at the end of this page.)</p>
<h1>Unschoolers</h1>
<p><em><strong>“We socialize. It’s fun. Socialization, on the other hand, that’s where someone trains you how to behave in an institutional setting. Not fun.” ~ Sara McGrath</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9973" title="unschooling" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/unschooling-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />As a Mom, I am just now beginning to understand why. Unschoolers are a different breed. Unschoolers are empowered to follow their own passions and interests. But first, they are encouraged to discover them. That&#8217;s a huge difference between traditional schooled kids &amp; unschoolers.  Tradional schoolers are required to focus on subject matter spoon fed to them by the school based on their biological age.</p>
<h2>Socialization</h2>
<p>&#8220;How will you child be socialized if he&#8217;s not in school?&#8221;</p>
<h3><em>&#8230;if I had a nickel&#8230;  </em></h3>
<p>But for those most commonly asking those questions, I ask you to consider:</p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling#Socialization" target="_blank">Wikipedia on socialization &amp; the unschooler:</a></em></p>
<blockquote><p>Concerns about socialization are often a factor in the decision to unschool. Many unschoolers believe that the conditions common in conventional schools, like age segregation, a low ratio of adults to children, a lack of contact with the community, and a lack of people in professions other than teachers or school administration create an unhealthy social environment. They feel that their children benefit from coming in contact with people of diverse ages and backgrounds in a variety of contexts. They also feel that their children benefit from having some ability to influence what people they encounter, and in what contexts they encounter them. <strong>Unschoolers cite studies which report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers</strong>,and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people with which they have the opportunity to communicate.</p></blockquote>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/09/14/children_of_banos_photo-essay1/"><img title="Miro as a volunteer, leading children in a creative theater exercise" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC08745.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="459" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Miro as a volunteer in Ecuador, leading children in a creative theater exercise</p></div>
<p><em>&#8230;just wait until you hear these two boys converse.</em> I am not an expert, but I suspect in general, unschooled kids are indeed simply socialized better within the world, not just their particular school grade class.  And being present with many social situations  is definitely a valuable skill.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that unschooled kids are simply more aware of their own presence. They are aware that they belong in this world and are proud to contribute.</p>
<h2><em>But what about Schooled Adults?</em></h2>
<p>Many adults are dismissive of children and have the general sense that kids have nothing of worthwhile to say.</p>
<h3><em>&#8230;in Miro&#8217;s own words:</em></h3>
<p>&#8220;Equally annoying, one of my biggest pet peeves is when adults talk down to me, treat me like I&#8217;m a &#8216;child&#8217;, incapable of having an intelligent thought on my own. I don&#8217;t like it when people think I&#8217;m stupid just because I&#8217;m a kid, like when taxi drivers won&#8217;t talk to me or people in restaurants wait for my mom&#8217;s approval before writing down my order. It felt really great to talk to someone so similar to me. It had been so long since I had had an interaction with another child I liked. The previous encounters I&#8217;ve had with other kids did not end well, and I was starting to believe they were all the same. However my interview with Devin has restored my faith in children.&#8221; ~Miro</p>

<h2>Other Raising Miro Unschooling Podcasts</h2>
<p>We have talked about <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/category/unschooling-2/">unschooling</a> in several other<a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/podcasts/podcast-archives/"> podcasts</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Episode #16</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2010/12/30/podcast-episode-16/">Podcast Episode #16 &#8211; Unschooling, Discovering No Differences Between Living &amp; Learning</a></strong>, I interviewed another traveling single mom. Theodora was traveling together with her son throughout Asia and provided her candor as we recoded our conversation, a frank talk between two moms, We broach the subjects, everything from education, to travel and even sex. If you haven’t heard that podcast, please follow the show links page on our web site at raisingmiro.com</p>
<p><strong>Then later on that year, we produced a 3 part series called <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/04/02/podcast-episode-22-%E2%80%93-unschooling-a-world-of-learning-part-1/">A World of Learning</a>.</strong></p>

<h1>Peru</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Huaraz01.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9974" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="Huaraz01" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Huaraz01-300x283.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>There are so many wonderful places on the planet, but we believe Peru is truly fascinating and unique. This country has an abundance of natural and cultural treasures that continues to intrigue visitors for hundreds of years. This is a land of rich cultural heritage. Although we&#8217;ve only been here a short seven months (yes, that&#8217;s a short time for immersing yourself into the culture) we&#8217;ve explored just a fraction of the notable sites and cities. There are large modern cities, small rural towns, beach resorts, jungle villages, mountain communities, deserts and everything in between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;Most people, most of the time, learn most of what they know about science and technology outside of school.&#8221; -National Science Foundation</strong></em></p>
<p>On our blog, we have shared with you posts about many of the places we&#8217;ve traveled and lived at including the infamous beach town of <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/12/05/mancora-a-love%E2%80%93hate-thing/">Mancora</a>, <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/11/23/haunchaco/">Huanchaco</a>, <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/17/trujillo-as-a-destination/">Trujillo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiclayo">Chiclayo</a>, <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/03/07/visiting-huaraz/">Huaraz</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca">Nasca</a> and <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/06/elongated-skulls-of-paracas/">Paracas</a>.</p>
<p>For us, the most fascinating part of exploring this beautiful country has been all that we&#8217;ve learned about the ancient cultures and traditions. Through my passion, Miro is exposed and is discovering things he&#8217;s never dreamed about. When I thought of Peru prior to visiting, all I knew was this is land of the Incas. Never in my wildest dreams was I prepared for all the experiences that were in store.</p>
<p><strong>Cultures</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned about so many cultures here, including the <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/12/15/temple-of-the-sun-moon/">Moche</a>, <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/10/08/chan-chan/">Chimu</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wari_Empire">Wari</a>, <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/02/tucume-the-largest-pyramid-complex-in-the-world/">Lambayaque</a>, <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/category/destinations/ruins/">Paracas</a>, <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/10/nazca-lines/">Nasc</a>a and <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/27/chavin-de-huantar-in-peru/">Chavin</a>. Some of these cultures date back 3000 to 4000 years ago. To think that these advanced cultures lived here 3 to 4,000 years is ago pretty mind-blowing!</p>
<p>We have seen the ruins of very sophisticated communities. Architecture of a precise nature, walls constructed out of solid stone, so perfectly cut that you cannot fit a hair between the two adjoining bricks.</p>
<div id="attachment_9975" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-9975 " title="templesunmoon11" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/templesunmoon11.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Miro considering the Moche culture at the Temple of the Sun &amp; the Moon</p></div>
<p><strong>Tucume<br />
</strong>We have seen the remains of the <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/02/tucume-the-largest-pyramid-complex-in-the-world/">largest pyramid complex </a>in world. Yes, even larger than in Egypt. Can you imagine an ancient land where 26 important pyramids were built, along with enclosures and ceremonial mounds across a 540 acre sprawl? We can, we&#8217;ve seen it and these pyramids date back to 1000 AD. Astounding.</p>
<p><strong>Nasca Lines<br />
</strong>We&#8217;ve experienced the massive geoglyphs, pictures drawn across the sandy desert, images so expertly drawn at an unbelievable scale. So large these earth drawings are only viewable from an airplane or observation tower. These images of animals grace the desert floor and what&#8217;s thought to be ancient landing strips for aircraft make up what&#8217;s known as the <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/10/nazca-lines/">Nasca line</a>s.</p>
<p><strong>Mummy of Cao</strong><br />
Then we saw a <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/01/30/tattooed_mummy_of_cao_peru/">tattooed female mummy</a> who, like the <a href="http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/egypt/mummies.htm">Egyptians</a>, was buried in a tomb found deep within an ancient pyramid, just off the northern pacific coast. I was even able to see the fascinating tattoos, which still grace her beautiful mummified body after roughly1300 years. Hope my mom&#8217;s looks that good in a millenium.</p>
<p><strong>Elongated Skulls</strong><br />
We even saw what looks like to be evidence of aliens, when we visited <a href="http://visitparacas.com/paracas-history-museum/">The Paracas History Museum</a>. We were honored to be able to speak with the brilliant <a href="http://brienfoerster.com/">Brien Forester</a>, author, <a href="http://hiddenincatours.com/">expert </a>and a contributing curator of the largest private collection of elongated skulls. He shared with us the history of the <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/category/destinations/ruins/">Paracas culture</a>, then proceeded to show a comparison between several elongated skulls, some believed to alien of nature, other believed to be human or human / alien hybrids.</p>
<p>We even have an <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2012/02/06/elongated-skulls-of-paracas/">article about that trip at our site, including a short video clip</a> we took of Brien showcasing the non-human attributes of some of the skulls.</p>
<h3><em>And the world shall remain our classroom&#8230;</em></h3>
<p>I believe this is a true example of &#8216;learning&#8217; through experiencing the world. Learning new things has become the gift both Miro and I share as we&#8217;ve both learned to experience the world with a sense of openness and amazement.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A Bicycle Adventure Built for Four</h1>
<h2>International Pedaled Powered Family Adventure</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9311" title="window-13" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/window-13-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" /></p>
<h3>Episode #28 we speak with Nancy from a remarkable family who views the world as their home.</h3>
<p>This is the second in a two part series, where both Miro and I both speak with the Vogel Family, also known as Family on Bikes. This family completed a multi year bicycle trek, starting in Alaska, traveling down the pan american highway, finally to reach their destination in Argentina. But this is not their only adventure together as a family and we learn that <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/category/in_the_moment/inspiration/">inspiration</a> is a family trait for the Vogels.</p>
<h3><em>This is episode #28, Part 2 of a 2 part series. Be sure to listen to <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/08/31/podcast_episode27/">Part 1 here</a>.</em></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“My invitation to you is to begin living every moment as though you are miraculous and deserve to live an extraordinary life. Fake it if you must and keep faking it until it&#8217;s real to you. The gift you will be giving yourself is a lifelong journey of discovery, one that is infinite and infinitely rewarding. Begin the journey. Today. This moment. Now.” </em><br />
<em>~ Robert White</em></p>
<p>In  episode #28 we speak  with Nancy Vogel of <a title="Family on Bikes" href="http://familyonbikes.org" target="_blank">FamilyonBikes.org</a>  about everything from trip planning to  preparations, education on the road and keeping your family  healthy on an extended journey. Nancy also shares some valuable advice for anyone who may have some fear preventing them from following their dreams.</p>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/08/31/podcast_episode27/">Episode # 27</a> includes an interview between Miro  and all of the boys from the Vogel clan including John Vogel, and twin sons Daryl &amp; Davy who, as a family of four, rode their bikes from Alaska to Argentina over a 3 year time span, and broke a world record in the process.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9313" title="Nancy closeup" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Nancy-closeup.jpg" alt="" width="250" /></p>
<h2>Traveling and Learning</h2>
<p>Nancy Vogel is 21-year  classroom teaching veteran. In our interview, Nancy shares her thoughts on roadschooling. Additionally, Nancy writes extensively on her blog about <a title="Family on Bikes on Education" href="http://familyonbikes.org/blog/category/education/" target="_blank">education</a>. Here&#8217;s an excerpt on <a title="Education  from  Family on Bikes" href="http://familyonbikes.org/blog/2011/03/education-learning-school/" target="_blank">her article</a> about education:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Education = Learning = school</h3>
<p><strong><em>ed•u•ca•tion [ej-oo-key-shuh n] –noun</em></strong></p>
<p>the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually for mature life.</p>
<p><strong><em>learn•ing [lur-ning] –noun</em></strong></p>
<p>knowledge acquired by systematic study in any field of scholarly application.</p>
<p>It’s funny how we associate these two words with school.  A brick building broken into classrooms filled with desks and chairs and blackboards.</p>
<p><strong>School = education = learning</strong> Synonyms all three.</p>
<p>And yet – are they?  <strong><em>What is education?  What’s true learning?</em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve talked quite a bit about our sons’ education in this blog – how we’ve allowed Mother Nature to provide most of the lessons; how we’ve trusted our sons to learn about the world around them. About how education is so much more than school.</p>

<h2>20 Miles per Cookie- 9000 Miles of Kid-Powered Adventures</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/twenty_miles_big_book.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9314" title="twenty_miles_big_book" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/twenty_miles_big_book-206x300.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="300" /></a>The family Vogal share their inspiration in their inspiring journey in their latest book.</p>
<h2>It was a year of adventure, a year of fun. A year of good time and bad, of highs and lows, of good weather and bad. But mostly, it was a year of magic – together as a family.</h2>
<p>“<em>It seems that in the darkest of times, the goodness within humanity becomes the most evident. For the Vogel family – cycling for a year around the US and Mexico – those encounters with kindness came to represent their journey almost as much as their own personal growth.” ~</em><em><a title="Time Travel Turtle" href="http://www.timetravelturtle.com/2012/01/book-review-twenty-miles-per-cookie/" target="_blank">Michael Turtle</a></em></p>
<p><em>“This book is a pleasure to read – for although it details a journey most of us won’t ever take, the life lessons can be extrapolated to any family. From cold, rain, muck, and headwinds, to the kindness of strangers and the extraordinary beauty of nature, the Vogel family kept on. Life lessons can be read here, without biking those 9,000 miles – keep your head down, don’t complain, keep going, work together, learn together, don’t push TOO hard, and enjoy the journey.” </em><em>~<a title="Wandering Educators" href="http://www.wanderingeducators.com/best/traveling/family-biking-across-north-america.html" target="_blank">Jessie Voigts</a></em></p>
<p><em>“One prominent theme in this book is the “Road Angels” the family comes across. In a time when we are all adding a second deadbolt to our door, telling our kids to trust no one and monitoring every second of their lives on the web, the Vogel family learned to have a little trust in their fellow man. ~<a title="Walkingon Travels" href="http://walkingontravels.wordpress.com/2012/01/16/would-you-bike-20-miles-for-a-cookie/" target="_blank">Keryn Means</a></em></p>
<p><em>Did it inspire me to take my own year long bike riding adventure with my family?  Well….No.  I don’t like riding my bike that much!  But it did help me to understand that we continually underestimate ourselves and that whatever we can dream we can accomplish if we only believe in ourselves. ~ <a title="Worldschool Adventures" href="http://worldschooladventures.com/2012/01/27/book-review-twenty-miles-per-cookie/" target="_blank">Amy Sztupovszky</a></em></p>
<p data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1}"><em>Nancy is a confident writer that left me giggling throughout the book as she shared the ups and downs of daily life on the road. She shared a few memorable disputes with her husband (it was reassuring to know they are normal, at least in that way), and had me grinning from ear to ear when they came across Road Angels that lightened their load and made the journey more bearable and enjoyable. Americans and Mexicans alike went out of their way to bring sunshine to their days! ~ <a title="Living outside the box" href="http://livingoutsideofthebox.com/2012/01/23/4410/" target="_blank">Alisa Lybbert</a></em></p>
<p data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:1}"><em>But I think most will agree with me about this, the most amazing thing about this story is simply that someone did it. That people leave their jobs and homes and BEDS with two kids and just get out there and live their lives to the fullest. This should not be surprising, but it’s really shocking. I feel like walking to my mailbox is a huge hassle most days. Much less camping out almost every night for a year in a tent with three dudes.Yet they did it, and they loved it.  ~ <a title="Edification" href="http://edificationyall.blogspot.com/2012/01/twenty-miles-per-cookie-book-review.html" target="_blank">Edification</a></em></p>
<div></div>
<p>This is the story of the Vogel Family&#8217;s first major family adventure – one year cycling 9300 miles through the USA and Mexico. Their sons were eight years old when they pulled out of our driveway in Boise, Idaho.</p>

International Pedaled Powered Family Adventure- Featuring an interview with the Vogel Family, also known as Family on Bikes.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A Bicycle Adventure Built for Four</h1>
<h2>International Pedaled Powered Family Adventure</h2>
<p><em><strong><em><em>“Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” </em><br />
~<em> Helen Keller</em></em></strong></em></p>
<h3>Episode #27 we speak with a remarkable family who views the world as their home. But what makes this family so unique, is they have spent the last 3 years traveling together on bikes.</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7752 alignleft" title="window" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/window-300x175.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175" /></p>
<p>This is the first in a two part series, where both Miro and I speak with the Vogel Family, also known as Family on Bikes. This family just completed a multi year bicycle trek, starting in Alaska, traveling down the pan american highway, finally to reach their destination in Argentina.</p>
<p>The trip covered 17,300 miles through the Western portion of Canada, the west coast of the United States, then the entire Central America continent, finally biking the length of South America from Colombia to the southernmost tip in Argentina.</p>
<p>Quite remarkable, especially considering this family of 4 has dedicated the last 3 years of their lives to do so, and upon completion, they found their sons <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/07/27/family-on-bikes-an-uphill-battle/">Davy and Daryl, candidates for a Guinness World Record</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7746" title="window-12" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/window-12.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="459" /></p>
<p>This is not the first time this family has traded a conventional life for a life of travel. Just a year prior to their Pan American Highway trip, this extraordinary family of 4 took one year to bicycle across the United States &amp; Mexico cycling 9300 miles. During their first family trip, the Vogel clan visited nineteen US states and five Mexican states and spent twelve months on the road.</p>
<p>Today the Vogel Boys, Davy and Daryl are 13 years old and have traveled more than most adults travel in their entire lifetime.<em> (Miro has yet to meet other traveling kids being raised with worldly experiences, so when this family agreed to grant us an interview we were more than thrilled.)</em></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>“Follow your bliss, and doors will open for you that you never knew existed. Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls.” ~ Joseph Campbell</em></strong></p>
<p>Daryl and Davy are very well traveled 13 year old twin brothers. We had a hard time imaging what was on the mind of this family after almost 3 years on the road, and the end almost in sight. This is an excerpt written by Davy about his last day of the journey. In Davy Vogel&#8217;s own words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Davy writes about his last day on the road on the <a href="http://familyonbikes.org/blog/2011/08/my-last-day-on-the-road/">FamilyonBikes.org blog</a>. Here&#8217;s an excerpt  :</em></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7744 alignleft" title="window-10" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/window-10-300x234.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="234" /><em>After a journey of nearly three years from the northern tip of Alaska to the southern tip of Argentina we were ready for our very last day on the road. It started out like any other day. We had camped in a forest of partially rotten trees behind an abandoned logging camp. The trees were covered with craggy strands of greenish moss reminding me of an old man’s whiskers.</em></p>
<p><em>We rode for a while until the sun came out. It was amazingly beautiful. We were going up a hill with a good view of a lake and the sun sparked off of the lake and illuminated all the trees.</em></p>
<p><em>We entered a valley with green trees and snow-capped jagged mountains surrounding us. Clouds hung low in the sky, obscuring the tops of the peaks.</em></p>
<p><em>We kept going and came around a corner and saw a huge sign saying USHUAIA. I pedaled past it first and waited for Mom and Dad. When they came I shouted, “I made it through first! Ha, ha!”  I had been on the road for a long time and the whole time I said, “We are going to Ushuaia.” It felt fantastic to finally be there.</em></p>

<p>“<strong><em>A person should set his goals as early as he can and devote all his energy and talent to getting there. With enough effort, he may achieve it. Or he may find something that is even more rewarding. But in the end, no matter the outcome, he will know he has been alive.”<br />
~Walt Disney</em></strong></p>
<h1>Meet the Family on Bikes &#8211; Family Vogel</h1>
<h3>John</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7745" title="window-11" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/window-11-246x300.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="210" />John grew up in Rhode Island and never traveled beyond New England until he went to college in Colorado. At some point in his college years he discovered bike touring and spent the next ten or fifteen years biking wherever he went. He crossed the USA quite a few times before getting more adventurous and venturing a bit farther from home.</p>
<p>One summer he flew to Alaska and cycled back to New Mexico (where he was living at the time). Another summer he cycled Iceland and Norway. Then came Australia. And then India.</p>
<p>All that time he was working as a teacher and traveling in the summers.</p>
<h3>Nancy</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7740" title="window-5" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/window-5-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" />Nancy grew up in Boise, Idaho and had the opportunity to travel each summer to a different place. Although they only traveled for a few weeks, every summer her parents loaded all five kids into the station wagon and took off for parts unknown.</p>
<p>When Nancy was 16, her parents took her to Mexico – and her eyes were opened to the fact that there was a big, wide world out there. As soon as she arrived home, she saw a commercial for the Peace Corps and made the decision to join it as soon as she could.</p>
<p>True to the decision Nancy made when she was sixteen years old, she joined the Peace Corps upon graduation from university. For the next 2.5 years she helped develop a Special Ed program in Honduras and formed a team for the Special Olympics.</p>
<p>Peace Corps gives volunteers a chunk of money when they leave in order to help them get established in the USA. I took the money and spent seven months traveling in South America instead.</p>
<p>Upon her return to the USA, she moved to the Navajo Indian Reservation where she taught for the next three years. During her first summer back in the USA she took off on my bike and cycled from Norfolk, Virginia to New Orleans. The next summer she visited her brother who was serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Malawi.</p>
<h3>Their lives together</h3>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7751 alignleft" title="window-17" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/window-17-300x252.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="252" />That brings us to spring of 1990 when a series of unusual events brought John and Nancy together to cycle in Pakistan.<br />
They spent the school year 1990/91 cycling Pakistan, China, India, Nepal, &amp; Bangladesh. The first weekend of the following school year they got married.</p>
<p>They lasted a grand total of two years in Albuquerque before going nuts. They got jobs at an American school in Alexandria, Egypt and took off to explore a new part of the world.</p>
<p>From 1993 – 1995 they lived in Alexandria and traveled extensively in the area. They went to Israel and Jordan, Greece and Turkey. They spent a summer cycling the Sinai Peninsula and Israel.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7738 alignright" title="window-3" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/window-3-273x300.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="300" />After two years in Egypt, they moved to Ethiopia to teach in another international school. From there, they explored Yemen and Mali on bikes and visited many other countries by bus. Their sons were born our third year in Ethiopia, and they continued to travel with kids in tow.</p>
<p>The boys celebrated their first birthday in Egypt, their second in Vietnam. They turned three in Thailand and four in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>After living in Ethiopia for seven years, John and Nancy got teaching jobs in an American school in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. They explored Taiwan and Bali and Myanmar during the two years we lived there.</p>
<p>After a brief stint in Malaysia, they returned to the USA shortly after the boys turned seven. They lasted a grand total of fifteen months before we hopped on our bikes and headed out to see our their home turf.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7741" title="window-6" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/window-6.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="469" /><br />
They spent the 2006-07 school year (the boys’ third grade year) cycling 9300 miles through the USA and Mexico. John and the boys were on a bicycle built for three and Nancy rode a single bike alongside them. They visited nineteen US states and five Mexican states in twelve months on the road.</p>
<p>They returned to Boise for fourth grade and spent that year planning and preparing to hit the road again – this time to cycle from Alaska to Argentina.</p>
<p>In June 2008, they headed out – this time John and Daryl rode a tandem bike while Davy and Nancy were on singles. After cycling 17,300 miles in nearly three years, they reached the southernmost tip of South America on March 21, 2011.</p>

<address><strong><img class="alignleft" title="hanna" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/jag72.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="162" />We have been fortunate to meet two other amazing travelers on our trip, in person. In Guatemala, we met Hanna, is a sweedish journist, traveling the same route,  from Alaska to Argentina.  Also, we met Jamie, is global bicyclist, traveling around the globe for 8 years on his bike. Miro and I interview  them both in: </strong></address>

<h1>Also in Episode #27 Miro shares his latest passion: <em>growing stuff</em></h1>
<p>We&#8217;ve been in Puru for almost 2 months now. We are sharing a house with some very dear friends that we met on the road in Nicaragua almost 2 years ago. They are another mother and son team , Bubba a former computer programmer turned naturalist, and Aztec dancer, &amp; Dixie, a self proclaimed <em><a href="http://consciousbabyboomers.com/">conscious baby boomer</a></em>, teacher, holder of two college degrees and perpetual traveler. We actually interviewed them for a past podcast, over a year ago, episode number 12, entitled <strong><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2010/10/16/podcast-episode-12/">Transformational Experiences Leading Into 2012 &amp; Beyond </a></strong>.</p>
<p><em>If you haven&#8217;t listened to that episode, we would love for you to hear it!</em></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/08/27/miros-garden-lettuce-entertain-you/">Miro’s Garden! Lettuce entertain you</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/lettuce2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7771" title="lettuce2" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/lettuce2-300x172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="172" /></a>I am always grateful when others wish to mentor Miro and find Miro&#8217;s learning experience to flow easier when he&#8217;s truly engaged. We realize part of the <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/?cat=632">unschooling process</a> is that everything can be a <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/04/20/world_as_our_classroom/">learning experience</a>. Through Bubba&#8217;s passion for plants and botany, Miro has begun to learn about planting food, farming, and has even learned how to harvest seeds from our farmer&#8217;s market purchased produce. On his own, Miro has been interested in seeking the health and nutrition benefits associated with the live foods he&#8217;s planted. To date, he&#8217;s caring for lettuce, chili peppers and peas. In Miro&#8217;s own words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;I never knew how amazing it was to sprout life. Watching seeds sprout and planting them into the dirt is actually a lot of fun. I have been recording their process in my notebook for the last few weeks. I have also been amazed by the nutritional facts I&#8217;ve found out, on each of the foods, by doing a little research. Did you know, you can have infinite lettuce? All you have to do is plant it, water it, give it sun light and when the lettuce is ready to eat, cut it above the bulb, leaving the the bottom part attached to the roots. Miraculously the lettuce leaves will regrow. That means infinite salads!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We are so happy to share that with you. Miro has been keeping a journal of the progress of the lettuce plants. If you&#8217;d like to read his post on the lettuce, <a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/2011/08/27/miros-garden-lettuce-entertain-you/">here&#8217;s the link</a>.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>1 Year For the World &#8211; Volunteering Around The Globe</h1>
<h2>Service brings joy:</h2>
<p><em><strong><em>“<em>I don&#8217;t know what your destiny will be, but one thing I know: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve.</em>&#8221;<br />
~<em>Albert Schweitzer</em></em></strong><br />
</em></p>
<h3>Episode #26 we speak with Alisha Robertson from <a href="http://www.smallworldpursuits.com/">SmallWorldPursuits.com</a></h3>
<p>Today, we talk to someone who is changing the world, impacting her reality and serving humanity by connecting with her passion. This episode is about being in service and one woman&#8217;s chose to dedicate a  year of her life to serve causes that are meaningful to her,  and doing so on a global scale. Margaret Mead was correct in saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>&#8220;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it&#8217;s the only thing that ever has.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<h1>Episode #26 is  about being in service</h1>
<div id="attachment_7501" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-7501 " title="Alisha with children in Uganda" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/292077_2332100226435_1367656541_2762418_6889193_n.jpg" alt="Alisha with children in Uganda" width="600" height="400" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Alisha with children in Sudan</p></div>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Everyone can be great because anyone can serve. You don&#8217;t have to have a college degree to serve. You don&#8217;t even have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve&#8230; You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.&#8221;</em></strong></p>

<p>Alisha Roberson is an amazing woman &amp; friend to both Miro an myself. She finds herself on a wonderful one one year volunteer adventure around the globe. When we met up with Alisha, both Miro, myself and  Alisha  were volunteering at a children&#8217;s organization in Ecuador. Actually, now Alisha finds herself in Sudan, on the African portion of her one year tour. <em>(Please read more about <a href="http://www.smallworldpursuits.com/">Alisha&#8217;s project here.</a>)</em></p>
<p>This episode includes an insightful interview where we talk about volunteering, being of service and connecting with that inner inspiration that we&#8217;ve learned to follow as it guides our lives. Alisha also shares tips on how to plan a one year volunteer trip, criteria for choosing organizations to volunteer with, and strategies to save money in preparation.</p>
<h3>Perfection is not so important</h3>
<p>In the interview Alisha reveals an epiphany she had, the day she realized she had to stop waiting for perfection and start living her dream. (<em>Something I think a lot of us can relate to.)</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Alisha writes about this experience here on her<a href="http://www.smallworldpursuits.com/the-day-i-stopped-waiting-for-perfection"> blog</a> :</em></p>
<p><strong><em>One of my biggest struggles was with perfection. That constant reminder to myself that there doesn’t have to be perfection before action.</em></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>A perfect plan. A perfect idea. A perfect way.</em></h3>
<p>Because, if we’re always waiting for perfection, our ideas will always stay ideas. There may never be action, because there may never be perfection. As I heard these words come out of my mouth, I realized that I still don’t even do some simple things, because I’m afraid that it won’t be perfect. So, this has been a simple moment of awareness for me. Being aware that my aim for perfection is actually holding me back. I am no longer going to stop acting on my ideas because they are not perfect.</p>
<p>So, the next time someone asks me what is my biggest piece of advice when it comes to pursuing dreams, travel plans, or making decisions on the next steps. I will simply say:</p>
<h2>Don’t wait for perfection to take action. Go be amazing, and learn along the way.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>We were so moved by her words, we are grateful for this reminder in our lives as well.</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">A Children&#8217;s Organization in Ecuador</span></p>
<p>This wonderful video, produced by Alisha from SmallWorldPursuits.com, shows some of the activities we led with the beautiful children in Ecuador. Working with the children was a true gift and kept us inspired.  See if you can spot Miro and myself working along side Alisha in some of the images.</p>

<p><strong>Small World Pursuits</strong> is a blog about my experiences on my volunteer journey around the world and a resource guide to help you on your own volunteer pursuits in this wonderful world.</p>
<p><strong>The Mission: </strong>To live and work throughout the world while volunteering with social cultural projects and philanthropic organizations that focus on education and have goals of teaching economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<p><strong>The Vision: </strong>To provide a volunteer resource guide that also highlights volunteer opportunities around the world. To help others believe in the transformative healing power that can be created through education and interaction. The vision of Small World Pursuits is based on the understanding of what a Senegalese poet once wrote:<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7506" title="screen-capture-2" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/screen-capture-2-265x300.png" alt="" width="212" height="240" /> <em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“In the end we will conserve only what we love. We love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught. We must learn about other cultures in order to understand, in order to love, and in order to preserve our common world heritage.”</strong></em><br />
<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Odyssey: </strong>An around the world volunteer voyage. To learn other ways of being and other ways of thinking. The quest to educate myself through social and spiritual enlightenment. To be in the world of human culture where I may seek out the commonalities of human kind.</p>

<h1>A brief History of Ecuador</h1>
<h3>For more on the history of Ecuador, visit this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador">wikipedia page</a>.</h3>
<p>The native people of Ecuador grew crops of maize, beans, potatoes and squash. They also raised dogs and guinea pigs for food. Many of them were skilled potters and metalworkers in gold, silver and copper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/karte-9-352.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-7505 alignnone" title="Ecuador Map" src="http://www.raisingmiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/karte-9-352.gif" alt="Ecuador Map" width="600" height="601" /></a></p>
<p>Then, in the late 15th century they were conquered by the Incas. Then, just over a hundred years later, the Spaniards encountered the coast of Ecuador for the first time. Soon thereafter,  Ecuador became the Spaniard&#8217;s focus, eventually resulting in conquest  in 1534 after having already conquered the Incas in what is now Peru.  In 1534 the Spaniards founded the city of Quito on the remains of a captured Inca city. The next year, in 1535, Guayaquil was founded.</p>
<p>In the years to come, diseases brought by the Spaniards, especially smallpox, killed many more of the native people than the Spanish soldiers did. With no resistance to European diseases the original peoples of Ecuador were decimated.</p>
<p>True to the nature of Spanish conquest,  the land  and people of Ecuador were treated as property and divided among the Spaniards. The settlers founded large estates and enslaved the native people  to work the land. The Spanish also brought slaves from Africa to Ecuador to work on sugar plantations. Today many Ecuadorians are of mixed race, part Spanish, part Native South American and part African.</p>
<p>In the 18th &amp; 19th centuries were filled with changes for the people of Ecuador, including  an economic recession, disillusionment and uprise from the Spanish rule, and part of the Bolivarian movement in 1820. In 1851, slavery was abolished in Ecuador and great tensions between different regions of  Ecuador resulted in the 1859 Ecuador split,  known as the &#8216;Terrible Year&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the late 19th and early 20th century Ecuador&#8217;s economy turned around as a result of  booming cocoa exports and the production of Panama hats.</p>
<p>20th Century Ecuador  brought a volatile political situation, including  military cous, a deep economic depression, earthquakes, political instability, and a quick succession of presidents.</p>
