			<title>Radio Advertising : Multi-Station Discount</title>
			<description>&lt;div&gt;
	As a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radioloungeusa.com/media_buying_direct_response_radio_advertising/&quot;&gt;media buyer for radio advertising&lt;/a&gt;, one must always be on the lookout for good deals when it comes to buying radio airtime.&amp;nbsp; Over the next few months, I will share some of the secrets to getting great radio advertising rates and negotiating the best schedule possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Right now, I want to focus on something quite basic yet powerful when media buying time comes around - look for multi-station discounts.&amp;nbsp; Multi-station buys are not just common nowaday, they have become almost the norm in this age of media consolidation.&amp;nbsp; Station clusters may have two, three...up to eight stations in one market.&amp;nbsp; Station management are usually trying to use the &amp;quot;cash-cow&amp;quot; station to drive sales on other stations within their cluster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With that said...It is a commonly known fact that purchasing in volume helps lower prices. The same holds true for number of stations.&amp;nbsp; If station KXXX is offering $300 per spot and KYYY is offering $300 per spot, and both are reaching effective segments of your potential customer (and both are owned by the same radio group), make a deal!&amp;nbsp; For example, tell the station rep that you will increase your radio advertising expenditure (i.e. spend more money) with the group but will pay $200 per spot for KXXX and KYYY as a combo (or maybe even less if the media buyer has a figure in mind). More than likely the answer will be &amp;quot;OK!&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp; You just cut your per spot rate by 33%.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s just one way to make the most of your radio advertising dollar.&amp;nbsp; A savvy media buyer will use many methods of negotiation to whittle down radio advertising rates to maximize a client&#39;s budget.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

	What radio stations should I run my advertising on?
 
	 
 
	A very common question heard here at Radio Lounge.  One of the biggest strengths of radio advertising is that radio is a very targeted medium.  Radio stations program content based upon their format.  Different formats target different demographics.  Want to reach women ages 35-44? An adult contemporary format might be your best choice.  Men 18-34?  Maybe sports talk or alternative rock stations would work best.  Every radio station has a &quot;sweet spot&quot;.  This sweet spot is going to be the strongest demographic segment based upon Arbitron ratings.  This is why it is very important to know your customer.  What are their ages, income levels, hobbies, etc?  This will allow you to fine tune your radio advertising efforts to reach the highest percentage of potential customers for the least amount of money.  Once you have defined your best station matches, it will be time to determine cost efficiencies...

	Nobody, okay, maybe a few, really knows how to present death to potential customers.&amp;nbsp; Many do it awkwardly, other&amp;rsquo;s create an advertising message that just lies there, but others have fun with the idea of death and burial. Especially to the owners of Cedar Hill in Hartford Connecticut.&amp;nbsp; Check out the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704388504575419263519517820.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;A Party To Die For&amp;quot; from the Wall St. Journal&lt;/a&gt; and note the video report on Cedar Hill and some others that know how event marketing that might be the ticket to those dearly beloved that are still with us.&lt;/div&gt;

			<title>Radio Advertising : Nuturing Creativity</title>
			<description>&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		In the early 70&amp;rsquo;s at a radio station in Upstate New York, I proposed a better way of categorizing our commercials, which at that time were on carts (like an 8-track tape).&amp;nbsp; I was the midday personality, not necessarily a management position.&amp;nbsp; To my surprise the station put my system into use and thanked me with a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant.&amp;nbsp; Pretty cool for a newly married guy making the big bucks in radio ($2.00 an hour at the time).&amp;nbsp; My point here is that so many companies don&amp;rsquo;t listen to their employees.&amp;nbsp; People at all levels of an organization have valid and valuable things to add to your business system.&amp;nbsp; By ignoring them, or worse yet, by not listening when they speak up, guarantees that the company loses their buy-in and a potential for making things better.&amp;nbsp; The article called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openforum.com/idea-hub/topics/the-world/article/ideacide-aka-14-ways-to-kill-creativity-matthew-e-may&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ideacide: or 14 Ways to Kill an Idea&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, written by Matthew E.

		In the early 70's at a radio station in Upstate New York, I proposed a better way of categorizing our commercials, which at that time were on carts (like an 8-track tape).  I was the midday personality, not necessarily a management position.  To my surprise the station put my system into use and thanked me with a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant.  Pretty cool for a newly married guy making the big bucks in radio ($2.00 an hour at the time).  My point here is that so many companies don't listen to their employees.  People at all levels of an organization have valid and valuable things to add to your business system.  By ignoring them, or worse yet, by not listening when they speak up, guarantees that the company loses their buy-in and a potential for making things better.  The article called &quot;Ideacide: or 14 Ways to Kill an Idea&quot;, written by Matthew E. May is worth the read.  If you have a similar experience, share it with us.
