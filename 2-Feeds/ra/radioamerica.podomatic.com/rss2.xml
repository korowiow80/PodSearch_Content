      <title>Blondie alexander-the-actor Free Otr</title>

Blondie was a radio situation comedy adapted from the long-run Blondie comic strip by Chic Young. The radio program had a long run on several networks from 1939 to 1950. After Penny Singleton was cast in the title role of the feature film Blondie (1938), co-starring with Arthur Lake as Dagwood, she and Lake repeated their roles December 20, 1938, on The Bob Hope Show. The appearance with Hope led to their own show, beginning July 3, 1939, on CBS as a summer replacement for The Eddie Cantor Show. However, Cantor did not return in the fall, so the sponsor, Camel Cigarettes chose to keep Blondie on the air Mondays at 7:30pm. Camel remained the sponsor through the early WWII years until June 26, 1944.

In 1944, Blondie was on the Blue Network, sponsored by Super Suds, airing Fridays at 7pm from July 21 to September 1. The final three weeks of that run overlapped with Blondie's return to CBS on Sundays at 8pm from August 13, 1944, to September 26, 1948, still sponsored by Super Suds. Beginning in mid-1945, the 30-minute program was heard Mondays at 7:30pm. Super Suds continued as the sponsor when the show moved to NBC on Wednesdays at 8pm from October 6, 1948, to June 29, 1949.

      <description>Gunsmoke is an American radio and television Western drama series created by director Norman MacDonnell and writer John Meston. The stories take place in and around Dodge City, Kansas, during the settlement of the American West.

The radio version ran from 1952 to 1961 and, according to John Dunning[1], amongst old-time radio fans, &quot;Gunsmoke is routinely placed among the best shows of any kind and any time.&quot; The television version ran from 1955 to 1975 and is the longest running prime time drama and the second-longest running prime time fictional program in U.S. television history, its record surpassed only by the Disney anthology television series and Hallmark Hall of Fame.

The Great Gildersleeve (1941-1957), initially written by Leonard L. Levinson, [1] was arguably the first spin-off program in broadcast history. Built around a character who had been a staple on the classic radio situation comedy Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest success in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off and later in a quartet of feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.

On Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve was a pompous windbag who became a consistent McGee nemesis (&quot;You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catch phrase). But he also became a popular enough windbag that Kraft Foods &#8212; looking primarily to promote its Parkay margarine spread &#8212; sponsored a new series with Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (the character was given several conflicting first names on Fibber McGee and Molly, and on one episode of that show revealed his middle name as Philharmonic) as the central, slightly softened, and slightly befuddled focus of a lively new family.</description>

A Date with Judy was an American radio program during the 1940s. It was a teenage comedy that began as a summer replacement for Bob Hope's show, sponsored by Pepsodent and airing on NBC from June 24 to September 16, 1941, with 14-year-old Ann Gillis in the title role. Dellie Ellis portrayed Judy when the series returned the next summer (June 23&#8211;September 15, 1942). Louise Erickson took over the role the following summer (June 30&#8211;September 22, 1943) when the series, sponsored by Bristol Myers, replaced The Eddie Cantor Show.

Louise Erickson continued as Judy for the next seven years, as the series, sponsored by Tums, aired from January 18, 1944 to January 4, 1949. As the popularity of the radio series peaked, Jane Powell starred as Judy in the MGM movie, A Date with Judy (1948). Co-starring with Powell were Elizabeth Taylor, Wallace Beery, Robert Stack, and Carmen Miranda.

Ford Motors and Revere Cameras were the sponsors for the final season of the radio series on ABC from October 13, 1949 to May 25, 1950.

A Date with Judy was also a comic book (based on the radio program) published by National Periodical Publications from October-November 1947 to October-November 1960.

Big-nosed and boisterous, Durante was a vaudeville favorite who remained a hit in the early days of radio and TV. Originally a saloon piano player, he combined his ragged musical talents with a rumpled charm and endless jokes about his nose, a mighty instrument which earned him the nickname &quot;Schnozzola&quot; or just &quot;the Schnoz.&quot; The 1935 stage musical Jumbo paired Durante with an elephant and boosted his career; he was a popular guest on the radio shows of stars like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, and eventually hosted his own shows as well. Durante's dese-and-dose New York accent was much parodied by impressionists of the day. He had a musical hit with the novelty tune &quot;Inka Dinka Doo&quot; and his famous sign-off phrase was &quot;Goodnight, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are.&quot;

The Marx Brothers were a team of sibling comedians that appeared in vaudeville, stage plays, film, and television.

Born in New York City, the Marx Brothers were the sons of Jewish immigrants from different parts of Germany (Plattdeutsch was the boys' first language). Their mother, Minnie Sch&#246;nberg, hailed from Dornum in East Frisia, Germany, and their father Simon &quot;Frenchie&quot; Marrix (whose name was anglicized to Sam Marx) from Alsace, now a part of France. The family lived in the Upper East Side of New York City between the Irish, German and Italian Quarters.

Jack Benny (February 14, 1894 in Chicago, Illinois &#8211; December 26, 1974 in Beverly Hills, California), born Benjamin Kubelsky, was an American comedian, vaudeville performer, and radio, television, and film actor. He was one of the biggest stars in classic American radio and was also a major television personality.

Benny may have been the first standup comedian, as the term is known, as well as one of the first to work with what became the situation comedy. He was renowned for his flawless comic timing and (especially) his ability to get laughs with either a pregnant pause or a single expression, such as his signature exasperated &quot;Well!&quot;. In hand with his dear friend and great &quot;rival&quot; Fred Allen &#8212; their long-running &quot;feud&quot; was one of the greatest running gags in comedy history &#8212; Benny helped establish a basic palette from which comedy since has rarely deviated, no matter how extreme or experimental it has become in their wake.

The Life of Riley was one of several blue-collar, ethnic sitcoms popular in the 1950s. Chester A. Riley was the breadwinner of an Irish-American nuclear family living in suburban Los Angeles. Although most of the program took place within the Riley household, his job as an airplane riveter sometimes figured prominently in weekly episodes. Riley's fixed place in the socio-economic structure also allowed for occasional barbs directed at the frustrations of factory employment and at the pretensions of the upper classes. After The Life of Riley was canceled, blue-collar protagonists like Riley would not reappear until   premiered in the 1970s. A pilot for The Life of Riley starred Herb Vigran and was broadcast on NBC in 1948. Six month later, the series appeared on NBC with Riley played by Gleason; however, Riley's malapropisms and oafish behavior were poorly suited to Gleason's wisecracking nightclub style. Bendix, who had played Riley on radio and in a movie version, was originally unable to play the part on television due to film obligations. When he did assume the role, however, he became synonymous with the character.

      <title>Duffs Tavern -44--03-07 Radio Americas Monday Edition</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627425.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.radioamerica.biz'&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigggdaddy.com&quot;&gt;Affordable Web Hosting $5.99 A month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Duffy's Tavern, an American radio situation comedy (CBS, 1941-1942; NBC-Blue Network, 1942-1944; NBC, 1944-1952), often featured top-name stage and film guest stars but always hooked those around the misadventures of the title establishment's malaprop-prone manager, Archie, played by the writer/actor who created the show, Ed Gardner.

In the show's familiar opening, &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,&quot; either solo on an old-sounding piano or by a larger orchestra, was interrupted by the ring of a telephone and Gardner's New Yorkese accent as he answered, &quot;Duffy's Tavern, where the elite meet to eat. Archie the manager speakin'. Duffy ain't here---oh, hello, Duffy.&quot;

Duffy, the owner, was never heard (or seen, when a film based on the show was made in 1945 or when a bid to bring the show to television was tried in 1954). But Archie always was---bantering with Duffy's man-crazy daughter, Miss Duffy (played by several actresses, beginning with Gardner's real-life first wife, Shirley Booth); with Eddie, the waiter/janitor (Eddie Green); and, especially, with Clifton Finnegan (Charlie Cantor), a likeable soul with several screws loose and a knack for falling for every other salesman's scam.

The show featured many high-profile guest stars, including Fred Allen, Mel Allen, Nigel Bruce, Bing Crosby, Boris Karloff, Veronica Lake,Peter Lorre, Tony Martin, Gene Tierney, Arthur Treacher and Shelley Winters. As the series progressed, Archie sllipped in and out of a variety of quixotic, self-imploding plotlines---from writing an opera to faking a fortune to marry an heiress. Such situations mattered less than did the show's quietly clever depiction of earthbound-but-dreaming New York city life and its individualistic, often bizarre characters.

      <title>Green Hornet  - Oliver Perry Radio Americas Sunday Edition</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627426.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.radioamerica.biz'&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigggdaddy.com&quot;&gt;Affordable Web Hosting $5.99 A month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The series detailed the adventures of Britt Reid, debonair newspaper publisher by day, crime-fighting masked hero at night, along with his sidekick, Kato, a Filipino of Japanese descent. A widespread urban legend has been the claim that the show's writers switched from one nationality to the other immediately after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, but the first disappeared well before direct U. S. involvement in the war, and the latter was not initially given until much later, with nothing more specific than &quot;Oriental&quot; being said in the interim. (When the characters were used in the first of a pair of movie serials, the politically perceptive producers of 1939 had Kato's nationality given as Korean.)

Britt Reid is a blood relative of The Lone Ranger. The character of Dan Reid, who appeared on the Lone Ranger program as the Masked Man's nephew, was also featured on the Green Hornet as Britt Reid's father, making the Green Hornet the grand-nephew of the Lone Ranger.

Originally, the show was to be called &quot;The Hornet&quot;, but the name was changed to &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; so that it could be copyrighted. The color was chosen because green hornets were reputed to be the angriest.

Jim Jewell directed the series until 1938. Jewell's sister, Lee Allman (Lenore Jewell Allman) wanted to play a part in a radio series at WXYZ so Jim had her written into The Green Hornet. She was the only actress to play Lenore Case, Britt Reid's secretary, during the entire run of the series. &quot;Casey&quot; was aware of her boss's double life, but only in the later years of the run. Similarly, another well known confidante, Police Commissioner Higgins, did not come into existence until near the end of the series.

      <title>The Great Gildersleeve - Radio America's Saturday Program</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.radioamerica.biz'&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigggdaddy.com&quot;&gt;Affordable Web Hosting $5.99 A month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


The Great Gildersleeve (1941-1957) was arguably the first spin-off program, as well as one of the first true situation comedies (as opposed to sketch programs) in broadcast history. Built around a character who had been a staple on the classic radio sit-com, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest success in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off, and later in a quartet of feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.

On Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve was a pompous windbag who became a consistent McGee nemesis (&quot;You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catch phrase). But he also became a popular enough windbag that Kraft Foods &#8212; looking primarily to promote its Parkay margarine spread &#8212; sponsored a new series with Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (the character was given several conflicting first names on Fibber McGee and Molly, and on one episode of that show revealed his middle name as Philharmonic) as the central, slightly softened, and slightly befuddled focus of a lively new family.

      <title>Boston Blackie - Radio America's Friday Program</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627428.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigggdaddy.com&quot;&gt;Affordable Web Hosting $5.99 A month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

src=&quot;http://radioamerica.podomatic.com/images/subscribe_with_itunes.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


The Boston Blackie radio series, starring Chester Morris, began June 23, 1944, on NBC as a summer replacement for The Amos 'n' Andy Show. Sponsored by Rinso, the series continued until September 15 of that year. Lesley Woods appeared as Blackie's girlfriend Mary Wesley, and Harlow Wilcox was the show's announcer.

On April 11, 1945, Richard Kollmar took over the title role in a radio series syndicated by Frederic W. Ziv to Mutual and other network outlets. Over 200 episodes of this series were produced between 1944 and October 25, 1950. Other sponsors included Lifebuoy Soap, Champagne Velvet beer and R&amp;H beer.

While investigating mysteries, Blackie invaribly encountered harebrained Police Inspector Faraday (Maurice Tarplin) and always solved the mystery to Faraday's amazement. Initially, friction surfaced in the relationship between Blackie and Faraday, but as the series continued, Faraday recognized Blackie's talents and requested assistance. Blackie dated Mary Wesley (Jan Miner), and for the first half of the series, his best pal Shorty was always on hand. The humorless Faraday was on the receiving end of Blackie's bad puns and word play.

      <title>Battle Of the Midway  - by john Ford</title>

src=&quot;http://radioamerica.podomatic.com/images/subscribe_with_itunes.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&quot;The Battle of Midway,&quot; directed by John Ford, provides a relatively
brief account of the Japanese attack of American ships at Midway atoll.
The film is comprised mostly of authentic footage from the battle, with
dramatic narration by Henry Fonda. &quot;Behind every cloud, there may be an
enemy,&quot; he intones as American fighter pilots search the sky. The rest

&quot;The Battle of Midway,&quot; directed by John Ford, provides a relatively
brief account of the Japanese attack of American ships at Midway atoll.
The film is comprised mostly of authentic footage from the battle, with
dramatic narration by Henry Fonda. &quot;Behind every cloud, there may be an
enemy,&quot; he intones as American fighter pilots search the sky. The rest
of the film mocks Emporer Tojo of Japan and portrays him as ruthless,
bombing hospitals and churches as he tries to conquer the Pacific.

In addition to his landmark radio work, Bud Colyer was the first person to portray Superman in motion pictures, once again lending his voice when the Man of Steel made his big-screen debut in animated cartoons.  These innovative science fiction spectaculars remain among the most technically polished examples of the &quot;short film&quot; art form.

Launched in September 1941 with the release of the initial entry, Superman, the cartoons were produced by Max Fleischer.  The Fleischer studio was initially based in New York and was famous for its rambunctios, rough-and-ready presentation of characters like Betty Boop and Popeye. The studio had just relocated to an enlarged modern facility in Florida.  Joe Shuster drew the model sheets for Lois Lane, Clark Kent, and Superman.  The first cartoon was received to critical acclaim and was nominated for an Academy Award. 

The Superman shorts look like feature films, complete with tracking shots and a stunning variety of camera angles, each of which necessitates a new background.  Artists duplicate real illumination, molding the characters with light and dark, and providing them with dramatic shadows.  The films move at an accelerating pace, with cuts coming faster and faster toward the climaxes, propelled by Sammy Timberg's dynamic musical scores.  Special effects involving fires, rays, and explosions set the screen ablaze.

The second cartoon, The Mechanical Monsters, was released near the end of 1941.  It features Superman battling an army of gigantic, flame-spewing, flying robots in a series of sensational scenes.  Later special effects extravaganzas include The Bulleteers, in which an airborn torpedo smashes through the skyscrapers of Metropolis, and The Magnetic Telescope, in which an astronomer's harebrained invention sends an asteroid hurtling earthward.  When not struggling with mad scientists, Superman takes on ferocious forces of nature like gorillas (in Terror on the Midway) or dinosaurs (The Arctic Giant).

In 1942 Paramount Studios acquired Fleischer Studios and gave it the new name of &quot;Famous Studios.&quot;  They produced the last 8 of the 17 shorts and continued the series until 1943. </description>

This article is about the comic book superhero Robin as he appears in other media, such as films, television and radio. Dick Grayson, the first Robin, is generally the Robin which is portrayed.

For decades, Robin rarely appeared withh Batman. The only exceptions have been animated stories featuring Robin as a member of the Teen Titans. Furthermore, from the 1940s to 1980s, Grayson was generally portrayed as being a teenager or adult. This was somewhat different from comic books, as Grayson started out at the age of eight.

Also from the 1940s to 1980s, Robin has appeared in the clalsic comic book suit of Grayson. However, since the 1990s, Dick Grayson's original &quot;pixie&quot; outfit has been avoided in other media. Instead, Robin usually wears a costume similar to the original uniform of Tim Drake, the third and current Robin in the comics. Drake, who was introduced near the end of the 1980s, has only been identified as the secret identity of Robin once in other media. </description>

There were several radio adaptations. Gasoline Alley during the 1930s starred Bill Idelson as Skeezix Wallet with Jean Gillespie as his girlfriend Nina Clock. Jimmy McCallon was Skeezix in the series that ran on NBC from February 17 to April 11, 1941, continuing on the Blue Network from April 28 to May 9 of that same year. The 15-minute series aired weekdays at 5:30pm. Along with Nina (Janice Gilbert), the characters included Skeezix's boss Wumple (Cliff Soubier) and Ling Wee (Junius Matthews), a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. Charles Schenck directed the scripts by Kane Campbell.

The syndicated series of 1948-49 featured a cast of Bill Lipton, Mason Adams and Robert Dryden. Sponsored by Autolite, the 15-minute episodes focused on Skeezix running a gas station and garage, the Wallet and Bobble Garage, with his partner, Wilmer Bobble. In New York this series aired on WOR from July 16, 1948 to January 7, 1949.</description>

 Popeye made his first animated appearance in Betty Boop Meets Popeye the Sailor (1933), one of several cartoons in which the popular Fleischer cartoon star met various comic strip characters, in hopes that some might prove popular enough to merit cartoon series of their own. The trial balloon didn't fly with Henry or The Little King, but it did with Popeye. The same year saw the release of I Yam What I Yam, the first of a long series of animated shorts in which Popeye received top billing.

The Fleischer Studio was taken over by Paramount Pictures in 1942, and renamed Famous Studios. Although it never achieved the heights of the Fleischer quality, Famous continued the Popeye series until 1957. In that year, the entire package of 228 cartoons started appearing on television.

During the 1960s, more short Popeye cartoons were made as TV originals. These were mass-produced in several animation studios, all over the world, and varied in quality. Many cartoon aficionados consider these to have diluted the product, and hold that the original Fleischer cartoons are the best. </description>

Gunsmoke is a long-running American radio and television Western drama created by director Norman MacDonnell and writer John Meston. The stories took place in and around Dodge City, Kansas, during the settlement of the American West.

The radio version ran from 1952 to 1961 and is commonly regarded as one of the finest radio dramas of all time. The television version ran from 1955 to 1975 and is the second longest running prime time fictional television program, its record surpassed only by the Disney anthology television series, which, though essentially the same in every incarnation, has appeared on TV under several titles.</description>

Charlie Chaplin was born on April 16 1889, in East Street, Walworth, London. His parents, both entertainers in the Music Hall tradition, separated before he was three. The 1891 census shows his mother, Hannah, living with Charlie and his older brother in Barlow Street, Walworth. As a child he lived with his mother in various addresses in and around Kennington Road in Lambeth, such as 3 Pownall Terrace, Chester Street and 39 Methley Street. His father Charles Chaplin Senior, who was of Roma ancestry, was an alcoholic and had little contact with his son, though Chaplin and his brother briefly lived with him and his mistress, whose name was Louise, at 287 Kennington Road (which address is now ornamented with a plaque commemorating Chaplin's residence here) when his mother was on a bout of mental illness and was admitted to the Cane Hill Asylum at Coulsdon. Louise sent the young Chaplin to Kennington Road school. Chaplin's father died when Charlie was twelve, leaving him and his older half-brother, Sydney Chaplin, in the sole care of his mother.

A serious condition in the larynx ended their mother&#8217;s career as a singer and her first crisis was when she was performing &quot;La Cantina&quot; at the Aldershot theatre, mainly frequented by rioters and soldiers, one of the worst places to perform. Lily was badly injured by the objects the audience mercilessly threw at her and she was booed off the stage. Backstage, she cried and argued with her manager. In the meantime, Chaplin went on stage alone and started singing a very well known tune at that time (Jack Jones).

At the early age of five, he attracted a constant stream of coins that the very same difficult and ruthless audience hurled at the talented artist, born before their very eyes.

Hannah Chaplin suffered from schizophrenia, and was again admitted to the Cane Hill Asylum. Chaplin had to be left in the workhouse at Lambeth, London, moving after several weeks to the Central London District School for paupers in Hanwell. The young Chaplin brothers forged a close relationship to survive. They gravitated to the Music Hall while still very young, and both proved to have considerable natural stage talent. Chaplin's early years of desperate poverty were a great influence on the characters and themes of his films and in later years he would re-visit the scenes of his childhood deprivation in Lambeth.

Unknown to Charlie and Sydney until years later, they had a half-brother through their mother, Wheeler Dryden, who was raised abroad by his father. He was later reconciled with the family, and worked for Chaplin at his Hollywood studio.

Chaplin's mother died in 1928 in Hollywood, seven years after being brought to the U.S. by her sons.

Although baptised in the Church of England, Chaplin was an agnostic for most of his life. [2]

This Is Your FBI was a radio crime drama which aired in the United States on ABC from April 6, 1945 to January 30, 1953. FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover gave it his endorsement, calling it &quot;the finest dramatic program on the air.&quot;

Producer-director Jerry Devine was given access to FBI files by Hoover, and the resulting dramatizations of FBI cases were narrated by Frank Lovejoy (1945), Dean Carleton (1946-47) and William Woodson (1948-53). Stacy Harris had the lead role of Special Agent Jim Taylor. Others in the cast were William Conrad, Bea Benaderet and Jay C. Flippen.

The show was created by producer-director Jerry Devine, a former comedy writer for Kate Smith and Tommy Riggs, who had turned his scripting talents to radio thrillers like Mr. District Attorney. This is Your FBI received the full cooperation of J. Edgar; Hoover gave Devine carte blanche to closed cases in the Bureau&#8217;s files for inspiration in writing the show&#8217;s weekly dramatizations. They were prefaced, of course, with the Dragnet-like disclaimer &#8220;All names used are fictitious and any similarity thereof to the names of persons or places, living or dead, is accidental.&#8221; (This led Jim Cox, author of Radio Crime Fighters, to observe: &#8220;Some listeners must have pondered that for a while&#8212;&#8216;So did these events happen or not?&#8217;&#8221;)

Debuting over ABC Radio on April 6, 1945, This is Your FBI broadcast from New York in its early run (1945-47), showcasing the talents of New York radio veterans like Mandel Kramer, Karl Swenson, Santos Ortega, Elspeth Eric, Joan Banks, and Frank Lovejoy (who narrated many of the shows). In 1948, though, the program relocated to Hollywood, and with the move established a regular weekly character in Special Agent Jim Taylor, a representative of all of the Bureau&#8217;s special agents, played by actor Stacy Harris.</description>

This Is Your FBI was a radio crime drama which aired in the United States on ABC from April 6, 1945 to January 30, 1953. FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover gave it his endorsement, calling it &quot;the finest dramatic program on the air.&quot;

Producer-director Jerry Devine was given access to FBI files by Hoover, and the resulting dramatizations of FBI cases were narrated by Frank Lovejoy (1945), Dean Carleton (1946-47) and William Woodson (1948-53). Stacy Harris had the lead role of Special Agent Jim Taylor. Others in the cast were William Conrad, Bea Benaderet and Jay C. Flippen.

The show was created by producer-director Jerry Devine, a former comedy writer for Kate Smith and Tommy Riggs, who had turned his scripting talents to radio thrillers like Mr. District Attorney. This is Your FBI received the full cooperation of J. Edgar; Hoover gave Devine carte blanche to closed cases in the Bureau&#8217;s files for inspiration in writing the show&#8217;s weekly dramatizations. They were prefaced, of course, with the Dragnet-like disclaimer &#8220;All names used are fictitious and any similarity thereof to the names of persons or places, living or dead, is accidental.&#8221; (This led Jim Cox, author of Radio Crime Fighters, to observe: &#8220;Some listeners must have pondered that for a while&#8212;&#8216;So did these events happen or not?&#8217;&#8221;)

Debuting over ABC Radio on April 6, 1945, This is Your FBI broadcast from New York in its early run (1945-47), showcasing the talents of New York radio veterans like Mandel Kramer, Karl Swenson, Santos Ortega, Elspeth Eric, Joan Banks, and Frank Lovejoy (who narrated many of the shows). In 1948, though, the program relocated to Hollywood, and with the move established a regular weekly character in Special Agent Jim Taylor, a representative of all of the Bureau&#8217;s special agents, played by actor Stacy Harris.</itunes:summary>

Death Valley Days was a long-running American radio and television anthology about true stories of the old American West, particularly the Death Valley area. It was created in 1930 by Ruth Woodman and ran on radio until 1945. It ran from 1952 to 1975 as a syndicated television show. The 558 television stories, which had different actors, were introduced by a host. The longest-running was &quot;The Old Ranger&quot; from 1952-1965, played by Stanley Andrews. The hosts following were actors Ronald Reagan, Robert Taylor, John Payne, Dale Robertson and Merle Haggard. During his time as host, Reagan also frequently appeared in the program as a performer. It has been rerun under other names and with other hosts, since the hosting segment at the beginning and the end could be easily reshot with another performer with no effect on the story. Alternate hosts and titles have included Frontier Adventure (Dale Robertson), The Pioneers (Will Rogers, Jr.), Trails West (Ray Milland), Western Star Theatre (Rory Calhoun) and Call of the West (John Payne). The last title was also often applied to the series' memorable, haunting theme music.

Under the Death Valley Days title, the program was invariably sponsored by Pacific Coast Borax Company, which during the program's run changed its name to U.S. Borax Company following a merger. Advertisements for the company's best-known products, 20 Mule Team Borax, a laundry additive, and Boraxo, a powdered hand soap, were often done by the program's host. Death Valley was the scene of much of the company's borax mining operations. The &quot;20-Mule Team Borax&quot; consumer products division of U.S. Borax was eventually bought out by the Dial Corporation, which as of 2006 still manufactures and markets them. U.S. Borax continued to mine and refine the borates and maintained Dial as one of its customers. In 2006, Rio Tinto, the parent company of U.S. Borax. Inc., decided to merge USB with two of its other holdings, Dampier Salt and Luzenac Talc, to form Rio Tinto Minerals and has moved its corporate headquarters to Denver, Colorado.

Death Valley Days is, judging from sheer number of episodes broadcast, by far the most successful syndicated television Western, the most successful television Western ever in the half-hour format, and arguably the most successful syndication of any genre in the history of the U.S. television market (Baywatch had a larger international market among U.S.-produced syndicated programs.)

It was created in 1930 by Ruth Woodman and ran on radio until 1945. It ran from 1952 to 1975 as a syndicated television show. The 558 television stories, which had different actors, were introduced by a host. The longest-running was &quot;The Old Ranger&quot; from 1952-1965, played by Stanley Andrews. The hosts following were actors Ronald Reagan, Robert Taylor, John Payne, Dale Robertson and Merle Haggard. During his time as host, Reagan also frequently appeared in the program as a performer. It has been rerun under other names and with other hosts, since the hosting segment at the beginning and the end could be easily reshot with another performer with no effect on the story. Alternate hosts and titles have included Frontier Adventure (Dale Robertson), The Pioneers (Will Rogers, Jr.), Trails West (Ray Milland), Western Star Theatre (Rory Calhoun) and Call of the West (John Payne). The last title was also often applied to the series' memorable, haunting theme music.

Under the Death Valley Days title, the program was invariably sponsored by Pacific Coast Borax Company, which during the program's run changed its name to U.S. Borax Company following a merger. Advertisements for the company's best-known products, 20 Mule Team Borax, a laundry additive, and Boraxo, a powdered hand soap, were often done by the program's host. Death Valley was the scene of much of the company's borax mining operations. The &quot;20-Mule Team Borax&quot; consumer products division of U.S. Borax was eventually bought out by the Dial Corporation, which as of 2006 still manufactures and markets them. U.S. Borax continued to mine and refine the borates and maintained Dial as one of its customers. In 2006, Rio Tinto, the parent company of U.S. Borax. Inc., decided to merge USB with two of its other holdings, Dampier Salt and Luzenac Talc, to form Rio Tinto Minerals and has moved its corporate headquarters to Denver, Colorado.

Death Valley Days is, judging from sheer number of episodes broadcast, by far the most successful syndicated television Western, the most successful television Western ever in the half-hour format, and arguably the most successful syndication of any genre in the history of the U.S. television market (Baywatch had a larger international market among U.S.-produced syndicated programs.)

Ellery Queen is both a fictional character and a pseudonym used by two American cousins from Brooklyn, New York: Daniel (David) Nathan, alias Frederic Dannay (October 20, 1905&#8211;September 3, 1982) and Manford (Emanuel) Lepofsky, alias Manfred Bennington Lee (January 11, 1905&#8211;April 3, 1971), to write detective fiction. In a successful series of novels that covered forty-two years, Ellery Queen was not only the name of the author, but also that of the detective-hero of the stories. Movies, radio shows, and television shows have been based on their works. The two, particularly Dannay, were also responsible for co-founding and directing Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, generally considered as one of the most influential English crime fiction magazines of the last sixty-five years. They were also prominent historians in the field, editing numerous collections and anthologies of short stories such as The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes. Their 994-page anthology for The Modern Library, 101 Years' Entertainment, The Great Detective Stories, 1841-1941, was a landmark work that remained in print for many years.</description>

Box 13 was a syndicated radio series about the escapades of newspaperman-turned-mystery novelist Dan Holliday, played by film star Alan Ladd. Created by Ladd's company, Mayfair Productions, Box 13 premiered August 22, 1948, on Mutual's New York flagship, WOR, and aired in syndication on the East Coast from August 22, 1948, to August 14. 1949. On the West Coast, Box 13 was heard from March 15, 1948 to March 7, 1949.

To seek out new ideas for his fiction, Holliday ran a classified ad in the Star-Times newspaper where he formerly worked. &quot;Adventure wanted, will go anywhere, do anything -- Box 13.&quot; The stories followed Holliday's adventures when he responded to the letters sent to him by such people as a psycho killer and various victims.

Sylvia Picker appeared as Holliday's scatterbrained secretary, Suzy, while Edmund MacDonald played police Lt. Kling. Supporting cast members included Betty Lou Gerson, Frank Lovejoy, Lurene Tuttle, Alan Reed, Luis Van Rooten and John Beal. Vern Carstensen, who directed Box 13 for producer Richard Sanville, was also the show's announcer.

Among the 52 episodes in the series were such mystery adventures as &quot;The Sad Night,&quot; &quot;Hot Box,&quot; &quot;Last Will And Nursery Rhyme,&quot; &quot;Hare And Hounds,&quot; &quot;Hunt And Peck,&quot; &quot;Death Is A Doll,&quot; &quot;Tempest In a Casserole&quot; and &quot;Mexican Maze.&quot; The dramas featured music by Rudy Schrager. Russell Hughes, who had previously hired Ladd as a radio actor in 1935 at a $19 weekly salary, wrote the scripts, sometimes in collaboration with Ladd. The partners in Mayfair Productions were Ladd and Bernie Joslin, who had previously run the chain of Mayfair Restaurants.</description>

The most famous radio broadcast of all time is still considered to be &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, by Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater on the Air, October 30, 1938. Produced by John Houseman, it caused a near-panic, and lots and lots of press coverage. It also spurred legislation banning the &quot;news&quot; format from radio drama for years following. And although Orson Welles himself said they had no idea they were causing such an uproar, he actually knew it was happening and was thrilled with all the attention. The script, by the late Howard Koch (who also won an Academy Award for the screenplay of &quot;Casablanca&quot;), was actually titled &quot;The Invasion From Mars&quot;, but was based on H.G. Wells' novella.

The story goes like this: That October evening most Americans tuned in to the &quot;The Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy Show&quot;, which was the most popular radio show of the time. Twelve minutes into the show they went to their usual musical break. At that point many people changed the channel, and came upon reporter Carl Philips in the field near Grover's Mills, New Jersey. By the time the break came, with the announcement that this was just a play, most of them had already gone off screaming. The &quot;War&quot; became famous, and the Bergen-McCarthy Show opposite it seems to have vanished.

&quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; story itself has been performed on radio many times since 1938, in a variety of formats. Gordon Payton claims to have 25 different audio versions of the story. The NBC Network anthology series Dimension X and X Minus One each offered a few alien invasion stories. (See &quot;The Embassy&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Order&quot;, &quot;The Last Martian&quot;, and &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, for example.</description>

      <title>African Queen - Humphrey Bogart</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627453.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.radioamerica.biz'&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigggdaddy.com&quot;&gt;Affordable Web Hosting $5.99 A month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 The African Queen is a story of survival and how two mismatched people pull together. These people, Charlie and Rose, learn to accommodate each other and function together to achieve a goal: Get a boat down a treacherous jungle river. They are civilians who are caught in enemy territory at the beginning of World War I. Rose is a crisp, prim, and proper minister&#8217;s sister. Charlie is a irreverent, unsophisticated somewhat crude mechanic.

On the surface level The African Queen is a love story of sorts and a tale of revenge. Rose wants to blow up a German gunboat down river because the Germans destroyed the mission and her brother died after being overwhelmed by the strain of the loss and the conditions of the jungle. Charlie just wants to get out of harms way but reluctantly goes along with her even though he thinks what she wants to do is &quot;crazy&quot; and believes it&#8217;s impossible to get a boat down the river. In the course of this venture they become closer and develop affection for each other as they respond to hardship and danger.

In watching The African Queen it is important to realize that blowing up the gunboat is a story gimmick. This gives Charlie and Rose a challenging goal and a reason to do something dangerous. It also heightens the tension between Rose and Charlie, creating a situation that helps us to realize something important about the character and qualities of these two and how they learn to tolerate and get along with each other. What makes The African Queen such an important and popular movie is its fundamental story: Two people, who are basically strangers, learn to function together and care for each other as they contend with very unpleasant realities during a difficult, unwanted ordeal.

When Skelton was drafted, Ozzie Nelson was prompted to create his own family situation comedy. The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet launched on CBS October 8, 1944, making a mid-season switch to NBC in 1949. The final years of the radio series were on ABC (the former NBC Blue Network) from October 14, 1949, to June 18, 1954. In an arrangement that amplified the growing pains of American broadcasting, as radio &quot;grew up&quot; into television (as George Burns once phrased it), the Nelsons' deal with ABC gave the network itself the right to move the show to television whenever it wanted to do it---they wanted, according to the Museum of Broadcast Communications, to have talent in the bullpen and ready to pitch, so to say, on their own network, rather than risk it defecting to CBS (where the Nelsons began) or NBC.

Their sons, David and Ricky, did not join the cast until five years after the radio series began. The two boys felt frustrated at hearing themselves played by actors and continually requested they be allowed to portray themselves. Prior to April 1949, the role of David was played by Joel Davis (1944-45) and Tommy Bernard, and Henry Blair appeared as Ricky. Since Ricky was only nine years old when he began on the show, his enthusiasm outstripped his ability at script reading, and at least once he jumped a cue, prompting Harriet to say, &quot;Not now, Ricky.&quot; Other cast members included John Brown as Syd &quot;Thorny&quot; Thornberry, Lurene Tuttle as Harriet's mother, Bea Benaderet as Gloria, Janet Waldo as Emmy Lou, and Dick Trout as Roger. Vocalists included Harriet Nelson, the King Sisters, and Ozzie Nelson. The announcers were Jack Bailey and Verne Smith. The music was by Billy May and Ozzie Nelson. The producers were Dave Elton and Ozzie Nelson. [1]</description>

There were several radio adaptations. Gasoline Alley during the 1930s starred Bill Idelson as Skeezix Wallet with Jean Gillespie as his girlfriend Nina Clock. Jimmy McCallon was Skeezix in the series that ran on NBC from February 17 to April 11, 1941, continuing on the Blue Network from April 28 to May 9 of that same year. The 15-minute series aired weekdays at 5:30pm. Along with Nina (Janice Gilbert), the characters included Skeezix's boss Wumple (Cliff Soubier) and Ling Wee (Junius Matthews), a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. Charles Schenck directed the scripts by Kane Campbell.

The syndicated series of 1948-49 featured a cast of Bill Lipton, Mason Adams and Robert Dryden. Sponsored by Autolite, the 15-minute episodes focused on Skeezix running a gas station and garage, the Wallet and Bobble Garage, with his partner, Wilmer Bobble. In New York this series aired on WOR from July 16, 1948 to January 7, 1949.</description>

James Francis Durante, better known as Jimmy Durante, (February 10, 1893 &#8211; January 29, 1980) was an American singer, pianist, comedian and actor, whose distinctive gravel delivery, comic language butchery, jazz-influenced songs, and large nose &#8212; his frequent jokes about it included a frequent self-reference that became his nickname: &quot;Schnozzola&quot; &#8212; helped make him one of America's most familiar and popular personalities of the 1920s through the 1970s.

A product of working-class New York, Durante dropped out of school in the eighth grade to become a full-time ragtime pianist, working the city circuit and earning the nickname &quot;Ragtime Jimmy,&quot; before he joined one of the first recognizable jazz bands in New York, the Original New Orleans Jazz Band. Durante was the only member of the group who didn't hail from New Orleans. His routines of breaking into a song to use a joke, with band or orchestra chord punctuation after each line became a Durante trademark. In 1920, the group was renamed Jimmy Durante's Jazz Band.

Durante became a vaudeville star and radio attraction by the mid-1920s, with a music and comedy trio called Clayton, Jackson and Durante. By 1934, he had a major record hit, his own novelty composition &quot;Inka Dinka Doo,&quot; and it became his signature song for practically the rest of his life. A year later, Durante starred in the Billy Rose stage musical, Jumbo, in which a police officer stopped him while leading a live elephant and asked him, &quot;What are you doing with that elephant?&quot; Durante's reply, &quot;What elephant?&quot;, was a regular show-stopper.</description>

The Avengers burst in the door of spy and super-hero adventure drama on South African radio in 1971, starring Donald Monat as John Steed, and Diane Appleby as the wonderful Emma Peel. It was based on the fine British TV series, which was very popular from the start in the UK, and is an excellent example of radio's adaptation of the television medium...as it had done with movies all along.</description>

King Kong was a great Box office success, as it became the highest grossing film of 1933 and the fifth highest grossing film of the 1930's. An impressive feat considering King Kong came out during one of the worst years of the Great Depression. Due to popular demand King Kong was re-released numerous times through the years.

    * In 1938 King Kong was re-released for the first time, but suffered some censorship. The Hays Office (in accordance with stiffer decency rules) removed a few scenes from the film that were considered too violent or obscene.

These include:

    * The Brontosaurus biting the men to death in the swamp
    * Kong peeling Ann Darrow's clothing off of her.
    * Kong's violent attack on the native village
    * Kong biting a New Yorker to death
    * Kong dropping a women to her death after mistaking her for Ann Darrow.

    * In 1942 King Kong was re-released again to great Box Office success. However it was altered again by censors as various scenes were darkened to 'minimize gore&quot;.

    * In 1952 King Kong saw its greatest release to date. Not only did it gross more money then any of its other releases, but it brought in more money then most new &quot;A-List&quot; pictures did that year. Due to this success, Warner Brothers was inspired to make a giant monster film of its own called The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. This movie in turn ended up kicking off the &quot;giant monster on the loose&quot; film boom of the 1950s.

    * King Kong was sold to television in early 1956 and pulled in an estimated 80% of all households with televisions in the New York area that week. In summer of 1956, King Kong was re-released theatrically (mainly drive-ins) based on its great TV success.

    * In the late 1960s, all the censored scenes that were cut back in 1938 were found, and restored back into the film. Janus Films gave the restored King Kong a brief theatrical re-release in 1971. This was the first time since its original run in 1933 that King Kong was seen in its complete form.

No show was more listened to in rural
America than Lum and Abner (1935-1953)
A large part of America was rural during its
run. On the air for over twenty-two years (the
first few years on local radio), it was the situation
comedy second only to Fibber McGee and Molly in popularity. Lum (played by Chester Lauck) and Abner (Norris Goff) exemplified the small town, rural Americans so many people strongly identified with, and their homespun, gentle humor struck a familiar but somehow surprisingly funny
note in people, keeping them tuned in week after
week.

Partners Lum and Abner owned the Jot `Em Down Store and Library, a kind of jumble shop, selling everything from lye soap to stoves to used books - a little bit of this, a little bit of that - in the fictitious town of Pine Ridge, Arkansas. By 1936, the show had become so popular, the town of Waters, Arkansas, officially changed its name to Pine Ridge. Frequent customers hanging around Lum and Abner's potbelly stove were such country characters as Grandpappy Peabody, Snake Hogan, and Cedric We Hunt (all played by Lauk), and Dick Huddleston, the town postmaster, Doc Miller, and Squire Skimp (played by Goff). Others heard on the show from time to time were Zasu Pitts, Cliff Arquette, Edna Best, Cornelius Peeples, and Andy Devine.

Dragnet was a popular, influential and long-running radio and television police procedural about the cases of a dedicated Los Angeles police detective, Sergeant Joe Friday, and his partners. The show takes its name from an actual police term, a dragnet for any system of coordinated measures for apprehending criminals or suspects.

Abbott and Costello is the name of an American comedy duo made up of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello

William &quot;Bud&quot; Abbott and Lou Costello first worked together in 1935 at the Eltinge burlesque theater on 42nd Street in New York. Costello (1906-1959) had become a comic after failing as a movie stunt double and extra.

Abbott and Costello is the name of an American comedy duo made up of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello

William &quot;Bud&quot; Abbott and Lou Costello first worked together in 1935 at the Eltinge burlesque theater on 42nd Street in New York. Costello (1906-1959) had become a comic after failing as a movie stunt double and extra. Abbott (1897-1974) had been in burlesque since 1916, first as a cashier, then a producer and finally a performer. Throughout the late 1930s, Abbott and Costello built their act by adapting and improving upon dozens of old burlesque sketches, including &quot;Who's on First?&quot;

Grace Ethel Cecile Rosalie Allen was born into a show business family; after being educated at Star of the Sea Convent School in girlhood, she teamed in vaudeville with her sister, Bessie, in 1909.

She met George Burns and the two immediately launched a new partnership&#8212;but they did not click until Burns cannily flipped the act around: after a Hoboken, New Jersey performance in which they tested the new style for the first time, Burns's hunch proved right. Gracie was the better laugh-getter, especially with the &quot;illogical logic&quot; that informed her responses to Burns's prompting comments or questions.

Allen's half of the act was known generally as a &quot;Dumb Dora&quot; act, named after a very early film of the same name that featured a scatterbrained female protagonist, but her &quot;illogical logic&quot; style was several cuts above the Dumb Dora stereotype, as was Burns's understated straight man. The twosome worked the new style tirelessly on the road, building a following, and finally playing the vaudevillian's dream: the Palace in New York. They fell in love along the way and married in Cleveland, Ohio on January 7, 1926&#8212;somewhat daring for those times, considering Burns's Jewish and Allen's Irish Catholic upbringing.[2] (For her part, Allen also endeared herself to her in-laws by adopting his mother's favourite phrase, used whenever the older woman needed to bring her son back down to earth: &quot;Nattie, you're a nice boy,&quot; using a diminutive of his given name. When Burns's mother died, Allen comforted her grief-stricken husband with the same phrase.)</description>

Bogie is an actor who continues to rank near the top on everybody's list. What is not generally known is that he made many appearances on radio after he moved his act from Broadway to Hollywood. In 1930 he got a contract with Fox and his feature film debut was in a 1930 short &quot;Broadway's Like That&quot;, co-starring Ruth Etting and Joan Blondell. Fox released him after two years. After another five years of stage and minor film roles, he broke through with &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; in 1936. Leslie Howard was starring in the movie, and threatened to quit unless Bogie, his fellow actor from the Broadway production, played Duke Mantee in the film version with him. Bogie named one of his sons Leslie in gratitude for this big break.In fact, many of Bogart's radio appearances were versions of the great films he did, but often he did guest spots or played characters that weren't from films. These performances are not known to the millions of younger fans that weren't lucky enough to hear radio as it happened. This collection give everybody the chance to hear that great Bogart voice again, and enjoy just how special his acting was. Incidentally, while serving in the U.S. Navy after getting kicked out of Andover Academy, he was wounded in the shelling of the USS. Leviathan. The resulting partial facial paralysis caused by his wounds gave him that signature vocal and facial style he is known for.
Bogart on the radio, circa 1940Lux Radio Theater was the premier Hollywood radio show, and featured themajor stars in their film roles. We have several of Bogie's greatest roles here, including a rehearsal for Bullets or Ballots. (That's the 1936 crime film classic with Edward G. Robinson and Joan Blondell).

Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video signals (programs) to a number of recipients (&quot;listeners&quot; or &quot;viewers&quot;) that belong to a large group. This group may be the public in general, or a relatively large audience within the public. Thus, an Internet channel may distribute text or music world-wide, while a public address system in (for example) a workplace may broadcast very limited ad hoc soundbites to a small population within its range. The sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a schedule. With all technological endevours a number of technical terms and slang are developed please see the list of broadcasting terms for a glossary of terms used. Television and radio programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or cable, often both simultaneously. By coding signals and having decoding equipment in homes, the latter also enables subscription-based channels and pay-per-view services. A broadcasting organisation may broadcast several programs at the same time, through several channels (frequencies), for example BBC One and Two. On the other hand, two or more organisations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day. Digital radio and digital television may also transmit multiplexed programming, with several channels compressed into one ensemble. When broadcasting is done via the Internet the term webcasting is often used. In 2004 a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce Podcasting. Podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast/narrowcast medium. One of the main proponents being Adam Curry and his associates the Podshow. Broadcasting forms a very large segment of the mass media. Broadcasting to a very narrow range of audience is called narrowcasting. The term &quot;broadcast&quot; was coined by early radio engineers from the midwestern United States. &quot;Broadcasting&quot;, in farming, is one method of spreading seed using a wide toss of the hand, in a broad cast.

Alan Walbridge Ladd (September 3, 1913 &#8211; 29 January 1964) was an American film actor. He was famous for his emotionless demeanor and small stature (reports of his height vary from 5'2&quot; to 5'9&quot;, with 5'6&quot; being the most generally accepted today). In just about all of his films he played either the hero or a bad guy with a conscience.

Ladd was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas to English immigrant parents, and died in Palm Springs, California of an overdose of alcohol and sedatives at the age of 50.

After first becoming a star with his performance as a hitman with a conscience in This Gun for Hire (1942), he became most famous for his starring role as a gunfighter in the classic 1953 western Shane. Veronica Lake was an ideal co-star; as she was so petite, 4' 11&#189;&quot; (1.51 m), she made him seem taller than he really was. Ladd also made Quigley's Top 10 Stars of the Year List 3 times, 1947, 1953 and 1954.

In 1954 he starred along side Peter Cushing and Patrick Troughton in The Black Knight.

Ladd also worked in radio, most notably the syndicated series Box 13. This series ran from 1948 to 1949 and was produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

He was sometimes listed as Allan Ladd in credits. His son Alan Ladd, Jr. became a motion picture executive and producer. Another son David Ladd was married to Charlie's Angels star Cheryl Ladd.

Alan Ladd was married to silent film actress Sue Carol, who was also his manager. Actress Jordan Ladd is his granddaughter.

On his passing in 1964, Ladd was entombed in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

Alan Walbridge Ladd (September 3, 1913 &#8211; 29 January 1964) was an American film actor. He was famous for his emotionless demeanor and small stature (reports of his height vary from 5'2&quot; to 5'9&quot;, with 5'6&quot; being the most generally accepted today). In just about all of his films he played either the hero or a bad guy with a conscience.

Ladd was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas to English immigrant parents, and died in Palm Springs, California of an overdose of alcohol and sedatives at the age of 50.

After first becoming a star with his performance as a hitman with a conscience in This Gun for Hire (1942), he became most famous for his starring role as a gunfighter in the classic 1953 western Shane. Veronica Lake was an ideal co-star; as she was so petite, 4' 11&#189;&quot; (1.51 m), she made him seem taller than he really was. Ladd also made Quigley's Top 10 Stars of the Year List 3 times, 1947, 1953 and 1954.

In 1954 he starred along side Peter Cushing and Patrick Troughton in The Black Knight.

Ladd also worked in radio, most notably the syndicated series Box 13. This series ran from 1948 to 1949 and was produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

He was sometimes listed as Allan Ladd in credits. His son Alan Ladd, Jr. became a motion picture executive and producer. Another son David Ladd was married to Charlie's Angels star Cheryl Ladd.

Alan Ladd was married to silent film actress Sue Carol, who was also his manager. Actress Jordan Ladd is his granddaughter.

On his passing in 1964, Ladd was entombed in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

Blondie was a radio situation comedy adapted from the long-run Blondie comic strip by Chic Young. The radio program had a long run on several networks from 1939 to 1950.

After Penny Singleton was cast in the title role of the feature film Blondie (1938), co-starring with Arthur Lake as Dagwood, she and Lake repeated their roles December 20, 1938, on The Bob Hope Show. The appearance with Hope led to their own show, beginning July 3, 1939, on CBS as a summer replacement for The Eddie Cantor Show. However, Cantor did not return in the fall, so the sponsor, Camel Cigarettes chose to keep Blondie on the air Mondays at 7:30pm. Camel remained the sponsor through the early WWII years until June 26, 1944.

In 1944, Blondie was on the Blue Network, sponsored by Super Suds, airing Fridays at 7pm from July 21 to September 1. The final three weeks of that run overlapped with Blondie's return to CBS on Sundays at 8pm from August 13, 1944, to September 26, 1948, still sponsored by Super Suds. Beginning in mid-1945, the 30-minute program was heard Mondays at 7:30pm. Super Suds continued as the sponsor when the show moved to NBC on Wednesdays at 8pm from October 6, 1948, to June 29, 1949.</description>

Pulp magazine publisher Street and Smith decided that instead of advertising their magazines on newsstands, they would try something new: radio. In 1930, they sponsored a weekly show called the Detective Story Hour featuring adaptations of mystery stories from their magazine of the same name. The shows were first announced, then later narrated by a strange and shadowy figure named - appropriately - The Shadow. The voice was done by James La Curto, and later Frank Readick Jr.

Much to Street and Smith's amazement, it was the narrator that became more popular than the show. Audiences were requesting for &quot;that Shadow Detective Magazine&quot;. Walter B. Gibson was soon hired to write what would become one of the most successful pulp novel series in the 1930s and 1940s. In the meantime, The Shadow remained a narrator for other radio show such as Blue Coal Radio Revue and Love Story Hour (another Street and Smith magazine) during 1931-1932. During 1932, he had gotten his own show, but still remained a narrator.</description>

Pulp magazine publisher Street and Smith decided that instead of advertising their magazines on newsstands, they would try something new: radio. In 1930, they sponsored a weekly show called the Detective Story Hour featuring adaptations of mystery stories from their magazine of the same name. The shows were first announced, then later narrated by a strange and shadowy figure named - appropriately - The Shadow. The voice was done by James La Curto, and later Frank Readick Jr.

Much to Street and Smith's amazement, it was the narrator that became more popular than the show. Audiences were requesting for &quot;that Shadow Detective Magazine&quot;. Walter B. Gibson was soon hired to write what would become one of the most successful pulp novel series in the 1930s and 1940s. In the meantime, The Shadow remained a narrator for other radio show such as Blue Coal Radio Revue and Love Story Hour (another Street and Smith magazine) during 1931-1932. During 1932, he had gotten his own show, but still remained a narrator.</itunes:summary>

Lum and Abner, an American radio comedy which aired as a network program from 1932 to 1954, became an American institution in its low-keyed, arch rural wit. One of a series of 15-minute serial comedies that dotted American radio at its height as America's number one home entertainment&#8212;others included Amos 'n' Andy, Easy Aces, The Goldbergs, and Vic and Sade&#8212;Lum and Abner included various elements of each but yielded something as singular as the others and became somewhat more of an institution.

The creation of co-stars Chester Lauck (who played Columbus &quot;Lum&quot; Edwards) and Norris Goff (Abner Peabody), Lum and Abner was as low-keyed as Easy Aces, as cheerfully absurdist as Vic and Sade, and raised The Goldbergs ethnic focus by amplifying the protagonists' regional identities. As the co-owners of the Jot 'em Down Store in the then-fictional town of Pine Ridge, Arkansas, who were always stumbling upon moneymaking ideas only to get themselves fleeced by nemesis Squire Skimp, before finding one or another way to redeem themselves, Lum and Abner played the hillbilly theme with deceptive cleverness: the hillbillies just knew the slickers were going to get theirs, sooner or later, and either didn't mind or knew more than they let on that the slickers getting theirs was a matter of fortunate circumstance.</description>

MacDonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as The Lone Ranger or The Cisco Kid. Gunsmoke was set in Dodge City, Kansas during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning notes that &quot;The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.&quot; He also writes that among old-time radio fans, &quot;Gunsmoke is routinely placed among the best shows of any kind and any time.&quot; (Dunning, 304) The show's cast, writing and sound effects have received much praise.

The radio series, which first aired April 26, 1952, and ran until June 18, 1961, on CBS, starred William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as the ghoulish, brittle Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell and Parley Baer as Dillon's assistant (but not his deputy) Chester Proudfoot. (On the television series, Doc's first name was changed to Galen, and Chester's last name was changed to Goode.) Chester's character had no surname until &quot;Proudfoot&quot; was ad libbed by Baer during a rehearsal early on, while Doc Adams was named after cartoonist Charles Addams. In a 1953 interview with Time, MacDonnell declared, &quot;Kitty is just someone Matt has to visit every once in a while. We never say it, but Kitty is a prostitute, plain and simple.&quot; (Dunning, 304)

William Conrad was actually one of the last actors who auditioned for the role of Marshal Dillon. He was already one of radio's busiest actors and had a powerful and distinctive baritone voice. Though Meston championed him, MacDonnell thought that Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over MacDonnell after reading just a few lines.

The show was distinct from other radio westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, and due to the outstanding sound effects, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie terrain where the show was set. The effects were subtle but multilayered and utilized very well, given the show's spacious feel. Dunning writes, &quot;The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above the muted shouts of kids playing in an alley. He heard noises from the next block, too, where the inevitable dog was barking.&quot; (Dunning, 305)</description>

Radio Listeners in Panic, Taking War Drama as Fact
Many Flee Homes to Escape 'Gas Raid From Mars'--Phone Calls Swamp Police at Broadcast of Wells Fantasy
This article appeared in the New York Times on Oct. 31, 1938.

A wave of mass hysteria seized thousands of radio listeners between 8:15 and 9:30 o'clock last night when a broadcast of a dramatization of H. G. Wells's fantasy, &quot;The War of the Worlds,&quot; led thousands to believe that an interplanetary conflict had started with invading Martians spreading wide death and destruction in New Jersey and New York.

The broadcast, which disrupted households, interrupted religious services, created traffic jams and clogged communications systems, was made by Orson Welles, who as the radio character, &quot;The Shadow,&quot; used to give &quot;the creeps&quot; to countless child listeners. This time at least a score of adults required medical treatment for shock and hysteria.

In Newark, in a single block at Heddon Terrace and Hawthorne Avenue, more than twenty families rushed out of their houses with wet handkerchiefs and towels over their faces to flee from what they believed was to be a gas raid. Some began moving household furniture.

Throughout New York families left their homes, some to flee to near-by parks. Thousands of persons called the police, newspapers and radio stations here and in other cities of the United States and Canada seeking advice on protective measures against the raids.

The program was produced by Mr. Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air over station WABC and the Columbia Broadcasting System's coast-to-coast network, from 8 to 9 o'clock.

The radio play, as presented, was to simulate a regular radio program with a &quot;break-in&quot; for the material of the play. The radio listeners, apparently, missed or did not listen to the introduction, which was: &quot;The Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations present Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air in 'The War of the Worlds' by H. G. Wells.&quot;

They also failed to associate the program with the newspaper listening of the program, announced as &quot;Today: 8:00-9:00--Play: H. G. Wells's 'War of the Worlds'--WABC.&quot; They ignored three additional announcements made during the broadcast emphasizing its fictional nature.

Mr. Welles opened the program with a description of the series of which it is a part. The simulated program began. A weather report was given, prosaically. An announcer remarked that the program would be continued from a hotel, with dance music. For a few moments a dance program was given in the usual manner. Then there was a &quot;break-in&quot; with a &quot;flash&quot; about a professor at an observatory noting a series of gas explosions on the planet Mars.

News bulletins and scene broadcasts followed, reporting, with the technique in which the radio had reported actual events, the landing of a &quot;meteor&quot; near Princeton N. J., &quot;killing&quot; 1,500 persons, the discovery that the &quot;meteor&quot; was a &quot;metal cylinder&quot; containing strange creatures from Mars armed with &quot;death rays&quot; to open hostilities against the inhabitants of the earth.

Despite the fantastic nature of the reported &quot;occurrences,&quot; the program, coming after the recent war scare in Europe and a period in which the radio frequently had interrupted regularly scheduled programs to report developments in the Czechoslovak situation, caused fright and panic throughout the area of the broadcast.

Telephone lines were tied up with calls from listeners or persons who had heard of the broadcasts. Many sought first to verify the reports. But large numbers, obviously in a state of terror, asked how they could follow the broadcast's advice and flee from the city, whether they would be safer in the &quot;gas raid&quot; in the cellar or on the roof, how they could safeguard their children, and many of the questions which had been worrying residents of London and Paris during the tense days before the Munich agreement.

So many calls came to newspapers and so many newspapers found it advisable to check on the reports despite their fantastic content that The Associated Press sent out the following at 8:48 P. M.:

&quot;Note to Editors: Queries to newspapers from radio listeners throughout the United States tonight, regarding a reported meteor fall which killed a number of New Jerseyites, are the result of a studio dramatization. The A. P.&quot;

Similarly police teletype systems carried notices to all stationhouses, and police short-wave radio stations notified police radio cars that the event was imaginary. </description>

Radio Listeners in Panic, Taking War Drama as Fact
Many Flee Homes to Escape 'Gas Raid From Mars'--Phone Calls Swamp Police at Broadcast of Wells Fantasy
This article appeared in the New York Times on Oct. 31, 1938.

A wave of mass hysteria seized thousands of radio listeners between 8:15 and 9:30 o'clock last night when a broadcast of a dramatization of H. G. Wells's fantasy, &quot;The War of the Worlds,&quot; led thousands to believe that an interplanetary conflict had started with invading Martians spreading wide death and destruction in New Jersey and New York.

The broadcast, which disrupted households, interrupted religious services, created traffic jams and clogged communications systems, was made by Orson Welles, who as the radio character, &quot;The Shadow,&quot; used to give &quot;the creeps&quot; to countless child listeners. This time at least a score of adults required medical treatment for shock and hysteria.

In Newark, in a single block at Heddon Terrace and Hawthorne Avenue, more than twenty families rushed out of their houses with wet handkerchiefs and towels over their faces to flee from what they believed was to be a gas raid. Some began moving household furniture.

Throughout New York families left their homes, some to flee to near-by parks. Thousands of persons called the police, newspapers and radio stations here and in other cities of the United States and Canada seeking advice on protective measures against the raids.

The program was produced by Mr. Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air over station WABC and the Columbia Broadcasting System's coast-to-coast network, from 8 to 9 o'clock.

The radio play, as presented, was to simulate a regular radio program with a &quot;break-in&quot; for the material of the play. The radio listeners, apparently, missed or did not listen to the introduction, which was: &quot;The Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations present Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air in 'The War of the Worlds' by H. G. Wells.&quot;

They also failed to associate the program with the newspaper listening of the program, announced as &quot;Today: 8:00-9:00--Play: H. G. Wells's 'War of the Worlds'--WABC.&quot; They ignored three additional announcements made during the broadcast emphasizing its fictional nature.

Mr. Welles opened the program with a description of the series of which it is a part. The simulated program began. A weather report was given, prosaically. An announcer remarked that the program would be continued from a hotel, with dance music. For a few moments a dance program was given in the usual manner. Then there was a &quot;break-in&quot; with a &quot;flash&quot; about a professor at an observatory noting a series of gas explosions on the planet Mars.

News bulletins and scene broadcasts followed, reporting, with the technique in which the radio had reported actual events, the landing of a &quot;meteor&quot; near Princeton N. J., &quot;killing&quot; 1,500 persons, the discovery that the &quot;meteor&quot; was a &quot;metal cylinder&quot; containing strange creatures from Mars armed with &quot;death rays&quot; to open hostilities against the inhabitants of the earth.

Despite the fantastic nature of the reported &quot;occurrences,&quot; the program, coming after the recent war scare in Europe and a period in which the radio frequently had interrupted regularly scheduled programs to report developments in the Czechoslovak situation, caused fright and panic throughout the area of the broadcast.

Telephone lines were tied up with calls from listeners or persons who had heard of the broadcasts. Many sought first to verify the reports. But large numbers, obviously in a state of terror, asked how they could follow the broadcast's advice and flee from the city, whether they would be safer in the &quot;gas raid&quot; in the cellar or on the roof, how they could safeguard their children, and many of the questions which had been worrying reside(continued)</itunes:summary>

William Alexander Abbott (born October 6, 1897 in Asbury Park, N.J.) was already an experienced 'straight man' when he first met his partner Louis Francis Cristillo (born March 6, 1906 in Paterson, N.J.) on the burlesque circuit. In 1936 the duo teamed up and became a much in demand act. However, it wasn't until an appearance on the Kate Smith Radio Hour, performing what would soon become their most famous sketch &quot;Who's On First,&quot; that Bud Abbott &amp; Lou Costello were to experience true stardom and a Hollywood career. Signed by Universal in 1939, Bud &amp; Lou were hailed by the studio as &quot;The New Kings Of Comedy,&quot; and went on to produce a decade of box office hits.</description>

The Superman animated cartoons, commonly known as the &quot;Fleischer Superman cartoons&quot; were a series of seventeen animated Technicolor short films, released by Paramount Pictures between 1941 and 1943, based upon the comic book character Superman. The first nine cartoons were produced by Fleischer Studios (the name by which the cartoons are commonly known). In 1942, Fleischer Studios was dissolved and reorganized as Famous Studios, which produced the final eight shorts. These cartoons are seen as some of the finest, and certainly the most lavishly budgeted, animated cartoons produced during The Golden Age of American animation. In 1994, the series was voted #33 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.

The Red Skelton Show began on radio in 1941 and was a success but television was the medium which best showcased the huge talents of Red Skelton. Radio didn't allow for Skelton to demonstrate his gift for pantomine and sight gags.

The show always featured a guest star and some skits. Musical guests performed and one of the first TV appearances of the Rolling Stones was on Red Skelton.

But it was for the wonderful characters Skelton created that people tuned in. Among those characters:

    Clem Kadiddlehopper
    Freddy Freeloader
    The Mean Widdle Kid
    Sheriff Deadeye
    Willy Lump Lump
    Cauliflower McPugg

Alan Young (born November 19, 1919) is an actor best known for his television role opposite a talking horse, Mister Ed.

Mr Young was born in North Shields,Tyne and Wear, England, and had the given name of Angus, he was raised in Edinburgh, Scotland and in Canada. He grew to love radio when bedbound as a child because of severe asthma, and became a radio broadcaster on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1944, he made the leap to American radio with The Alan Young Show, NBC's summer replacement for Eddie Cantor. Following a move to ABC in the fall (1944-46), he returned to NBC (1946-49).

His television version of The Alan Young Show began in 1950. After the show's cancellation, Young appeared in supporting parts in films such as The Time Machine (1960).

His most popular venture, however, was Mister Ed, a CBS television show which ran from 1961 to 1966. He played the owner of a talking horse which would talk to no one but him.

Alan Young learned the radio craft in Canada and broke into American Radio after being fired from his first Canadian show Stag Party after asking for pay higher than the $15 per week he was earning. After working on a summer show for Eddie Cantor, Young earned his own show, The Alan Young Show, combining situation comedy and hilarious gags. He ventured into TV with television version The Alan Young Show which won him an Emmy in 1951.
Then along came a talking horse. Mister Ed premiered in 1961. George Burns, producer of the show, was behind the decision to cast Young. Said George, &quot;Alan was the type of man that a horse would want to talk to.&quot;</description>

Throughout the 1950s, Rod Serling had established himself as one of the hottest names in television, equally famous for his success in writing televised drama as he was for criticizing the medium's limitations. His most vocal complaints concerned the censorship frequently practiced by sponsors and networks. &quot;I was not permitted to have my Senators discuss any current or pressing problem,&quot; he said of his 1957 production &quot;The Arena&quot;, intended to be an involving look into contemporary politics. &quot;To talk of tariff was to align oneself with the Republicans; to talk of labor was to suggest control by the Democrats. To say a single thing germane to the current political scene was absolutely prohibited... In retrospect, I probably would have had a much more adult play had I made it science fiction, put it in the year 2057, and peopled the Senate with robots. That would probably have been more reasonable and no less dramatically incisive.&quot;</description>

 Lisa Laco, Host: Well we're going to talk about Charles Dickens right now because Charles Dickens is ever foremost in our minds this week as we get ready to read Charles Dickens'  A Christmas Carol this weekend here in Thunder Bay. When he was about ten years old poverty forced him to take a job in a factory to provide for his family. Now he was so ashamed of his time there that he never told anyone about it, but he couldn't hide the secret totally. According to Philip the experience surfaces in the actions and the attitudes of many of Charles Dickens, especially in Ebenezer Scrooge from  A Christmas Carol . Philip Allingham is a professor in the Faculty of Education at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay; he's also a Dickens scholar. CBC reporter Cathy Alex asked him what inspired Charles Dickens to write  A Christmas Carol .

Philip V. Allingham, Faculty of Education, Lakehead University, Dickens Scholar: He was fascinated by German ghost stories; in fact, he had written himself one in the middle of Pickwick Papers in 1836. In the fall of 1843 he was invited to go to Manchester, where he saw a good deal of urban poor, prostitution, other social ills. He and a number of other Victorian reformers including Cobden and Disraeli were to speak and so he heard all the tales of horror in industrial society. He saw a great deal of it; he stayed with his sister whom he loved very much--remember Scrooge's relationship with his sister. And his sister had a little boy who was lame; he probably had what we call now Pot's disease, tuberculosis of the bone, if you can imagine. So there is Tiny Tim, who was originally by the way called &quot;Tiny Fred&quot; after Dickens' younger brother, but &quot;Tiny Fred&quot; doesn't really make it does it. So in proof he corrected that to &quot;Tiny Tim.&quot; He also put in the famous &quot;God bless us, everyone!&quot;--it wasn't in the original manuscript. And I think he was also interested in trying to help the ragged schools that were trying to educate poor children at night. These children worked in factories during the daytime. And so all of these things were fermenting in his mind and, like a great Coleridgian dream, A Christmas Carol was born.</description>

Born in New York City, the Marx Brothers were the sons of Jewish immigrants from different parts of Germany. (Plattdeutsch was the boys' first language.) Their mother, Minnie Sch&#246;nberg, originally hailed from Dornum in East Frisia, Germany, and their father Simon &quot;Frenchie&quot; Marrix (whose name was anglicized to Sam Marx) from Alsace, now a part of France.

The story met with instant success, selling six thousand copies within a week. Originally written as a potboiler to enable Dickens to pay off a debt, the tale has become one of the most popular and enduring Christmas stories of all time.

In fact, contemporaries of the time noted that the popularity of the story played a critical role in redefining the importance of Christmas and the major sentiments associated with the holiday.

The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad is an animated feature produced by Walt Disney Studios and released to theaters on October 5, 1949 by RKO Radio Pictures. It is the eleventh animated feature in the Disney animated features canon. This film was the final of Disney's 1940s &quot;package films&quot; (feature films comprised of two or more short subjects instead of a single feature-length story). Beginning with the next animated feature release, Cinderella, his studio would return to the feature-length stories that low income and World War II had caused a drought of during the 1940s.</description>

Crosby's biggest musical hit was his recording of Irving Berlin's &quot;White Christmas&quot; which he introduced through a 1941 Christmas-season radio broadcast and the movie Holiday Inn. Bing's recording hit the charts on 3 October 1942, and rose to #1 on 31 October, where it stayed for 11 weeks. In the following years Bing's recording hit the top-30 pop charts another 16 times, even topping the charts again in 1945 and January of '47. The song remains Bing's best-selling recording, and the best-selling single and best selling song of all time . In 1998 after a long absence, his 1947 version hit the charts in Britain, and as of 2006 remains the North American holiday-season standard. According to Guinness World Records, Bing Crosby's White Christmas has &quot;sold over 100 million copies around the world, with at least 50 million sales as singles.&quot;</description>

Lux Radio Theater, one of the genuine classic radio anthology series (NBC Blue Network (1934-1935); CBS (1935-1955), adapted first Broadway stage works, and then (especially) films to hour-long live radio presentations. It quickly became the most popular dramatic anthology series on radio, running more than twenty years. The program always began with an announcer proclaiming, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, Lux presents Hollywood!&quot; Cecil B. DeMille was the host of the series each Monday evening from June 1, 1936, until January 22, 1945. On one occasion, however, he was replaced by Leslie Howard.

Lux Radio Theater strove to feature as many of the original stars of the original stage and film productions as possible, usually paying them $5,000 an appearance to do the show. It was when sponsor Lever Brothers (who made Lux soap and detergent) moved the show from New York to Hollywood in 1936 that it eased back from adapting stage shows and toward adaptations of films. The first Lux film adaptation was The Legionnaire and the Lady, with Marlene Dietrich and Clark Gable, based on the film Morocco. That was followed by a Lux adaptation of The Thin Man, featuring the movie's stars, Myrna Loy and William Powell.

Many of the greatest names in film appeared in the series, most in the roles they made famous on the screen, including Abbott and Costello, Lauren Bacall, Lucille Ball, Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, Charles Boyer, Claudette Colbert, Gary Cooper, Joseph Cotton, Bing Crosby, Dan Duryea, Ava Gardner, Cary Grant, Bob Hope, Vivien Leigh, Agnes Moorehead, Vincent Price, Donna Reed, Frank Sinatra, Ann Sothern, Barbara Stanwyck, James Stewart, Gene Tierney, John Wayne, Jane Wyman, Orson Welles and Loretta Young.

Harry Lillis &quot;Bing&quot; Crosby (May 3, 1903 &#8211; October 14, 1977) was an American singer and actor whose career lasted from 1926 until his death in 1977.

Arguably the first true multi-media star, Bing Crosby's influence on popular culture and popular music is enormous -- from 1934 to 1954 he held a nearly unrivaled command of record sales, radio ratings and motion picture grosses. He is usually considered to be a member of popular music's &quot;holy trinity&quot; of ultra-icons, alongside Elvis Presley and The Beatles1, and is currently the most electronically recorded human voice in history (Schwartz, 1995) [1]

Crosby is also credited as being the major inspiration for most of the male singers that followed him, including the likes of Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and Dean Martin. Tony Bennett summed up Crosby's impact, stating, &quot;Bing created a culture. He contributed more to popular music than any other person - he moulded popular music. Every singer in the business has taken something from Crosby. Every male singer has a Bing Crosby idiosyncrasy.&quot; 1</description>

A Date with Judy was an American radio program during the 1940s. It was a teenage comedy that began as a summer replacement for Bob Hope's show, sponsored by Pepsodent and airing on NBC from June 24 to September 16, 1941, with 14-year-old Ann Gillis in the title role. Dellie Ellis portrayed Judy when the series returned the next summer (June 23&#8211;September 15, 1942). Louise Erickson took over the role the following summer (June 30&#8211;September 22, 1943) when the series, sponsored by Bristol Myers, replaced The Eddie Cantor Show.

Louise Erickson continued as Judy for the next seven years, as the series, sponsored by Tums, aired from January 18, 1944 to January 4, 1949. As the popularity of the radio series peaked, Jane Powell starred as Judy in the MGM movie, A Date with Judy (1948). Co-starring with Powell were Elizabeth Taylor, Wallace Beery, Robert Stack, and Carmen Miranda.

Ford Motors and Revere Cameras were the sponsors for the final season of the radio series on ABC from October 13, 1949 to May 25, 1950.

A Date with Judy was also a comic book (based on the radio program) published by National Periodical Publications from October-November 1947 to October-November 1960.</description>

The Great Gildersleeve (1941-1957) was arguably the first spin-off program, as well as one of the first true situation comedies (as opposed to sketch programs) in broadcast history. Built around a character who had been a staple on the classic radio sit-com, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest success in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off, and later in a quartet of feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.

On Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve was a pompous windbag who became a consistent McGee nemesis (&quot;You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catch phrase). But he also became a popular enough windbag that Kraft Foods &#8212; looking primarily to promote its Parkay margarine spread &#8212; sponsored a new series with Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (the character was given several conflicting first names on Fibber McGee and Molly) as the central, slightly softened, and slightly befuddled focus of a lively new family.

Premiering on NBC on August 31, 1941, The Great Gildersleeve moved the title character from the McGee's Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve now oversaw his late sister's estate and took on the rearing of his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle and followed by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) and Leroy (Walter Tetley) Forester. In a striking forerunner to such later television hits as Bachelor Father and Family Affair, both of which are centered on well-to-do uncles taking in their deceased siblings' children, Gildersleeve was a bachelor raising two children while, at first, administering a girdle manufacturing company (&quot;If you want a better corset, of course it's a Gildersleeve&quot;) and then for the bulk of the show's run, serving as Summerfield's water commissioner, between time with the ladies and nights with the boys. Indeed, The Great Gildersleeve may have been the first broadcast show to be centered on a single parent balancing child-rearing, work, and a social life, done with taste and genuine wit, often at the expense of Gildersleeve's now slightly understated pomposity

      <title>Radio America's - The Great Gildersleeve - Thanksgiving Story</title>
      <description>By 1852, Hale's campaign succeeded in uniting 29 states in marking the last Thursday of November as &quot;Thanksgiving Day.&quot;

Finally, after a 40-year campaign of writing editorials and letters to governors and presidents, Hale's passion became a reality. On September 28, 1863, Sarah Josepha Hale wrote a letter to President Lincoln and urged him to have the &quot;day of our annual Thanksgiving made a National and fixed Union Festival.&quot; On October 3, 1863, President Lincoln proclaimed the last Thursday in November as a national day &quot;of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father.&quot; Here is the text of Lincoln's proclamation:

    By the President of the United States of America.

    A Proclamation.

    The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence, have not arrested the plough, the shuttle or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consiousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom. No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity and Union.8

Lincoln issued a similar proclamation in 1864. U.S. presidents maintained the holiday on the last Thursday of November for 75 years (with the exception of Andrew Johnson designating the first Thursday in December as Thanksgiving Day 1865 and Ulysses Grant choosing the third Thursday for Thanksgiving Day 1869).

In 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declare the next-to-last Thursday of the month (November 23rd) to be Thanksgiving Day. This break with tradition was prompted by requests from the National Retail Dry Goods Association. Since 1939 had five Thursdays in November, this would create a longer Christmas shopping season. While governors usually followed the president's lead with state proclamations for the same day, on this year, twenty-three states observed Thanksgiving Day on November 23rd, the &quot;Democratic&quot; Thanksgiving. Twenty-three states celebrated on November 30th, Lincoln's &quot;Republican&quot; Thanksgiving. Texas and Colorado declared both Thursdays to be holidays.
After two years of public outcry and confusion, Congress introduced the legislation to ensure that future presidential proclamations could not impact the scheduling of the holiday.. They established Thanksgiving Day as the fourth Thursday in November. The legislation took effect in 1942. Their plan to designate the fourth Thursday of the month allowed Thanksgiving Day to fall on the last Thursday five out of seven years.

The Great Gildersleeve (1941-1957) was arguably the first spin-off program, as well as one of the first true situation comedies (as opposed to sketch programs) in broadcast history. Built around a character who had been a staple on the classic radio sit-com, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest success in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off, and later in a quartet of feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.

On Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve was a pompous windbag who became a consistent McGee nemesis (&quot;You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catch phrase). But he also became a popular enough windbag that Kraft Foods &#8212; looking primarily to promote its Parkay margarine spread &#8212; sponsored a new series with Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (the character was given several conflicting first names on Fibber McGee and Molly) as the central, slightly softened, and slightly befuddled focus of a lively new family.

Premiering on NBC on August 31, 1941, The Great Gildersleeve moved the title character from the McGee's Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve now oversaw his late sister's estate and took on the rearing of his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle and followed by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) and Leroy (Walter Tetley) Forester. In a striking forerunner to such later television hits as Bachelor Father and Family Affair, both of which are centered on well-to-do uncles taking in their deceased siblings' children, Gildersleeve was a bachelor raising two children while, at first, administering a girdle manufacturing company (&quot;If you want a better corset, of course it's a Gildersleeve&quot;) and then for the bulk of the show's run, serving as Summerfield's water commissioner, between time with the ladies and nights with the boys. Indeed, The Great Gildersleeve may have been the first broadcast show to be centered on a single parent balancing child-rearing, work, and a social life, done with taste and genuine wit, often at the expense of Gildersleeve's now slightly understated pomposity

      <itunes:summary>By 1852, Hale's campaign succeeded in uniting 29 states in marking the last Thursday of November as &quot;Thanksgiving Day.&quot;

Finally, after a 40-year campaign of writing editorials and letters to governors and presidents, Hale's passion became a reality. On September 28, 1863, Sarah Josepha Hale wrote a letter to President Lincoln and urged him to have the &quot;day of our annual Thanksgiving made a National and fixed Union Festival.&quot; On October 3, 1863, President Lincoln proclaimed the last Thursday in November as a national day &quot;of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father.&quot; Here is the text of Lincoln's proclamation:

    By the President of the United States of America.

    A Proclamation.

    The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence, have not arrested the plough, the shuttle or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consiousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom. No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity and Union.8

Lincoln issued a similar proclamation in 1864. U.S. presidents maintained the holiday on the last Thursday of November for 75 years (with the exception of Andrew Johnson designating the first Thursday in December as Thanksgiving Day 1865 and Ulysses Grant choosing the third Thursday for Thanksgiving Day 1869).

George Burns, born Nathan Birnbaum (January 20, 1896 &#8211; March 9, 1996), was an American comedian and actor.

His career spanned vaudeville, film, radio, and television, with and without his equally legendary wife, Gracie Allen. His arched eyebrow and cigar smoke punctuation became familiar trademarks for over three quarters of a century. Enjoying a remarkable career resurrection that began at age 79, and ended shortly before his death at age 100, George Burns was better known in the last two decades of his life than at any other time in his life and career

Orvon Gene Autry (September 29, 1907 &#8211; October 2, 1998) was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television.

Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. in In Old Santa Fe as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial The Phantom Empire. Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film. He became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942.

He was the first of the singing cowboys, succeeded as the top star by Roy Rogers when Autry served as a flier with the Air Transport command during World War II. From 1940 to 1956, Autry also had a weekly radio show on CBS, Gene Autry's Melody Ranch. Another money-spinner was his Gene Autry Flying &quot;A&quot; Ranch Rodeo show which debuted in 1940.

He briefly returned to Republic after the war, to finish out his contract, which had been suspended for the duration of his military service and which he had tried to have declared void after his discharge. Thereafter, he formed his own production company to make westerns under his own control, which were distributed by Columbia Pictures, beginning in 1947. He also starred and produced his own television show on CBS beginning in 1950. He retired from show business in 1964, having made almost a hundred films up to 1955 and over 600 records. He was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1969 and to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

The Great Gildersleeve (1941-1957) was arguably the first spin-off program, as well as one of the first true situation comedies (as opposed to sketch programs) in broadcast history. Built around a character who had been a staple on the classic radio sit-com, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest success in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off, and later in a quartet of feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.

On Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve was a pompous windbag who became a consistent McGee nemesis (&quot;You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catch phrase). But he also became a popular enough windbag that Kraft Foods &#8212; looking primarily to promote its Parkay margarine spread &#8212; sponsored a new series with Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (the character was given several conflicting first names on Fibber McGee and Molly) as the central, slightly softened, and slightly befuddled focus of a lively new family.

Premiering on NBC on August 31, 1941, The Great Gildersleeve moved the title character from the McGee's Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve now oversaw his late sister's estate and took on the rearing of his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle and followed by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) and Leroy (Walter Tetley) Forester. In a striking forerunner to such later television hits as Bachelor Father and Family Affair, both of which are centered on well-to-do uncles taking in their deceased siblings' children, Gildersleeve was a bachelor raising two children while, at first, administering a girdle manufacturing company (&quot;If you want a better corset, of course it's a Gildersleeve&quot;) and then for the bulk of the show's run, serving as Summerfield's water commissioner, between time with the ladies and nights with the boys. Indeed, The Great Gildersleeve may have been the first broadcast show to be centered on a single parent balancing child-rearing, work, and a social life, done with taste and genuine wit, often at the expense of Gildersleeve's now slightly understated pomposity

Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off, and later in a quartet of feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.

On Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve was a pompous windbag who became a consistent McGee nemesis (&quot;You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catch phrase). But he also became a popular enough windbag that Kraft Foods &#8212; looking primarily to promote its Parkay margarine spread &#8212; sponsored a new series with Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (the character was given several conflicting first names on Fibber McGee and Molly) as the central, slightly softened, and slightly befuddled focus of a lively new family.

Premiering on NBC on August 31, 1941, The Great Gildersleeve moved the title character from the McGee's Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve now oversaw his late sister's estate and took on the rearing of his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle and followed by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) and Leroy (Walter Tetley) Forester. In a striking forerunner to such later television hits as Bachelor Father and Family Affair, both of which are centered on well-to-do uncles taking in their deceased siblings' children, Gildersleeve was a bachelor raising two children while, at first, administering a girdle manufacturing company (&quot;If you want a better corset, of course it's a Gildersleeve&quot;) and then for the bulk of the show's run, serving as Summerfield's water commissioner, between time with the ladies and nights with the boys. Indeed, The Great Gildersleeve may have been the first broadcast show to be centered on a single parent balancing child-rearing, work, and a social life, done with taste and genuine wit, often at the expense of Gildersleeve's now slightly understated pomposity

John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 &#8211; November 22, 1963), also referred to as John F. Kennedy, JFK, John Kennedy, or Jack Kennedy, was the 35th President of the United States. He served from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. His leadership during the ramming of his PT-109 during World War II led to being cited for bravery and heroism in the South Pacific. Kennedy represented Massachusetts during 1947&#8211;1960, as both a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate. He was elected President in 1960 in one of the closest elections in American history. He is the only Roman Catholic to be elected President of the United States as of 2006.

Major events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the building of the Berlin Wall, the Space Race, early events of the Vietnam War, and the American Civil Rights Movement.

John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Official investigations have repeatedly determined Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin, but critics allege that Oswald acted as part of a conspiracy or was not involved at all and was framed. Kennedy's assassination is considered to be a defining moment in U.S. history due to its traumatic impact on the nation as well as on the political history of the ensuing decades, his subsequent branding as an icon for a new generation of Americans and American aspirations, and for the mystery and conspiracy allegations which surround it.

The Great Gildersleeve (1941-1957) was arguably the first spin-off program, as well as one of the first true situation comedies (as opposed to sketch programs) in broadcast history. Built around a character who had been a staple on the classic radio sit-com, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest success in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off, and later in a quartet of feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.

On Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve was a pompous windbag who became a consistent McGee nemesis (&quot;You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catch phrase). But he also became a popular enough windbag that Kraft Foods &#8212; looking primarily to promote its Parkay margarine spread &#8212; sponsored a new series with Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (the character was given several conflicting first names on Fibber McGee and Molly) as the central, slightly softened, and slightly befuddled focus of a lively new family.

Premiering on NBC on August 31, 1941, The Great Gildersleeve moved the title character from the McGee's Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve now oversaw his late sister's estate and took on the rearing of his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle and followed by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) and Leroy (Walter Tetley) Forester. In a striking forerunner to such later television hits as Bachelor Father and Family Affair, both of which are centered on well-to-do uncles taking in their deceased siblings' children, Gildersleeve was a bachelor raising two children while, at first, administering a girdle manufacturing company (&quot;If you want a better corset, of course it's a Gildersleeve&quot;) and then for the bulk of the show's run, serving as Summerfield's water commissioner, between time with the ladies and nights with the boys. Indeed, The Great Gildersleeve may have been the first broadcast show to be centered on a single parent balancing child-rearing, work, and a social life, done with taste and genuine wit, often at the expense of Gildersleeve's now slightly understated pomposity

Richard Diamond, Private Detective was a detective drama which was on radio from 1949 to 1953 and on television from 1957 to 1960.


Dick Powell starred in the Richard Diamond, Private Detective radio series as a rather light-hearted detective who often ended the episodes singing to his girlfriend, Helen. It began on NBC April 24, 1949, picked up Rexall as a sponsor April 5, 1950, and continued until December 6, 1950. The shows were written by Blake Edwards.

With Camel as a sponsor, it moved to ABC from January 5, 1951, to June 29, 1951, with Rexall returning for a run from October 5, 1951, until June 27, 1952.

Substituting for Amos 'n' Andy, it aired Sunday evenings on CBS from May 31, 1953 until September 20, 1953.

Because Dick Powell was known for musical comedies prior to his appearance as Philip Marlowe in Raymond Chandler's Murder, My Sweet (1944) and because he was a detective who sang in Richard Diamond, Private Eye, some regard this radio series as an influence on the character of Philip E. Marlow (Michael Gambon) in Dennis Potter's Chandleresque The Singing Detective (1986).

Lux Radio Theater, one of the genuine classic radio anthology series (NBC Blue Network (1934-1935); CBS (1935-1955), adapted first Broadway stage works, and then (especially) films to hour-long live radio presentations. It quickly became the most popular dramatic anthology series on radio, running more than twenty years. The program always began with an announcer proclaiming, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, Lux presents Hollywood!&quot; Cecil B. DeMille was the host of the series each Monday evening from June 1, 1936, until January 22, 1945. On one occasion, however, he was replaced by Leslie Howard (actor).

Lux Radio Theater strove to feature as many of the original stars of the original stage and film productions as possible, usually paying them $5,000 an appearance to do the show. It was when sponsor Lever Brothers (who made Lux soap and detergent) moved the show from New York to Hollywood in 1936 that it eased back from adapting stage shows and toward adaptations of films. The first Lux film adaptation was The Legionnaire and the Lady, with Marlene Dietrich and Clark Gable, based on the film Morocco. That was followed by a Lux adaptation of The Thin Man, featuring the movie's stars, Myrna Loy and William Powell.

Many of the greatest names in film appeared in the series, most in the roles they made famous on the screen, including Abbott and Costello, Lauren Bacall, Lucille Ball, Humphrey Bogart, Charles Boyer, Claudette Colbert, Gary Cooper, Bing Crosby, Dan Duryea, Ava Gardner, Cary Grant, Bob Hope, Vivien Leigh, Agnes Moorehead, Vincent Price, Donna Reed, Frank Sinatra, Ann Sothern, Barbara Stanwyck, James Stewart, Gene Tierney, John Wayne, Jane Wyman, Orson Welles and Loretta Young.

Who made the most appearances in Lux Radio Theater productions? Among the men, Don Ameche---eventually a radio star in The Bickersons---topped the list with 18 Lux appearances, just ahead of Fred MacMurray's 17. Among the ladies, the honor went to Barbara Stanwyck with 15 Lux appearances (including and especially her re-creation of her hit film Sorry, Wrong Number---itself born of an earlier radio production, on CBS legend Suspense). Loretta Young's 14 appearances were the second most among the ladies.

The Great Gildersleeve (1941-1957) was arguably the first spin-off program, as well as one of the first true situation comedies (as opposed to sketch programs) in broadcast history. Built around a character who had been a staple on the classic radio sit-com, Fibber McGee and Molly, The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest success in the 1940s. Actor Harold Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off, and later in a quartet of feature films released at the height of the show's popularity.

On Fibber McGee and Molly, Peary's Gildersleeve was a pompous windbag who became a consistent McGee nemesis (&quot;You're a haa-aa-aa-aard man, McGee!&quot; became a Gildersleeve catch phrase). But he also became a popular enough windbag that Kraft Foods &#8212; looking primarily to promote its Parkay margarine spread &#8212; sponsored a new series with Peary's Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve (the character was given several conflicting first names on Fibber McGee and Molly) as the central, slightly softened, and slightly befuddled focus of a lively new family.

Premiering on NBC on August 31, 1941, The Great Gildersleeve moved the title character from the McGee's Wistful Vista to Summerfield, where Gildersleeve now oversaw his late sister's estate and took on the rearing of his orphaned niece and nephew, Marjorie (originally played by Lurene Tuttle and followed by Louise Erickson and Mary Lee Robb) and Leroy (Walter Tetley) Forester. In a striking forerunner to such later television hits as Bachelor Father and Family Affair, both of which are centered on well-to-do uncles taking in their deceased siblings' children, Gildersleeve was a bachelor raising two children while, at first, administering a girdle manufacturing company (&quot;If you want a better corset, of course it's a Gildersleeve&quot;) and then for the bulk of the show's run, serving as Summerfield's water commissioner, between time with the ladies and nights with the boys. Indeed, The Great Gildersleeve may have been the first broadcast show to be centered on a single parent balancing child-rearing, work, and a social life, done with taste and genuine wit, often at the expense of Gildersleeve's now slightly understated pomposity

      <title>Gene Autry- melody ranch</title>

An amateur talent with the guitar and voice led to his performing at local dances. After an encouraging chance encounter with Will Rogers, he began performing on local radio in 1928 as &quot;Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy&quot;.


He signed a recording deal with Columbia Records in 1931. He worked in Chicago, Illinois on the WLS (AM) radio show National Barn Dance for four years with his own show where he met singer/songwriter Smiley Burnette. In his early recording career Autry covered various genres, including a labor song, &quot;The Death of Mother Jones&quot; in 1931. But his first hit was in 1932 with That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine, a duet with fellow railroad man, Jimmy Long.

Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. in In Old Santa Fe as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial The Phantom Empire. Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film. He became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942.

He was the first of the singing cowboys, succeeded as the top star by Roy Rogers when Autry served as a flier with the Air Transport command during World War II. From 1940 to 1956, Autry also had a weekly radio show on CBS, Gene Autry's Melody Ranch. Another money-spinner was his Gene Autry Flying &quot;A&quot; Ranch Rodeo show which debuted in 1940.

He briefly returned to Republic after the war, to finish out his contract, which had been suspended for the duration of his military service and which he had tried to have declared void after his discharge. Thereafter, he formed his own production company to make westerns under his own control, which were distributed by Columbia Pictures, beginning in 1947. He also starred and produced his own television show on CBS beginning in 1950. He retired from show business in 1964, having made almost a hundred films up to 1955 and over 600 records. He was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1969 and to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

Post-retirement he invested widely in real estate, radio and television, including buying the copyrights from dying Republic Pictures for the films he had made for them.

      <title>Gracie and George Burns</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627510.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.radioamerica.biz'&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a

In the early 1930s, like many vaudeville stars of their era, Burns and Allen graduated to radio. Their show was modestly successful, though the ratings began to decline. The show was originally a continuation of their original &quot;flirtation act&quot; (as their vaudeville and short film routines had been). George realized that they were simply too old for that material, and changed the show's format into the situation comedy vehicle for which they are best remembered: a working show business couple negotiating ordinary problems caused by Gracie's &quot;illogical logic&quot;, usually with the help of neighbors Harry and Blanche Morton, and their announcer, Bill Goodwin (later replaced by Harry von Zell during the run of their television series). One of the show's running gags (both in radio and television) had George firing the announcer at least once every other episode.

      <title>The shadow- 1939-01-08 island of the devil</title>

The Shadow was long believed to have debuted on radio as a program in its own right September 26, 1937, on the Mutual Broadcasting System. But the character actually premiered in September 1931, on CBS, as part of the hour-long The Blue Coal Radio Revue (named for the show's sponsor), featuring Frank Readick &#8212; the &quot;Shadow&quot; announcer of Detective Stories &#8212; as the Shadow, and playing Sundays at 5:30 p.m. Eastern standard time. The stories also appeared on Thursday nights for a month, when Love Story Drama (another Street and Smith creation) took the Thursday night slot &#8212; but also featured occasional portrayals of the Shadow.

Blue Coal had a long relationship with the Shadow, moving the radio series to NBC in October 1932 with Readick playing the character on Wednesday nights now. Two years later, NBC ran the stories on Mondays and Wednesdays, both at 6:30 p.m., with LaCurto taking occasional turns as the title character. Three years later came the beginning of the half-hour drama radio buffs have remembered so well, with the then-unknown Orson Welles as the Shadow, the show moving to Mutual, and the famous catch phrase now in full play.

Welles did not speak that signature line &#8212; Readick did, using a water glass next to his mouth for the echo effect. But Welles did make a credible Shadow, two years before his notoriety as the mastermind of Mercury Theatre on the Air's production of War of the Worlds.

After Welles left the role for a career in the cinema, The Shadow was portrayed by such actors as Bill Johnstone, Bret Morrison (the longest tenure, with ten years in two separate runs), John Archer, and Steve Courtleigh as Lamont Cranston/The Shadow. The radio show also introduced female characters into the Shadow's realm, most notably Margot Lane (played by Agnes Moorehead among others) as Cranston's love interest and crime-solving partner (the character was eventually integrated into Gibson's pulp novels). In the 1994 movie, Margot's name was spelled &quot;Margo.&quot; However, early scripts of the radio show clearly show that the character's name was spelled &quot;Margot&quot;.

Once The Shadow joined Mutual as a half-hour series, it did not leave Sunday evenings radio until December 26, 1954. It outlasted the magazine that gave birth to it: The Shadow Magazine ended with the summer 1949 issue, although Gibson wrote three new &quot;official&quot; stories between 1963 and 1980. Gibson started off a short series of updated Shadow novels for Belmont with Return of the Shadow under his own name, followed by The Shadow Strikes, Beware Shadow, Cry Shadow, The Shadow's Revenge, Mark of The Shadow, Shadow Go Mad, Night of The Shadow, and Destination: Moon. The Shadow had mental powers in these books, to cloud men's minds so he effectively became invisible, to conquer pain, etc.</description>

The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, an American radio and television series, was once the longest-running, live-action situation comedy on American television, having aired on ABC from 1952 to 1966 after a ten-year run on radio. Starring former bandleader Ozzie Nelson and his vocalist wife, vocalist Harriet Hilliard (she dropped her maiden name after the couple ended their music career), the show's sober, gentle humor captured a large, sustaining audience, even if it never reached the top ten in the actual ratings and later critics tended to dismiss it as fostering a slightly unrealistic picture of post-World War II American family life.</description>

      <title>Orson Welles- War of the world</title>

Orson Welles' radio adaptation of H. G. Wells' classic novel The War of the Worlds was performed by Mercury Theatre on the Air as a Halloween special on October 30, 1938. The live broadcast reportedly frightened many listeners into believing that an actual Martian invasion was in progress.

Welles's adaptation is possibly the most successful radio dramatic production in history. It was one of the Radio Project's first studies.

It has been suggested in recent years that the War of the Worlds broadcast was actually a psychological warfare experiment. In the 1999 documentary, Masters of the Universe: The Secret Birth of the Federal Reserve, writer Daniel Hopsicker claims that the Rockefeller Foundation actually funded the broadcast, studied the ensuing panic, and compiled a report that was only available to a chosen few. A variation of this conspiracy theory has the Princeton Radio Project and the Rockefeller Foundation as co-conspirators. [2]. This seems at odds with the fact that the Mercury Theatre's broadcasts over CBS before December 1938 did not contain any sponsorship announcements, and the competing Chase &amp; Sanborn Hour on NBC originated from studios in Manhattan's Rockefeller Center complex.</description>

It is Thursday night, July 31,1930. The time is 9:40 PM. Radio listeners tuned to CBS hear the first appearance of &quot;The Shadow&quot; as James La Curto portrays the part in the Detective Story Hour. Street and Smith publishers sponsored this show (which lasted about a year), along with their magazine series The Shadow, A Detective Monthly.

In September 1931, The Blue Coal Radio Revue, starring Frank Readick, Jr. (who was the star in the later Detective Story Hour shows), continued the adventures of &quot;The Shadow&quot;. The show remained an hour long, but was heard on Sundays at 5:30 PM.

For a short time, lucky CBS listeners were able to hear The Shadow on both Thursdays and Sundays. In October, 1931, the 9:30 Thursday slots were taken by Love Story Drama or Love Story Hour (sponsored by Street and Smith), which also had portrayals of The Shadow!

The program shifted to Mutual on September 26, 1937, and was heard on Sundays at 5:30 PM. It maintained the same sponsor (Blue Coal), but had a new voice for Lamont Cranston, the young and relatively new theater and radio personality: Orson Welles. The 1937 programs also began to feature &quot;The Shadow&quot; as a character in the stories, rather than merely as a narrator. (Mr Welles was &quot;The Shadow&quot; through 1938, while the now syndicated program was sponsored by Goodrich.) Here is a log of The Shadow while Orson Welles played the part, as well as the famous  &quot;Weed of Crime&quot; ending  from 1938. [Experts state this voice is really that of Frank Readick rather than Orson Welles]

      <title>Dragnet  - A Double Header- The Big Donation 520612</title>

&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.badge714.com/images/DRAGHEAD.JPG&quot;&gt;


Dragnet debuted inauspiciously. The first several months were bumpy, as Webb and company worked out the program&#8217;s format and eventually became comfortable with their characters (Friday was originally portrayed as more brash and forceful than his later usually relaxed demeanor). Gradually, Friday&#8217;s deadpan, fast-talking persona emerged, described by John Dunning as &quot;a cop's cop, tough but not hard, conservative but caring.&quot; (Dunning, 210) Friday&#8217;s first partner was Sgt. Ben Romero, portrayed by Barton Yarborough, a longtime radio actor. When Dragnet hit its stride, it became one of radio&#8217;s top-rated shows.

Webb insisted on realism in every aspect of the show. The dialogue was clipped, understated and sparse, influenced by the hard boiled school of crime fiction. Scripts were fast moving but didn&#8217;t seem rushed. Every aspect of police work was chronicled, step by step: From patrols and paperwork, to crime scene investigation, lab work and questioning witnesses or suspects. The detectives&#8217; personal lives were mentioned, but rarely took center stage. (Friday was a bachelor who lived with his mother; Romero was an ever-fretful husband and father) &quot;Underplaying is still acting,&quot; Webb told Time. &quot;We try to make it as real as a guy pouring a cup of coffee.&#8221; (Dunning, 209) Los Angeles police chiefs C.B. Horrall and (later) William H. Parker were credited as consultants, and many police officers were fans.

Webb was a stickler for accurate details, and Dragnet used many authentic touches, such as the LAPD's actual radio call sign (KMA-367), and the names of many real department officials, such as Ray Pinker and Lee Jones of the crime lab or Chief of Detectives Thad Brown.

Episodes began with an announcer describing the basic premise of the show. &quot;Big Saint&quot; (April 26, 1951) for example, begins with, &quot;You're a Detective Sergeant, you're assigned to auto theft detail. A well organized ring of car thieves begins operations in your city. It's one of the most puzzling cases you've ever encountered. Your job: break it.&quot;

Friday offered voice-over narration throughout the episodes, noting the time, date and place of every scene as he and his partners went through their day investigating the crime. The events related in a given episode might occur in a few hours, or might span a few months. At least one episode unfolded in real time: in &quot;City Hall Bombing&quot; (July 21, 1949), Friday and Romero had less than 30 minutes to stop a man who was threatening to destroy the City Hall with a bomb.

At the end of the episode, the announcer would relate the fate of the suspect. They were usually convicted of a crime and sent to &quot;the State Penitentiary, San Quentin&quot; or a mental hospital, but other occasions the cases had ambiguous, unusual or even disappointing resolutions. Sometimes, criminals avoided justice or escaped, at least on the radio version of Dragnet. In 1950, Time quoted Webb: &quot;We don&#8217;t even try to prove that crime doesn&#8217;t pay ... sometimes it does&quot; (Dunning, 210)

Specialized terminology was mentioned in every episode, but was rarely explained. Webb trusted the audience to determine the meanings of words or terms by their context, and furthermore, Dragnet tried to avoid the kinds of awkward, lengthy exposition that people wouldn&#8217;t actually use in daily speech. Several specialized terms (such as &quot;A.P.B.&quot; for &quot;All Points Bulletin&quot; and &quot;M.O.&quot; for &quot;Modus Operandi&quot;) were rarely used in popular culture before Dragnet introduced them to everyday America.

While most radio shows used one or two sound effects experts, Dragnet needed five; a script clocking in at just under 30 minutes could require up to 300 separate effects. Accuracy was underlined: The exact number of footsteps from one room to another at Los Angeles police headquarters were imitated, and when a telephone rang at Friday&#8217;s desk, the listener heard the same ring as the telephones in Los Angeles police headquarters. A single minute of &quot;A Gun For Christmas&quot; is a representative example of the evocative sound effects featured on &quot;Dragnet&quot;. While Friday and others investigate bloodstains in a suburban backyard, the listener hears a series of overlapping effects: a squeaking gate hinge, footsteps, a technician scraping blood into a paper envelope, the glassy chime of chemical vials, bird calls and a dog barking in the distance.

Scripts tackled a number of topics, ranging from the thrilling (murders, missing persons and armed robbery) to the mundane (check fraud and shoplifting), yet &quot;Dragnet&quot; made them all interesting due to fast-moving plots and behind-the-scenes realism. In &quot;The Garbage Chute&quot; (15 December 1949), they even had a locked room mystery.
Spoiler warning:

Dragnet debuted inauspiciously. The first several months were bumpy, as Webb and company worked out the program&#8217;s format and eventually became comfortable with their characters (Friday was originally portrayed as more brash and forceful than his later usually relaxed demeanor). Gradually, Friday&#8217;s deadpan, fast-talking persona emerged, described by John Dunning as &quot;a cop's cop, tough but not hard, conservative but caring.&quot; (Dunning, 210) Friday&#8217;s first partner was Sgt. Ben Romero, portrayed by Barton Yarborough, a longtime radio actor. When Dragnet hit its stride, it became one of radio&#8217;s top-rated shows.

Webb insisted on realism in every aspect of the show. The dialogue was clipped, understated and sparse, influenced by the hard boiled school of crime fiction. Scripts were fast moving but didn&#8217;t seem rushed. Every aspect of police work was chronicled, step by step: From patrols and paperwork, to crime scene investigation, lab work and questioning witnesses or suspects. The detectives&#8217; personal lives were mentioned, but rarely took center stage. (Friday was a bachelor who lived with his mother; Romero was an ever-fretful husband and father) &quot;Underplaying is still acting,&quot; Webb told Time. &quot;We try to make it as real as a guy pouring a cup of coffee.&#8221; (Dunning, 209) Los Angeles police chiefs C.B.

      <title>green hornet</title>

The Green Hornet was an American radio program that ran on WXYZ (Detroit), the Mutual Network and the ABC Blue Network from January 31, 1936 to December 5, 1952. Created by WXYZ's George W. Trendle and Fran Striker, who also created The Lone Ranger, the juvenile adventure series initially starred Al Hodge in the title role, followed by Donovan Faust (1943), Bob Hall (1944-51) and Jack McCarthy (1951-52). The radio show used Rimsky-Korsakov's &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; as its theme song, blended with a hornet buzz created on a theremin.

The series detailed the adventures of Britt Reid, debonair newspaper publisher by day, crime-fighting masked hero at night, along with his trusty sidekick, Kato, a Filipino of Japanese ancestry. With the outbreak of World War II his Japanese heritage was almost completely dropped, leading to the common misperception that the character's nationality had been switched by the show's writers. (When the characters were used in a pair of movie serials Kato's nationality was inexplicably given as Korean.) Reid is a close relative of The Lone Ranger. The character of Dan Reid, who appeared on the Lone Ranger program as the Masked Man's nephew, was also featured on the Green Hornet as Britt's father. The Lone Ranger's name is often incorrectly stated to have been John Reid, an error first made in a volume called The Big Broadcast in the 1970s. In fact, however, writers for WXYZ never provided a first name for the character.

In the original introduction of the radio show announcer Mike Wallace proclaimed that the Green Hornet went after criminals that &quot;even the G-Men (FBI agents) couldn't reach&quot;. The show's producers were called by FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover who prompted them to remove the line implying that some crime fighting was beyond the abilities of the FBI. During World War II, the radio show's title was used as a codename for SIGSALY, secret encryption equipment used in the war.</description>

This page of the Vintage Audio section of the website contains archive recordings of songs, skits and speeches from the final year of the war, 1918.

This year saw each of the Central Powers capitulate to the Allies, with resultant revolutions in Germany and Austria-Hungary.  Meanwhile U.S. President Woodrow Wilson continued to press the case for a post-war League of Nations - a proposal ultimately vetoed by Congress.

Written in 1918 by Ernest R Ball (music) and K. Keirn Brennan (lyrics), You Can't Beat Us (If It Takes Ten Million More) comprised a straightforward American patriotic song.

Abbott: Well, Costello, I'm going to New York with you. Bucky Harris the Yankee's manager gave me a job as coach for as long as you're on the team.

Costello: Look Abbott, if you're the coach, you must know all the players.

Abbott: I certainly do.

Costello: Well you know I've never met the guys. So you'll have to tell me their names, and then I'll know who's playing on the team.

Abbott: Oh, I'll tell you their names, but you know it seems to me they give these ball players now-a-days very peculiar names.

Costello: You mean funny names?

Abbott: Strange names, pet names...like Dizzy Dean...

Costello: His brother Daffy

Abbott: Daffy Dean...

Costello: And their French cousin.</description>

Biography:  Penny Singleton was born Mariana Dorothy Agnes Letitia McNulty (Wow!  What a name!).  Her father was an Irish Philadelphia newspaperman named Benny McNulty.  On a side note, Benny McNulty was related to Jim Farley, Franklin Roosevelt's campaign manager and later Postmaster General.

As a child, Mariana (who went by first name Dorothy), sang songs at a silent movie theatre.  After the sixth grade she joined a touring vaudeville act called &quot;The Kiddie Kabaret&quot;.  She married a dentist named Lawrence Scogga Singleton in 1937 and took his last name.  Dorothy changed her first name to Penny because she saved large amounts of penny coins.  Thus, &quot;Penny Singleton&quot; was born, in a manner of speaking.  Before she became credited in films as Penny Singleton, she was listed in the credits as Dorothy McNulty.  A really great Dorothy McNulty appearance to see is &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; from 1936 where she plays a tough nightclub dancer.  She sings and dances in this film, which is also a treat.  In this film, she is not the wholesome American housewife figure we came to expect in the &quot;Blondie&quot; films.  In the second of the Thin Man movies, her character is quite a trampy bimbo.  Also in this film, and in others before she became Blondie, Penny Singleton is a brunette.  Penny was born a brunette, and bleached her hair blonde specifically for the Blondie role.  She kept that hair color for most of the rest of her life.

Dorothy (Penny) also acted/sang/danced in the 1938 movie Humphrey Bogart regarded as his worst ever, &quot;Swing Your Lady&quot;.  But later that year, she was cast as Blondie alongside Arthur Lake as Dagwood and movie history was made.  This is still the longest-running film series in terms of number of films made in a period of time; 28 Blondie films were made in 12 years.  Penny Singleton later divorced Dr. Lawrence Singleton in 1939, but kept his name for the rest of her life.  Together they had one daughter.  She married Robert Sparks in 1941 and remained married to him until his death on July 22, 1963.  They had one child together, too.  Penny never remarried again.

Playing a popular comic strip character for 12 years tends to get a girl typecast, so after the film series ended in 1950 film work slowed down for Penny.  She did continue stage acting, but her next REALLY popular role came with the TV cartoon series &quot;The Jetsons&quot; in which she was the voice of Jane Jetson.  Penny did a lot of things outside of the movies, and was quite a humanitarian.  In 1966, Penny led the first strike of the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes and gained improved working conditions.  In 1969, she was elected president of AGVA (American Guild of Variety Artists).  In 1974, she received an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from St. John's University.  All this, plus she was the first woman president of an AFL-CIO union.  As you can tell, Penny kept herself plenty busy after Blondie...probably even more so than when she was making those films.

On a final note, I started the Blondie movies' internet prescence in 2000.  I've been fortunate to have received e-mails from some of Penny Singleton's relatives.  One thing I always wanted to know is if she knew there was a website devoted to her or what she thought of it.  I was hoping to meet with her or talk with her someday.  Of course, that can never happen.  On November 12, 2003, Penny Singleton died due to complications of a stroke.  She was 95 years old.  If anyone out there knows where I can send a fan letter to her surviving family I'd be most grateful.  Thank you and I hope you've enjoyed reading this biography of one of the movies' greatest leading ladies!

Penny Singleton quotes:

&quot;God bless Chic Young!&quot;  Penny said this referring to the creator of the Blondie comic strip.  His creation led to her success in films.

      <title>Crime Classic- 530629 The Sudden Death of James Fisk</title>

Crime Classics was a U. S. radio docudrama which aired over CBS from June 15, 1953, to June 30, 1954.

Created, produced, and directed by radio actor/director Elliott Lewis, the program was a historical true crime series, examining crimes and murders from the past. It grew out of Lewis' personal interest in famous murder cases and took a documentary-like approach to the subject, carefully recreating the facts, personages and feel of the time period. Comparatively little dramatic license was taken with the facts and events, but the tragedy was leavened with humor, expressed largely through the narration.

The crimes dramatized generally covered a broad time and place frame from ancient Greece to late 19th-century America. Each episode in the series was co-written by Morton Fine and David Friedkin, in consultation with Lewis, although the scripting process was more a matter of research, as the stories were &quot;adapted from the original court reports and newspaper accounts&quot; or from the works of historians.

The cases ranged from famous assassinations (of Abraham Lincoln and Julius Caesar) and the lives (and often deaths) of the likes of Cesare Borgia and Blackbeard to more obscure cases, such as Bathsheba Spooner, who killed her husband Joshua Spooner in 1778 and became the first woman tried and executed in America.

The only continuing character was the host/narrator, Thomas Hyland, played by Lou Merrill. Hyland was introduced by the announcer as a &quot;connoisseur of crime, student of violence, and teller of murders.&quot; Merrill's deadpan portrayal of Hyland provided the welcome note of tongue-in-cheek humor to the proceedings. Unlike the ghoulish weird storytellers of The Whistler and The Mysterious Traveler, Hyland was an ordinary fellow who, in a dry, droll manner, would present a tale from his files, his wry comments interspersed between dramatized scenes. The episodes would typically begin with Hyland inviting the audience to listen to a sound, from drops of rain to horses hooves, and then introducing the main players and events of his report. The titles also contributed to the series' light tone, as they were intentionally pompous and usually laced with irony. Typical titles included &quot;Your Loving Son, Nero,&quot; &quot;If a Body Needs a Body, Just Call Burke and Hare,&quot; and &quot;The Axe and the Droot Family... How They Fared.&quot;

Aliens in the Mind

This six-part BBC radio drama stars none other than Peter Cushing and Vincent Prince, who between them became two of the most famous horror film stars of the 1950s and 1960s.

Aliens in the Mind is based on a story by the then-foremost Doctor Who script editor Robert Holmes. It centres around the discovery, on a remote Scottish island, of a community of 'human mutants' capable of telepathy. A plan is in place to use them to control the British Government, and friends Curtis Lark (Vincent Price) and Hugh Baxter (Peter Cushing) join forces to combat them.

Box 13
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search

Box 13 was a syndicated radio series about the escapades of newspaperman-turned-mystery novelist Dan Holliday, played by film star Alan Ladd. Created by Ladd's company, Mayfair Productions, Box 13 premiered August 22, 1948, on Mutual's New York flagship, WOR, and aired in syndication on the East Coast from August 22, 1948, to August 14. 1949. On the West Coast, Box 13 was heard from March 15, 1948 to March 7, 1949.

To seek out new ideas for his fiction, Holliday ran a classified ad in the Star-Times newspaper where he formerly worked. &quot;Adventure wanted, will go anywhere, do anything -- Box 13.&quot; The stories followed Holliday's adventures when he responded to the letters sent to him by such people as a psycho killer and various victims.

Sylvia Picker appeared as Holliday's scatterbrained secretary, Suzy, while Edmund MacDonald played police Lt. Kling. Supporting cast members included Betty Lou Gerson, Frank Lovejoy, Lurene Tuttle, Alan Reed, Luis Van Rooten and John Beal. Vern Carstensen, who directed Box 13 for producer Richard Sanville, was also the show's announcer.

Among the 52 episodes in the series were such mystery adventures as &quot;The Sad Night,&quot; &quot;Hot Box,&quot; &quot;Last Will And Nursery Rhyme,&quot; &quot;Hare And Hounds,&quot; &quot;Hunt And Peck,&quot; &quot;Death Is A Doll,&quot; &quot;Tempest In a Casserole&quot; and &quot;Mexican Maze.&quot; The dramas featured music by Rudy Schrager. Russell Hughes, who had previously hired Ladd as a radio actor in 1935 at a $19 weekly salary, wrote the scripts, sometimes in collaboration with Ladd. The partners in Mayfair Productions were Ladd and Bernie Joslin, who had previously run the chain of Mayfair Restaurants.,</description>

A terrifying 50-foot-tall ape, King Kong is one of the most famous monsters in movie history. He first starred in the 1933 film King Kong; the movie's climax, with Kong carrying actress Fay Wray to the top of the Empire State Building, is a famous Hollywood moment. (Kong was created for that film by special effects pioneer Willis O'Brien.) King Kong later starred in several remakes and in the 1963 Japanese classic King Kong vs. Godzilla. Kong returned in late 2005 in a brand-new film directed by Oscar-winner Peter Jackson and starring Naomi Watts in the Fay Wray rol</description>

This wartime propaganda show, made at the same time as Hello Americans, was sponsored by Lockheed and Vega, and used the theme of planes and aviation to expound upon America's war efforts and its continuing climb to greatness. While blatant propaganda, the show is usually quite entertaining, often using humor to make its point. Plus, where else can you hear Welles playing Satan, as in a guest episode? Like Hello Americans, CU used vignettes and sketches to gets its message across, and Mercury actors such as Agnes Moorehead, Joseph Cotten, Ray Collins, and Everett Sloane appear. During Welles' period on the show, programs lasted only 15 minutes. After Welles left, Cotten later took over as host, and the show expanded to half an hour in length. The show was broadcast on CBS, as was Hello Americans.

      <title>The golden Age of Radio music 1920- Good news Radio by nbc</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627535.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.radioamerica.biz'&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a

The Golden Age of Hollywood began in the late 1920's with the rise of the great studios such as the vertically-integrated Big 5 of Fox, Paramount, Warner, MGM, RKO, and the Little 3 of United Artists, Universal, Columbia. These studios were dominated by powerful moguls and celebrity stars of the Aquarian Age, developed the standardized production of 52 films per year following the rules of the Classic Narrative Style, adopted the technology of the sound revolution, and artificial lighting, imposed an exhibition system of block booking on theaters led by the great movie palaces. Studios responded to social change by creating new genres such as the gangster film in the first Golden Age of the early Depression Era and the G-Man film in the Conservative Era of the later depression, a second Golden Era. The Golden Age ended in the late 1940s with the postwar crisis of studio breakup, declining attendance, the challenges by sports stadiums, shopping centers and television and radio.


The Golden Age of Television is a reference to the period from approximately 1949 to 1960 when American prime time television drama was predominated by original and classic productions from such writers as Paddy Chayefsky, Reginald Rose and Rod Serling. The age really defines the time in which television and radio were both in their golden ages. Most of these programs were produced as installments of live dramatic anthologies such as The Philco Television Playhouse, Kraft Television Theatre and Playhouse 90, though in the mid-to-late fifties the genre spread to include filmed series such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone.

Many of the best early programs of this era were not original programming, but evolved from successful radio shows that with the transition to television brought with them already polished concepts, casts and writing staffs. This is a major reason why quality was so consistently high during this period. Even an original show like I Love Lucy drew heavily from radio as many of those scripts were rewrites from Lucille Ball's late 40's radio show My Favorite Husband. Shows like Our Miss Brooks, The Burns and Allen Show and Jack Benny ran concurrently on both radio and TV until television reception reached beyond the major metropolitan areas in the mid fifties. By 1960, about 80% of American households had a television set. At that point sitcoms and dramas dropped out of radio and became wholly the domain of television.

British televison had a head start on American TV thanks to the 1920's efforts of John Logie Baird, Scottish inventor of a mechanical television format that the BBC used to broadcast regular programming from 1929-1936. Still, the golden age of British TV enjoyed its peak around the same time as in the United States ranging from approximately 1949 to 1955. Writers such as Nigel Kneale and producers like Rudolph Cartier produced classic programming such as The Quatermass Experiment and Mystery Story (of which sadly no recording exists). Other notable programs include serials by the producer Francis Durbridge and classic children's programs such as Muffin the Mule and Andy Pandy.

      <title>Lone Ranger - Snake in the grass -55-01-03</title>

This was the longest running children's show on radio from 1933 to 1956. Sponsor of the following shows was General Mills (Cheerios, Wheaties and Kix cereals) although few of the shows actually contain the commercials.


onto greets the Lone Ranger with the expression &quot;kemosabe&quot;, which has also been written &quot;Kemo Sabe&quot; or &quot;Kemo Sabhay&quot;. The origin of this expression is somewhat unclear, but James Jewell, an early director of the radio series, said the name comes from a boy's camp located on Mullett Lake, Michigan that his father-in-law had run from 1911 to 1941. The translation was said to mean &quot;trusty scout&quot;. Fran Striker, the writer of the Lone Ranger scripts, said the actual expression was Ta-i ke-mo sah-bee, which he said meant &quot;greetings trusty scout&quot;. In the pilot of the Clayton Moore TV series, &quot;Enter the Lone Ranger&quot;, Tonto explicitly states that &quot;Kemosabe&quot; means &quot;trusty scout&quot;. There has been a discussion about the origins of the word in The Straight Dope suggesting the word may be of either Ojibwe or Potawatomi origin. Link to straight dope.com

However, the phrase &quot;faithful friend&quot; has also been associated with the term Kemo Sabe. One such instance was in the 20th anniversary broadcast of the radio show, which recapped the Ranger's origin. In the scene where the wounded Ranger awakens and recognizes Tonto, he says, &quot;years ago, you called me Kemo Sabe&quot;. Tonto replies, &quot;That right, and you still Kemo Sabe. It mean, 'faithful friend'&quot;.

Various investigators have found other sources for this saying, some of them humorous and usually centering around the idea that &quot;Kemo Sabe&quot; is actually an insult or vulgarity. For instance, a Far Side comic strip has the long-since retired Lone Ranger discovering (in an Indian dictionary) that &quot;Kemo Sabe&quot; is an Apache expression for a &quot;horse's rear end&quot;.</description>

 The next woman shamus, chronologically, is Carolyn Day, Detective and I'm guessing her origin to be about 1940. Whether or not she actually reached the airwaves is yet to be determined, but there are four episodes in circulation, each five minutes in length. Their brevity would suggest they are audition shows, but I can't prove that either. Carolyn Day is both the star and narrator of each program. She and her father, Randolph Day, are detectives and her boyfriend is Larry Bixby, a homicide lieutenant of an unnamed metropolitan city. There are no cast credits nor can I identify any of the actors by their voices.</description>

      <title>Death Valley Radio </title>

Death Valley Days was a long-running American radio and television anthology about true stories of the old American West, particularly the Death Valley area. It was created in 1930 by Ruth Woodman and ran on radio until 1945. It ran from 1952 to 1975 as a syndicated television show. The 558 television stories, which had different actors, were introduced by a host. The longest-running was &quot;The Old Ranger&quot; from 1952-1965, played by Stanley Andrews. The hosts following were future President of the United States Ronald Reagan (before he was elected governor of California), Robert Taylor, Dale Robertson and Merle Haggard. During his time as host, Reagan also frequently appeared in the program as an actor. It has been rerun under other names and with other hosts, since the hosting segment at the beginning and the end could be easily reshot with another performer with no effect on the story. Alternate hosts and titles have included Frontier Adventure (Dale Robertson), The Pioneers (Will Rogers, Jr.), Trails West (Ray Milland), Western Star Theatre (Rory Calhoun) and Call of the West (John Payne). The last title was also often applied to the series' memorable, haunting theme music.

Old commercials know how to solve all our problems. If the man you married didn't turn out to be the man you thought he was, get him some Arid Deodorant (it also safeguards friendships). Having trouble finding the perfect Christmas gift? &quot;Give Fatima, they're extra mild.&quot; Want a complexion like Joan Blondell? Buy Lux Facial Soap, and use it daily - it will make your skin softer, smoother.</description>

      <title>Fred Allen Guests Frank Sinatra, Leo Durocher</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627541.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred Allen - Comedian, Radio Personality
Born: May 31, 1894

Fred Allen, who comically feuded with Jack Benny on the air for years, invented an entirely new form of radio comedy which consisted of lampooning current events, making fun of his sponsors, and presenting skits that featured a cast of memorable recurring characters. Allen was born John Florence Sullivan on May 31st, 1894 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the son of a bookbinder and storyteller. He became interested in comedy after finding a book on its history in his father's shop, and he taught himself to juggle by reading a book on the subject by the age of eighteen he was appearing in vaudeville as a juggler and comedian. A successful engagement at the Palace in 1919 led to many Broadway shows, including The Passing Show of 1922, where he met his future wife and radio co-star, Portland Hoffa.


 He made the transition to radio with The Lint Bath Club Revue, which premiered October 23rd, 1932 on CBS and moved to NBC in 1933. Allen's perfectionism led him to move from sponsor to sponsor. His shows, for which he wrote much of the material himself, included The Salad Bowl Revue (1933), The Sal Hepatica Revue (1933-34), The Hour of Smiles (1934-35), and Town Hall Tonight (1935-40). The Fred Allen Show, his last series, ran from 1942 to 1949. His funniest and most popular regular sketch, &quot;Allen's Alley,&quot; premiered on Sunday, December 6th, 1942. It featured Allen strolling along, knocking on the doors of various characters, including average American John Doe (played by John Brown), pompous poet Falstaff Openshaw (Allan Reed), and boisterous southern senator Beuregard Claghorn (announcer Kenny Delmar).

      <title>Milton Berle - Prize Fighting 47-12-09</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627543.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.radioamerica.biz'&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;

In 1934-36, Berle was heard regularly on The Rudy Vallee Hour, and he got much publicity as a regular on The Gillette Original Community Sing, a Sunday night comedy-variety program broadcast on CBS from September 6, 1936 to August 29, 1937. In 1939, he was the host of Stop Me If You've Heard This One with panelists spontaneously finishing jokes sent in by listeners. Three Ring Time, a comedy-variety show sponsored by Ballantine Ale was followed by a 1943 program sponsored by Campbell's Soups. The audience participation show Let Yourself Go (1944-45) could best be described as slapstick radio with studio audience members acting out long suppressed urges (often directed at host Berle). Kiss and Make Up, on CBS in 1946, featured the problems of contestants decided by a jury from the studio audience with Berle as the Judge. He also made guest appearances on many comedy-variety radio programs during the 1930s and 1940s.

Scripted by Hal Block and Martin Ragaway, The Milton Berle Show brought Berle together with Arnold Stang, later a familiar face as Berle's TV sidekick. Others in the cast were Pert Kelton, Mary Schipp, Jack Albertson, Arthur Q. Bryan, Ed Begley, vocalist Dick Forney and announcer Frank Gallop. The Ray Bloch Orchestra provided the music for the series. Sponsored by Philip Morris, it aired on NBC from March 11, 1947, until April 13, 1948.

His last radio series was The Texaco Star Theater, which began September 22, 1948 on ABC and continued until June 15, 1949, with Berle heading the cast of Stang, Kelton and Gallop, along with Charles Irving, Kay Armen and double-talk specialist Al Kelly. It employed top comedy writers (Nat Hiken, brothers Danny and Neil Simon, Aaron Ruben), and Berle later recalled this series as &quot;the best radio show I ever did... a hell of a funny variety show.&quot; It served as a springboard for Berle's rise as television's first major star.</description>

In 1934-36, Berle was heard regularly on The Rudy Vallee Hour, and he got much publicity as a regular on The Gillette Original Community Sing, a Sunday night comedy-variety program broadcast on CBS from September 6, 1936 to August 29, 1937. In 1939, he was the host of Stop Me If You've Heard This One with panelists spontaneously finishing jokes sent in by listeners. Three Ring Time, a comedy-variety show sponsored by Ballantine Ale was followed by a 1943 program sponsored by Campbell's Soups. The audience participation show Let Yourself Go (1944-45) could best be described as slapstick radio with studio audience members acting out long suppressed urges (often directed at host Berle). Kiss and Make Up, on CBS in 1946, featured the problems of contestants decided by a jury from the studio audience with Berle as the Judge. He also made guest appearances on many comedy-variety radio programs during the 1930s and 1940s.

Scripted by Hal Block and Martin Ragaway, The Milton Berle Show brought Berle together with Arnold Stang, later a familiar face as Berle's TV sidekick. Others in the cast were Pert Kelton, Mary Schipp, Jack Albertson, Arthur Q. Bryan, Ed Begley, vocalist Dick Forney and announcer Frank Gallop. The Ray Bloch Orchestra provided the music for the series. Sponsored by Philip Morris, it aired on NBC from March 11, 1947, until April 13, 1948.

His last radio series was The Texaco Star Theater, which began September 22, 1948 on ABC and continued until June 15, 1949, with Berle heading the cast of Stang, Kelton and Gallop, along with Charles Irving, Kay Armen and double-talk specialist Al Kelly. It employed top comedy writers (Nat Hiken, brothers Danny and Neil Simon, Aaron Ruben), and Berle later recalled this series as &quot;the best radio show I ever did... a hell of a funny variety show.&quot; It served as a springboard for Berle's rise as television's first major star.</itunes:summary>

Academy Award winning documentary on the pivotal naval battle of the war in the Pacific. Filmed while the attack on Midway Island was underway, standout director John Ford was actually injured during filming.

The first 9 minutes of this documentary of the battle of Midway was devoted to the fighting by the US ground troops on Midway. This was actually a minor part of the battle, but provided great footage for the film. The overall effect was very stirring, especially the byplay between Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell. This must have been very comforting to the folks at home when shown in the theaters. I enjoyed it very much.</description>

      <title>Bob Hope Early 1950's carswell afb</title>

Bob Hope, KBE, KCSG, (May 29, 1903 &#8211; July 27, 2003), born Leslie Townes Hope, was a famous British-born American entertainer who appeared in vaudeville, on Broadway, on radio and television, in movies, and in performing tours for U.S. Military personnel.
Contents

Hope performed his first United Service Organizations (USO) show on May 6, 1941, at March Field, California. He continued to travel and entertain troops for the rest of World War II and later during the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the 1990&#8211;1991 Persian Gulf War. When overseas he almost always performed in Army fatigues as a show of support for his audience. Hope's USO career lasted half a century, during which he headlined approximately sixty tours.

A 1997 act of Congress signed by President Clinton named Hope an &#8220;Honorary Veteran&#8221;. He remarked, &#8220;I've been given many awards in my lifetime &#8212; but to be numbered among the men and women I admire most &#8212; is the greatest honor I have ever received.&quot;

However, there were also critical voices relating to the entertainer's patriotic activities. In his biography, Bob Hope: The Road Well-Traveled (1999), Lawrence J. Quirk writes that Hope was making sacrifices to entertain U.S. servicemen, whom he called &quot;my boys&quot;. But according to the author, the government always paid for Hope's trips, and by Vietnam, his routines had grown thin and become synonymous with the &quot;war machine.&quot;

Jack Benny (February 14, 1894 &#8211; December 26, 1974), born Benjamin Kubelsky, was an American comedian, vaudeville performer, and radio, television, and film actor. He was one of the biggest stars in classic American radio and was also a major television personality.

Benny may have been the first standup comedian, as the term is known, as well as one of the first to work with what became the situation comedy. He was renowned for his flawless comic timing and (especially) his ability to get laughs with either a pregnant pause or a single expression. In hand with his great &quot;rival&quot; Fred Allen &#8212; their long-running &quot;feud&quot; was one of the greatest running gags in comedy history &#8212; Benny helped establish a basic palette from which comedy since has rarely deviated, no matter how extreme or experimental it has become in their wake.


Benny had been only a minor vaudeville performer, but he became an enormously successful national figure with The Jack Benny Program, a weekly radio show which ran from 1932 to 1948 on NBC and from 1948 to 1955 on CBS, and was consistently among the most highly rated programs during most of that run.

George Herman Ruth, better known as Babe Ruth, was the greatest sporting hero of his day. Seventy years later it is difficult to comprehend just what a legend The Babe was. Adventures of Babe Ruth are short fictional tales of the life of the great baseball player. They border on being modern day fables, each one with a simple yet important message to put across to the audience. Despite the simple plots and sugar-sweet story lines they are still most enjoyable to listen to and the sound quality is (on the whole) excellent considering their age.

he Creaking Door was an old-time radio series of horror and suspense shows originating in South Africa.

There are at present anywhere from 34-37 extant episodes in MP3 circulation, yet no currently available program logs for the series indicate the year of the series' broadcast (though it was likely sometime in the 1950s, given the generally high audio quality of the available shows), or the total number of episodes, and only a handful of them are known by their broadcast order. The stories are thrillers in the Inner Sanctum vein, and generally thought of favorably by most fans of OTR.


Old-Time Radio (OTR) and the Golden Age of Radio are phrases used to refer to radio programs (audio theater) mainly broadcast during the 1920s through the late 1950s.

Vintage radio is remembered for fanfares and show openings, running gags, trademark sounds and newsworthy events, such as the headlines after The War of the Worlds was dramatized on Orson Welles' Mercury Theater on the Air. Others recall the creaking-door sound effect on Inner Sanctum Mysteries, the Dragnet theme music, the &quot;Hi-Yo, Silver!&quot; call of the Lone Ranger or the cackle of The Shadow: &quot;Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows.&quot; In the early 1950s, music radio began to replace the many familiar comedy/drama favorites. The end of the era is often marked by the final CBS broadcasts of Suspense and Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar on September 30, 1962.

 Dimension X was an old-time radio program broadcast April 1950 to September 1951 on NBC.

Dimension X was the first notable adult science fiction series on radio, preceded only by the short-lived 2000 Plus, scattered episodes of anthology dramas, and juvenile fare, such as Flash Gordon.

The series featured adaptations of stories by respected science fiction writers such as Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein. The first thirteen episodes were broadcast live, the remainder prerecorded.

Dimension X lasted only one year, but the later X Minus One utilized many of the same actors and scripts. All fifty episodes survive and are available from various retailers.   </description>

      <title>Marx Brothers- 1947-04-30 in Chicago</title>

During the mid-1930's, radio began to displace movies as the most popular entertainment medium. After all, it was free, it didn't require going out, and a much broader array of show formats was available, most of which did not require the time commitment of the audience that movies required. This boom in popularity saw a scramble to secure available talent for radio shows, and big-name Hollywood movie personalities were a prime target. As luck would have it, the Marx Brothers were on the downhill side of their cinematic careers and were looking to branch out into other areas. Groucho especially sought out radio, which gave him opportunity to exercise his natural wit. Chico pursued a career as a band leader, which landed him occasional air time, as the broadcasting of big band music was a popular use of the airwaves. For obvious reasons, Harpo was at a handicap in this medium, but still found an occasional guest spot. I have attempted here to document several radio appearances by each of the three brothers; however, as record keeping was not viewed as a necessity in this field back then, there is no attempt to present this as a complete list. Particularly difficult to trace to a specific date are Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) broadcasts* of Command Performance, G.I. Journal, and Mail Call broadcasts, which were often recorded on disc only for distribution to military bases, and whose broadcast dates and times varied at each locale.&quot; (Wayne Boenig)

The Adventures of Ellery Queen: Famous for his mystery books, Ellery invites listeners to solve his radio mysteries. The show was heard on various networks between 1939 and 1948 (except for the 1941-1942 season, when it was off the air). Most of its sponsors still exist, except for Kolynos toothpaste. 

Even on radio   Marion Shockley   (1911-1981) was the first actress to portray Nikki Porter  , Ellery's secretary and low-key love interest. In the &quot;Gum-Chewing Millionaire&quot; she's a blonde professional typist who gets asked to work on Ellery's manuscripts. She then applies for the job of personal secretary.


On radio, The Adventures of Ellery Queen was heard on all three networks from 1939 to 1948. During the 1970s, syndicated radio fillers, Ellery Queen's Minute Mysteries, began with an announcer saying, &quot;This is Ellery Queen...&quot; and would go on to describe a case in one minute. The radio station would then encourage callers to try to solve the mystery and win a sponsor's prize. Once they got a winner, the solution part of the spot would be played as confirmation.

Helene Hanff, best-known for her book 84 Charing Cross Road, was a scripter for the television series version of The Adventures of Ellery Queen (1950-52), which began on the DuMont Television Network but soon moved to ABC. Shortly after the series began, Lee Hart, who played Queen, died and was replaced in the lead role by Lee Bowman. The series returned to DuMont in 1954 with Hugh Marlowe in the title role. George Nader then played Queen in The Further Adventures of Ellery Queen (1958-59), but he was replaced with Lee Philips in the final episodes.

Peter Lawford starred in the television movie Ellery Queen: Don't Look Behind You (1971). The 1975 television movie Ellery Queen led into the 1975-76 television series starring Jim Hutton in the title role (with David Wayne as his widowed father). Each episode would end with Queen breaking the fourth wall to go over the facts of the case and invite the audience to solve the mystery on their own.

The cousins, under their collective pseudonym, were given the Grand Master Award for achievements in the field of the mystery story by the Mystery Writers of America in 1961.

      <title>Jack Benny Fest.  33-06-09 Who Killed Mr x</title>

Benny had been only a minor vaudeville performer, but he became an enormously successful national figure with The Jack Benny Program, a weekly radio show which ran from 1932 to 1948 on NBC and from 1948 to 1955 on CBS, and was consistently among the most highly rated programs during most of that run.


The Characters

Benny's stage character was a clever inversion of his actual self. Though the character was named Jack Benny, he was also just about everything the actual Jack Benny himself wasn't: cheap, petty, vain and self-congratulatory. His masterful comic rendering of these traits became the vital linchpin to the Benny show's success. Benny set himself up as the comedic foil, allowing his supporting characters to draw laughs at the expense of his stinginess, vanity, and pettiness. By allowing such a character to be seen as human and vulnerable, in an era where few male characters were allowed such obvious vulnerability, Benny made what might have been a despicable character into a lovable Everyman character. Benny himself said on several occasions: &quot;I don't care who gets the laughs on my show, as long as the show is funny.&quot;

The supporting characters who amplified that vulnerability only too gladly included wife Mary Livingstone as his wisecracking and not especially deferential female friend (not quite his girlfriend, since Benny would often try to date movie stars like Barbara Stanwyck, and occasionally had stage girlfriends such as Gladys Obispo); rotund announcer Don Wilson (who also served as announcer for Fanny Brice's hit, Baby Snooks); bandleader Phil Harris as a jive-talking, wine-and-women type whose repartee was rather risque for its time (Harris and Mahlon Merrick shared the actual musical chores of the show); boy tenor Dennis Day, who was cast as a sheltered, naive youth who still got the better of his boss as often as not (this character was originated by Kenny Baker, but perfected by Day); and, especially, Eddie Anderson as valet-chauffeur Rochester van Jones &#8212; who was as popular as Benny himself.

Superman on Radio
Superman on Radio The Adventures of Superman

&quot;Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings at a single bound!&quot;

&quot;Look! Up in the sky!&quot;
&quot;It's a bird!&quot;
&quot;It's a plane!&quot;
&quot;It's Superman!&quot;

&quot;Yes, it's Superman - strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman - defender of law and order. champion of equal rights, valiant, courageous fighter against the forces of hate and prejudice, who disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.&quot;

The above signature was heard in many variations over the airwaves, and has become as much a part of the public's perception of Superman as his blue, red and yellow costume. What most people don't know, is that this widely recognised opening did not originate from the 4-color pages of Superman comics, but rather on the long-running adventures serial that was one of the hallmarks of the Golden Age of Radio.

We all know that Superman first appeared in 1938 within the pages of Action Comics #1, but much of the mythology associated with Superman and many of the supporting cast of characters originated in his radio adventures. Daily Planet characters such as Perry White and Jimmy Olsen, along with Inspector Bill Henderson, were originally created for the radio series. Superman first discovered his greatest weakness, Kryptonite, in his radio adventures long before it appeared within the pages of the Superman comics. He also regularly teamed up with Batman and Robin on radio before the trio joined forces in the comic books. The radio series' influence also extended to the big screen. The Fleischer Superman movie-cartoons were nominated for Academy Awards, and featured voices from the cast of the radio series, while the screenplays of Columbia's 1948 and 1950 Superman movie serials were adapted from the radio program rather than from the stories within the comic books.

Up, Up and Away!

Superman first flew onto the radio airwaves on Monday, 12 February, 1940 as a transcribed series for Hecker's H-O Oats. DC's press agent Allen Ducovny and former pulp fiction author Robert Joffe Maxwell developed the new series. The two were quick to realise that Superman's popularity could be boosted by the vast radio audiences.

In 1939, Maxwell and Ducovny prepared several sample audition disks to sell the idea to prospective sponsors, co-writing the first version of Superman's famous opening signature: &quot;Faster than an airplane, more powerful than a locomotive, impervious to bullets. 'Up in the sky - look!' 'It's a giant bird.' 'It's a plane.' 'It's SUPERMAN!' And now, Superman - A being no larger than an ordinary man but possessed of powers and abilities never before realised on Earth: able to leap into the air an eigth of a mile at a single bound, hurtle a 20-story building with ease, race a high-powered bullet to its target, lift tremendous weights and rend solid steel in his bare hands as though it were paper. Superman - a strange visitor from a distant planet: champion of the oppressed, physical marvel extraordinary who has sworn to devote his existence on Earth to helping those in need.&quot; &quot;We had a lot of fun writing that opening,&quot; Ducovny once said. &quot;It was a typical radio action piece that fully utilized sound effects.&quot;

The new show was purchased by Hecker's H-O Oats, who tried to buy time on the networks but were turned down. Nevertheless, Hecker's bought airtime on ten stations and distributed the prerecorded series on 16-inch &quot;electrical transcription&quot; disks. Superman achieved a Crossley rating of 5.6 ten weeks after its debut, the highest rating of any thrice-weekly juvenile program on the air. Frank Chase produced the early episodes of Superman, George Ludlum scripted, and a repertory of the finest actors in New York radio was assembled. Ned Wever (CBS's Bulldog Drummond) and Agnes Moorehead (The Shadow's &quot;lovely Margot Lane&quot;) portrayed Jor-L and Lara, Superman's Kryptonian parents in the premier broadcast, with Jay Josten (Mr. District Attorney) as Rozan. Other early episodes featured the versatile Santos Ortega (Nero Wolfe) and future movie star Frank Lovejoy (radio's Blue Beetle). The success or failure of the series would largely rest upon the actor chosen to portray the dual leads. Bob Maxwell was afraid he might have to hire an actor to play both of Superman's personalities, unless he could obtain the services of a particular who initially wanted nothing to do with Superman.

Superman on Radio
Superman on Radio The Adventures of Superman

&quot;Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings at a single bound!&quot;

&quot;Look! Up in the sky!&quot;
&quot;It's a bird!&quot;
&quot;It's a plane!&quot;
&quot;It's Superman!&quot;

&quot;Yes, it's Superman - strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman - defender of law and order. champion of equal rights, valiant, courageous fighter against the forces of hate and prejudice, who disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.&quot;

The above signature was heard in many variations over the airwaves, and has become as much a part of the public's perception of Superman as his blue, red and yellow costume. What most people don't know, is that this widely recognised opening did not originate from the 4-color pages of Superman comics, but rather on the long-running adventures serial that was one of the hallmarks of the Golden Age of Radio.

We all know that Superman first appeared in 1938 within the pages of Action Comics #1, but much of the mythology associated with Superman and many of the supporting cast of characters originated in his radio adventures. Daily Planet characters such as Perry White and Jimmy Olsen, along with Inspector Bill Henderson, were originally created for the radio series. Superman first discovered his greatest weakness, Kryptonite, in his radio adventures long before it appeared within the pages of the Superman comics. He also regularly teamed up with Batman and Robin on radio before the trio joined forces in the comic books. The radio series' influence also extended to the big screen. The Fleischer Superman movie-cartoons were nominated for Academy Awards, and featured voices from the cast of the radio series, while the screenplays of Columbia's 1948 and 1950 Superman movie serials were adapted from the radio program rather than from the stories within the comic books.

Up, Up and Away!

Superman first flew onto the radio airwaves on Monday, 12 February, 1940 as a transcribed series for Hecker's H-O Oats. DC's press agent Allen Ducovny and former pulp fiction author Robert Joffe Maxwell developed the new series. The two were quick to realise that Superman's popularity could be boosted by the vast radio audiences.

In 1939, Maxwell and Ducovny prepared several sample audition disks to sell the idea to prospective sponsors, co-writing the first version of Superman's famous opening signature: &quot;Faster than an airplane, more powerful than a locomotive, impervious to bullets. 'Up in the sky - look!' 'It's a giant bird.' 'It's a plane.' 'It's SUPERMAN!' And now, Superman - A being no larger than an ordinary man but possessed of powers and abilities never before realised on Earth: able to leap into the air an eigth of a mile at a single bound, hurtle a 20-story building with ease, race a high-powered bullet to its target, lift tremendous weights and rend solid steel in his bare hands as though it were paper. Superman - a strange visitor from a distant planet: champion of the oppressed, physical marvel extraordinary who has sworn to devote his existence on Earth to helping those in need.&quot; &quot;We had a lot of fun writing that opening,&quot; Ducovny once said. &quot;It was a typical radio action piece that fully utilized sound effects.&quot;

The new show was purchased by Hecker's H-O Oats, who tried to buy time on the networks but were turned down. Nevertheless, Hecker's bought airtime on ten stations and distributed the prerecorded series on 16-inch &quot;electrical transcription&quot; disks. Superman achieved a Crossley rating of 5.6 ten weeks after its debut, the highest rating of any thrice-weekly juvenile program on the air. Frank Chase produced the early episodes of Superman, George Ludlum s(continued)</itunes:summary>

Launching a new range of &quot;Classic Radio Sci-Fi&quot; releases, this six-part BBC radio drama stars none other than Peter Cushing and Vincent Prince, who between them became two of the most famous horror film stars of the 1950s and 1960s. &quot;Aliens in the Mind&quot; is based on a story by the then-foremost &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script editor Robert Holmes. It centres around the discovery, on a remote Scottish island, of a community of 'human mutants' capable of telepathy. A plan is in place to use them to control the British Government, and friends Curtis Lark (Vincent Price) and Hugh Baxter (Peter Cushing) join forces to combat them. This renowned production from 1976 is sure to delight fans of science fiction, archive radio, horror films and &quot;Doctor Who.&quot; This release forms part of BBC Audiobooks' &quot;Classic Radio Sci-Fi&quot; range. Other titles are &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs.&quot;

Producer Leon Schlesinger had already produced one cartoon in the Looney Tunes series, and its success prompted him to try to sell a sister series to Warner Bros. His selling point was that the new cartoons would feature music from the soundtracks of Warner Bros. films and would thus serve as advertisements for Warner Bros. recordings. The studio agreed, and Schlesinger dubbed the series Merrie Melodies.

Walt Disney Productions had already scored with their Silly Symphonies. Since cartoon production usually began with a soundtrack, animating a piece of music made it easier to devise plot elements and even characters.

Merrie Melodies closing title from the early 1960s.

The Merrie Melodies series was taken on by Rudy Ising, one of the two animators (the other being Hugh Harman) who had worked on the original Looney Tunes short. The first of these was Lady, Play Your Mandolin!, released in 1931. Ising attempted to introduce new characters in his Merrie Melodies films, such as Piggy, Foxy, and Goopy Geer, but Foxy was so derivative of Mickey Mouse that he was dropped, possibly at Disney's urging. The Merrie Melodies shorts became largely plotless musicals or romances without any recurring characters and continued in this vein even after Ising left the studio in 1933.

In 1934, Schlesinger produced his first color Merrie Melodies shorts, Honeymoon Hotel and Beauty and the Beast, which were produced in Cinecolor (Disney had exclusive rights to the richer Technicolor process). Their success convinced Schlesinger to produce all future Merrie Melodies shorts in color as well. Looney Tunes continued in black and white until 1943.

Contractually, Merrie Melodies cartoons were obligated to include at least one full chorus from a Warner Bros. song. Warner Bros. requested that these songs be performed by name bands whenever possible, but this lasted only through the first few shorts. The policy annoyed the animators of Merrie Melodies, since the songs often interrupted the cartoons' momentum and pacing.

In the late 1930s, the animators were released from this obligation, and the Merrie Melodies shorts came to resemble more closely the black-and-white Looney Tunes series. In 1943, Schlesinger began producing Looney Tunes in color as well, and the two series became virtually indistinguishable except by their theme music and opening titles. By this time the theme music for Looney Tunes was &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; by Cliff Friend and Dave Franklin and the theme music for Merrie Melodies was an adaptation of &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; by Charles Tobias, Murray Mencher &amp; Eddie Cantor.

Warner Bros.-owned songs continued to appear in some of the shorts, however, as shown by the frequent repetition of &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; and &quot;Singing in the Bathtub,&quot; as well as the music of Carl Stalling and Raymond Scott, particularly &quot;Powerhouse&quot;.</description>

Appearing on CBS Radio, Johnny Dollar was heard each week flying off to a different town filled with danger and possibly murder as he tried to get to the bottom of insurance fraud. There were rarely any recurring characters except Dollar; despite sometimes romance and friends, the character was generally a loner. These early episodes, however, tended to be flat and the character of Dollar too dry. So at the start of the 1950 season, Charles Russell was out and veteran film actor Edmund O'Brien stepped in as the second Johnny Dollar. The series during the O'Brien years improved with scripts by expert crime writer such as E. Jack Neumann, John Michael Hayes, Sidney Marshall and Blake Edwards. The character took on the stereotype of the American detective developed by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. Dollar was more hardboiled; his softer side rarely appeared. O'Brien left in 1952 and John Lund became Dollar number three. With Lund in the role, the character as developed by O'Brien remained.</description>

Perry Mason on the Radio

Since his film experience with Hollywood turned out to be so embarrassing it may come as a surprise that Gardner agreed to put his hero on radio.

Perry Mason on the Radio

Since his film experience with Hollywood turned out to be so embarrassing it may come as a surprise that Gardner agreed to put his hero on radio. Although his compadres advised him to aim for a nighttime, prime time slot for Mason, Gardner sold the radio rights to Procter &amp; Gamble, the kingpins of soap, who decided to put the series on during the day.

      <title>Blondie - The Actor</title>

Biography:  Jeffrey Silver was the very last boy to play the part of Alexander Bumstead in the long-running and highly popular &quot;Blondie&quot; radio show.  It's because of him, more than anyone else, that I included a &quot;Blondie Radio Show&quot; section to this website.  He's a SPECIAL BLONDIE CONSULTANT and has contributed much in the way of information and pictures.  He's also a very talented individual who, as a child actor, had a way of delivering dialogue that is beyond compare.  Truly outstanding!

He made his professional radio debut in Cleveland on NBC in &quot;The Ohio Story.&quot;  He later arrived in Hollywood in August of 1948.  At first, the Silvers family came to Hollywood only to summer in Long Beach.  There was no thought of a Hollywood radio career for Jeff.  It just all kind of fell into place.  How?

Jeffrey's mother spent a day taking her mother to some of the local audience-participation programs.  The thought then struck her that her son should try out for a Hollywood radio audition.  His radio career flourished on the strength of his ability alone, with most of his roles resulting from word-of-mouth recommendations of actors and directors who sampled his past performances.</description>

      <title>Captain Midnight 10</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627565.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radioamerica.biz&quot;&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;

Captain Midnight was a U.S. radio serial broadcast from 1938 to 1949. Created by radio scripters Wilfred G. Moore and Robert M. Burtt, the program was developed at WGN in Chicago. Sponsored by the Skelly Oil Company, it began as a syndicated show in the fall of 1938, airing on a few midwest stations through the spring of 1940. In the fall of 1940, Ovaltine took over sponsorship, and the series was then heard nationally on the Mutual Radio Network where it remained until December, 1949.

The title character, Charles James Albright, was a World War I pilot. His Captain Midnight code name was given by a general who sent him on a high-risk mission. When the show began in 1938, Albright was a private aviator who helped people, but his situation changed in 1940. When the show was taken over by Ovaltine, the origin story explained how Albright was recruited to head the Secret Squadron, an aviation-oriented paramilitary organization fighting sabotage and espionage during the period prior to the United States' entry into World War II. The Secret Squadron acted both within and outside the United States.

When the United States was attacked at Pearl Harbor, the show shifted the Secret Squadron's duties to fight the more unconventional aspects of the war. Besides the stock villain, Ivan Shark, the war years introduced Axis villains, Baron von Karp, Admiral Himakito and von Schrecker. After the war, some of the newer villains used war surplus equipment to carry out their activities. The show was extremely popular, with an audience in the millions. Just under half the listeners were adult, and it was a favorite of WWII Army Air Corps crews when they were stationed in the U.S. Premiums offered by the series were decoders, and these Code-O-Graphs were used by listeners to decipher daily messages previewing the next day's episode.</description>

The Civil War is nearing its end. The Confederacy, beaten down and fading fast, is slowly realizing their cause is lost. However, there are still those diehards who will fight to the last. Among them is Joseph Paradine, a Rebel Scout who is still getting reconnaissance on Union targets. Ignoring the treasonous advice of his cowardly subordinate Dauger, Paradine decides to stealthily investigate a small town that should be a hotbed of Union activity but is strangely quiet.

Paradine discovers the reason for the stillness is that everyone in the town has been frozen into immobility as if by magic. The only man stirring is a wild-looking old man named Teague, who claims that he is a warlock who has cast the spell of stillness. Teague says that he will be dead before the end of the day, so he gives his book of black magic to Paradine. The old man tells him the book can win the war for the South...but the price may be the very soul of the Confederacy!

&quot;Still Valley&quot; is a fairly average episode of &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; but still boasts some notable performances and images. As Paradine, veteran actor Gary Merrill hits just the right note of weariness and toughness. He also delivers some pretty florid dialogue. Vaughn Taylor as Old Man Teague is pretty creepy and looks like someone who wouldn't have any problem trafficking with the Devil.

The &quot;stillness&quot; of the townsfolk is imperfectly realized. When Paradine inspects a row of frozen soldiers, many can be seen blinking and twitching.

The final denouement is a memorable one and suggests that there IS such a thing as too high a price for victory.

Teague: &quot;You've got the right of it, Johnny Reb. That's just who you're in league with. The Devil! The Devil, you're in league with the Devil! The Devil....&quot;</description>

Launching a new range of &quot;Classic Radio Sci-Fi&quot; releases, this six-part BBC radio drama stars none other than Peter Cushing and Vincent Prince, who between them became two of the most famous horror film stars of the 1950s and 1960s. &quot;Aliens in the Mind&quot; is based on a story by the then-foremost &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script editor Robert Holmes. It centres around the discovery, on a remote Scottish island, of a community of 'human mutants' capable of telepathy. A plan is in place to use them to control the British Government, and friends Curtis Lark (Vincent Price) and Hugh Baxter (Peter Cushing) join forces to combat them. This renowned production from 1976 is sure to delight fans of science fiction, archive radio, horror films and &quot;Doctor Who.&quot; This release forms part of BBC Audiobooks' &quot;Classic Radio Sci-Fi&quot; range. Other titles are &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs.&quot;</description>

Gradually, the Gasoline Alley characters married, had kids, and it became the first comic strip-soap opera in the post-War babyboom 1940s, before there was even such a genre as the conventional soap opera. A 15-minute radio version of the strip was developed and broadcast for a time in the same decade, sponsored by spark plug and parts maker Autolite, which focused upon Skeezix as a young adult running a gas station and garage.

Alan Young (born November 19, 1919) is an actor best known for his television role opposite a talking horse, Mister Ed.

Mr Young was born in North Shields,Tyne and Wear, England, and had the given name of Angus, he was raised in Edinburgh, Scotland and in Canada. He grew to love radio when bedbound as a child because of severe asthma, and became a radio broadcaster on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, then moved to New York where he was given his own television program, The Alan Young Show in 1950. After the cancellation of his show, he made several films: Margie (1946), Chicken Every Sunday (1948), Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1949), Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick (1952), Androcles and the Lion (1952), Gentleman Marry Brunettes (1955), Tom Thumb (1958), The Time Machine (1960), and a cameo in the remake of The Time Machine (2002).

His most popular venture, however, was Mister Ed, a CBS television show which ran from 1961 to 1966. He played the owner of a talking horse - which would talk to no one but him.

      <title>George Burns &amp;amp; Gracie Allen  40-30-27  till the cows come </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627575.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radioamerica.biz&quot;&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;

Gracie Allen (July 26, 19021 - August 27, 1964) was an American comedian who became internationally famous as the zany partner of husband George Burns. Burns himself phrased it perfectly, in a gag that got laughs no matter how often he repeated it for the rest of his life: &quot;One day, the audience realised I had a terrific talent. They were right. I did have a terrific talent. And I was married to her for 38 years.&quot;

The Burns drollery and the Allen malaprops and definitional contortions made for classically understated comic dialogue. It also made for very few true imitations, because the team's style was itself inimitable. Goodman Ace and his wife Jane, in their own radio show, Easy Aces, approached it differently, with Jane Ace's classic word mangling a distinct contrast to Allen's &quot;logically illogical&quot; style. By the time Allen retired, she was half a national institution.

      <title>Dick Tracy - The case of the positive negative 1948-01-22</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627576.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radioamerica.biz&quot;&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;

Dick Tracy had a long run on radio, from 1934 weekdays on NBC's New England stations to the ABC network in 1948. Bob Burlen was the first radio Tracy in 1934, and others heard in the role during the 1930s and 1940s were Barry Thompson, Ned Wever and Matt Crowley. The early shows all had 15-minute episodes.

On CBS, with Sterling Products as sponsor, the serial aired four times a week from February 4, 1935 to July 11, 1935, moving to Mutual from September 30, 1935 to March 24, 1937 with Bill McClintock doing the sound effects. NBC's weekday afternoon run from January 3, 1938 to April 28, 1939 had sound effects by Keene Crockett and was sponsored by Quaker Oats, which brought Dick Tracy into primetime (Saturdays at 7pm and, briefly, Mondays at 8pm) with 30-minute episodes from April 29, 1939 to September 30, 1939. The series returned to 15-minute episodes on the ABC Blue Network from March 15, 1943 to July 16, 1948, sponsored by Tootsie Rolls, which used the music theme of &quot;Toot Toot, Tootsie&quot; for its 30-minute Saturday ABC series from October 6, 1945 to June 1, 1946. Sound effects on ABC were supplied by Walt McDonough and Al Finelli.

Directors of the series included Mitchell Grayson, Charles Powers and Bob White. Cast members at various times included Walter Kinsella as Pat Patton, Helen Lewis as Tess Trueheart and Andy Donnelly and Jackie Kelk as Junior Tracy. Announcers were Ed Herlihy and Dan Seymour.

      <title>Wild Bill Hickock - 53-03-27 Carnival of danger</title>

This juvenile western followed the same format as the TV show of the same name that ran throughout the same years. This format certainly was not new as the charismatic hero and comic side-kick was something that had been done before with Hopalong Cassidy and The Cisco Kid, and to some extent with the Lone Ranger.

The storylines for Wild Bill Hikock are anything but challenging. The basic plot is usually along the lines of Hickock and his sidekick, Jingles, blundering into trouble, fighting their way out of it somehow, and then riding off into the sunset in readiness for next weeks trials and tribulations.

James Butler Hickok (May 27, 1837 &#8211; August 2, 1876), better known as Wild Bill Hickok, was a legendary figure in the American Wild West. He is perhaps the best known figure from that era. After fighting in the Union army during the American Civil War, he became a legendary army scout, and later, lawman and gunfighter.

Hickok was born in Troy Grove, Illinois on May 27, 1837. He left his father's farm in 1855 to be a stage coach driver on the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails. His gunfighting skills led to his nickname.

This juvenile western followed the same format as the TV show of the same name that ran throughout the same years. This format certainly was not new as the charismatic hero and comic side-kick was something that had been done before with Hopalong Cassidy and The Cisco Kid, and to some extent with the Lone Ranger.

      <title>Burns and Allen</title>

Burns and Allen were an American comedy duo consisting of George Burns and his wife, Gracie Allen.

Burns wrote most of the material, and played the straight man. Allen played a silly, addleheaded woman. Both attributed their success to the other, to the ends of their lives. Early on, the team had played the opposite roles until they noticed that the audience was laughing at Gracie's straight lines, so they made the change.

Burns and Allen developed their popular routine over more than three decades of stage, radio, film, and television. Historians of popular culture have often stated that Allen was a brilliant comedian, whose entire career consisted of engaging in dialogues of &quot;illogical logic&quot; that left her verbal opponents dazed and confused, and her audiences in stitches. During a typical 23-minute episode of the Burns and Allen show, the vast majority of the dialogue and speaking parts were written for Allen, who was credited with having the genius to deliver her lengthy diatribes in a fashion that made it look as though she was making her arguments up on the spot. (One running gag on the TV show was the existence of a closet full of hats belonging to various visitors to the Burns household, where the guests would slip out the door unnoticed, leaving their hats behind, rather than face another round with Gracie.)

Burns and Allen had several regulars, including Toby Reed, Gail Gordon, Elliot Louis, musician Meredith Willson, and Artie Shaw. Bill Goodwin announced the program for several years, and also went with George and Gracie to the Burns And Allen TV program.

Burns would always ended the show with &quot;Say goodnight, Gracie&quot; to which Allen simply replied &quot;Good night.&quot; She never said &quot;Good night, Gracie&quot; as legend has it.[1] (this &quot;false memory&quot; may be caused by the Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In ending, &quot;Say good night, Dick;&quot; &quot;Good night, Dick!&quot;).</description>

Box 13 was a syndicated radio series about the escapades of mystery novelist Dan Holiday (Alan Ladd), a former newsman. Created by Mayfair Productions, the series premiered August 22, 1948, on New York's WOR and aired in syndication on the East Coast from August 22, 1948, to August 14. 1949. On the West Coast, Box 13 was heard from March 15, 1948 to March 7, 1949.

To seek out new ideas for his fiction, Holiday ran a classified ad in the Star-Times newspaper. &quot;Adventure wanted, will go anywhere, do anything -- Box 13.&quot; The stories followed Holiday's adventures when he responded to the letters sent to him by such people as a psycho killer and various victims.

Sylvia Picker appeared as Holiday's scatterbrained secretary Suzy. Supporting cast members included Betty Lou Gerson, Frank Lovejoy, Lurene Tuttle, Alan Reed, Luis Van Rooten and John Beal. Vern Carstensen, who directed Box 13 for producer Richard Sanville, was also the show's announcer.

Among the 52 episodes in the series were such mystery adventures as &quot;The Sad Night,&quot; &quot;Hot Box,&quot; &quot;Last Will And Nursery Rhyme,&quot; &quot;Hare And Hounds,&quot; &quot;Hunt And Peck,&quot; &quot;Death Is A Doll,&quot; &quot;Tempest In a Casserole&quot; and &quot;Mexican Maze.&quot; The dramas featured music by Rudy Schrager. Russell Hughes, who had previously hired Ladd as a radio actor in 1935 at a $19 weekly salary, wrote the scripts, sometimes in collaboration with Ladd. The partners in Mayfair Productions were Ladd and Bernie Joslin, who had previously run the chain of

      <title>Abbott &amp;amp; Costello</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627584.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bbott and Costello (William (Bud) Abbott, 1897-1974; Louis Cristillo, 1906-1959) were an American comedy duo whose work in radio, film, and television made them one of the most popular and respected teams in comedy history. Their &quot;Who's on First?&quot; routine, developed during their years in burlesque, is widely considered to be one of the greatest comedy sketches of all time.

They received their first national exposure in 1938 when they appeared on radio's The Kate Smith Hour. Their popularity on the program grew and they stayed on as regulars for two years. This led to roles in a Broadway musical, &quot;The Streets of Paris,&quot; in 1939. In 1940 they were signed by Universal for the film One Night in the Tropics. Cast strictly in a supporting capacity, they nonetheless stole the show with several classic routines, including their immortal &quot;Who's on First?&quot; Universal signed them to a long-term contract and their second film, &quot;Buck Privates,&quot; 1941 secured their place as movie stars. The duo made over 30 films between 1940 and 1956 (see list below) and were among the most popular and highest-paid entertainers in the world during World War II. Among their most popular films are &quot;Hold That Ghost,&quot; &quot;Who Done It?&quot;, &quot;Pardon My Sarong,&quot; &quot;The Time of Their Lives,&quot; &quot;Buck Privates Come Home,&quot; &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,&quot; and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man.&quot;

The team also appeared on radio throughout the 1940s. They began by hosting a summer replacement series for Fred Allen on NBC in 1940, then joined Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on the Chase and Sanborn program in 1941. During the same period two of their films, &quot;Buck Privates&quot; and &quot;Hold That Ghost,&quot; were adapted for radio and presented on Lux Radio Theater. On October 8, 1942 the team launched their own weekly show on NBC sponsored by Camel cigarettes. They moved to ABC (the former NBC Blue Network) from 1947-49.

By 1951, the twosome had moved to television--first as one of the rotating hosts of The Colgate Comedy Hour (Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope were among the others) and then, the following year, in their own situation comedy, The Abbott and Costello Show. The half-hour series was loosely adapted from their radio show, but cast the duo as unemployed wastrels. One of the show's running gags involved Abbott perpetually nagging Costello to get a job to pay their rent, while Abbott barely lifted a finger himself in that direction. The show featured Sidney Fields as their landlord and Hillary Brooke as a friendly neighbor who sometimes got involved in the pair's schemes. Another semi-regular was Joe Besser, who played Stinky, a 40-year-old sissy dressed in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit. The Abbott and Costello Show ran from 1952 to 1954, but the show found a new life in syndicated rerun broadcast in the late 1960s and early-to-mid 1970s, and the episodes were probably seen by more viewers this time around than when the show was actually produced.</description>

      <itunes:summary>bbott and Costello (William (Bud) Abbott, 1897-1974; Louis Cristillo, 1906-1959) were an American comedy duo whose work in radio, film, and television made them one of the most popular and respected teams in comedy history. Their &quot;Who's on First?&quot; routine, developed during their years in burlesque, is widely considered to be one of the greatest comedy sketches of all time.

They received their first national exposure in 1938 when they appeared on radio's The Kate Smith Hour. Their popularity on the program grew and they stayed on as regulars for two years. This led to roles in a Broadway musical, &quot;The Streets of Paris,&quot; in 1939. In 1940 they were signed by Universal for the film One Night in the Tropics. Cast strictly in a supporting capacity, they nonetheless stole the show with several classic routines, including their immortal &quot;Who's on First?&quot; Universal signed them to a long-term contract and their second film, &quot;Buck Privates,&quot; 1941 secured their place as movie stars. The duo made over 30 films between 1940 and 1956 (see list below) and were among the most popular and highest-paid entertainers in the world during World War II. Among their most popular films are &quot;Hold That Ghost,&quot; &quot;Who Done It?&quot;, &quot;Pardon My Sarong,&quot; &quot;The Time of Their Lives,&quot; &quot;Buck Privates Come Home,&quot; &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,&quot; and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man.&quot;

The team also appeared on radio throughout the 1940s. They began by hosting a summer replacement series for Fred Allen on NBC in 1940, then joined Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on the Chase and Sanborn program in 1941. During the same period two of their films, &quot;Buck Privates&quot; and &quot;Hold That Ghost,&quot; were adapted for radio and presented on Lux Radio Theater. On October 8, 1942 the team launched their own weekly show on NBC sponsored by Camel cigarettes. They moved to ABC (the former NBC Blue Network) from 1947-49.

By 1951, the twosome had moved to television--first as one of the rotating hosts of The Colgate Comedy Hour (Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope were among the others) and then, the following year, in their own situation comedy, The Abbott and Costello Show. The half-hour series was loosely adapted from their radio show, but cast the duo as unemployed wastrels. One of the show's running gags involved Abbott perpetually nagging Costello to get a job to pay their rent, while Abbott barely lifted a finger himself in that direction. The show featured Sidney Fields as their landlord and Hillary Brooke as a friendly neighbor who sometimes got involved in the pair's schemes. Another semi-regular was Joe Besser, who played Stinky, a 40-year-old sissy dressed in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit. The Abbott and Costello Show ran from 1952 to 1954, but the show found a new life in syndicated rerun broadcast in the late 1960s and early-to-mid 1970s, and the episodes were probably seen by more viewers this time around than when the show was actually produced.</itunes:summary>

Jess Oppenheimer, the man Lucille Ball called &quot;the brains&quot; behind I Love Lucy, wrote comedy during radio&#8217;s golden age for such show business legends as Fred Astaire, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Al Jolson, Rudy Vallee, John Barrymore, and Fanny Brice, on programs such as The Packard Hour, The Gulf Screen Guild Show, The Jack Benny Program, The Chase &amp; Sanborn Hour, Texaco Star Theater, The Rudy Vallee Program, The Lifebuoy Program, and Baby Snooks. His association with Lucille Ball began in 1948, when he signed on as head writer, producer and director of her radio series, My Favorite Husband.
     When CBS made a TV deal with the legendary redhead, Lucy made it a condition that Oppenheimer be in charge of the venture. He remained as producer and head writer of the series for five of its six seasons, writing the pilot and 153 episodes with Madelyn Pugh Davis and Bob Carroll Jr. (joined in the 1955 by writers Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf). After I Love Lucy Oppenheimer created and produced such TV series as Angel, Glynis (starring Glynis Johns), and The Debbie Reynolds Show. His other TV credits include The General Motors 50th Anniversary Show, Ford Startime, The U.S. Steel Hour, Get Smart, and Bob Hope&#8217;s Chrysler Theater, as well as specials for Danny Kaye, Lucille Ball, Bob Hope, Rosalind Russell, and others. He received two Emmy Awards and five Emmy nominations, a Sylvania Award, and the Writers&#8217; Guild of America Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television Achievement.
     Upon Oppenheimer's passing in 1988, Lucille Ball called him &quot;a true genius,&quot; adding &quot;I owe so much to his creativity and his friendship.&quot; His humorous memoir, Laughs, Luck...and Lucy: How I Came to Create the Most Popular Sitcom of All Time, completed after his death by his son, Gregg, is in its seventh printing since its publication in 1996, and was released in paperback earlier this year. The audio cassette edition was recently named Pop Culture Audiobook of the Year by Publishers Weekly.

From 1957 - 1960 the show became a series of one-hour
      specials under the titles &quot;The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show&quot;
      and &quot;The Luci-Desi Comedy Hour&quot; which alternated with 
      the dramatic anthology &quot;Desilu Playhouse&quot;, which see;

      &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; derived from a CBS radio series which had 
      starred Lucille Ball and Richard Denning called &quot;My 
      Favorite Husband&quot;; Head writer/producer Jess Oppenheimer 
      and two other writers who had worked on the CBS radio
      show became the core staff working on the new TV series, 
      which also introduced Vivian Vance and William Frawley
      into the TV ensemble cast; 

      When CBS asked Lucille Ball to move to television, she 
      insisted they let her real-life husband, latin bandleader
      Desi Arnaz, play her fictional husband &quot;Ricky&quot; in the TV 
      series; But CBS-TV executives did not believe the 1950s 
      TV viewing audience would be interested in the family
      life of a wacky redhead married to a Cuban bandleader

Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video signals (programs) to a number of recipients (&quot;listeners&quot; or &quot;viewers&quot;) that belong to a large group. This group may be the public in general, or a relatively large audience within the public. Thus, an Internet channel may distribute text or music world-wide, while a public address system in (for example) a workplace may broadcast very limited ad hoc soundbites to a small population within its range.

The sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a schedule. With all technological endevours a number of technical terms and slang are developed please see the list of broadcasting terms for a glossary of terms used.

Television and radio programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or cable, often both simultaneously. By coding signals and having decoding equipment in homes, the latter also enables subscription-based channels and pay-per-view services.

A broadcasting organisation may broadcast several programs at the same time, through several channels (frequencies), for example BBC One and Two. On the other hand, two or more organisations may share a channel and each use it during a fixed part of the day. Digital radio and digital television may also transmit multiplexed programming, with several channels compressed into one ensemble.

When broadcasting is done via the Internet the term webcasting is often used. In 2004 a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce Podcasting. Podcasting is an asynchronous broadcast/narrowcast medium. One of the main proponents being Adam Curry and his associates the Podshow.

Broadcasting forms a very large segment of the mass media.

Broadcasting to a very narrow range of audience is called narrowcasting.

The term &quot;broadcast&quot; was coined by early radio engineers from the midwestern United States. &quot;Broadcasting&quot;, in farming, is one method of spreading seed using a wide toss of the hand, in a broad cast.</description>

Gunsmoke's four continuing characters on both radio and television were
Matt Dillon, United States Marshall,
Chester Wesley Proudfoot, his middle aged &quot;helper,&quot;
Charles &quot;Doc&quot; Adams, the town physician, and
Kitty Russell, a &quot;saloon girl&quot; at the Texas Trails.


Gunsmoke was set in Dodge City, Kansas between 1872, when the Santa Fe Railroad reached town, and 1885, when local farmers forced the end of the Texas cattle drives along the Western Trail. Dodge City, known as the &quot;Queen of the Cow Towns,&quot; the &quot;Wicked Little City,&quot; the &quot;Gomorrah of the Plains,&quot; had a reputation as a hostile, lawless town where the &quot;fastest gun&quot; ruled. As the opening of the show proclaimed: &quot;Around Dodge City and in the territory on west, there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers and that's with a U.S. Marshal and the smell of gunsmoke.&quot; That marshall, Matt Dillon, was modeled after the real lawmen who &quot;tamed&quot; (or at least kept a lid on) Dodge City: US Deputy Marshall Wyatt Earp (1848-1929), Sheriff Bat Masterson (1856-1921), Sheriff Bill Tilghman (1854-1924), and Sheriff Charlie Bassett.</description>

      <title>Green Hornet   - Oliver Perrys car</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627593.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radioamerica.biz&quot;&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a&gt;



The Green Hornet was an American radio program that ran on WXYZ (Detroit), the Mutual Network and the ABC Blue Network from January 31, 1936 to December 5, 1952. Created by WXYZ's George W. Trendle and Fran Striker, who also created The Lone Ranger, the juvenile adventure series initially starred Al Hodge in the title role, followed by Donovan Faust (1943), Bob Hall (1944-51) and Jack McCarthy (1951-52). The radio show used Rimsky-Korsakov's &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; as its theme song, blended with a hornet buzz created on a theremin.

The series detailed the adventures of Britt Reid, debonair newspaper publisher by day, crime-fighting masked hero at night, along with his trusty sidekick, Kato, a Filipino of Japanese ancestry. With the outbreak of World War II his Japanese heritage was almost completely dropped, leading to the common misperception that the character's nationality had been switched by the show's writers. (When the characters were used in a pair of movie serials Kato's nationality was inexplicably given as Korean.) Reid is a close relative of The Lone Ranger. The character of Dan Reid, who appeared on the Lone Ranger program as the Masked Man's nephew, was also featured on the Green Hornet as Britt's father. The Lone Ranger's name is often incorrectly stated to have been John Reid, an error first made in a volume called The Big Broadcast in the 1970s. In fact, however, writers for WXYZ never provided a first name for the character.

In the original introduction of the radio show announcer Mike Wallace proclaimed that the Green Hornet went after criminals that &quot;even the G-Men (FBI agents) couldn't reach&quot;. The show's producers were called by FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover who prompted them to remove the line implying that some crime fighting was beyond the abilities of the FBI. During World War II, the radio show's title was used as a codename for SIGSALY, secret encryption equipment used in the war.

Back Of The Mike&quot; is well done. It shows the viewer how a 1930's radio play was done in the studio. Unlike television, the radio listeners had to participate by using their imagination.

HOW SOUND EFFECTS ARE PRODUCED IN THE MODERN RADIO STUDIO. BOY LISTENS TO WESTERN DRAMA ON RADIO; THIS IS INTERCUT WITH ACTORS &amp; TECHNICIANS PRODUCING SOUND EFFECTS. CONTAINS WESTERN CHASE SCENES. DAY IS SAVED BY SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER IN CHEVROLET.

Ken Smith sez: A boy lies on his bed (wearing a white shirt and a necktie), listening to a radio western. We see the images the radio creates in his mind, then we cut to the studio, where we see that this whole fantasy world is created at a frantic pace by announcers in three-piece suits and sound-effects technicians operating incredibly complicated jury-rigged devices. Since this is a Jam Handy picture, the good guys catch the bad guys in the end because the good guys are in a Chevrolet and the bad guys are only on horses.

      <title>Lone Ranger</title>

The Lone Ranger galloped through performance after performance of radio heroism on
Detroit&#8217;s WXYZ: His dramatic &#8220;Hi-Yo Silver&#8221; echoed through living rooms across the
nation and fans young and old thrilled with excitement when &#8220;the thundering hooves of
the great horse Silver&#8221; were heard via the airwaves, bearing the masked rider, with
Tonto at his side, to his mission of rescue.
Seventy-two years ago, when the Lone Ranger was first broadcast, the identity of  the
sonorous-voiced hero was a closely-guarded secret. Actually, an actor named Jack
Deeds played the title role for the first six broadcasts. He was replaced by a young
actor, George Stenius (later famous as George Seaton, movie producer) who
continued in the role for three months. When Stenius quit, then-station manager Brace
Beemer was selected to play the lead, but Beemer quit after a few months to open his
own advertising agency.
Earl W. Graser, another actor, played the masked hero with an easygoing naturalness
that had a strong identification for listeners until his untimely death in an automobile
accident in April of 1941. Baffled on Graser&#8217;s replacement, the producers decided to
buy some time by having the Lone Ranger critically wounded and unconscious, unable
to speak except for some heavy breathing to show he was still alive.</description>

Jack Benny (February 14, 1894 &#8211; December 26, 1974), born Benjamin Kubelsky, was an American comedian, vaudeville performer, and radio, television, and film actor. He was one of the biggest stars in classic American radio and was also a major television personality.

Benny may have been the first standup comedian, as the term is known, as well as one of the first to work with what became the situation comedy. He was renowned for his flawless comic timing and (especially) his ability to get laughs with either a pregnant pause or a single expression. In hand with his great &quot;rival&quot; Fred Allen &#8212; their long-running &quot;feud&quot; was one of the greatest running gags in comedy history &#8212; Benny helped establish a basic palette from which comedy since has rarely deviated, no matter how extreme or experimental it has become in their wake.</description>

      <title>Johnny Dollar</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/8885/600x600_627598.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radioamerica.biz&quot;&gt;clickhere Visit the Radio America Store web site.Buy your 50 mp3 for &amp;5.00&lt;/a

Appearing on CBS Radio, Johnny Dollar was heard each week flying off to a different town filled with danger and possibly murder as he tried to get to the bottom of insurance fraud. There were rarely any recurring characters except Dollar; despite sometimes romance and friends, the character was generally a loner. These early episodes, however, tended to be flat and the character of Dollar too dry. So at the start of the 1950 season, Charles Russell was out and veteran film actor Edmund O'Brien stepped in as the second Johnny Dollar. The series during the O'Brien years improved with scripts by expert crime writer such as E. Jack Neumann, John Michael Hayes, Sidney Marshall and Blake Edwards. The character took on the stereotype of the American detective developed by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. Dollar was more hardboiled; his softer side rarely appeared. O'Brien left in 1952 and John Lund became Dollar number three. With Lund in the role, the character as developed by O'Brien remained.

In 1955, radio actor Bob Bailey, fresh from his long run as George Valentine in LET GEORGE DO IT, stepped into the role as the fourth Johnny Dollar (there was an audition show with Dick Powell in 1948 that is not counted). It was with Bailey that the series really blossomed. Changing to a 15-minute format five times a week, and under the sharp eye of the new producer/director, Jack Johnstone, the scripts got much deeper into characterization and plot. And Bailey's depiction of Dollar had shades of a gritty street fighter, yet bright and sensitive. With a strong cast (many of the same veteran radio actors appearing in different roles) and excellent directing, the portrayals were much more real. And exciting; listen to such serials as &quot;The Open Town Matter&quot; or &quot;The MacCormack Matter.&quot; Even while radio drama was already declining, this was radio acting at its best. The sound effects, some of which were canned, fit into the scripts so well as to produce some very exciting adventure/mystery. </description>

      <title>Fred Allen - Santa wont ride tonight</title>

Fred Allen hated television. Allen was a radio comedian for nearly two decades who, as early as 1936, had a weekly radio audience of about 20 million. When he visited The Jack Benny Show to continue their long running comedy feud, they had the largest audience in the history of radio, only to be later outdone by President Franklin Roosevelt during a Fireside Chat. The writer Herman Wouk said that Allen was the best comic writer in radio. His humor was literate, urbane, intelligent, and contemporary. Allen came to radio from vaudeville where he performed as a juggler. He was primarily self-educated and was extraordinarily well read.

Allen's world of radio was highly competitive and commercial, just as TV would be many years later. He wrote most of the material for his weekly shows himself, usually working 12 hour days, 6 days a week. Most comedians, like Bob Hope, had an office filled with writers, but Allen used only a few assistants in writing his comedy. And some of these assistants went on to have successful careers in literature and comedy, such as Herman Wouk author of The Caine Mutiny and The Winds of War, and Nat Hiken who created Phil Silver's The Phil Silvers Show for TV. Allen's program was imbued with literate, verbal slapstick. He had ethnic comedy routines in Allen's Alley, appearances by celebrities such as Alfred Hitchcock, musical numbers with talent from the likes of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, and social commentaries on every conceivable subject, especially criticisms of the advertising and radio industry.</description>

Clark Kent is the secret identity of Superman. Kent, as opposed to Superman, is traditionally presented as behaving in a more introverted or mild manner compared to his superheroic self. John Byrne's The Man of Steel revamp drops many traditional aspects of Clark Kent in favor of giving him a more aggressive and extroverted personality, including making Kent a top football player in high school and a successful author. Recent storylines restore elements of the earlier mild-mannered version of Kent.

Clark Kent is a reporter at the Metropolis newspaper The Daily Planet, which allows him to keep track of events in which he might be able to help. Fellow reporter Lois Lane is often the object of Clark's affection; Lois's affection for Superman and rejection of Clark are a recurring theme in Superman comics, television, and movies. Unlike Batman, Superman considers himself Clark Kent first and Superman second. In an episode of Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman Superman says, &quot;Superman is what I can do; Clark is who I am.&quot;

Clark keeps his Superman identitity a secret to protect his loved ones. Various methods for keeping his Superman's identity secret over the years include his using &quot;super-hypnosis&quot;, subliminally causing people to not make the connection, compressing his spine as Clark Kent to become shorter, and studying the Meisner acting technique to switch seamlessly between personas. Modern comic book stories show that to everyone, Superman is the greatest hero in the world and a larger-than-life figure, and no one thinks to look for him living as a normal human. Furthermore, since Superman goes into public unmasked, most people assume that he has no other identity. Even Batman commended him on his disguise. As long as he does not let on that he has another life, there is no real reason to look for a secret identity. When first confronted by evidence that Clark Kent is Superman, Lex Luthor dismisses it, saying, &quot;No one with the power of Superman would be living as a normal man&quot;.</description>

This series came to the CBS radio network, via station KNX in Hollywood, on April 26, 1952 and is considered to be the best of the &quot;adult westerns.&quot;  Everything about this program was first rate from the acting to the very best in sound patterns (effects).  William Conrad had to make a choice between this program, or staying with Escape, which he was heard on extensively.  You'll agree that he made the right choice with devoting his talents here.
 
     William Conrad played U.S. Marshall Matt Dillon of Dodge City on the frontier of Kansas; Parley Baer as Chester Wesley Proudfoot, deputy to Marshall Dillon; Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, saloon girl; and Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams.  These four were heard in virtually very broadcast for the entire run.
 
     The great CBS acting staff is well represented here.  Harry Bartell, Jeanne Bates, Lillian Buyeff, Virginia Christine, John Dehner, Lawrence Dobkin, Sam Edwards, Virginia Gregg, Vivi Janiss, Helen Kleeb, Lou Krugman, Jack Kruschen, Ralph Moody, Jeanette Nolan, James Nusser, Vic Perrin, Barney Phillips, and Ben Wright are heard throughout these programs.  The total supporting acting staff included more than 115 actors and actresses.  A total of 413 different scripts were produced.  This is radio at its finest.

Gunsmoke was set in Dodge City, Kansas between 1872, when the Santa Fe Railroad reached town, and 1885, when local farmers forced the end of the Texas cattle drives along the Western Trail. Dodge City, known as the &quot;Queen of the Cow Towns,&quot; the &quot;Wicked Little City,&quot; the &quot;Gomorrah of the Plains,&quot; had a reputation as a hostile, lawless town where the &quot;fastest gun&quot; ruled. As the opening of the show proclaimed: &quot;Around Dodge City and in the territory on west, there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers and that's with a U.S. Marshal and the smell of gunsmoke.&quot; That marshall, Matt Dillon, was modeled after the real lawmen who &quot;tamed&quot; (or at least kept a lid on) Dodge City: US Deputy Marshall Wyatt Earp (1848-1929), Sheriff Bat Masterson (1856-1921), Sheriff Bill Tilghman (1854-1924), and Sheriff Charlie Bassett. </description>

Lou Costello was born Louis Francis Cristillo in March 1906 in New Jersey. Standing only 5'3&quot; but very athletic, Costello went to Hollywood as a young man in the 1920s to break into films. However, he could only secure work as a stuntman and in bit parts. Feeling defeated, he went back east in the late 1920s and entered burlesque. After his initial meeting with Bud Abbott, the duo developed an instant rapport. They honed their act in vaudeville and burlesque houses; since the act was becoming successful so quickly, they soon found themselves ascending to greater heights. Comedian Henny Youngman, who was a great fan of theirs, pulled some strings and got them a one-time booking on a 1938 episode of the Kate Smith Radio Hour, one of the most popular radio programs at the time. The team proved to be such a hit with audiences that they returned to the show numerous times, eventually doing their famous &quot;Who's On First?&quot; routine. Several studio executives took notice of Abbott and Costello's growing popularity, but Universal Studios, best known at the time for their horror films, made the best offer, so the team signed a contact with the studio in 1939.</description>

A Tale of Two Cities (1859) is one of Dickens&#8217; two historical novels, the other being Barnaby Rudge, the two cities in question are Paris and London at the time of the French Revolution. Perhaps unsurprisingly Dickens seems to disdain the aristocracy. The heroic nobleman, Charles Darnay, renounces his status in opposition to his uncle, the Marquis de St Evremonde, and the evils of oppression he represents. Meanwhile, Dr Manette the physician has become aware of the Marquis&#8217; ill-practice through a young peasant and his sister who have been hideously treated. After Darnay leaves France, he falls in love with Manette&#8217;s daughter, Lucie, and they are married. The story continues after Darnay&#8217;s happiness with Lucie as he returns to France during the Terror to save a servant. Darnay is arrested and condemned to death. The final section of the novel is concerned with the question of whether he will survive or be punished for his noble act of rescue, and whether or not the Englishman Carton who resembles Darnay will be able to save his life. It is a story of great sacrifices being made for the sake of principle. The novel is notable for its vivid representation of France during this troubled time and was modelled on Carlyle&#8217;s The French Revolution. Although contemporary critics saw it as humourless, it has become popular since then due to film and dramatic adaptations. </description>

Bagel Street, aka. Susquehanna Hat Company routine, with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, taken from &quot;In Society&quot;

This is a classic vaudeville routine, and highly popular with the fans of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. During the filming of In Society, Lou wanted to include this routine in the movie. However, because the movie was already on a tight shooting schedule, since Universal Pictures wanted to release this film before MGM's Abbott and Costello movie &quot;Lost in a Harem,&quot; the producers refused. Lou was unwilling to give up on the idea, so he filmed and directed this segment himself.

The routine involves Abbott and Costello helping out a friend, Derby Dan, owner of a hat shop, by delivering some hats to the Susquehanna Hat Company on Bagel Street (later, when doing the same routine on the Abbott and Costello television show, it was changed to Fleugel Street).

The Lone Ranger was an early, long-running radio and television show based on characters created by George W. Trendle of Detroit, Michigan and developed by writer Fran Striker of Buffalo, New York. Their inspiration may have come from The Lone Star Ranger, a novel by Zane Grey. The basic premise is that a masked cowboy in the Old West gallops about righting injustices, usually with the aid of a clever and laconic American Indian called Tonto. Karl May's tales of Old Shatterhand and Chief Winnetou may have influenced the creation of the concept; but the main source for the Lone Ranger and many other masked heroes of the 1920s, 1930s, and on into the 21st century is Zorro.</description>

Between 1971 and 1973 the TV series scripts were adapted for radio for broadcast in South Africa, which did not have television until 1976. The Tara King episodes had the character effectively renamed Emma Peel. Donald Monat played Steed, and Diane Appleby, Mrs Peel. The stories were adapted into between 5 and 7 episodes of approximately 15 minutes each (including adverts) and stripped across the week on the SABC.

Currently 19 complete serials survive, all from original reel-to-reel off-air recordings, as well as three episodes of &quot;Escape In Time&quot;, from a mixture of sources.</description>

Lum and Abner, an American radio comedy which aired as a network program from 1932 to 1954, became an American institution in its low-keyed, arch rural wit. One of a series of 15-minute serial comedies that dotted American radio at its height as America's number one home entertainment---others included Amos 'n' Andy, Easy Aces, The Goldbergs, and Vic and Sade---Lum and Abner included various elements of each but yielded something as singular as the others and became somewhat more of an institution.

The creation of co-stars Chester Lauck (as Columbus &quot;Lum&quot; Edwards) and Norris Goff (as Abner Peabody), Lum and Abner was as low-keyed as Easy Aces, as cheerfully absurdist as Vic and Sade, and raised The Goldbergs ethnic focus by amplifying the protagonists' regional identities. As the co-owners of the Jot 'em Down Store in the then-fictional town of Pine Ridge, Arkansas, who were always stumbling upon moneymaking ideas only to get themselves fleeced by nemesis Squire Skimp, before finding one or another way to redeem themselves, Lum and Abner played the hillbilly theme with deceptive cleverness: the hillbillies just knew the slickers were going to get theirs, sooner or later, and either didn't mind or knew more than they let on that the slickers getting theirs was a matter of fortunate circumstance.</description>

Duffy's Tavern, an American radio situation comedy (CBS, 1941-1942; NBC-Blue Network, 1942-1944; NBC, 1944-1952), often featured top-name stage and film guest stars but always hooked those around the misadventures of the title establishment's malaprop-prone manager, Archie, played by the writer/actor who created the show, Ed Gardner.

In the show's familiar opening, &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,&quot; either solo on an old-sounding piano or by a larger orchestra, was interrupted by the ring of a telephone and Gardner's New Yorkese accent as he answered, &quot;Duffy's Tavern, where the elite meet to eat. Archie the manager speakin'. Duffy ain't here---oh, hello, Duffy.&quot;

Duffy, the owner, was never heard (or seen, when a film based on the show was made in 1945 or when a bid to bring the show to television was tried in 1954). But Archie always was---bantering with Duffy's man-crazy daughter, Miss Duffy (played by several actresses, beginning with Gardner's real-life first wife, Shirley Booth); with Eddie, the waiter/janitor (Eddie Green); and, especially, with Clifton Finnegan (Charlie Cantor), a likeable soul with several screws loose and a knack for falling for every other salesman's scam.</description>

Dragnet debuted inauspiciously. The first several months were bumpy, as Webb and company worked out the program&#8217;s format and eventually became comfortable with their characters. Gradually, Friday&#8217;s deadpan, fast-talking persona emerged, described by John Dunning as &quot;a cop's cop, tough but not hard, conservative but caring.&quot; (Dunning, 210) Friday&#8217;s first partner was Sgt. Ben Romero, portrayed by Barton Yarborough, a longtime radio actor. When Dragnet hit its stride, it became one of radio&#8217;s top-rated shows.

Webb insisted on realism in every aspect of the show. The dialogue was clipped, understated and sparse, influenced by the hard boiled school of crime fiction. Scripts were fast moving but didn&#8217;t seem rushed. Every aspect of police work was chronicled, step by step: From patrols and paperwork, to crime scene investigation, lab work and questioning witnesses or suspects. The detectives&#8217; personal lives were mentioned, but rarely took center stage. &quot;Underplaying is still acting,&quot; Webb told Time. &quot;We try to make it as real as a guy pouring a cup of coffee.&#8221; (Dunning, 209) Los Angeles police chiefs C.B. Horrall and (later) William H. Parker were credited as consultants, and many police officers were fans.</description>

Skelton was the son of a Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus clown who died shortly before he was born. Skelton himself got one of his earliest tastes of show business with the same circus as a teenager. Before that, however, he had been given the show business bug at age ten by entertainer Ed Wynn, who spotted him selling newspapers trying to help his family. After buying every newspaper in Skelton's stock, Wynn took the boy backstage and introduced him to every member of the show with which he was traveling. By age fifteen, Skelton had hit the road full-time as an entertainer, working everywhere from medicine shows and vaudeville to burlesque, showboats, minstrel shows, and circuses.

Skelton was the son of a Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus clown who died shortly before he was born. Skelton himself got one of his earliest tastes of show business with the same circus as a teenager. Before that, however, he had been given the show business bug at age ten by entertainer Ed Wynn, who spotted him selling newspapers trying to help his family. After buying every newspaper in Skelton's stock, Wynn took the boy backstage and introduced him to every member of the show with which he was traveling. By age fifteen, Skelton had hit the road full-time as an entertainer, working everywhere from medicine shows and vaudeville to burlesque, showboats, minstrel shows, and circuses.

Crime Classics was a U. S. radio docudrama which aired over CBS from June 15, 1953 to June 30, 1954. Created, produced, and directed by radio actor/director Elliott Lewis, the program was basically a historical true crime series, examining crimes, and especially murders, from the past. It grew out of Lewis's personal interest in famous murder cases, and took a documentary-like approach to the subject, carefully recreating the facts, personages, and feel of the time period. Comparatively little dramatic license was taken with the facts and events, but the tragedy was leavened with humor, expressed largely through the narration.

The crimes dramatized generally covered a broad time and place frame from ancient Greece to late 19th century America. Each episode in the series was co-written by Morton Fine and David Friedkin, in consultation with Lewis, although the scripting process was more a matter of research, as the stories were &quot;adapated from the original court reports and newspaper accounts&quot; for the most part (or from the works of historians in the case of the ancient crimes). The cases ranged from famous assassinations (of Abraham Lincoln and Julius Caesar) and the lives (and often deaths) of the likes of Cesare Borgia and Blackbeard to more obscure yet fascinating cases, such as that of Bathsheba Spooner. Spooner killed her husband Joshua Spooner in 1778 and became the first woman to be tried and executed in the United States of America.</description>

      <title>A pair of Nylons - The Green Hornet</title>

The Green Hornet was an American radio program that ran from January 31, 1936 to 1952, created by George W. Trendle, who also created The Lone Ranger, and initially starring Al Hodge as the Hornet. It was later made into a 1966-67 television program starring Van Williams as the Green Hornet and Bruce Lee as Kato.

The series detailed the adventures of Britt Reid, debonair newspaper publisher by day, crime-fighting masked hero at night, along with his trusty sidekick, Kato. Kato was a Filipino of Japanese ancestry. With the outbreak of World War II his Japanese heritage was almost completely dropped, leading to the common misperception that the character's nationality had been switched by the show's writers. (When the characters were used in a pair of movie serials Kato's nationality was inexplicably given as Korean.) Reid is a close relative of John Reid, The Lone Ranger. The character of Dan Reid, who appeared on the Lone Ranger program as the Masked Man's nephew was also featured on the Green Hornet as Britt's father.

In the original introduction of the radio show announcer Mike Wallace proclaimed that the Green Hornet went after criminals that &quot;even the G-Men (FBI agents) couldn't reach&quot;. The show's producers were called by FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover who prompted them to remove the line implying that some crime fighting was beyond the abilities of the FBI.</description>

Dick Tracy is a comic strip detective and a popular character in American pop culture. The character of Dick Tracy is a hard hitting, fast shooting, and supremely intelligent police detective who has matched wits with a variety of often grotesquely ugly villains. Dick Tracy was created by cartoonist Chester Gould in 1931 for a newspaper comic strip also entitled Dick Tracy. The strip, which made its debut appearance on October 4th, 1931, was distributed by the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. Gould wrote and drew the strip until 1977.
The popularity and success of the Dick Tracy&#8217;s comic strip spread to radio and to movie serials. Ralph Byrd first played Dick Tracy in a movie of the same name in 1937. Byrd&#8217;s career continued through a series of B-grade Tracy movies. The best known of the films is Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome, with the title's villain played by Boris Karloff</description>

According to a &quot;TV Episode List&quot; published on Gunsmoke: The Great American Western, he directed two television episodes of Gunsmoke: &quot;Panacea Sikes&quot; (April 13, 1963) and &quot;Captain Sligo&quot; (January 4, 1971) , and narrated a third-- &quot;Women for Sale&quot; (September 10 &amp; 17, 1973).</itunes:summary>

In the summer of 1947, a fantastic new domestic comedy series was begun. It featured the lives of the Nelson family, Ozzie, Harriet and their sons David and Ricky. Harriet met Ozzie when he was looking for a girl singer for his band, they married in October 1935 and had a son, David, in October 1936 and another son, Eric (Ricky), in May 1940. These two sons would later play themselves in this hugely successful show. The family were constantly entangled in the amusing situations Ozzie had caused. Once he had set his mind to something, nothing could dissuade him until disaster had run its inevitable course.

Matt Dillon was the Marshall of Dodge City, Kansas in this thirty-minute western adventure. There were over 480 episodes broadcast in the 9 years it had spanned. The opening of the show left little doubt that Dillon was the law; &#8220;Around Dodge City, and into the territory on the west, there&#8217;s just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers: that&#8217;s with a US Marshall and the smell of gunsmoke! Gunsmoke! &#8230; Starring William Conrad the story of the violence that moved west with young America, and the story of a man who moved with it. I&#8217;m that man &#8230; Matt Dillon.

The adventures of Amos 'n Andy presented the antics of Amos Jones, an Uncle Tom-like, conservative; Andy Brown, his zany business associate; Kingfish Stevens, a scheming smoothie; Lawyer Calhoun, an underhanded crook that no one trusted; Lightnin,' a slow-moving janitor; Sapphire Stevens, a nosey, loud-mouth; Mama, a domineering mother-in-law, and the infamous Madame Queen. The basis for these characters was derived largely from the stereotypic caricatures of African-Americans that had been communicated through several decades of popular American culture, most notably, motion pictures.</description>

Fibber McGee and Molly is a situation comedy radio show that was broadcast from 1935-1959 on the National Broadcasting Company, and can still be heard today on various local stations broadcasting old-time radio programs. The show was known for its vaudeville humor and Midwestern flavor. The action revolved mainly around Fibber and Molly McGee. Their friends and neighbors would visit the McGees' home and discuss events of the day, or join in on whatever the McGees were doing.

Fibber McGee and Molly was on the air from 1935-1959. It premiered on April 16, 1935 and was on the air regularly (with the exception of a year period in 1956-57) until September 6, 1959.

There were several formats to the show:

The half-hour weekly version ran from April 16, 1935 until June 30, 1953 (on Monday nights [1935-1938] and Tuesdays, where it would spend the rest of its weekly run).</description>

Abbott &amp; Costello were one of the greatest comedy teams in the history of show business. They mastered the straightman/clown relationship, creating a magical chemistry that would take them from the burlesque stage to radio to broadway to film and finally, to television Born William Alexander Abbott on October 6, 1897 in Asbury Park, N.J., Bud became one of the most sought after and polished straightmen on the burlesque circuit. It was here that he met his future partner, Louis Francis Cristillo, born on March 6, 1906 in Paterson, N.J. Their official teaming was in 1936. Although they became a popular booking commodity on the burlesque wheel, it wasn't until they appeared on the KATE SMITH RADIO HOUR, performing what would soon become known as their classic signature skit, &quot;Who's On First,&quot; that Bud Abbott &amp; Lou Costello were hurled to stardom, and to Hollywood. Signed to Universal in 1939, Abbott &amp; Costello reigned as the new &quot;Kings Of Comedy,&quot; producing a solid decade of box office hits as: &quot;Buck Privates;&quot; &quot;In The Navy;&quot; &quot;Hold That Ghost;&quot; &quot;Naughty Nineties;&quot; &quot;Time Of Their Lives;&quot; and their 1948 monster classic, &quot;Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein.&quot; Today, that film remains a favorite among fans, as well as an international cult masterpiece. Bud and Lou's style and brand of comedy helped lift the morale of the American public during World War II.</description>

Enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend, his specialty was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Faraday heading the official investigation. Boston Blackie is a rather peculiar character as he wasn't a private investigator in his original incarnation at all. It was only later, in film, radio, and eventually television, that he morphed into a private eye. In the original Boston Black story by Jack Boyle, written way back in 1919, Blackie was a hardened criminal serving time in a hellish California prison.</description>

Date with Judy was an American radio program during the 1940s. It was a teenage comedy that began as a summer replacement for Bob Hope's show, sponsored by Pepsodent and airing on NBC from June 24 to September 16, 1941, with 14-year-old Ann Gillis in the title role. Dellie Ellis portrayed Judy when the series returned the next summer (June 23&#8211;September 15, 1942). Louise Erickson took over the role the following summer (June 30&#8211;September 22, 1943) when the series, sponsored by Bristol Myers, replaced The Eddie Cantor Show.

Louise Erickson continued as Judy for the next seven years, as the series, sponsored by Tums, aired from January 18, 1944 to January 4, 1949. As the popularity of the radio series peaked, Jane Powell starred as Judy in the MGM movie, A Date with Judy (1948). Co-starring with Powell were Elizabeth Taylor, Wallace Beery, Robert Stack, and Carmen Miranda.

Ford Motors and Revere Cameras were the sponsors for the final season of the radio series on ABC from October 13, 1949 to May 25, 1950.</description>

Beautiful, young Elinor Carlisle stands serenely in the dock accused of the murder of Mary Gerrard, her rival in love. The evidence is damning: only Elinor had the motive, the opportunity and the means to administer the fatal poison. Yet, inside the hostile courtroom, one man still presumes Elinor is innocent until proven guilty; Hercule Poirot is all that stands between Elinor and the gallows...

      <title>Adventures of Babe Ruth  1939  04-16</title>

George Herman Ruth, better known as Babe Ruth, was the greatest sporting hero of his day. Seventy years later it is difficult to comprehend just what a legend The Babe was. Adventures of Babe Ruth are short fictional tales of the life of the great baseball player. They border on being modern day fables, each one with a simple yet important message to put across to the audience. Despite the simple plots and sugar-sweet story lines they are still most enjoyable to listen to and the sound quality is (on the whole) excellent considering their age.</description>

      <title>School`s Out (1930) - Spanky &amp;amp; our Gang</title>

The original theatrical film shorts released from 1922 - 1944
     were titled &quot;Hal Roach's Rascals&quot;; another name Roach tried 
     during the silent years from 1922 - 1928 was &quot;The Terrible Ten&quot;;

     But since the first short was titled &quot;Our Gang&quot;, the public 
     began to refer to them as &quot;'Our Gang' Comedies&quot;; so Roach
     finally adopted that name for this series of shorts; and by
     the sound era (circa 1928) &quot;Our Gang&quot; was the official name;
     The first Little Rascals &quot;talkie&quot; was &quot;Schools Out&quot; (1928);

     Quite a few child actors were used for years until they
     began to get too old, at which time they were unceremoniously
     replaced by a fresh face; Several TV actors got their start
     working in this series including Jackie Cooper (1929-1931),
     Robert Blake known as &quot;Mickie&quot; (1939-1944) and West-coast  
     local TV children's show host Johnny Downs (1925 - 1927)</description>

This show, like the later CBS Radio Mystery Theatre, was produced by Himan Brown. Well known for its creaking door opening, and the humorous voice of Raymond portrayed initially by Raymond Edward Johnson. Brown was quoted as saying to an assistant, &quot;I'm gonna make that door a star.&quot; Soundman Terry Ross once told a story that the squeak was obtained by burying hinges in dirt then watering the dirt. After a couple of weeks, the hinges were dug up nice and rusty. No sooner had they set the door up with a great squeak than a setup boy indicated he had oiled the hinges to fix the squeak.</description>

# There were 413 radio stories, broadcast 480 times.
# From an e-mail from Mrs. Howard Culver (Howie, the Dodge House clerk from the TV series)

    Yes, Howard was one of several who did auditions for the radio Gunsmoke, and he was chosen from the recordings with unnamed applicants to play Marshall Dillon. He cut a record (Matt Dillon was known as Mark Dillon in it), but since Howard was playing the lead in &quot;Straight Arrow&quot; on Mutual Network, his contract with Mutual would not let him play the lead in the Gunsmoke show. Thence it was given to William Conrad.

Freeman Gosden and Charles Correl starred as Amos Jones and Andrew H. Brown. Starting in 1926 and 1927 as the &quot;Sam 'n' Henry&quot; show, then renamed in 1928 as Amos 'n' Andy, they went on to incredible success and popularity. During the Great Depression, their audiences reached epic proportions in part due to their common, average Joe approach.</description>

      <title>George Burns &amp;amp; Gracie Allen</title>

It's uniqueness makes it a hard one to describe. Basically, Gracie would goof up and try to hide her mistake from her husband. Her way of hiding it would be so easy to &quot;see through&quot; but she'd be sure that he wouldn't find out. Also, she would misunderstand things others told her and then assume it was they who didn't understand. Then she'd proceed to explain things to them. For example, someone might say that their doctor had to close his practice due to a lack of patients. Gracie would say that they should learn to control their anger (lack of patience). Then the person might say, &quot;No, I mean they don't have enough people coming to see them for medical attention&quot;. Gracie would then say, &quot;Well, of course, if you always get mad at them, they'll go to another doctor&quot;. And it would go &quot;on and on&quot; like that until the person would give up and Gracie would be satisfied that she had explained it to them adequately.

This rare 1938 piece allowed listeners to track the movement of the Flying Clipper as it moved around the world during the broadcasts.

      <itunes:summary>From badges to maps to cards to photos to code books - and even a newspaper - many of these pieces are excellent examples of radio-toy tie-ins - particularly the &#8220;Speed Gibson's Great Clue Hunt&#8221; Paper Sheet. This rare 1938 piece allowed listeners to track the movement of the Flying Clipper as it moved around the world during the broadcasts. And interestingly, all the memorabilia relating to Speed Gibson's adventures (except for one lone cereal-sponsored premium) were bread related - with sponsors running the gamut from Peter Pan Bread to Brown's Bread Ltd. to Dreikorn's Bread.

Each show began with Skelton performing a monologue based on topical material, followed by a musical interlude. He would then perform in a series of blackout sketches featuring one or more of his characters. The sketches were a mixture of new material and old routines (including his popular &quot;Guzzler's Gin&quot;) perfected over the years in vaudeville and in nightclubs. At the end of the program, Skelton would become serious and express his gratitude to his audience for their love and laughter. His signature closing line became &quot;Good night and may God bless.&quot;</description>

Cohan: more than any other recording artist of the early industry, Murray was the primary interpreter of the now-famous songs of Cohan, the original &quot;Yankee Doodle Boy.&quot;</description>

      <itunes:summary> The songs that Billy Murray popularized are classic American tunes, from &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis&quot; to &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway,&quot; and from &quot;Harrigan&quot; to &quot;K-K-K-Katy (Stammering Song).&quot; You'll notice that a number of the songs were composed by George M. Cohan: more than any other recording artist of the early industry, Murray was the primary interpreter of the now-famous songs of Cohan, the original &quot;Yankee Doodle Boy.&quot;</itunes:summary>

      <description>Bruce Eells Associates produced this 15-minute series that was then an early syndication, via Broadcasters Program Syndicate/Bruce Eells and Associates syndication. As was usual then, music filled the first part of the show, so that the local station announcer could do a commercial or two. So the writer and actors were left with a 12 1/2-minute mystery.

&quot;The IOU Murder&quot; spins the tale of a mansion murder in which the shot is not suicide. &quot;Paid in Full&quot; is a plot twister in which the guilty is known, but can't be pinned with the crime. In the &quot;Stolen Brain&quot; a professor's body has been has &quot;gone missing&quot; and the brain is held for $35,000 ransom. That's a lot of money even today for a mass of &quot;little grey cells.&quot; In another, Mrs. North is found bound and gagged by a dead man in her bedroom. A woman is pushed out from a speeding roadster owned by an Italian with an airtight alibi, but the dead dame has twin brothers who swear vengeance on him anyway. An overdose of cocaine kills a recluse who hasn't left his room in 20 years. A crook cashes a check from a Count who may be a no-count. A boxer is permanently KO'd after a big fight, but the cops finger one of three men taking a shower as the killer. Pretty aggressive stuff for 1932!

In 1941 they found a permanent spot providing music for Red Skelton's program, a position that foundered when Skelton was drafted in 1944. In that year, the energetic Ozzie Nelson proposed a show of his own to network CBS and sponsor International Silver--a show in which the Nelsons would play themselves. Early in its run, the radio Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet jettisoned music for situation comedy. Ozzie Nelson himself directed and co-wrote all the episodes, as he would most of the video shows.</description>

The group appeared on various shows on radio, including the Andrews Sisters' Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch in '44-'45, and the Roy Rogers Show during the 1946 - 48 period. Western swing was big in those days, and this show has some really fine renditions in that great American music style.</description>

      <title>Lum&amp;amp;Abner</title>

Chet was born on February 2, 1902 in Aleene, Arkansas and Norris was born in Cove, Arkansas on May 30, 1906. Both had moved to Mena with their families by 1911. They lived only a few blocks apart and grew up together. They were both very talented comedians and by 1931 had become local &quot;Amos and Andy&quot; imitators. They were scheduled to perform on a local charity program in Hot Springs, Arkansas on April 26, 1931. At the last minute they decided to appear as two old-time Arkansas philosophers with the names &quot;Lum Eddards&quot; and &quot;Abner Peabody&quot;. Thus was formed a team that was to delight radio audiences for the next 25 years. Just three months later on July 27, 1931 &quot;Lum &amp; Abner&quot; made its' national radio debut on the NBC radio network from Chicago with the Quaker Oats Company as their first sponsor. This was to continue, with different sponsors and networks, for nearly 25 years. They also performed their routines on vaudeville stages throughout the country. By 1933 they had introduced the &quot;Jot &quot;Em Down Store&quot; to their audiences and this would become the focal point of most of the programs. By 1940, Chet and Norris were on their way to Hollywood to make the first of seven motion pictures. In 1948 the radio format was changed from a 15-minute show to a thirty minute program. The new shows used special guest stars, a live orchestra, and a studio audience. This was quite a change from the original shows and was not as well received by the listening audience. By 1953 television was the new rage in America. Chet and Norris considered trying the new medium and a pilot show was taped. However, Norris' health problems were just too much to allow him to stand rigors of performing on early tv. So Chet and Norris decided to retire those &quot;two loveable old characters from Pine Ridge&quot;. Another era of the golden age of radio came to an end. They had performed over 5,000 live radio programs and entertained countless millions of fans. For the next ten years or so Chet and Norris each made several appearances on various tv programs but never again revived the Lum &amp; Abner show. Norris &quot;Tuffy&quot; Goff (Abner) passed away on June 12, 1978 and Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Lauck (Lum) joined him on February 21, 1980. Gone but definitely NOT forgotten!</description>

      <itunes:summary>Chet Lauck and Norris Goff were the creators of Lum &amp; Abner. Chet was born on February 2, 1902 in Aleene, Arkansas and Norris was born in Cove, Arkansas on May 30, 1906. Both had moved to Mena with their families by 1911. They lived only a few blocks apart and grew up together. They were both very talented comedians and by 1931 had become local &quot;Amos and Andy&quot; imitators. They were scheduled to perform on a local charity program in Hot Springs, Arkansas on April 26, 1931. At the last minute they decided to appear as two old-time Arkansas philosophers with the names &quot;Lum Eddards&quot; and &quot;Abner Peabody&quot;. Thus was formed a team that was to delight radio audiences for the next 25 years. Just three months later on July 27, 1931 &quot;Lum &amp; Abner&quot; made its' national radio debut on the NBC radio network from Chicago with the Quaker Oats Company as their first sponsor. This was to continue, with different sponsors and networks, for nearly 25 years. They also performed their routines on vaudeville stages throughout the country. By 1933 they had introduced the &quot;Jot &quot;Em Down Store&quot; to their audiences and this would become the focal point of most of the programs. By 1940, Chet and Norris were on their way to Hollywood to make the first of seven motion pictures. In 1948 the radio format was changed from a 15-minute show to a thirty minute program. The new shows used special guest stars, a live orchestra, and a studio audience. This was quite a change from the original shows and was not as well received by the listening audience. By 1953 television was the new rage in America. Chet and Norris considered trying the new medium and a pilot show was taped. However, Norris' health problems were just too much to allow him to stand rigors of performing on early tv. So Chet and Norris decided to retire those &quot;two loveable old characters from Pine Ridge&quot;. Another era of the golden age of radio came to an end. They had performed over 5,000 live radio programs and entertained countless millions of fans. For the next ten years or so Chet and Norris each made several appearances on various tv programs but never again revived the Lum &amp; Abner show. Norris &quot;Tuffy&quot; Goff (Abner) passed away on June 12, 1978 and Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Lauck (Lum) joined him on February 21, 1980. Gone but definitely NOT forgotten!</itunes:summary>

Ruth Cornwall Woodman was asked to write the show in 1930. Though she knew nothing of the desert and its people, New York Vassar graduate Ruth undertook the project with enthusiasm. When the show began in 1930, many of the areas she was writing about were still quite rough in nature, with many roads but mostly mere trails. Each year Ruth would spend several months traveling through the desert to explore ghosttowns, saloons, backpacking just outside Death Valley, and interviewing old timers. She would talk to gas station men, bartenders, and small town newspapermen. She did her research well, pouring over old newspapers and visiting old west museums, scouring the west for anything that would inspire a good story. The result of all this hard work was rewarding - a highly successful show that lasted over two decades, and later became a television show with Ronald Regan as the host. Death Valley Days presents stories of the old west, with realism and drama virtually unmatched by other westerns of the day.</description>

It is considered to be one of the first popular radio comedies based on the lives of a working-class Jewish family. Gertrude Berg wrote The Goldbergs, as a loosely based autobiography on her life as a wife and mother in New York. To gain insight into the tribulations of her characters Berg researched incognito in the Bronx among the tenements and poor conditions of family in poverty. In 1951, The Goldbergs became a feature film with the production of Molly.</description>

Comprised mostly of authentic footage from the battle, it is dramatically narrated by Henry Fonda. &quot;Behind every cloud, there may be an enemy,&quot; he intones as American fighter pilots search the sky. The rest of the film mocks Emporer Tojo of Japan and portrays him as ruthless, bombing hospitals and churches as he tries to conquer the Pacific.

It was hailed from the start by critics and whole neighborhoods of working-class listeners alike&#8230;a duo that doesn't often see eye-to-eye!

Duffy's Tavern was a place on Third Avenue and 23rd St. in New York City, where the &quot;elite meet to eat, Duffy ain't here, Archie the Manager speakin'&#8230;&quot; Anyone who loved old time radio probably knows that phone patter by heart! Ed Gardner played Archie, the manager of Duffy's Tavern, and he was as &quot;real&quot; sounding as any character on radio, as he had grown up in the Big Apple. His use and abuse of language was &quot;exempulary&quot; - the same type of local &quot;parlese&quot; that made The Damon Runyan Theater a favorite with New Yorkers everywhere. Gardner was a theatrical veteran, whose wife, Shirley Booth, well-known stage and screen actress, began on the show with him.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Duffy's Tavern was first heard in 1940 and became a regular feature. It was hailed from the start by critics and whole neighborhoods of working-class listeners alike&#8230;a duo that doesn't often see eye-to-eye!

Duffy's Tavern was a place on Third Avenue and 23rd St. in New York City, where the &quot;elite meet to eat, Duffy ain't here, Archie the Manager speakin'&#8230;&quot; Anyone who loved old time radio probably knows that phone patter by heart! Ed Gardner played Archie, the manager of Duffy's Tavern, and he was as &quot;real&quot; sounding as any character on radio, as he had grown up in the Big Apple. His use and abuse of language was &quot;exempulary&quot; - the same type of local &quot;parlese&quot; that made The Damon Runyan Theater a favorite with New Yorkers everywhere. Gardner was a theatrical veteran, whose wife, Shirley Booth, well-known stage and screen actress, began on the show with him.</itunes:summary>

Created by Robert M. Burtt and Willfred G. Moore, the creators of The Air Adventures of Jimmie Allen, the series was sponsored by the Skelly Oil Company. In the beginning, &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; was simply an undercover name for Jim &quot;Red&quot; Albright, who regularly piloted cargo and passengers. As an undercover agent, Albright was trying to gather information on a gang of criminals. However, by the end of the first run, ending in a summer hiatus, the Captain Midnight persona was beginning to stick and many knew him only by that name. Captain Midnight was constantly trying to stop the plans of the evil Ivan Shark and his daughter Fury. Shark remained as Midnight's evil nemesis throughout the length of the radio run. Captain Midnight was helped in his efforts by Chuck Ramsey and Patsy Donovan (later, Joyce Ryan) who were members of his Secret Squadron. In the national versions, there was also Ichabod Mudd, Midnight's mechanic. There were a number of different actors playing the various roles over the long run. The series grew in popularity and was broadcast over the Mutual Network beginning in 1940 sponsored by Ovaltine.</description>

After all, it was free, it didn't require going out, and a much broader array of show formats was available, most of which did not require the time commitment of the audience that movies required. This boom in popularity saw a scramble to secure available talent for radio shows, and big-name Hollywood movie personalities were a prime target. As luck would have it, the Marx Brothers were on the downhill side of their cinematic careers and were looking to branch out into other areas. Groucho especially sought out radio, which gave him opportunity to exercise his natural wit. Chico pursued a career as a band leader, which landed him occasional air time, as the broadcasting of big band music was a popular use of the airwaves. For obvious reasons, Harpo was at a handicap in this medium, but still found an occasional guest spot. I have attempted here to document several radio appearances by each of the three brothers; however, as record keeping was not viewed as a necessity in this field back then, there is no attempt to present this as a complete list. Particularly difficult to trace to a specific date are Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) broadcasts* of Command Performance, G.I. Journal, and Mail Call broadcasts, which were often recorded on disc only for distribution to military bases, and whose broadcast dates and times varied at each locale.&quot; </description>

      The films and radio series were based upon a character created in

      based on the life of Honolulu police detective named Chang Apana.

It looks like a job for Superman...only how can Superman stop the source of these artificially induced earthquakes and still save Lois, now trapped in our villain's underwater lair which has begun filling with water due to Superman attempts to stop the earthquake device!

Here we have yet another fast-paced, exciting storyline. The underwater lair and its mechanical devices have a decidedly futuristic look and make for some arresting visuals, although one does wonder why our scientific genius/lead villain travels via a rather ordinary speedboat? </description>

And an additional irony is that the series was a comedy, a genre that most people think of as harmless. The series began as Sam n' Henry, but was later changed to Amos n' Andy. What gives the series its &quot;off limits&quot; tag is that the two characters are based on the minstrel blackface comedians that were so prevelant in Vaudeville.</description>

The new series was developed by DC's press agent Allen Ducovny and Robert Joffe Maxwell, a former pulp fiction author who had been assigned the job of licensing the subsidiary merchandising rights to DC's popular comic book character for toys and commercial products. The duo was quick to realize that the vast radio audience could be used to extend Superman's popularity.

In 1939, Maxwell and Ducovny prepared several sample audition disks to sell the idea to prospective sponsors and co-wrote the first version of Superman's famous opening signature.

&quot;We had a lot of fun writing that opening,&quot; Ducovny recalls, &quot;It was a typical radio action piece that fully utilized sound effects.&quot;

They mastered the straightman/clown relationship, creating a magical chemistry that would take them from the burlesque stage to radio to broadway to film and finally, to television Born William Alexander Abbott on October 6, 1897 in Asbury Park, N.J., Bud became one of the most sought after and polished straightmen on the burlesque circuit. It was here that he met his future partner, Louis Francis Cristillo, born on March 6, 1906 in Paterson, N.J. Their official teaming was in 1936.

Signed to Universal in 1939, Abbott &amp; Costello reigned as the new &quot;Kings Of Comedy,&quot; producing a solid decade of box office hits as: &quot;Buck Privates;&quot; &quot;In The Navy;&quot; &quot;Hold That Ghost;&quot; &quot;Naughty Nineties;&quot; &quot;Time Of Their Lives;&quot; and their 1948 monster classic, &quot;Abbott &amp;  Costello Meet Frankenstein.&quot; Today, that film remains a favorite among fans, as well as an international cult masterpiece. Bud and Lou's style and brand of comedy helped lift the morale of the American public during World War II. Eager to lend their time to the war effort, the boys funded (out-of-pocket) a cross-country tour to help raise much needed funds on behalf of the War Bond Drive. Everywhere they appeared there were sell-out audiences.

The dramas chosen, according to NBC, were because they were considered &#8220;good drama&#8221; regardless of the name of the author, the fame of the play, etc. In many instances, original radio plays were used on the series. Director of production and author of some of the original radio plays was Harry W. Junkin. The cast varied according to the script needs but New York radio actors and actresses were used, some of them experienced and others chosen from the best in radio acting newcomers. The overall production for the series was under the supervision of Richard McDonagh, NBC Script Manager. Musical bridges were by Roy Shields and his Orchestra. The announcer was Robert Warren.

                   Writer: Ernest Kinoy.

                        A comedy about two ever-loving &#8220;mamas&#8221; who are determined their son and daughter should wed each other.

The capstan drive belts were also replaced and the turntable drive wheel was re-rubbered This cute unit built in 1952 received a new cartridge and needle.This Admiral has a strong AM radio and a 3 speed record changer which plays 78, 33, and 45 RPM records.It is in almost perfect condition save for cracks in the front clear radio dial bezel.I think it probably sounds as good as when it was new.</description>

They are smart enough to use this to their advantage, and get in and out of trouble at the drop of a sombrero. They had trusty steeds that any young cowhand could name - for Cisco, it was Diablo, and Pancho rode Loco. And often, the pair seemed like a couple of crazy devils themselves. Pancho is one of the best sidekicks in Western  as he is always rattling on with a sense of humor that is as wide as his belly. He's a lover of the food, while Cisco is obviously a handsome, dashing hero who has an eye for a shady &quot;varmint&quot;, or the fair lady in distress that usually thanks him at the end of the episode. From '42 to '45, Jackson Beck played Cisco Kid, and Louis Sorin handled Pancho. Mutual-Don Lee productions took over in '46, and Jack Mather became Cisco, and Harry Lang played Pancho. They continued in the roles until the show's end in '56.</description>

For months helpless citizens have been robbed, beaten senseless and kidnapped. The criminal is a twisted genius with cunning. It's up to Detective Sergeant Joe Friday to get him.

The listening audience was estimated at 40 million, almost one-third of Americans living at that time. The story was of Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll playing Amos and Andy as black men from Harlem who owned the Fresh Air Taxi Company, so called because its only cab had no windshield. Amos and Andy were the commonest of common men: they symbolized the poor Joe with no money, no job and no future. It was the first significant serial utilizing the elements of sympathetic characters, comedy and suspense.

In essence, the series was one of a slew of middle-class family sitcoms in which moms were moms, kids were kids, and fathers knew best.

      <itunes:summary>Father Knows Best, a family comedy of the 1950s, is perhaps more important for what it has come to represent than for what it actually was. In essence, the series was one of a slew of middle-class family sitcoms in which moms were moms, kids were kids, and fathers knew best. Today, many critics view it, at best, as high camp fun, and, at worst, as part of what critic David Marc once labeled the &quot;Aryan melodramas&quot; of the 1950s and 1960s.</itunes:summary>

Arguably the most consistently inventive of all the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Rocketeers doesn't let up for a second, from a telescope that wants to rebel and an octopus band next to fishing skeletons.

Certainly not a children's cartoon, while it begins with the duo wanting to travel in space, it ends with them after far more libidinous pursuits. As the entire townsfolk jump in the sea in the hope of some mermaid... er, tail?... it must also be acknowledged the homo-erotic segment where T &amp; J get so close they're literally singing with the same mouth. On the same lines, the Mae West caricature (a mandatory inclusion for cartoons of the period, it seems) also talks in a man's voice.

His strange, humorous, and often supernatural adventures take him all over the world, and place him in conflict with enemies such as the Sea Hag and King Blozo of Brutopia.</description>
