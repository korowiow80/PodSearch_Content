                  <title>Redeye - Co-op Radio: Canada&#039;s record on legislating strikers back to work, Segment 1</title>
                  <link>http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/59373</link>
                  <description>Canada&#039;s governments are among the worst offenders when it comes to legislating striking workers back to work. Since 1982 more complaints have been made against Canada at the level of International Labour Organization than any other country in the world. Workers in Newfoundland and Labrador have strongly resisted back-to-work legislation in their province.  Hans Rollman tells us about a couple of creative strategies unions there used to fight this tactic.  Hans Rollman is a reporter, columnist and opinions editor for the Newfoundland and Labrador-based website theindependent.ca.</description>

                  <description>In 2010 a U.S. Supreme Court decision rolled back legal restrictions on corporate spending on the grounds that political speech by a business entity could receive the same First Amendment protections that people do. But the notion that corporations are people is under attack.  Joel Bakan wrote the essay Psychopaths Inc which challenges the idea of corporate personhood. It appears in the new Occupy Handbook, a new book published in April 2012. Joel Bakan is a professor of law at the University of British Columbia.

                  <description>Uranium has been mined in Saskatchewan since the 1930s. Provincial premiers from Tommy Douglas to Brad Wall have exploited its use as a raw material for nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Public opposition to uranium development has led the government to use the University of Saskatchewan as a fig leaf. D&#039;Arcy Hande is a retired archivist and environmental activist. </description>

                  <description>The two remaining asbestos mines in Quebec have been shut down since last fall. A Canadian investor is trying to raise $25 million to re-open it. Meanwhile activists are working equally hard to keep the mine closed - and to finally put an end to Canada&#039;s export of this deadly mineral.
