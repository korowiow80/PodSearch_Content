      <itunes:subtitle>Howard Wong, Nationalist Chinese Air Force Brat.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Recently I had lunch with 76 year old Howard Wong, an Air Force brat.  But not the US Air Force...the Chinese Air Force!  Howard's father was a general in the Chinese Air Force and worked with the Flying Tigers in World War II.  Howard shares some of his own memories of living in Hong Kong and Chengdu China, and we find out how he answers the question "where are you from?"</itunes:summary>
      <description>Howard Wong was born in Guangzhou, China, in the late 1920s.  His father was Lieutenant General Huang Guang Rui of the Nationalist Chinese Air Force.  Lt. General Huang Guang Rui served under Sun Zhongshan (Sun Yat-sen), and later under Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek).  During China's war against the Japanese invaders in the 1930s and 40s, Howard moved around China with his father, mother, and siblings.  He lived in Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Hong Kong.  His father had good relationships with General James Doolittle and General George C. Marshall.  Howard later emigrated to the United States in the late 1940s where he has been ever since.</description>
