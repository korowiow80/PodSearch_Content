<p>(introlude) Kubota Toshinobu &#8211; Ichizu na Yoru, Mukizu na Asa</p>
<p>FatKidsBrotha &#8211; NWA ft Snubnose Frankenstein. I had this on repeat for a really long time. This whole tape is good &#8211; check them out <a href = "http://fatkidsbrotha.bandcamp.com/">on bandcamp</a>.</p>
<p>A$AP Rocky &#8211; Been Around The World (Chopped and Screwed). From an older mixtape. This is a really mean song. </p>
<p>S.L.A.C.K. &#8211; Hatsugen On Skit ft Rau Def. You&#8217;ve heard S.L.A.C.K. here before, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve played any Rau Def. I really like what both of these dudes are doing, but Rau Def right now especially is on some wildness. Over the summer he started attacking Zeebra (sort of a living legend in Japanese rap) for absolutely no reason. It was pretty funny.<br />
no twitter for S.L.A.C.K. Rau is <a href="http://twitter.com/xxxRAUDEFxxx">@xxxRAUDEFxxx</a></p>
<p>FatKidsBrotha &#8211; Queso ft Key! and Snubnose Frankenstein. Just stop what you&#8217;re doing now and get their tape.</p>
<p>Gucci Mane &#8211; Stupid (ahnnu remix). HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA. swag.<br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/ahnnu">@ahnnu</a></p>
<p>Ham-R &#8211; Workinonit Remix. I have a lot of respect for this dude. This is off a tape he put out in 2010, which was the hands-down most forward thinking mixtape in Japanese rap that year. He&#8217;s supposed to be putting together an album right now.<br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/hammerdahustler">@hammerdahustler</a></p>
<p>Curtis Williams &#8211; This Her Jam ft MoneyMakinNique and Alkebulan. This is a pretty cool mixtape all around, but this track just kills. Also, the tape is called Trill Shit Only, which is worth a lot of points.<br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/thatboycurtis">@thatboycurtis</a></p>
<p>and that&#8217;s it for this one. and yeah, i&#8217;m on twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/dexdigi">@dexdigi</a></p>

<p>The backstory &#8211; some time in late 2006, I got a bizarre email from a group calling themselves the Wurd Munchaz, with a link to their myspace. At first I thought it was just another low-budget demo, but then I listened to the cuts, and my mind was blown.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know hardly anything about these dudes. They don&#8217;t answer their email, nobody seems to know anything about them. Every few months, though, a poorly spelled, all-caps email comes in from their producer, Copy Payper, with an mp3. </p>
<p>And out of nowhere, the other day I get this TTDD remix in the mail. I can&#8217;t find it online, they seem to have abandoned their myspace. I really know very little about these dudes &#8211; I don&#8217;t even know how many people are in their group &#8211; but real talk, they&#8217;ve been my favorite group for like 4 years now.</p>
<p>okay whatever this is getting long, let&#8217;s just get into the playlist.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">TTDD &#8211; Love In Da Mall (Wurd Munchaz Remix)</span>. I&#8217;m 100% sure that this isn&#8217;t official, but it still goes. Oddly enough, the production on this actually sounds a little more &#8216;normal&#8217; than the original. If, you know, you can ignore Copy Payper screaming over the top.</p>
<p>I guess <a href="http://twitter.com/fucktyler">@fucktyler</a> is as good a contact for TTDD as any.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Graaeetest Gurrruuop</span>. No, not a typo. That&#8217;s how they spelled &#8220;greatest group&#8221;. The chorus, if you can call it that, since it&#8217;s at the end, is great.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Shoht B Get That Muneee</span>. Do not sleep on Shoht B. If you don&#8217;t pay attention, you miss things, like how he nonchalantly drops a reference to the Busy World of Richard Scarry in the middle of his first few bars. Frodo&#8217;s verse, though, is seriously insane. He actually starts threatening the Girl Scouts.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Tell Me About You Jeans Remix</span>. Yes, there is an original to this, which I can&#8217;t seem to find, but this one is better, and a little more schizophrenic (listen to the lyrics. the singers are actually contradicting one another). Also, Little Leroy calls out T-Pain. This one is also a lot more complex musically &#8211; that sounds like actual violin by Devron, plus an absolutely epic guitar solo by Copy Payper. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Red Monkey Jeans</span>. Early stuff. This is actually the track that introduced me to Wurd Munchaz. It&#8217;s pretty rough &#8211; I think they&#8217;re using an Archos or something to record this because you can hear the mic clicking in between verses. The gunshots, overtalk, and screams are enough (actually all of their stuff used to be full of gunshots and eagle shrieks), but come on. &#8220;I do my aerobics on my shoulder&#8221;? Telling us about how he brings ten pairs of jeans to the mall? Shoht B is a beast. </p>
<p>Also, <em>this song is about pants</em>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Cowboy Test</span>. I don&#8217;t understand the title, but this is sort of an odd song &#8211; the first verse is actually Copy Payper doing a rehash of Shoht B&#8217;s verse on You Got Beef, along with some other old lines from other cuts. I don&#8217;t know what album this one was intended for, or when it was recorded.</p>
<p>so, again. I can&#8217;t really provide much information, because I don&#8217;t have any. If you&#8217;re looking for more, there&#8217;s some on Grooveshark, and you can look at their <a href="http://myspace.com/wurdmunchaz">myspace</a>, which hasn&#8217;t been updated for a long time. But yeah, swag them out or whatever.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t really write much now. I recorded this last night. I am not in Japan now so I&#8217;m obviously safe, and the friends I&#8217;ve been able to get ahold of are all safe, but I&#8217;m still pretty upset &#8211; so no track breakdown.</p>
<p>The intro probably doesn&#8217;t make any sense, sorry. Things are going to be hard for a while, but I figured the very least I could do was post some swagged out cuts to keep people thinking about my friends.</p>

<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Jet Age of Tomorrow</strong> &#8211; Welcome Home, Son (feat<strong> Casey Veggies </strong>and <strong>Tyler, the Creator</strong>)</span>.

<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Droop-E </strong>- [I AM]. Sure, dubstep if you want to call it that. Either way this song goes really hard. <a href = "http://twitter.com/droope707"><a href="http://twitter.com/droope707">@droope707</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Gucci Mane</strong> &#8211; Photo Shoot (Flying Lotus remix)</span>. Seriously, what is Gucci doing in the intro?<br />

Louis Bordeaux &#8211; Say The Word Again Bitch (<a href = "http://twitter.com/louisbordeaux"><a href="http://twitter.com/louisbordeaux">@louisbordeaux</a></a>)</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Hir-O</strong> &#8211; Welcome Back Hir-O</span>. He&#8217;s got an instrumental album out, which you should absolutely <a href="http://hir-o.bandcamp.com/album/the-voyage-home-instrumental-album">go get</a>. He&#8217;s apparently going to be at SXSW in some capacity, so if you&#8217;re going, go there, find him, and thank him. <a href = "http://twitter.com/hirobeats"><a href="http://twitter.com/hirobeats">@hirobeats</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Suhburb</strong> &#8211; This is 96</span>. Five points if you can guess what inspired this cut. Hint: he gave me this song like three years ago.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Suhburb</strong> + <strong>Donwill</strong> &#8211; Take it from me (remix)</span>. More Suhburb. I hear he&#8217;s making beats again. He still doesn&#8217;t have a facebook or twitter though.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this installment. holler.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow135.mp3">MIXTAPE 135 &#8211; SLAB ME OUT</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>okay, so you know how much I like all of you? I like all of you so much that I am in the goddamn library mixing this episode down right now. The library. I&#8217;m supposed to be doing homework now, but no &#8211; I&#8217;m here with my laptop and my Korg nanokontrol and I can&#8217;t even take a bathroom break because I&#8217;m afraid someone might steal my equipment.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&#8217;m not writing long breakdowns here.</p>
<p>So here are the takeaway points for this episode:<br />
1. I wanted to slab out some indiekid music, because:<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. I don&#8217;t want any of my caucasian listeners to feel left out and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. I actually like a lot of indiekid music<br />
2. As I said last time, Odd Future is seriously my favorite group/collective right now. Also,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. I have been saying &#8220;swag&#8221; and &#8220;swagged out&#8221; recently<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The title of this jawn is obviously a reference to that<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Seriously if you dislike my show but like rap, just go listen to OF for a few months, you won&#8217;t miss anything<br />
3. Please keep sending me mail. I love that stuff. Even if you hate what I&#8217;m doing, that&#8217;s totally fine; tell me. Requests/concepts are also great. You should also hit me on twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/dexdigi"><a href="http://twitter.com/dexdigi">@dexdigi</a></a>.</p>
<p>okay, lets get into it.</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">introlude: <a href="http://www.dubcat.net/">dubcat</a> &#8211;  mario</span>. Kid needs better titles.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>OFWGKTA</strong> &#8211; Up (Screwed and Chopped remix)</span>. This one sort of inspired the whole episode. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite">overlay interlude &#8211; video message</span> from <a href="http://twitter.com/mamikonu"><a href="http://twitter.com/mamikonu">@mamikonu</a></a>. everybody get your eyes checked.<br />
<span class = "hilite"><strong>Sweet Trip</strong> &#8211; Acting</span>. Off of You Will Never Know Why, which came out in 2009. Anyone that used to listen to my radio show in like 05 will remember that I played their old velocity::design::comfort record pretty much all the time. The new one is good, the older one I think is a little more mind blowing, but I recommend both.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Maps of Norway</strong> &#8211; Holland Tunnel</span>. I think someone at my radio station put me onto this. I&#8217;m also pretty sure that none of these people are from either Norway nor Holland, which is sort of confusing but okay I guess.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Whitest Boy Alive</strong> &#8211; Burning</span>. These guys make pretty good music videos. The band name is also pretty good. They&#8217;re from Berlin, which is really confusing in the context of the last song, because Norway and Holland and Berlin are all basically the same place, but it&#8217;s not technically ingenuine since I think all of them are white, so at least they are being partially honest, if a little boastful.</p>
<p>interlude: <strong>Yo Gotti</strong> Interlude</span>. Digitally enhanced by me. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/officialyogotti"><a href="http://twitter.com/officialyogotti">@officialyogotti</a></a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Ohmega Watts</strong> &#8211; Interlude 1: Journey</span>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Big K.R.I.T.</strong> &#8211; Small as a Giant</span>. I actually like this dude a lot. Dude being where he is from I&#8217;m pretty sure someone has actually done a better job slowing this one out, but whatever I did it myself. <a href="http://twitter.com/bigkrit"><a href="http://twitter.com/bigkrit">@bigkrit</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Wiley</strong> &#8211; Off The Radar</span>. Come on, this song is great. He spends a good three minutes ending every goddamn line with the words &#8220;black one&#8221;. This is one of those songs where slowing it down is actually useful, because it makes you realize how stupid intricate the wordplay is. Memorable lines: &#8220;Black men ain&#8217;t meant to have black cards, bentleys &#8211; <em>got them anyway</em>&#8220;.  Jesus. &#8220;Black, black, black. I&#8217;m so black I could make a rat run&#8221;. Come on, man. Also, read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/jul/09/wiley-great-grime-giveaway">this</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Casey Veggies</strong> &#8211; Networking</span>. I think a lot of people are really paying attention to Tyler, but seriously, the entire OF, and a lot of people associated with them make, and have been making, a lot of really swagged out songs for a really long time now. Mike G actually did a version of this, but I couldn&#8217;t get a high quality link for it, and actually now relistening to this, I sorta like mine. <a href="http://twitter.com/caseyveggies"><a href="http://twitter.com/caseyveggies">@caseyveggies</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>N.E.R.D.</strong> &#8211; Inside of Clouds (Tyler, the Creator remix)</span>. This song is absolutely adorable. Come on, it&#8217;s about rain and taking baths and hot chocolate. We need more music like this.</p>
<p>okay yeah i realize prolly lots of you didnt like this one but thats ok. holler at a scholar</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow134.mp3">MIXTAPE 134 &#8211; DIFFERENT VECTORS</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>I feel sort of weird about putting this out, because I&#8217;m not sure how people will take it. But fuck it I&#8217;m 26 I can do what I want.</p>
<p>As far as the inspiration for this theme, there are two things:</p>
<p>First, and I&#8217;m not going to turn this into a language lesson, but there&#8217;s a term I always liked in Japanese: ãƒ™ã‚¯ãƒˆãƒ«ã®é•ã„, &#8220;bekutoru no chigai&#8221;, which sorta translates to &#8220;a difference in vectors&#8221;. This can be used to express a difference of opinion that two people have &#8211; so if you happen to feel one way about something and someone feels another way, then you both have different &#8220;vectors&#8221;, or different &#8220;directionalities&#8221;. Which I think is sort of an interesting metaphor. So that&#8217;s where the name comes from.</p>
<p>The second is actually something I&#8217;ve always considered to be a truth about thinking about interaction between people. I tried explaining this to a friend of mine when I was maybe 17, and she thought it was horrible and pessimistic, so I never really shared it with anyone else again, but I still think it&#8217;s pretty valid. Of course, the little exercise we do in the intro is a very simplified version &#8211; people are free to change their angles at any time, and sometimes do &#8211; but not very often; especially after they&#8217;ve gathered momentum from going in the same direction for a few years. So this is not fatalistic, I&#8217;m not saying people are doomed from the start to never get along, but, you know, it&#8217;s better than blaming your friend or blaming yourself when you don&#8217;t see eye to eye.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what this episode is about &#8211; different angles, different directions. In a sense this is sort of a final chapter to the (what I am now retroactively considering) series I made with <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0329/mixtape-118-change-of-direction/">118</a> and <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0426/mixtape-119-keep-it-moving/">119</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: I made a rap tape about people fighting. It sorta goes hard so you should listen.</p>

<div style="clear:both; height:3px;"></div>
</div>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center><br />
introlude: <span class = "hilite"><strong>Paul White</strong> &#8211; Cheese Special and a Draw (slowed. Maybe too much. I shouldn&#8217;t have done that, sorry.)</span> <a href = "paulwhite.bandcamp.com">paulwhite.bandcamp.com</a>.<br />
<span class = "hilite"><strong>Paul White</strong> &#8211; Floating Free</span>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Doss The Artist</strong> &#8211; Outer Blue ft<strong> Flying Lotus</strong> prod <strong>Hir-O</strong></span>. Old dude got called out. Hir-O, by the way, is crazy with the beats and you will be hearing more from him here in the future. <a href="http://twitter.com/hirobeats"><a href="http://twitter.com/hirobeats">@hirobeats</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Tyler The Creator</strong> &#8211; Inglorious</span>. This cut is so heavy. Tyler is an absolute beast. I will say right here that there is no collective that I am more excited about right now more than Odd Future. If you do not like this, then you should probably take a break from this show for a while. Also, +5 points if you understand the Shake Junt reference. <a href="http://twitter.com/OFWGKTA"><a href="http://twitter.com/OFWGKTA">@OFWGKTA</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Big Ken</strong> &#8211; Sweetest Thing Freestyle</span>. I think I said this the last time I played him, but this dude can really sing. Took me forever to put this one together, but thanks for hooking me up with this one. <a href="http://twitter.com/bigkenmrmoney"><a href="http://twitter.com/bigkenmrmoney">@bigkenmrmoney</a></a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Sway</strong> &#8211; The King Full Stop</span>. It still sort of weirds me out that dude died. You ever drive by the house where a relative of yours that has since passed on used to live, and you start crying? <a href = "http://twitter.com/sway_dcypha"><a href="http://twitter.com/sway_dycypha">@sway_dycypha</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Earl Sweatshirt </strong>- Luper</span>. I&#8217;m pretty sure we&#8217;ve all been here before. Earl is also just stupid with the flows &#8211; I highly recommend listening to more of this kid. Also, the intro on this is absolutely hilarious. Incidentally, this is Tyler&#8217;s younger brother.<a href="http://twitter.com/OFWGKTA"><a href="http://twitter.com/OFWGKTA">@OFWGKTA</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Doss The Artist</strong> &#8211; Sasha Grey</span>. Seriously, go check the rest of this tape.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Domo Genesis</strong> &#8211; Last Roll</span>. Yet another Odd Future member. The creativity in this group is just off the wall. <a href="http://twitter.com/OFWGKTA"><a href="http://twitter.com/OFWGKTA">@OFWGKTA</a></a></p>
<p>outrolude: <span class = "hilite"><strong>Tev95</strong> &#8211; Purple Minks</span> <a href="http://twitter.com/supertev95"><a href="http://twitter.com/supertev95">@supertev95</a></a>.<br />
<span class = "hilite"><strong>dex digi</strong> &#8211; å£°ãŒå¥½ã[koe ga suki]</span>. This is really more of a rework of someone else&#8217;s beat (mostly the voice samples), but I forgot whose. If this is yours, tell me, I&#8217;ll credit you. <a href = "http://twitter.com/dexdigi"><a href="http://twitter.com/dexdigi">@dexdigi</a></a></p>
<p>so that&#8217;s this round. And yeah, if you do twitter or whatever, follow me: <a href = "http://twitter.com/dexdigi"</a><a href="http://twitter.com/dexdigi">@dexdigi</a></a></p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow133.mp3">MIXTAPE 133 &#8211; BOUNCE TAPE THE FOURTH</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>So this is sort of cheating, since this was actually recorded in like mid March, and just sort of sat on my hard drive, but whatever &#8211; as long as it keeps me on a weekly schedule it counts, right? Right?</p>
<p>Bounce Tape 4. If you&#8217;re new to the series, you can get yourself caught up by checking the<a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/tag/bounce-tape/"> bounce tape file</a>. </p>
<p>Note &#8211; this tape (like the others) is not necessarily &#8220;good&#8221;, and has a lot of &#8220;mistakes&#8221; like &#8211; overdrawn or nonexistent transitions, me playing things 30 BPM too fast because I think it sounds better that way, and well, Super Mario sound effects. If you&#8217;re okay with that, let&#8217;s get into it&#8230;</p>

<p></center></p>
<p><center>Tracklist</center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Dr. Dre</strong> and <strong>Snoop Dogg</strong> &#8211; The Next Episode (<strong>Jay Robinson</strong> Clubstep Mix)</span>. This kind of scared me the first time I heard it. <a href="http://twitter.com/jayrobinson"><a href="http://twitter.com/jayrobinson">@jayrobinson</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Simian Mobile Disco</strong> &#8211; Cruel Intentions (feat. <strong>Beth Ditto</strong>) (<strong>Joker</strong> Remix)</span>. This is such a cute song, really, when you think about it. &#8220;Call me down, we&#8217;ll hang out, I&#8217;m down for whatever.&#8221; Like riding bikes or getting ice cream or something. That said, though, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve left messages like this on various females&#8217; voicemails over the years, and it&#8217;s never worked out yet, so I can&#8217;t really recommend using it.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Deadmau5</strong> &#038; <strong>Kaskade</strong> &#8211; I Remember (<strong>Caspa</strong> Remix)</span>. Yes, like I said, this mix is old. But seriously, this song does not get old. The bass just really smashes like that. Have you seen <a href="http://vimeo.com/8626264">this video</a> that the mad decent kids put out? It also smashes. The clip, incidentally, is from Say Anything, which I watched on the strength of this clip, and I can also recommend, as it is a really fine specimen of mid-80s white cinema, if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Gucci Mane</strong> &#8211; Dope Boys (<strong>Bird Peterson</strong> Remix)</span>. Seriously, listening to this now this song is so juvenile. I know MF Doom refers to himself in third person all the time, but somehow when Gucci does it he sounds like a first grader. Oh, the remix also samples BT &#8211; â€œGodspeedâ€, which is pretty funny. <a href="http://twitter.com/gucci1017"><a href="http://twitter.com/gucci1017">@gucci1017</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Rapture</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t Go Do It (<strong>Million $ Mano</strong> Remix)</span>. Yeah, this is 2007 status, but nobody cares because this song just goes that hard. <a href="http://twitter.com/djmano"><a href="http://twitter.com/djmano">@djmano</a></a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Rye Rye</strong> &#8211; Bang feat. <strong>M.I.A.</strong> (<strong>DJ Segaâ€™s</strong> Philly Club Remix)</span>. Speaking of M.I.A., has anyone really listened to that new record?

</center></p>
<p>So yeah, I&#8217;m not dead. As I mentioned in the intro, this is a quick throwback to how a lot of us used to make mixtapes, complete with pause edits, bits of the song bleeding through five seconds early because of the source tape deteriorating, radio static, questionable sound quality, and so on.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and this episode is composed entirely of tapes I found in a bargain bin at a Wherehouse when they went out of business in like 2003, and never listened to until last month. A lot of these groups/acts aren&#8217;t really around anymore, hence the lack of links. </p>
<p>Shoutout to anyone still actually listening to the show.</p>

<div style="clear:both; height:3px;"></div>
</div>
<p></center></p>
<p><center>Tracklist</center></p>
<p>instrolude: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/norsehorsemusic">Norse Horse</a> &#8211; Hidden Place. Beatflip by me, whatever.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Busta Rhymes</strong> + <strong>Phife</strong> &#8211; Freestyles</span>. 1996, off of <strong>DJ Cash Money</strong> Presents WKIS: Guess Who&#8217;s Coming To Dinner. This isn&#8217;t exactly Busta Rhymes&#8217; most skillful performance ever, but he gets points for managing to somehow screw up the most famous line of the most famous opera ever. Also for referencing Zack the Lego Maniac. Then Phife comes on and starts talking about Shaq being on the Orlando Magic, and starts seriously hating on MC Hammer, which is pretty hilarious in 2010. Then again I can sort of understand, because I seem to remember him showing up in a music video in a zebra print speedo on some total seriousness.</p>
<p>Also, yes, I cut out Q-tip&#8217;s freestyle, because it was boring. Also the Roots, because it was boring, and Bahamadia&#8217;s, because it was boring, and Biz Markie, because I just couldn&#8217;t fit it. It&#8217;s pretty hilarious, though &#8211; worth hearing.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Dana Barros</strong> &#8211; Check It</span>. Yes, Dana Barros the basketball player. This comes from the infamous 1994 compilation B-Ball&#8217;s Best Kept Secret, which also brought us Shaq&#8217;s awful &#8216;Mic Check 1-2&#8242;, which was basically Ill All Skratch interrupting Shaq&#8217;s rhymes in mid-verse in an attempt to save him from embarrassing himself. Seriously, though, why is Barros&#8217; song so good? He&#8217;s got a sort of scary amount of skill on the mic considering this is just a sidebar for him, and looking through the liners, dude actually wrote his own lyrics. Listening to his shoutouts, he also has pretty good taste in music. I don&#8217;t know anything about the guy basketballwise, but man, he probably could have had a decent underground career if he felt like it.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Critical Madnez</strong> &#8211; Sumthin&#8217; Sumthin&#8217;</span>. The compilation  &#8211; or at least I think it&#8217;s a compilation &#8211; this came off is sort of weird. It&#8217;s got 4 tracks from 4 artists, and none of the selections are very good, except this one. Of course, the sample probably helps, but I genuinely dig this one.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Brotha Lynch Hung</strong> &#8211; West Coast Parlae feat<strong> D. Dubb</strong></span>. You know, I never really listened to Brotha Lynch Hung, but this is pretty great. The cover to this compilation, however, is seriously laughably terrible, and the inset picture is some dude in a hospital gown or something. Of all of the tapes I raided for this episode, however, this was probably the most consistently listenable.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Blu</strong> &#8211; Hide &#038; Go Get It feat <strong>E-40</strong></span>. Note that this isn&#8217;t the Blu from LA. But okay seriously E-40 totally ruins this song so hard that he actually makes it better. I found this on a caseless compilation called &#8220;Whoop Ass&#8221;. Seriously, though, the R&#038;B part makes zero sense, and the E-40 part makes negative sense.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>B-Boy K</strong> &#8211; Funkin&#8217; Up The Scene</span>. 1994 Bay Area slaps, from a record label that was apparently right down the way from where my moms grew up. The rest of the tape itself isn&#8217;t that great, but this one just slaps way too hard. It&#8217;s mainly comprised of various Parliament/George Clinton samples, which is always good &#8211; and the rhyming just goes hard.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Ghetto Twinz</strong> &#8211; Sho No Luv</span>. 1995. The only real bounce tune on this album, and easily my favorite. It&#8217;s sort of weird though &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty sure that these two can sing, but the singing they do on the hook is pretty bad. This is also the most brutal song in this episode.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this time &#8211; hollerrr</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow128.mp3">MIXTAPE 128 &#8211; BE PATIENT</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>I know, I know. One episode I&#8217;m trying to help out the busy people, now I&#8217;m telling you to slow down and be patient. Sorry. But to make up for that, I included another nonsensical intro because I know you all love those.</p>
<p>But on the real though, if you feel like any of the stuff in the intro applies to you, sit down, grab some chips, and give yourself a good half hour to listen to this one. </p>
<p>Also, please note that nothing I said in the intro should be interpreted as an okay to go stab somebody. </p>
<p><center>Tracklist</center><br />
<span class = "hilite">Instrolude: <strong>Air</strong> &#8211; Dirty Trip</span>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>DJ Signify</strong> &#8211; Fly Away. That first line is just too hard</span>. &#8220;To thicken the plot&#8221;? Wow. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/djsignify">m/djsignify</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Gil Scott-Heron</strong> &#8211; Me And The Devil</span>. Shouts to Mr U for reminding me of this cut, and for part of the inspiration on this episode. I guess people are sorta lukewarm on this song itself, but I don&#8217;t know, I dig it. <a href = "http://gilscottheron.net/">gilscottheron.net</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>UNKLE</strong> &#8211; Rabbit In Your Headlights feat Thom Yorke</span>. Remember the video for this jawn? Skurry. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/unkle">m/unkle</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>UNKLE</strong> &#8211; Rabbit In Your Headlights (<strong>Massive Attac</strong>k Remix)</span>. Just the drum section, really.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Morcheeba</strong> &#8211; Never An Easy Way</span>. This stayed in my no-skip-protection-having-CD player so much when I was 12. I&#8217;m still not sure why I came into possession of this record in the first place, but it goes pretty hard. Protip: Post-Skye Morcheeba isn&#8217;t really that great. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/morcheeba">m/morcheeba</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Sandpeople</strong> &#8211; The Dapper Mob</span>. This is just a really unsettling song, which is I think the last cut of an actual rap album. More unsettling is how this song gets stuck in your head. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sandpeople">m/sandpeople</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Big Ken</strong> (of <strong>334 Mobb</strong>) &#8211; We Miss You Teddy</span>. I think I remember hearing Big Ken sing before, so it&#8217;s not such a surprise to hear him do it on this cut. That said though, this is sort of a weird track &#8211; the rap literally only goes for like four bars and then the song ends. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bigkentheone">m/bigkentheon</a>e.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>SMKA</strong> &#8211; Deer Mama feat Yelawolf</span>. This cut introduced me to Yelawolf. I can&#8217;t really stress how much I like this cut. And SMKA &#8211; that whole 808 project is basically dope. Get it. Bonus points if you realize that this is the only proper rap song in this whole episode. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/smkamusic">m/smkamusic</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Gil Scott-Heron</strong> &#8211; We Almost Lost Detroit</span>. There&#8217;s not much to say about this one. If you don&#8217;t get it, rewind.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what I got this round. Holler.</p>

<p>You know what, I know you&#8217;re busy. But you&#8217;re not too busy to listen to my show. If you really care about me, you&#8217;ll listen to my show.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s jawn is for busy people. Each track is below 2 minutes, no exceptions. I even included times, so in case you hate a particular track you know how long you have to suffer until the next one. But you won&#8217;t, because you like my show, and you like me.</p>
<p>Listen on the train, in the car, on your coffee break, in the bathroom while you&#8217;re ditching class/meetings. </p>
<p>I even made the tracklist all short, in case you&#8217;re too busy to read.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow126.mp3">MIXTAPE 126 &#8211; THE GOLDEN CARTRIDGE LEVEL 2</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>Okay, now I said this in the intro of the show itself, but just in case &#8211; you&#8217;re going to have to listen to <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0808/mixtape-123-the-gold-cartridge-level-1/">part one</a>, or this episode is going to make absolutely no sense. </p>
<p>This is a continuation of  <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0808/mixtape-123-the-gold-cartridge-level-1/">Level 1</a> in the Gold Cartridge saga. As you&#8217;ll remember, our hero managed to scrape through Level 1 with two lives left &#8211; will he make it to the end of this world? How long is this game, anyway? What&#8217;s with the weird Department of Defense references? And is it just me or is the amount of video game themed tracks increasing exponentially recently? </p>
<p>Some of these answers and more &#8211; all in today&#8217;s episode.<br />
<center></p>

<p></center><br />
<center>Tracklist:</center><br />
<span class = "hilite">introlude: an unnamed beat from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/flyinglotus">Flying Lotus</a></span>. I got this from him forever ago and have a feeling it&#8217;s since seen an official release, but don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s called. Any ideas?<br />
nintendo<br />
<span class = "hilite">Jurassic Park &#8211; Level 1 theme music (NES)</span></p>
<p><center><br />
<h1>World 2-1</h1>
<p></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Random</strong> &#8211; Intro (Epilogue)</span>. While this record is sort of hit-and-miss for me, anyone with the nerve to put together an entire concept album on Mega Man earns respect from me. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/random215">m/random215</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Random</strong> &#8211; Robot City feat YTCracker [short edit]</span>. I actually got put up on YTC by someone who listened to the original Nintendo Mixtape forever ago, and I can&#8217;t lie, he&#8217;s not bad. There is an entire genre of this &#8216;nerdrap&#8217; stuff, and most of it is unfortunately pretty terrible &#8211; but YTC is both an originator in the field and actually has flows. Dig the upper middle class whining about &#8216;posers&#8217; &#8211; classic.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Harmonic313</strong> &#8211; From The D feat Guilty Simpson</span>. Really, really old cut, but still goes hard. <a href = "http://www.harmonic313.com">harmonic313.com</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Theme from Werewolf (NES)<br />
Theme from when you turn into a bunny in the Dark World on Legend of Zelda 3 (SNES)</p>
<p><center><br />
<h1>World 2-2</h1>
<p></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Clipse</strong> &#8211; Virginia (Team Teamwork Lost Woods Remix)</span>. This cut is seriously just too hard. Shouts to nxt for linking me on this. Concept, execution &#8211; brilliant. <a href = "http://teamteamwork.bandcamp.com/">teamteamwork.bandcamp.com</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>D-Lo</strong> &#8211; Coppers feat Sleepy</span>. Okay, so first this beat just really slaps hard. Things are fine left at that, but add on top of that the fact that this is a sample of the first three seconds of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN8_FecnA1g&#038;feature=related">Metroid</a>. Oddly enough, a Japanese rapper, Big J.O.E. used this same sample earlier, but this song totally sons that one, no question. Metroid, though. Did anyone ever even beat that game? <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/mrnohoe">m/mrnohoe</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Airborn Audio</strong> &#8211; Now I Lay Me Down</span>. Probably better known as two thirds (H. Prizm and M Sayid) of Antipop Consortium. They only put out one record, and I think it really went over people&#8217;s heads, which is unfortunate because this really was sort of a dope album. Note the potential ambiguous Final Fantasy loop &#8211; which is probably actually just wishful thinking on my part. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/airbornaudio">m/airbornaudio</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>People Under The Stairs</strong> &#8211; Gamin&#8217; On Ya</span>. This song is totally ridiculous &#8211; first, the samples they&#8217;re running predate anything else on here by at least five years &#8211; and then there&#8217;s got to be at least one game reference in every single bar, many of which I&#8217;ve never even played.  That Karnov reference is ridiculous. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/peopleunderthestairs">m/peopleunderthestairs</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Ghostface</strong> &#8211; Computer Love Remix</span>. This cut is really old, you&#8217;ve probably all heard it, and there&#8217;s really not much to say here except that I know you&#8217;re glad I put it in anyway.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Animal Style</strong> &#8211; Living Distance</span>. Shouts to Aaron for the heads up on this one. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/animalstyle">m/animalstyle</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;and that&#8217;s what it is this time around. holler at a scholar.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow125.mp3">MIXTAPE 125 &#8211;  STORYTIME IN THE 90s</a></center></p>
<p>So yeah, been forever. On one level we have strictly tracks from the 1990s, and on another level we have the art of storytelling coming in at various angles. I&#8217;ve been meaning to do something like this for a minute, so let&#8217;s get into it.<br />
<center></p>
<div><object width="300" height="300"><param name="movie" value="http://www.mixcloud.com/media/swf/player/mixcloudLoader.swf?v=14"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><param name="flashVars" value="feed=http://www.mixcloud.com/api/1/cloudcast/mixtapeshow/mixtape-125-storytime-in-the-90s.json"></param><embed src="http://www.mixcloud.com/media/swf/player/mixcloudLoader.swf?v=14" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="feed=http://www.mixcloud.com/api/1/cloudcast/mixtapeshow/mixtape-125-storytime-in-the-90s.json" width="300" height="300"></embed></object>
<div style="clear:both; height:3px;"></div>
<p></center></p>
<p>Introlude: <span class = "hilite"><strong>The Pharcyde</strong> &#8211; Groupie Therapy</span></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Top Choice Clique</strong> &#8211; Peace of Mind</span>. Apparently this record, produced in 1990, never saw a proper release &#8211; until maybe a year ago. Word has it A&#038;M label politics ended in all recorded material being canned, minus a few promo records that Esoteric found, baked in his oven to straighten them out, and well, here we are, 19 years after the fact. I ended up cutting part of this off because it&#8217;s too long for my tastes, but for those who dig it &#8211; go find the original. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jawnp78">m/jawnp78</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Royal Flush</strong> &#8211; I Never Made 20</span>. I remember reading about this cut in a Bun B interview, I think, and the dude was right &#8211; this song goes really hard. Anyone who&#8217;s been listening to rap for more than a week or so knows that some songs just sort of go in one ear and out the other, and others really feel like someone&#8217;s sitting you down and telling you something and you <em>have</em> to listen. This is one of those songs. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/streetboss">m/streetboss</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Psychoward</strong> &#8211; Rockslangas</span>. I&#8217;m probably one of the worst basketball players in the world. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/psychowarddotcom">m/psychowarddotcom</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Hieroglyphics</strong> &#8211; Cab Fare</span>. I didn&#8217;t actually hear this one until maybe like 04 or so, when a good friend of mine introduced me to this song. I used to sit at her house and just play it on repeat. Hi, helen. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/hieroglyphics">m/hieroglyphics</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>CRU</strong> &#8211; Just Another Case feat<strong> Slick Rick</strong></span>. This is the only song on here that I actually heard when it came out. I remember the video being sort of scary (I mean, I was like 12), when it switched up into that PRONTO PRONTO craziness. The sample on this is pretty great.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Freddie Foxx </strong>- Man Destroys Man</span>. Another previously unreleased jawn. Okay, so this is the song I was talking about in the intro. Let me be clear up front &#8211; I thought twice about putting this out because I didn&#8217;t know if people would be able to see past the language here. However &#8211; that&#8217;s actually not even the point here, because if you actually listen closely to the story as it plays out and if you listen closely to some of the clues dude drops in the middle &#8211; e.g. &#8220;it really was about who was the baddest&#8221; is a big one &#8211; you&#8217;ll see what Freddie, regardless of whatever homophobic issues dude is dealing with personally, is actually talking about here (hint: it&#8217;s in the title). If you think about it in this sense, this is actually a really interesting record. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/theogbumpyknuckles">m/theogbumpyknuckles</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Geto Boys</strong> &#8211; 5th Ward/South Central Malt feat <strong>Ice Cube</strong></span>. So for the few who didn&#8217;t know, St Ides was running this massive campaign to get as many dark people to drink malt liquor as possible back in the 90s, and a lot of rappers happily signed on. The scary thing is that a lot of these tracks &#8211; there&#8217;s around like 30 of them &#8211; including videos for 2 that I know of &#8211; were really great. This is only one of them. Shouts to Gavin for reminding me of this. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/getoboysfromthesouth">m/getoboysfromthesouth</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, that&#8217;s what it is for this week. What&#8217;s good with you all?</p>
<p>PS: bonus points for anyone who knows what the picture on the episode cover is.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow124.mp3">MIXTAPE 124 &#8211; THE SKATE TAPE</a></center></p>
<p>Yeah. So first, I have several shoutouts &#8211; Mamiko for sending me my board, everyone I know out here in the city for probably unknowingly influencing me to buy one, Elliot for &#8211; well, I&#8217;m not sure, but somehow I think he influenced this one too.</p>
<p>And real talk, I&#8217;m not trying to act like someone who&#8217;s been down since day one on this. I only got my jawn like a month and a half ago, and my best trick is a little number I like to call &#8220;not falling&#8221;. But to be fair, growing up where and when I did, general common sense said that black people do not ride skateboards (I think my father might have actually told me this once). Somehow I did manage to own a pair of rollerblades, but that&#8217;s beside the point.</p>
<p>But yeah, this is a tape specifically engineered for hitting the pavement during these last few weeks of summer. Put this in the iphone/ipod/whatever devices you foreigners are using nowadays and hit the streets.</p>

<p><center><br />
<h1>Tracklist</h1>
<p></center></p>
<p>instromental: <span class = "hilite"><a href = "http://www.myspace.com/madlib">Madlib</a> &#8211; Blunt Break</span>.<br />
<span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; Retro Electro</span>. With DJ Clue screaming all over it, which maybe makes it better, I&#8217;m not sure. I was having a hard time thinking of what to start this off with, when I found this in the archives. I&#8217;m sort of looking forward to skating to this. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/jayelect">m/jayelect</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Che Grand</strong> &#8211; King âœ– Grand</span>. My official theory behind the name of this track is that Che found out how to make this  âœ– mark and decided to use it in a song. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/chegrand">m/chegrand</a> </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Unagi</strong> &#8211; Song of Satisfaction feat <strong>Eddie Meeks</strong></span>. Shouts to Unagi for hitting me with this record in I think March. Actually, I&#8217;m certain it&#8217;s March, as I was listening to it back at home in CA and my moms heard me playing it and asked me who it was because she liked it &#8211; then she heard this particular track and said that &#8220;that man just ruined a very nice song&#8221;. I think the chorus is sort of great, personally. I cut this off halfway, but if you want the rest, go check it out. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/unagi">m/unagi</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>K-Salaam &#038; Beatnick</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t Die feat <strong>Bun B</strong>, <strong>Talib Kweli</strong>, and <strong>Colin Munroe</strong></span>. I still don&#8217;t really understand the chorus here. &#8220;Don&#8217;t die&#8221; sounds like something you tell somebody before they try something stupid, like being Mexican and walking into a 7-11 with your hands in your pockets &#8211; but this song doesn&#8217;t even have any Spanish in it, so I&#8217;m sort of confused. That said, it&#8217;s a pretty good track. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/ksalaammusic">m/ksalaammusic</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Roots</strong> &#8211; !!!!!!!</span>. Yeah. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/theroots">m/theroots</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Tanya Morgan</strong> &#8211; Hardcore Gentlemen</span>. The high pitched rapping in here is going to evoke a really obvious connection some other groups/tracks, but I think that&#8217;s the point. This song is great. &#8220;I took her to the movies and got her hella Skittles&#8221;? Brilliant. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/tanyamorgan">m/tanyamorgan</a></p>
<p>Wait, is that where I&#8217;ve been going wrong? Skittles. Had no idea it was that simple.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Born Wit It</strong> &#8211; Elevators Freestyle</span>. The rest of the Substance Abuse tape ain&#8217;t too bad, either.  <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/bornwitit">w/bornwitit</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>J. Cole</strong> &#8211; Til Infinity</span>. Somehow the last cut made me think of this one. Shouts to Ultra Ouxu for recommending this tape. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Hudson Mohawke</strong> &#8211; Rising 5</span>. I mean, I&#8217;d heard of Hudson Mo before, but nothing like this. This is so good I felt bad talking over it. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/hudsonmo">w/hudsonmo</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Cymbals Eat Guitars</strong> &#8211; Living North</span>. I mean, you can&#8217;t have a skate tape without at least some guitars in it, right? <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/cymbalseatguitars">w/cymbalseatguitars</a></p>
<p>PS: My board is actually a longboard, and it&#8217;s hella cool. I should post a picture of it or something.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow123.mp3">THE GOLD CARTRIDGE LEVEL 1</a></center></p>
<p>Man, I don&#8217;t even know how to start this one off. So once, a very long time ago, on this very here rappidy rap podcast, I put out a <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0728/episode-43-nintendo-mixtape/">nintendo mixtape</a>. I didn&#8217;t actually think anyone would like it, I just sort of wanted to do it &#8211; but the response was actually sort of good. You could call this a sequel if you want, but in reality, this is actually a prequel&#8230;</p>
<p>The year is 1998, and our hero is a 14-year old dex digital. I would write out the story here, but I&#8217;ll just let <a href="http://ghosteo.net">Ghosteo</a> take it from here with the mad drawing skills. </p>
<p>And thus opens today&#8217;s episode &#8211; The Gold Cartridge, Level 1.</p>

<p><center><br />
<h1>World 1-1</h1>
<p></center></p>
<p>So for those of you who missed the ridiculous 5 minute intro skits &#8211; here you go.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Instructionalude</strong></span><br />
Serengeti Drop.<br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/jbizthaill">J Bizness</a> &#8211; Denice<br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/paulmw">Paul White</a> &#8211; City Bright Lights<br />
æ™‚ã®éŽãŽã‚†ãã¾ã¾ã«(Toki no sugi yuku mama ni) (NES)</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Meek Millz</strong> &#8211; One For The Money</span>. <strong>Hoodfamous</strong> on the track. I have to say, this is probably the best flip of the Super Mario Bros sample I&#8217;ve ever heard. Even beyond that, this beat just sorta goes hard. And anybody who&#8217;s seen any videos of Millz knows that the dude is sort of skurry with it. I mean, I woulda liked some mario references in this cut, but I can&#8217;t be mad at him. Shouts to JT for the cut. <a href = " http://www.myspace.com/hoodfamous215">m/hoodfamous215</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Game/Realitylude</strong></span><br />
Crash N The Boys (NES) &#8211; this game was the business back in the day. Most violent pseudo-olympics game I ever played.<br />
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Overworld Theme) (NES) &#8211; this game was so stupidly hard it wasn&#8217;t even funny.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Finale</strong> &#8211; Motor Music (snippet)</span>. When I first heard this cut I wasn&#8217;t really sure if I was reading too much into the droning background music &#8211; but then I heard One Man Show. Obvious nintendo influence. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/finale">m/finale</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Alchemist</strong> &#8211; That&#8217;ll Work feat Three 6 Mafia (snippet)</span>. You know, because I still like Three 6. This cut for some reason makes me think of Castlevania. I can&#8217;t really condone how dude prefers to spend his money, though. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/thealchemist">m/thealchemist</a></p>
<p><center><br />
<h1>World 1-2</h1>
<p></center></p>
<p>Wow, I forgot how whiny I was as a 14 year old. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Racist Gamealude</strong></span><br />
Street Fighter Intro. (SNES)</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Turbo</strong> &#8211; Gigaton Punch</span>. Definite shouts to <strong>AustinJ</strong> for putting me on to this track like two years ago. Now that he mentions it though, I don&#8217;t know anyone that actually used Balrog. Personally I started off on probably Dhalsim (long range punches), then Blanka until I realized the electricity thing was only cool until you got hit with a fireball in the middle of your shock attack. Then Guile, then Chun Li, mainly because she can jump off the walls. Why&#8217;d they have to make Balrog all useless? On the song though, you can&#8217;t even front on it. It&#8217;s great. <a href "http://www.youtube.com/scrambletv">y/scrambletv</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Oh No</strong> &#8211; Lay You Out feat <strong>Redman</strong></span>. Oh No was already on the last Nintendo jawn, so he&#8217;s already got a record for being a nintendo fiend. And Redman isn&#8217;t really surprising either, considering that one episode of &#8220;Cribs&#8221; where he had like a Sega under his bed or something. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/ohnodisrupt">m/ohnodisrupt</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>DJ Tour</strong> &#8211; Street Fighter Mix feat <strong>Mistah Fab</strong></span>. I don&#8217;t know, this is sort of a weird choice I guess. Beatwise, it&#8217;s actually perfect &#8211; they did absolutely nothing to the instrumental except add an extra kick and clap in and maybe some orchestra hits. Fabby himself comes with some sort of ridiculously corny lines, but I like how he says &#8220;money&#8221; so it&#8217;s okay. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/mistahfab">m/mistahfab</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Outrolude</strong></span><br />
Star Tropics 2 (NES)</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Afro Classics</strong> &#8211; The Follow Through</span>. Maybe a new name for some (I&#8217;m actually sorta late with this one, so probably not), but if you remember Scarub of Living Legends &#8211; this is him paired up with Very. I haven&#8217;t had time to sit down through the whole record yet, but it ain&#8217;t bad. I dig the hook on this one. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/afroclassicsmusic">m/afroclassicsmusic</a></p>
<p>Oh wow, I completely forgot to do this in the outro, but shouts to <strong>B</strong> on the in-game announcer vocals. You might remember him as Uncle Chester from the<a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0423/mixtape-show-69-the-rock-episode/"> Rock Episode</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what it is for this week. Apparently there&#8217;s a World 2 to this game, so I guess check back next week for another one? </p>

<p>So yeah, near the end of the actual Tsuyu season, I manage to get this one out. If you haven&#8217;t heard of Tsuyu, you&#8217;ll know what it is by the end of the episode. So for those of you in areas of the planet cursed enough to be still dealing with rain at this time of year, sit inside, put the headphones on, look out the window, and dig it.</p>

<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Introlude: <strong>Chris Craft</strong> &#8211; Rise Again</span>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Finale</strong> &#8211; Issues</span>. Both sides of the mic, dude is really just kinda dope. I&#8217;ve got a couple other joints I plan on putting up in the near future. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/finale">m/finale</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Doom</strong> &#8211; Absolutely</span>. I mean, it&#8217;s Doom. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Edan</strong> &#8211; Murder Mystery</span>. Surreal. Shouts to F Diesel for putting me up on the dude. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/eeddaann">m/eeddaann</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Faimkills</strong> &#8211; In Your Sleep</span>. Replaying the bit at the end, I&#8217;m realizing that I may be mixing up part of the story with something else. But I definitely remember cereal, and socks. Kid clearly puts a lot into tweaking out the production &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty sure some of the references are over my head. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/faimkills">m/faimkills</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Statik Selektah</strong> &#8211; The Thrill Is Gone ft<strong> Styles P </strong>&#038; <strong>Talib Kweli</strong></span>. &#8220;I&#8217;m like god damn, they even screwed up conscious rap&#8221; = thank you, amen, church, tabernacle. I can&#8217;t quite cosign on the funny clothes comment though, because I like funny clothes. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/statikselektah">m/statikselektah</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>JR &#038; PH7</strong> &#8211; Top Rank feat<strong> Guilty Simpson</strong> and <strong>Black Milk</strong></span>. Guilty just continues to say violent things where violent thing-saying is totally irrelevant and unnecessary, but still sort of cool. Dig the production.<a href = "http://www.myspace.com/jrph7">m/jrph7</a>.</p>
<p>Outrolude: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/esserhq">Esser</a> &#8211; I Love You (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/princepaulofficialmyspacepage">Prince Paul </a>Remix Instrumental)<br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/snackchizzel">Chan</a> &#8211; Lonely Road Instrumental</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Rhymefest</strong> &#8211; No Sunshine</span>. Promise, last time I put a track up off this tape. Still, though, the concept was just really that great. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/rhymefest">m/rhymefest</a><em> (thanks for the correction J)</em></p>
<p>On <strong>Michael</strong> &#8211; as I said, there&#8217;s not a whole lot that needs to be said. I can&#8217;t do a tribute episode or a special or anything like that, it just doesn&#8217;t feel right.</p>
<p>ps &#8211; I think I&#8217;m not using &#8220;paradox&#8221; right. Blame it on the whole not-english-speaking thing.</p>

<p>After what, like a year of Earth time, the two adventurers from the 2100s are back with the future funk. In this installment, Dex Digital (wait, that&#8217;s not his real name?) and Brothertron are busy repairing their ship after getting half blown apart by space pirates. Everything is going well, if slowly, until all of a sudden the main computer starts, well&#8230;malfunctioning?</p>
<p>Note &#8211; this is a continuation of the Soultronica Saga series &#8211; if you missed <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/1008/mixtape-91-soultronica-5-bounty-hunters/">Episode 5</a>, you might wanna check that out.</p>

</div>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Introlude</span> &#8211;<br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/blackmk">Black Milk</a> &#8211; Purple Track 6<br />
<strong>Black Milk</strong> &#8211; Purple Track 8</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>A Leon</strong> &#8211; Spaced Out</span>. Real talk, this track is a large part of what prompted this episode. I don&#8217;t really think there&#8217;s a whole lot that needs to be said about this cut. And just a reminder &#8211; for those of you who were in to <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/aleoncraft">myspace.com/aleoncraft</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Co$$</strong> &#8211; Khakis and Taylors</span>. More ridiculous, random statements (&#8220;documenting the documentations?&#8221;) from someone you&#8217;ve heard here before. This one kinda just goes hard. <a href = "http://myspace.com/paidthecoss">m/paidthecoss</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Saroc</strong> &#8211; The First Mother</span>. Production from Sol Messiah. I can&#8217;t really think of any other artists that could get away with running the same lyrics twice &#8211; but in this case, it&#8217;s more than worth the second runthrough. Everything I have heard from this woman has been dope. I got a little more Saroc on the way too&#8230;</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">malfunctionlude: </span><br />
<strong>Aphex Twin</strong> &#8211; Ageispolis<br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/bordeauxlouis">Louis Bordeaux</a> &#8211; Say The Word Again Bitch (</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Gil Scott-Heron</strong> &#8211; Angel Dust</span>. Really, just bootlegged off of an old Sa-Ra mixtape.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Ta&#8217;Raach</strong> &#038; <strong>Konphlict</strong> &#8211; 10 Feet High (Giraffe Pussy)</span>. I can&#8217;t even pretend that I understand this one. Stoned rappidy raps over triple time. <a href = "www.myspace.com/taraach">m/taraach</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Afro-Mystik</strong> &#8211; Urban Euphoric</span>. Off the Future Tropic record. I can&#8217;t really even recall why I have this joint, but it&#8217;s definitely very good. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/afromystik">m/afromystik</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Team Knoc</strong> &#8211; Swisher</span>. Sirrealz is actually one of my favorite artists, even though I haven&#8217;t heard much from the dude lately. Team Knoc can be kinda hit and miss, but when they hit, they hit. <a href = "www.myspace.com/officialteamknoc">m/officialteamknoc</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Biosphere</strong> &#8211; In Triple Time</span>. I really recommend that you just get the full version of this and space out. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/biosphereofficial">m/biosphereofficial</a>.</p>
<p>So. Yeah. Soultronica. Holler.</p>

<p>See, a promise is a promise.</p>
<p>Anyway, this week, as the title suggests, is the breakup joint. Partially based on real life, partially based on the bizarre phenomenon in which when you&#8217;re depressed, you want to listen to even more depressing music, and partially based on that urge to just get something off your chest. That said, let&#8217;s get into the:</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">introlude &#8211; Mos Def &#8211; Brown Sugar</span>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Ta&#8217;raach</strong> &#8211; Hey</span>. <font color = "#ccc"><em>You know, this is like that part where you&#8217;re all &#8220;man, forget her, I&#8217;m good.&#8221; You know that phase. </em></font>Trackwise, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve just been meaning to get this one on forever. A lot of the stuff dude says in this track is just really mean-spirited, which makes me like it even more. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/taraach">myspace.com/taraach</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Super Chron Flight Brothers</strong> &#8211; Once We Were Kings</span>. <font color = "#ccc"><em>And then you start to think back.</em> </font>This record kinda reminds me of Airborn Audio. Weird, paranoid subject matter over weird, paranoid beats. Apparently they holed themselves up in a Yogyakarta hotel during the production process, and their weed/skurry noises type antics resulted in an unwritten ban on Black patrons at that establishment. Not sure how I&#8217;m supposed to feel about that. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/flightbrothers">myspace.com/flightbrothers</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Malcolm Kipe</strong> &#8211; My Room Remix</span>.<font color = "#ccc"><em> Negativity. </em></font>Really it was the instro that got me on this one.  <a href = "http://www.lastfm.jp/music/Malcom+Kipe">mk on lastfm</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>RJD2</strong> &#8211; June (Remix)</span>. <font color = "#ccc"><em>Aaaand here comes the &#8220;why me why me&#8221; phase.</em></font> After the first verse you think it&#8217;s just going to be a rant on the state of rap music, until the second one comes in. Just too heavy. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/rjd2">myspace.com/rjd2</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; Girlfriend.</span> <font color = "#ccc"><em>You think about calling her&#8230; remember? That always used to work.</em></font> Not much to say here. It&#8217;s Jay. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/jayelect">myspace.com/jayelect</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Albe Back</strong> &#8211; Without You (dex digi Bohemian Rhapsody Edit)</span>.<font color = "#ccc"><em> No, she said don&#8217;t call. It&#8217;s already over. Give it up, famo, you&#8217;re just making yourself look bad. Don&#8217;t lose your cool.</em></font> Seriously, three bars in I realized I&#8217;d heard this chord progression before. You can hate me for doing this, but really my only motivation was that I couldn&#8217;t stand the original hook. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/albemusic">myspace.com/albemusic</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay-Z</strong> vs <strong>Coldplay</strong> &#8211; What If We Cry? prod Remot</span>. <font color = "#ccc"><em>Which gives you more time to think. And now you can finally be a little more honest with yourself. Trying to &#8220;keep your cool&#8221; was what got you here in the first place.</em></font> I don&#8217;t own any Coldplay albums, but I hear from very reliable sources that lots of white people like them. This cut is even more depressing this time around. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/remotmusic">myspace.com/remotmusic</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>People Under The Stairs</strong> &#8211; More Than You Know</span>. <font color = "#ccc"><em>Congratulations, you&#8217;re now officially &#8220;in touch with your emotions&#8221;.

<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>O.D.B </strong>- No More (Wasted Time)</span>. <font color = "#ccc"><em> But hey, at least you can respect yourself a little more now, right? Right? </em></font>At least, that&#8217;s what this cut seems to be called. I know, it&#8217;s really lo-fi, but this is the only version I&#8217;m aware of. A cry for help, man, just too late.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>DJ Lt Dan</strong> and<strong> Jay Z</strong> &#8211; Interlude b/w Living Proof</span>. <font color = "#ccc"><em>&#8230;</em></font> I don&#8217;t know, this just seemed to fit.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what it is for this week. Bonus points for anyone who can identify the original image I bootlegged to make this week&#8217;s episode cover.</p>

<p>Yeah. Took a minute. We changed directions last week, now we gotta keep it moving. </p>

</div>
<p><font size = "1">Lemme know what you think, I&#8217;m in the midst of rethinking the structure of this site&#8230;anyway, on to the&#8230;</font></p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">introlude: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/zakiibrahim">Zaki Ibrahim</a> &#8211; You Choose. </span></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>GaKnew Roxwell</strong> &#8211; Trynna Say</span>. I&#8217;m not going to lie, I&#8217;m not sure how to say this dude&#8217;s name. Joint itself is raw, in a good way, and just powerful. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/gaknew">myspace.com/gaknew</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Shaun Boothe</strong> &#8211; Unauthorized Biography &#8211; Jimi Hendrix</span>. I&#8217;d sort of appreciate it if people here stopped comparing me (visually) to Jimi Hendrix. Not that that&#8217;s going to happen any time soon though. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/shaunboothe">myspace.com/shaunboothe</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Cee-Lo</strong> &#8211; Free (full version, live on 88.5)</span>. This isn&#8217;t really even rap music, it&#8217;s gospel, and it&#8217;s brilliant. If you need any more of a reason to recommend this show to anyone, do it for this track. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ceelogreen">myspace.com/ceelogreen</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Blu and Mainframe</strong> &#8211; Long Time Gone</span>. Off the Johnson &#038; Jonson release. You all already know how I feel about this project. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/jandjbabyproducts">myspace.com/jandjbabyproducts</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Alf-Alpha</strong> &#8211; Bittersweet feat <strong>Pheo</strong></span>. Alf gave me this track (speaking of which, I never asked you dude, why the name?) forever ago, and then just recently hit me with this version with the Pheo vocals. I think he did it because he knew I would appreciate the Dexter&#8217;s Lab reference (shouts to anyone that remembers the Lab parties, <font size = "1">or was at one of the Lab parties but doesn&#8217;t remember it, ahem</font>). <a href="http://www.myspace.com/alfalpha">myspace.com/alfalpha</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Black Milk</strong> &#8211; Mo Power</span>. Dude can produce, and rhyme. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/blackmk">myspace.com/blackmk</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>U-N-I</strong> &#8211; Reach For The Sky feat <strong>Tabi Bonney</strong> and <strong>Haziq Ali</strong></span>. Really the production is what pulled me in on this one (<strong>Beatnick</strong> and <strong>K-Salaam</strong> have apparently been really busy recently), but it&#8217;s solid all over, really. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/unimuzik">myspace.com/unimuzik</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Uhh</strong> &#8211; I Love Me feat<strong> Jon B</strong></span>. As <strong>Yep</strong> of <strong>The Uhh</strong> (these dudes are either on to something with their names or, well, I don&#8217;t know) stressed, &#8220;thee <strong>Jon B</strong>&#8220;. I&#8217;ve been asking these dudes for a record for like four or more years. It&#8217;s sort of rough, but this is an all over hilarious-but-still-really-good song. They were also kind enough to let the instro ride out for like a minute and a half, which I happily jumped on to talk about the term &#8220;grown and sexy&#8221;. In short, I&#8217;m not a fan of the term. Details in the show itself. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theuhh">myspace.com/theuhh</a>. </p>
<p>So yeah, let me know what you think. Also feel free to talk about Grown and Sexy because I think that this is seriously an epidemic that should be stopped. I&#8217;m dead serious about this, as serious as I was about Skeeter being Black.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what it is for this week. Tune in next week. Yes, next week. Yes. Next week. Promise.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been recently getting a little jealous of the popularity of the Soultronica Series on my own site. I&#8217;m not really sure how they do it, but somehow Digi (the 2109 version) and Brotherton manage to consistently make tapes that rival, or maybe exceed, my stuff. Even though it&#8217;s been over a year since there&#8217;s been a proper update to the Saga, I still get mail about it. </p>
<p>I mean, they&#8217;re 100 years in the future so I guess it makes sense that they&#8217;re more advanced than me, but still. So I figured I&#8217;d try my hand at something different, but still kept it 2009 with it. Hope you dig. </p>

Sort of raw on the mastering process, but I dig this one.  I was actually about to put an old Z&#8217;hane remix Kenny had sent me on this, but I got this and changed my mind.

<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>L.A.U.S.D. </strong>- iFeel feat <strong>Curly Tops </strong>and <strong>Nautica Jackets</strong></span>. Okay seriously these two need to stop with extra names. Generally the acceptable limit is 6ish official names plus 37 throwaways used in rap lyrics only ala Wu-Tang, but these two are about to get their alias privileges revoked just off the ridiculousity of their first picks. I&#8217;m not sure which is which, but Jack of J*Davey and Blu are both on here. Also L.A.U.S.D. as in the producers, not as in the system that screwed up countless friends (shout outs to the San Bernardino system too though). The more I listen to this the more I like it.

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow117.mp3">MIXTAPE 117 -NIGGAS AND BITCHES</a></center></p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to apologize upfront:</p>
<p>1. The intro is long. The outro is long. This episode is long. Almost an hour. I talk a lot.<br />
2. I repeatedly use a word that I&#8217;m not really known for using, ever.</p>
<p>That out of the way, here&#8217;s the background:</p>
<p>The other day, during the course of my very serious research (read: half-asleep, cruising the Japanese interwebs), I discovered Japanese beef.</p>
<p>Apparently underground rappers Seeda and Oki of Geek had taken offense to something in the outro of the Teriyaki Boyz&#8217; (probably only known in the States (and Japan) for showing up on Youtube videos wearing Bape and dancing around with Kanye) new single, &#8220;Serious Japanese&#8221;. They then proceeded to air their frustrations in public by recording a dis track (complete with accompanying video) and posting it up on Seeda&#8217;s <a href="http://seeda.syncl.jp/?p=diary&#038;di=79530">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Check the video below:<br />
<center><br />
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PM83MInKkPI&#038;hl=ja&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PM83MInKkPI&#038;hl=ja&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br />
SEEDA &#038; OKI from GEEK &#8211; TERIYAKI BEEF<br />
</center></p>
<p>The two lines which we will be tackling today are below:</p>
<blockquote><p>ä¸€äººã¯ãƒ“ãƒƒãƒã§å¾Œã¯ã‚«ã‚¹ you are serious? ã¸ããŒèŒ¶ã‚’æ²¸ã‹ã™<br />
<em>One of you is a bitch, the others are trash. You are serious? Don&#8217;t make me laugh</em><br />
<br />
äºŒç•ªç…Žã˜ã¯ãƒ‹ã‚¬ã®æ©Ÿå«Œå–ã‚Š ass hall ã‚¬ãƒã‚¬ãƒã€€ï¼„ã‚’ã°ã‚‰ã¾ã<br />
<em>You&#8217;re played out, just trying to make the niggers* like you. Assholes**, throwing money around</em><br />
<br />
*Ostensibly, the black rappers/producers they&#8217;re associated with. I could have used the &#8220;nigga&#8221; form, but it&#8217;s being used more as an insult here, so it&#8217;s sort of in between a swap-word for &#8220;dude&#8221; and an actual proper racial slur.<br />
**I think that&#8217;s what they meant.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the above is a really loose translation. If you have a more eloquent one, let me know and I&#8217;ll fix it.</p>
<p>Oh yes, shouts to <strong>VTS</strong> for this week&#8217;s image design and some insight on the lyrics. Also shouts to ãƒŸã‚¹ã‚¿ãƒ¼ãƒãƒ.</p>
<p>So yeah. Pretty much every underground Japanese rap fan is aware of this dis, the Teriyaki Boyz&#8217; Verbal has responded to it on his <a href="http://ameblo.jp/m-flo-verbal/">blog</a> and mentioned it on his <a href="http://www.zima.jp/podcast/verbaleyez/">podcast</a>, and it&#8217;s been picked up on every site I can find &#8211; but there&#8217;s one angle that hasn&#8217;t been touched &#8211; the fact that in the first twenty seconds, somebody drops the N-bomb.</p>
<p>I thought it was interesting. So today, using this dis track as a starting point, we&#8217;ll look at some of the different ways we can look at this phenomenon (if you want to call it that), some of the background on how we got to this point, and in the end, I guess, look a little closer at the situation as it is at home.</p>
<p>A lot of talking, a lot of what will likely come off as little more than pointless theorizing, but at the very least, an awful lot of dope music.</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p>beatro: The Brothers Johnson &#8211; Q.<br />
beatro 2: <a href="http://www.nipseyhussle.com">Nipsey Hussle</a> &#8211; Hussle in the House</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Re-Up Gang</strong> &#8211; Real Niggas.</span> I didn&#8217;t actually sit down and listen to the whole mixtape, but I do dig this cut. I had a conversation at a ramen shop this morning (somebody needs to tell these dudes that letting customers in at 3:AM, handing them soup, and then closing down at 3:20 is not funny) about the above dis track, and he said &#8220;Dex, you know that for these guys, &#8216;nigga&#8217; just means &#8216;guy&#8217;&#8221;. If so, this song gives more than a few real-life examples of how to use the word &#8211; actually, this one goes above and beyond and expands on it, giving you the macho angle on the word as well. <a href = "http://myspace.com/ablive">myspace.com/ablive</a></p>
<p>beatro 3: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/supersmokysoul">Super Smoky Soul</a> &#8211; Simply (Extended Version)</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Stat Quo</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m Sorry.</span> As I said in the episode, this stands on its own as a piece of art. All of these songs do. You don&#8217;t have to &#8220;agree&#8221; with what the dude is saying &#8211; since when did we start judging art with a PC ruler? But dig dude&#8217;s stance on the word: &#8220;They can&#8217;t say it but we can&#8230;Look at the power we hold in our hand&#8221;. And while this dude does make an attempt at showing respect towards women, this song is sort of uncompromisingly misogynistic &#8211; if you spelled it out in mathematical terms, bitch characteristics = &#8220;female&#8221; characteristics = undesirable characteristics. A = B = C, thus A = C, Q.E.D. This is sort of a theme throughout a good number of these songs.  <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/statquo">myspace.com/statquo</a></p>
<p>beatro 4: Jr Don &#8211; Bring In Black 2</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Tribe Called Quest</strong> &#8211; Sucka Nigga.</span> I guess this is the most palatable song of any of these for the PC set. That said, there&#8217;s not much substantially different from Q-Tip&#8217;s and Stat Quo&#8217;s stances on the word.  <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/atribecalledquest">myspace.com/atribecalledquest</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Three 6 Mafia</strong> &#8211; Watcha Starin At feat Lil Jon.</span> Sort of had to put these dudes in here. Lil Jon was possibly the root cause of white frat dudes screaming &#8220;nigga whut&#8221; at college parties from &#8217;03-06&#8242;. At least from what I saw.</p>
<p>beatro 5: <a href="http://unagi442.com">Unagi</a> &#8211; High? Yes</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Tahir</strong> &#8211; You Don&#8217;t Know Me.</span> Probably the most challenging cut on here. Make no mistake about it, though &#8211; as the dude says, the sentiments expressed on this record aren&#8217;t rare, and they aren&#8217;t new. Lyrics to rewind and contemplate: &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s my right to say this right here. This is my shit. This is my hood, and you&#8217;re in it</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>beatro 6: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sadatx">Sadat X</a> &#8211; Hang &#8216;Em High</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jayo Felony</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t Call Me Nigga.</span> I&#8217;m realizing that it&#8217;s starting to look like I put a large portion of this together just doing a search in my iTunes folder for &#8220;nigga&#8221;. Early 90s west coast. A lot of prison rap on this particular album, for good reason.  <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/jayofelony">myspace.com/jayofelony</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>MC Tucker and DJ Irv </strong>- Where Dey At?</span> Probably a couple hooks in here you&#8217;ll recognize. Obviously this is just the intro, but the rest of the song sorta does the same thing.</p>
<p>beatro 7: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/platinumpiedpipers">Platinum Pied Pipers</a> &#8211; After the Worries</p>
<p>You know, maybe I should have said this earlier, but I&#8217;m not here on some NAACP whining about how the word itself is bad. I&#8217;m not really interested in &#8220;nigga&#8221; right now beyond its use as a tool here to give us a look at a bigger issue. You know, just putting that out there.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Sporty T</strong> &#8211; Sporty Talkin 93.</span> Edited. Note how &#8220;niggas&#8221; and &#8220;brothers&#8221; is used absolutely interchangeably. The first time I ever saw the Beef DVD series was in Japan (they got all 3 out here). Subtitles. And every time the dudes on TV said &#8220;that nigga this, a real nigga wouldn&#8217;t that, I don&#8217;t like them niggas&#8221;, etc, the &#8220;nigga&#8221; was translated as &#8220;é»’äºº&#8221; &#8220;black person&#8221;. Sometimes é»’äººç”·æ€§, &#8220;black male&#8221;. So if you want to go with the &#8220;ignorance of the weight of the word&#8221; route, this would be a good thing to cite.  Also I&#8217;m realizing now that I didn&#8217;t talk about bitches as much as I promised &#8211; maybe some other time. <a href = "http://http://www.myspace.com/sportyt504">myspace.com/sportyt504</a></p>
<p><strong>Jayo Felony</strong> &#8211; Niggas and Bitches. This was released as a radio single, believe it or not. And since the hook (you sort of have to hear it to believe it, try not to laugh) wasn&#8217;t going to work on radio, they actually cut a totally different version for the B-side called &#8220;Brothers and Sisters&#8221;, complete with each &#8220;nigga&#8221; being replaced for &#8220;brother&#8221;, and &#8220;bitch&#8221; for &#8220;sister&#8221; throughout the song. It&#8217;s sort of interesting to think about how simply switching the two words around makes such a large difference &#8211; the sentiment of the song doesn&#8217;t change at all (either way, it&#8217;s a tribute to loyal friends).  </p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what it is for this round. Hit the comments, I&#8217;m interested. </p>
<p><font size = "1">(oh, and even though I said this in the episode, let me put it in writing &#8211; don&#8217;t mistake this as &#8216;dex is hating on Japan/Japanese rap/rappers&#8217;. And I like Seeda (and what I&#8217;ve heard of Geek). I sorta wish I woulda done a proper Japanese rap show before I put this out, but I had to get this off my chest first. Look for an actual music episode coming soon.)</font></p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow116.mp3">MIXTAPE 116 &#8211; PRIORITIES</a></center></p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p>Happy new year, happy new president, hope you bought yourself a new hoodie instead of blowing it on chocolates for some dude/female who aint appreciate you anyway. Been a minute.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been curled up in a ball in your room, in the dark, whispering silently to yourself &#8220;man, I wish dex would hurry up and talk about something he has no business even opening his mouth about for over 12 minutes in an outro&#8221;, this is your episode. For those of you who haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s all good because you can just loop the tracks instead.</p>
<p>Priorities &#8211; we all have them.</p>
<p>Tracklist</p>
<p>Intro &#8211; <strong>Kev Brown </strong>- Keep On Instrumental. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/kevbrown">myspace.com/kevbrown</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Co$$ </strong>- Angelic feat <strong>Blu</strong></span>. Both of these dudes are dope. I can&#8217;t support the Power Rangers reference (never liked them dude(ette)s from the start, Ninja Turtles reigns supreme son), but Blu&#8217;s &#8220;we in the field tryna kill demons&#8221; for some reason makes me want to go play Final Fantasy or something.<a href = "http://www.myspace.com/paidthecoss">myspace.com/paidthecoss</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Bambu </strong>- Crooks and Rooks</span>. From LA to..uh, LA. Really, relistening to this track again, probably all of that nonsense at the end shoulda just been left to a close ear bent at this joint. I know I&#8217;m a little late on this, but this joint, along with the video, is some of the best rap music I have heard in a minute, period. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/bambumusic">myspace.com/bambumusic</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Primeridian </strong>- Money</span> feat Rashid Hadee and Pugz Atoms. True story &#8211; I found this cut, unlabeled, in my iTunes the other day, and dug it. I sent an email to Suhburb to double check that this was okay to blast on the show, and got a &#8220;uh, I didn&#8217;t write that song, fam&#8221; mail back. Lol wut? So I dug through my gmail box and it turns out it&#8217;s a Primeridian cut. Make no mistake, being mistaken for a Suhburb production is a good thing (come on, the drum work &#8211; doesn&#8217;t this sound like 06 era Suhburbia?), but seriously people gotta start <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/1016/are-you-a-rapper-get-on-bandcamp/">tagging their mp3s</a> &#8211; this &#8220;final mixdown 080707.mp3&#8243; business is getting old.<a href = "http://www.myspace.com/primeridian">www.myspace.com/primeridian</a></p>
<p>oh yeah, thanks to <a href="http://mamiko.nu">mamiko</a> for this ep&#8217;s design.  </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Tor Cesay</strong> &#8211; The Perch feat <strong>Flying Lotus</strong>, <strong>Phonte</strong>, and <strong>Oddisee</strong></span>. I got this sampler from (I think) Giant Step and it was sort of great. I really wanted to put some of the more grimy tracks up, but I ended up going with this one. Anyone out there more up on this person, the proper pronunciation of her name? <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/toruk">myspace.com/toruk</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Royce </strong>- Shake This</span>. I&#8217;m too tired to remember the original sample on this cut (help?), but I&#8217;m actually kinda into with it. The balance and intensity is pretty impressive. I like how the first verse is squeaky clean and then all of a sudden Royce flies into a flurry of curse words near the end of the second verse, and then it&#8217;s really all over. Also how his statement regarding his status with Primo is actually affirmed an appropriate sound effect. Seriously guys, Primo-style radio edits are so much better than album cuts. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Pax and Pry</strong></span> &#8211; Another group whose name I&#8217;m not quite sure how to pronounce. I forget who put me up on this group (they&#8217;re from NL, so maybe Ouxu? was this your doing?), but right now I am very thankful for their advice because they are sort of good. And, for anyone wondering how they might implement, sans bandcamp or any other outside party, some of the pushy &#8220;advice&#8221; given in this <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/1016/are-you-a-rapper-get-on-bandcamp/">previous post</a> aimed at independent rappidy rappers, their site is a good example. <a href = "http://www.paxandpry.com/">paxandpry.com</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Outro Instrumental &#8211; <strong>King Most Yancey Boys</strong> Megamix</span> (sliced, looped, etc).</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Eskibeat Public Service Announcement</strong></span> &#8211; as you probably noticed, that was a cover of the old <strong>Wiley </strong>&#8220;Eskimo&#8221; beat as produced by yours truly with a few minutes of spare time and a Nintendo DS. I&#8217;m totally serious, I expect to see a hit track pop up from over there produced on a DS. Also sorry about the whole echo effect thing, somebody told me UK people liked that sort of stuff so I was just trying to do some outreach. </p>
<p>Actually, if anyone wants the raw version of that track I can post it up.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what it is. While I&#8217;m not really confident that I expressed myself properly (or concisely) in the outro, I am serious about being worried that people that just randomly support any minority (choose your own definition for that word) artist, just for the sake of &#8220;supporting&#8221; them, are taking away from and cheapening the efforts those artists within that same group that <em>really are dope and truly do deserve respect</em> for putting out good music.</p>
<p>So yeah, does anyone have any thoughts on that? I&#8217;m sort of interested in hearing what people think about this.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow115.mp3">MIXTAPE 121 &#8211; DO GOOD THINGS</a></center></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Johnny? This is sort of a weird story and I&#8217;m not sure if it makes any sense the way I&#8217;m telling it, but yeah. This happened, and is still happening. </p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Fusion Unltd</strong> &#8211; The Sun feat <strong>Little Brother</strong>, <strong>Nickelus F</strong>, <strong>Hall of Fame</strong>, and <strong>Skillz</strong></span>. A producer that is sort of new to me. Lyrics ain&#8217;t bad either &#8211; &#8220;When I write I&#8217;m enlightening myself&#8221;? That&#8217;s sort of profound. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/fusionunltdfup">myspace.com/fusionunltdfup</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>H.O.P.E</strong> &#8211; Can&#8217;t Knock the Hustle II feat <strong>Raquel Rodriguez</strong></span>. The vocals are kinda on the edge of contributing and taking away from the cut, but overall I dig. <a href = "http://myspace.com/f2dhope">myspace.com/f2dhope</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Caltroit</strong> &#8211; Goatit feat <strong>Elzhi</strong> and <strong>Bishop Lamont</strong></span>. Off that recent Black Milk mixtape. This dude is sort of dope on the production. And come on, &#8220;raise your hands and see stars like King Hippo&#8221;? I hope I&#8217;m not the only one here who caught that. <a href = "http://myspace.com/blackmk">myspace.com/blackmk</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jim Jones</strong>, <strong>Noe</strong>, and <strong>Tom Gist</strong> &#8211; Christmas Eve</span>. Aside from dude feeling the need to do adlibs at the end of every bar, this is sort of a great song. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/jimjones">myspace.com/jimjones</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Rhymefest</strong> &#8211; Breakadawn feat <strong>Daniel Merriweather </strong>and <strong>alpha</strong></span>. I&#8217;ve dropped one cut from this tape before, but this is seriously a genius project. Don&#8217;t miss the skits. <a href = "http://myspace.com/rhymefest">myspace.com/rhymefest</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Wurd Munchaz</strong> &#8211; Shakespeare</span>. This is actually one of my favorite groups. If you don&#8217;t get the reference, I don&#8217;t know. You don&#8217;t spend enough time on the internet. <a href = "http://myspace.com/wurdmunchaz">myspace.com/wurdmunchaz</a></p>
<p>Okay, here:<br />
<img src = "http://mixtapeshow.net/gottogetpaid.jpg" width = "400px"><br />
<font size = "1">original: <a href = "http://marriedtothesea.com">marriedtothesea</a></font><br />
I mean, come on. A rap song based on an internet joke? What&#8217;s next?</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Cassius Clay</strong> &#8211; I Am The Greatest</span>. Yes, as in <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong>. I checked the latest Shaun Boothe Unauthorized Biography joint (you heard the Bob Marley joint here last episode), and he referenced Ali&#8217;s recording career. Apparently people have referred to his stuff as some of the first battle raps &#8211; and really, listening to this, I can&#8217;t disagree. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>John Robinson</strong> &#8211; Don King</span>. Shouts to <strong>JR</strong> for linking this one up &#8211; been a minute since we&#8217;ve had some of his material on the show. If we spin Ali, it&#8217;s only fair to spin something about Don King, right? Info about his latest project here: <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/thejohnrobinsonproject">myspace.com/thejohnrobinsonproject</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Thunderclaps</strong> &#8211; Judgement Day (short preview edit)</span>. Shouts to <strong>Charlee</strong> for hooking me up with this joint forever ago. I have the long edit, but for some reason I dig the quick pace of this one. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/thunderclapsmusic">myspace.com/thunderclapsmusic</a>.</p>
<p>instros:<br />
intro:<br />
<strong>Black Milk</strong> &#8211; Purple Track 3<br />
outros:<br />
<strong>Illa J</strong> &#8211; DFTF<br />
<strong>RJD2</strong> &#8211; Unlimited<br />
<strong>Scarface</strong> &#8211; In Cold Blood</p>
<p>So yeah. Go out and do something nice for one of your friends, or for somebody you don&#8217;t know.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow114.mp3">MIXTAPE 115 -YOU AINT EVEN GOTTA GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL</a></center></p>
<p>All the education you need is right here on the Mixtape Show.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe not &#8211; but I&#8217;ll keep the written short and say this &#8211; if you don&#8217;t get something out of every track on here, rewind. </p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>iLLiTe</strong> &#8211; Intro. Courtesy of CDR</span>. Easily coulda made the First Impressions episode, if, you know, it was out back then. New artist to me, but sounds good thus far. Side street it on empty. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/eyedouble">myspace.com/eyedouble</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; Exhibit A (Transformations)</span>. The early may have heard this a bit earlier this month, but hey, I&#8217;m putting in work here and things take time. Not much needs to be said here. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/jayelect">myspace.com/jayelect</a>.</p>
<p>Also this might sound sort of weird but something about the way Jay says &#8220;Nirvana&#8221; strikes me as kinda endearing.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Mr Scruff</strong> &#8211; After Time</span>. Not necessarily representative of all of dude&#8217;s work, but yeah. Short clip. Go dig. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/mrscruffofficial">myspace.com/mrscruffofficial</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Wu-Tang</strong> &#8211; I Can&#8217;t Go To Sleep feat <strong>Isaac Hayes</strong> (Live Version)</span>. Okay, I get that you invented the crying flow, fam, but serious? A little far maybe? I can&#8217;t front though, this one sort of goes hard.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>DJ Sprinkles</strong> &#8211; Midtown 120 Intro</span>. I discovered this earlier this morning. Sort of a counterexample to the intro. This one might change the way you think about house music &#8211; which should make you start thinking about hip-hop, considering the family tree. Check the release page <a href = "http://www.comatonse.com/releases/midtown120blues.html">here</a>, which includes the words to the track. æ—¥æœ¬èªžè¨³ã‚‚ã‚ã‚‹ã®ã§ã€æ˜¯éžãƒã‚§ãƒƒã‚¯ã—ã¦ã­ã€‚</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; Posers</span>. I&#8217;ve been holding onto this forever with the intention of putting it into a different themed episode that I sort of tossed. No information on the vocalist though. Anyone care to fill us in before I start having to write emails? </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Saroc</strong> &#8211; Motorbike</span>. The title won&#8217;t make much sense until the end. Sol &#8211; who was kind enough to send me this cut direct from the studio last week &#8211; on production.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Shaun Boothe</strong> &#8211; Unauthorized Biography of Bob Marley</span>. Seriously, this is like running through a Wikipedia article set to a beat, in a good way. Maybe if those stupid Multiplication Rap tapes my 2nd grade teacher gave me thinking I&#8217;d like it because I was Black were this good, I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten that D in Calculus senior year. I&#8217;m sort of looking forward to this Muhammad Ali joint. <a href = "http://myspace.com/shaunboothe">myspace.com/shaunboothe</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Madlib</strong> &#8211; Disco Break</span>. Yes, you&#8217;re supposed to learn something from this too. No excuses. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/madlib">myspace.com/madlib</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Wiley</strong> &#8211; I Was Lost</span>. I could never play this one on the radio back home because it had curses in it. Not the end of the world though, because I could still play Pies and Wot Do You Call it, and maybe that is making some of you UK kids roll your eyes but anyone who has the sheer nerve to end six consecutive bars with the words &#8220;no girlfriend&#8221; instead of thinking of actual rhymes on the first cut of their debut record is okay with me. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/eskiboywiley">www.myspace.com/eskiboywiley</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>e.s.t</strong> &#8211; Still (Radio Edit)</span>. In lieu of an outro, I guess. Shouts to Giant Step for the hookup.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; Exhibit A (Transformations) &#8211; Final Version</span>. Or at least that&#8217;s what it says on the tin. This sort of adds another level to the first mix, with more audio tweaking (but still a little reserved compared to old episode 82) but I like both, so here you go. Dig the outro.</p>
<p>Oh, also, <strong>supercali</strong>, there is a section in here that I absolutely expect you to identify. </p>
<p>Pencils down, put your answer sheet inside your test booklet, and pass your packets forward and to the left.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow113.mp3">MIXTAPE 113 &#8211; SKEETER WAS BLACK</a></center></p>
<p>I was originally going to talk about something else here, but all of a sudden I like felt the holy ghost or something and was inspired to talk about this. Seriously everyone, this is an important issue that I feel strongly about. I&#8217;ve actually had serious conversations about this. </p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p>Intro: <span class = "hilite"><strong>Copywrite</strong> &#8211; Fuck A Soundcheck (prod <strong>RJD2</strong>)</span></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Busta Rhymes</strong> &#8211; Packin Them Things (prod <strong>Kev Brown</strong>)</span>. This is just sort of a given. And even Busta Rhymes voted for Obama. You know where to find Busta, so go check out <a href = "http://myspace.com/kevbrown">myspace.com/kevbrown</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Blu</strong> and <strong>Mainframe</strong> &#8211; Hold On John</span>. Off of the Johnson and Jonson record, which you&#8217;ve been <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/tag/johnson-and-jonson/">hearing bits of</a> for the last couple years or so. Apparently the joint is actually out now, and it&#8217;s highly recommended. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a single cut on this record that I don&#8217;t like. I&#8217;ve said enough about this record before, so I&#8217;ll leave it at that. Shouts to <strong>Steve</strong> for this one. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/jandjbabyproducts">myspace.com/jandjbabyproducts</a>.</p>
<p><em>I mean, think about it.</em> The only dude who seemed to be able to dance. He could beatbox. He wore rappidy-rap style clothing &#8211; well, comparatively. Oddly enough, I never felt like this was stereotyping &#8211; I just naturally internalized that Skeeter was Black. I seriously can&#8217;t wrap my head around the fact that some people don&#8217;t get it. To my white friends &#8211; I like you all a lot, but sometimes you miss things. Very important things. Like which cartoon characters are which race.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Stanza</strong> &#8211; Do</span>. As heard previously on your favorite rap podcast, this is another selection off of Name This Album. The lyricism is sort of bizarrely great (trying to imagine the hand contortions in the beginning is alternately funny and amazing) and as with the rest of the cuts on here, there&#8217;s actually a message in here. And as I mentioned in the outro, Stanza has inexplicably put this entire record up online for free download &#8211; inexplicably because it&#8217;s easily worth the money. The record is dope. <a href = "http://www.mqrt.com/stanza-name-this-album/">Go get it here</a>, and check out the rest of the site at <a href = "http://www.mqrt.com/">mqrt.com</a>. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>MF Doom</strong> &#8211; Rapp Snitch Knishes feat <strong>Mr Fantastic</strong></span>. Does anyone actually know anything about Mr Fantastic? I mean, I could google the dude, I guess, but after listening to this, I&#8217;m realizing that I haven&#8217;t heard much of anything from the dude.<a href = "http://www.myspace.com/mfdoom">myspace.com/mfdoom</a>.</p>
<p><em>This of course</em>, is all based on when the show was on Nickelodeon. I quit watching when Disney took over. Actually I think at that point in my life I was a little busy to be watching cartoons (okay, it was just on at an inconvenient time. I definitely used run late for school because I wanted to catch the end of Pokemon).</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Q-Tip</strong> &#8211; Gettin&#8217; Up</span>. On the Dilla rework &#8211; you might have heard this one, but for those who haven&#8217;t &#8211; dope. This really is a proper rework. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/qtip">myspace.com/qtip</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Marlena Shaw</strong> &#8211; California Soul (Diplo remix)</span>. For real, when I read the track title before actually listening to it, I was both excited and worried to hear what sort of destruction Diplo would wreak on this classic &#8211; but it&#8217;s oddly restrained. It&#8217;s good. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/officialmarlenashaw">myspace.com/officialmarlenashaw</a>.</p>
<p>Outro: <span class = "hilite"><strong>Qwel</strong> and <strong>Kip Killagain</strong> &#8211; Heliocentric (Instrumental).</span> I actually like Qwel.</p>
<p><em>So, really.</em> Doug was clearly white, Skeeter was obviously Black. The logic doesn&#8217;t really run across color lines, however &#8211; I mean, what about Bee Bee? She&#8217;s blue too, but I never got &#8220;Black vibes&#8221; from her, if that&#8217;s an appropriate word. And reversewise, come to think of it, Patti was sort of ambiguous &#8211; mixed ancestry, perhaps? She was sort of dark. Connie was Asian. I&#8217;m fairly confident about that one.</p>
<p>Am I overthinking this? Any other theories are welcome.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and thoughts on the music. You know.</p>

<p><strong>Dex</strong> (2008 version) will be back next week (Earth time, maybe) with a new rap episode &#8211; or in the meantime I guess you can holler at him in the &#8220;comments section&#8221; of this &#8220;website&#8221;. <strong>Brothertron out</strong>.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow111.mp3">MIXTAPE 111 &#8211; HOW WAS YOUR SUMMER</a></center></p>
<p>So this, I guess, would be the third official Summer Mixtape. For those of you who are in Southern California &#8211; it&#8217;s probably still summer for you &#8211; so feel free to grab the first edition &#8211; <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0704/episode-42-summer-mixtape/">SUMMER MIXTAPE</a> (2006), the second one &#8211; <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0617/mixtape-75-backpacker-summer-in-la/">BACKPACKER/SUMMER IN LA</a> (2007), and then put it together with this one, and get on your Dyno with the black mags and bang out, kiddo.</p>
<p>As I said &#8211; I had a major hard drive crash and lost hella data (and some music &#8211; do your backups, kids, for serious) which caused the 3-week delay, but here we go. Let&#8217;s get into it:</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p>Intro &#8211; <span class = "hilite"><a href="http://www.myspace.com/thadreid">Thad Reid</a> &#8211; Cruzin feat Akshan.</span></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Stat Quo</strong> &#8211; Dear Summer (Part 2).</span> The follow-up to Part 1, which I probably would have put out were it not for the hard drive crash-induced delay. I don&#8217;t think I necessarily cared that much about Stat Quo&#8217;s life and/or career before hearing this series, but I have to say, this is sort of an interesting series that dude has been putting out. It&#8217;s sort of like the rap version of Livejournal. Or maybe that&#8217;s <strong>Atmosphere</strong>. So maybe this is more like the rap version of Caroline&#8217;s older sister&#8217;s Xanga, because I used to read that all the time and be like damn she&#8217;s cool. You ever do that? Interweb stalking is bad, kids. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/statquo">myspace.com/statquo</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>DJ Crazy Toones</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s A Demo Teaser.</span> This isn&#8217;t even a song, but I dig this cut. Some of the most ignorant statements on this episode are made by this man. I mean, I fully agree with the sentiment &#8211; too many people out there don&#8217;t understand how to put together a mixtape/cd/podcast, but come on, did we need that comment about Singapore? And why was the dude in Singapore? I mean, anybody can go to Singapore. I can go right now in probably like a few hours. Is there something special about Singapore that I don&#8217;t know? I mean, go to Tibet, fam, and I&#8217;ll be impressed. Maybe beat up a monk or something. Aside from that, this demo is just ridiculous. I really want to hear this mixtape now. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/djcrazytoones">myspace.com/djcrazytoones</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Birdman</strong> &#8211; Sun Come Up feat <strong>Rick Ross</strong> and <strong>T-Pain</strong>.</span> Nobody really cares about what Rick Ross did before he was a rapper, because 90% of the rap game is lying, ladies and gentlemen. It&#8217;s an act. Yes, it has ramifications on what happens out here, and it&#8217;s okay to get sucked into the drama on some suspension of disbelief, but é¨™ã•ã‚Œã‚‹ãªã€dig? I gave a talk at a high school earlier today and some kids in the audience were absolutely blown away that rappers weren&#8217;t you know, actually shooting people in real life. Remind me to tell you about the first time I ever saw the Beef DVD (hint &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t in the US). That said, I like this cut, and it&#8217;s probably the most &#8220;traditional&#8221; summer rap cut I got on here.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Guilty Simpson</strong> &#8211; Michigan Nights.</span> Okay, <strong>Guilty</strong> &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m like that cat you never liked but was scared to fight&#8221;. I&#8217;m actually thinking about this now and I can&#8217;t think of anyone I didn&#8217;t like to the point that I wanted to physically harm them but I was scared to actually give it a try. That said, I more or less quit fighting around age 12 or 13 (the age when people start bringing knives and guns to school fights). A lot of the time I wish rap songs were shorter &#8211; like on the 2 minute range &#8211; but this is one of those cuts where you&#8217;re glad you don&#8217;t have to be satisfied with a cut-up radio version. Cinematic. Dig it. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/guiltysimpson">myspace.com/guiltysimpson</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Replife</strong> &#8211; Do You Want To Pay A MF.</span> Interlude status. The album is good, though. Stay tuned.<a href = "http://www.myspace.com/danielgraykontarisreplife">myspace.com/danielgraykontarisreplife</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Double F</strong> &#8211; I-5 Merge.</span> I alluded to some superbly ignorant statements being made in this episode &#8211; and here they are. What is this dude even talking about? You&#8217;ve heard a cut off this tape <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/1215/mixtape-97-west-coast-winter/">before</a>, actually. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/mystadub">myspace.com/mystadub</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>U-N-I</strong> &#8211; Yesterday.</span> I think I was put up on these dudes last summer, and finally they make an appearance on the mixtape show. Kids set aside the A.D.I.D.A.S style swagger stuff for a minute and go somewhat serious for a minute. I like this cut. Shout-outs to <strong>Amanda</strong> for having the good sense to pick these kids up for <a href="http://blockparty.ucr.edu/">Block Party</a>. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/unimuzik">myspace.com/unimuzik</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Fatlip</strong> &#8211; What&#8217;s Up Fatlip? (Breakbot Remix).</span> Breakbot is a new name to me, but whoever the cat is did a pretty good job with this remix. Fatlip somehow sounds more pathetic on this cut, and the vocal glitching is just enough to be noticeable but not over the top on some Funkstorung (not that I don&#8217;t like Funkstorung). Like you can&#8217;t listen to this and not really feel bad for this dude. And we all have days like this&#8230;right? Right? <em>(I can&#8217;t find dude&#8217;s myspace.)</em></p>
<p>Guest Anouncement/åºƒå‘Šalude &#8211; <span class = "hilite"><strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/jimjones">Jim Jones</a></strong> &#8211; Pop Champagne feat <strong>Ron Browz</strong> and <strong>Juelz Santana</strong> (instrumental)</span>: I&#8217;m not going to write about it here since I&#8217;m still a little upset about it, but the end of this episode got cut off by someone you&#8217;ll probably recognize&#8230;looks like next week&#8217;s episode I&#8217;ll be taking a break.</p>
<p>And before I forget, shout out to <a href="http://mamiko.nu">Mamiko</a> again for handling the artwork on this joint because I still don&#8217;t have any image editing software yet.</p>
<p>So &#8211; how was your summer?</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow110.mp3">MIXTAPE 110 &#8211; STATE OF THE RAP UNION</a></center></p>
<p>So if there was a State of the Hip-Hop Union, I think one thing that we could probably count on would be that unlike any previous or current administration, we would get the straight, uncut reality of our current status. I mean, there would still be lying about what sort of dirt people did in the past or how many guns/cars/etc dudes owned &#8211; but yeah. I would tune in to watch that. </p>
<p>So the idea behind this is people from different angles telling us what our current situation is &#8211; some of them more indirect than others, some of them more violent than others, and hey, some of them even have some recommendations for us. Enough from me, let&#8217;s see what they have to say&#8230;</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Stereolab</strong> &#8211; Neon Beanbag</span> I think I must have been the one person at <a href="http://kucr.org">KUCR</a> that never actually played any Stereolab. Probably because I never really listened that much &#8211; my mistake. Everybody go out and buy Stereolab. Off the 4AD and Rough Trade 2008 Sampler, which is ridiculous. <a href = "http://www.stereolab.co.uk/">stereolab.co.uk</a>. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Young Jeezy</strong> &#8211; My President feat <strong>Nas</strong></span>. Leave it to Jeezy (yeeeeeeeahhhhh) to make a song where he praises a presidential candidate, damns the current president, and raves about his blue lambo in the same breath. I like this song.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>East Coast Avengers</strong> &#8211; Kill Bill O&#8217;Reilly</span>. I really wanted to get this episode out like four days ago, but technical difficulties prevented that. As I say in the episode itself &#8211; this track placement comes with zero disclaimers or apologies. I figure that in a genre where threatening other rappers for nothing is the norm &#8211; threatening somebody that actually deserves it is pretty sensible. ã¡ãªã¿ã«ã€the girl at the end probably deserves an award for best line in the song. East Coast Avengers is made up of <strong>Esoteric</strong>, <strong>Trademarc</strong>, and <strong>DC the Midi Alien</strong>. <a href = "http://eastcoastavengers.com/">eastcoastavengers.com</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Mic Legacy</strong> &#8211; So Ghetto feat <strong>Rapper Big Pooh</strong></span>. The instro on this is like the musical embodiment of the Minstrel Show cover plus being in church. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/miclegacydafuture">myspace.com/miclegacydafuture</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Crooked I</strong> &#8211; Paper Planes Remix/Block Obama</span>. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what the official title of this cut is. About 80% of the stuff this dude is talking about is totally ridiculous &#8211; including the random diatribe on claiming that stealing songs is &#8220;not hip-hop&#8221;. I&#8217;m not saying that stealing music is a good thing, but seriously, it seems like every time I turn around someone is telling me that something is &#8220;not hip-hop&#8221;. Eating broccoli is not hip-hop. And co-opting the &#8220;Change&#8221; line? There&#8217;s got to be something wrong with that, but I can&#8217;t hate. Anyway, this song is hip-hop, and it is over the Paper Planes riddim, which makes it extra good. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/crookedi">myspace.com/crookedi</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Elzhi</strong> &#8211; Colors</span>. Come on, it&#8217;s Elzhi. There&#8217;s something sort of surreal about this song &#8211; not just the imagery. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on it, but it&#8217;s a great song. You might need to play it back a few times to actually get what he&#8217;s doing. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/zhifi">myspace.com/zhifi</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Invincible</strong> &#8211; Locusts feat <strong>Finale</strong>, wsg <strong>Gwen Mingo</strong> and <strong>Ron Scott</strong></span>. Welcome to the reality that is Detroit. There&#8217;s a video to this as well &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave my commentary on this one out and just let you read the <a href="http://sweeneykovar.wordpress.com/2008/08/29/invincible/">interview</a>. Thanks to Sweeney Kovar for this one (and the one above, come to think of it). Album sounds like it&#8217;s definitely worth a purchase. <a href = "http://www.emergencemusic.net/">emergencemusic.net</a>. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Stranglers</strong> &#8211; Golden Brown</span>. Apparently everyone else and their mom has discovered this song recently and are trying to make beats out of it, but if you want to hear a proper drug song done properly by proper white people (nothing against Pink Floyd, I like you guys too), this would be a good joint to track down. <a href = "  http://www.myspace.com/thestranglers">myspace.com/thestranglers</a>.</p>
<p>See, told you I was back on track, sorta.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow109.mp3">MIXTAPE 109 &#8211; BEEN TOO LONG</a></center></p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m not dead. And no, the show is not dead, and I&#8217;m not planning on letting it die anytime soon. I&#8217;ve kinda been underground for a minute, just basically putting in work and getting my bars up on the school angle. It has, however, been far too long &#8211; maybe too long? Are you all still even <em>out there</em>? That said &#8211; let&#8217;s get into it:</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Intro Instrumental &#8211; <strong>9th Wonder</strong> &#8211; Black Album Rejects <a href="http://twitter.com/search/31">#31</a> (I think). </span></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Murs</strong> &#8211; Can It Be. </span>I couldn&#8217;t think of a better track to start this one off with. And no, I&#8217;m absolutely not hating on Murs. I remember the first time I actually saw the dude &#8211; he came to my university in a dirty white T shirt, old sneakers, and some pajama pants and rocked a show on what was basically a hill with some grass on it. Crazy show, and I&#8217;ve been a fan ever since. Dude is a dope rapper, he just happens to have made a song that confused me, and this joint more than makes up for that. And apparently he&#8217;s got a free record up &#8211; check out <a href="http://www.mursand9thwonder.com">www.mursand9thwonder.com</a>. And yes, when the new record comes out &#8211; <em>buy it</em>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; Defcon 4. </span>From what I can tell, this joint is at least 4 years old. Produced by <strong>Sol Messiah</strong> (fam hit me up), it&#8217;s a little more straightforward beatwise than the stuff we heard, say, on episode 82. Lyrically, it&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;d expect from the dude. Time to hit the library. <a href = "http://myspace.com/jayelect">myspace.com/jayelect</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Gif</strong> &#8211; Invisible (Ramona Moore).</span> I was eating dinner a few weeks ago with a kid from Hong Kong, a kid from Japan (duh), and a Kyrgyzstani, when the topic turned to the elections. The Kyrgyzstani dude said something about that he&#8217;d heard that there is no longer any racism in the US. Unfortunately he decided to say that when I was in the middle of trying to sip my soda so he definitely ended up with that joint all over his new shirt. I laughed that hard. I don&#8217;t know &#8211; maybe if you watch the news you get that impression &#8211; but I don&#8217;t watch the news, so I wouldn&#8217;t know (I have been, however, watching Japanese news, and that is a whole different story)&#8230;Dude was actually genuinely surprised when I had to set him straight. </p>
<p>Anyway, as I said, this song actually follows the seqence of an actual event. For some more info on what happened with Ramona Moore, you can check <a href="http://freehiphopnow.blogspot.com/2008/06/gif-invisible-ramona-moore.html">this blog post</a>. For Da Gif himself, check <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dagif">myspace.com/dagif</a>. Thank you for making this song, fam.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>East Flatbush Project</strong> &#8211; A Day In A Life feat <strong>Stress</strong>.</span> This cut is just dope. I don&#8217;t have too much to say about this. It&#8217;s been too long since we&#8217;ve had one of <strong>Spencer</strong>&#8216;s joints grace the Mixtape Show. This one is off the <a href="http://theeastflatbushproject.com">&#8220;First Born&#8221; EP</a> &#8211; a joint project with Spencer and Stress. Do yourself a favor and play this one a few times. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/theeastflatbushproject">myspace.com/theeastflatbushproject</a>. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Black Milk</strong> and <strong>Fat Ray</strong> &#8211; Take Control. </span>I&#8217;ve been sitting on this cut for a miiinute. Maybe it&#8217;s just the cymbals on this joint that do it for me &#8211; but they&#8217;re not exactly slacking in the lyrical department here either. <a href = "www.myspace.com/blackmk">myspace.com/blackmk</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Madlib</strong> &#8211; Go feat Guilty Simpson. </span> This song has some of the cruelest lyrics I&#8217;ve heard since, well, the <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0605/mixtape-108-suburban-sprawl/">last episode</a>. That Punk&#8217;d line, combined with the Black / white / Chinese man joint is just too much. <a href = "http://stonesthrow.com">stonesthrow.com</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">Outro Instrumental &#8211; <a href="http://myspace.com/410pharaohs">410 Pharaohs </a>- Fresh.</span></p>
<p>And yeah, I&#8217;ll get into the rap in japan thing at some point in the near future&#8230;</p>
<p>In the meantime, that&#8217;s what I got for this week. Holler at a scholar.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow108.mp3">MIXTAPE 108 &#8211; SUBURBAN SPRAWL</a></center></p>
<p><em>This is for those of you who have been sending emails and leaving comments asking when I was finally going to let go of some of the SuhBURB stuff I had stockpiled up&#8230;</em></p>
<p>As promised earlier (you did see the video, right?), the new Suburban Sprawl record is out. In case you missed it, Suburban Sprawl = Donwill (of Tanya Morgan) and probably the one producer that gets the most airtime (airtime? do you say that for a podcast?) on the Mixtape Show &#8211; SuhBURB. </p>
<p>So yes, the record is out. 40 minutes, 16 tracks, and highly recommended. And it&#8217;s on here. In its entirety, for free. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to keep my comments to myself for the time being, but lest you be wondering whether or not you should click that &#8220;play&#8221; button, keep the following three points in mind:</p>
<p>1. This is the best thing I&#8217;ve heard all year<br />
2. The last time I gave an entire episode to one artist/group, it was Jay Electronica. We all know how I feel about Jay Electronica<br />
3. wow</p>
<p>As you listen, you can check the <a href="http://mcdayjob.com/2008/06/04/donwill-suhburb-suburban-sprawl-free-download/">liner notes</a> featuring ridiculous commentary by both artists, and grab the full hi-fi version from the <a href="http://mcdayjob.com/2008/06/04/donwill-suhburb-suburban-sprawl-free-download/">official site</a>.</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">00 &#8211; Ridiculous-ass Mixtape Show drop by <strong>Suhburb</strong>. </span>Seriously fam, this is not what I had in mind when I asked for a drop.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">01 &#8211; The Tiki Torch.</span> I remember when I first got this beat. First time I played it out anywhere, it got a nod from Daedelus. I&#8217;m sort of glad they left it as is.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">02 â€“ Sittinâ€™ at the Bar Demo.</span> Ha! Tearing apart Ladder Theory from the base, I guess. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite">03 &#8211; Baltimore Bitch.</span> Words fail me.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">04 &#8211; Diwadiwadonald.</span> Wow, the bongos on this one. I think at this point I remembered why Donwill is sort of dope lyrically.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">05 &#8211; Salsoul.</span> This is one of the things that, for me, separates SuhBURB from other producers &#8211; the soul he puts into the kick drum programming. This obviously isn&#8217;t the only song where you&#8217;ll notice that, but dig the lows on this one.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">06 &#8211; Fly Me feat. Von Pea</span>.<em> (you heard this one earlier, but without the Von Pea verse, which is quite possibly the cruelest verse I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life.)</em></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">07 &#8211; Guilty.</span> Damn.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">08 &#8211; Night Time.</span> Am I the only one who thought of UGK at the end here?<br />
<span class = "hilite">09 &#8211; All Right.</span> When I first met Suhburb, I don&#8217;t even think he was really making that much rap music yet &#8211; he was a jungle producer. I&#8217;d been sitting on this track for a very long time &#8211; I wanted to drop it as part of the Soultronica Saga. I guess that will teach me to wait to drop a track. </p>
<p><span class = "hilite">10 &#8211; Slipknot.</span> Is this from the Brasil beat tape? </p>
<p><span class = "hilite">11 &#8211; The Words.</span> It&#8217;s joints like these that make me respect Don for actually having the nerve to rap on tracks like this. I think Suhburb makes beats that are hard to rap on on purpose.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">12 &#8211; Dead Ass.</span> Lyrically maybe the most powerful track for me on this project. Check this one.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">13 &#8211; Maybe.</span> More heavy content.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">14 &#8211; Audio Visual.</span> This song is sort of ridiculously cute. I mean, I&#8217;m not even mad they didn&#8217;t get to put Jack Davey on this one. Can we get this &#8220;girl at the time&#8221;&#8216;s name?</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">15 &#8211; The Champ (LP Version).</span>  Seriously, who raps over things like this? Something is wrong with both of these kids.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">16 &#8211; Funeral March.</span> Propane Pip dropped this one first, but it&#8217;s still dope. And by the way, Suhburb &#8211; you make fun of me for spinning slab music on my old radio joint, and then you turn around and drop a slowed version of this joint? Explanation? Also, the content here confused me until I read the <a href="http://mcdayjob.com/2008/06/04/donwill-suhburb-suburban-sprawl-free-download/">liner notes</a> &#8211; you should probably check them instead of reading this. </p>
<p>And there you have it. Burn it, share it, whatever. I&#8217;m still sort of scratching my head over the fact that this isn&#8217;t being sold for, you know, money.</p>
<p>So, obviously, I think that this record is dope. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thought I told you it was on again.</p>
<p>First and foremost, <em>thank you</em> to everyone for sticking around. I know it&#8217;s been a minute. I&#8217;ll try to explain more later, but for now, the episode:</p>
<p>This is a sidebar to the <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/category/soultronica/">Soultronica Saga</a> (which, yes, is still in the works&#8230;slowly, but in the works). I set the spaceship aside for a moment and we take a look at an alternate future of rap, jungle, and reggae music: Dubstep. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get right into the music:</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">The Tracklist</font>.</center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">intro: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/generalbayswate">DZ</a> &#8211; Strong On Ya.</span></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Loefah</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s Yours.</span> Well, might as well ease you all into it, right? Rough track. See if you can remember where this sample came from.  <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/loefah">myspace.com/loefah</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> and <strong>Zed Bias</strong> &#8211; The Cauldron. </span>From a BBC Benji B session, I think. This one I&#8217;ve got to say I did not see coming. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what the story is behind this one, but think about it &#8211; how many US rappers are willing to even consider jumping on a grime/dubstep/categorizemeplease track? Exactly. I think Zed produced this. I think. Courtesy of Sweeney Kovar.  <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/zedbias">myspace.com/zedbias</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Bug</strong> &#8211; Skeng feat <strong>Killa P</strong> and <strong>Flow Dan</strong>.</span> If you are wondering where the dub and reggae influence I was talking about comes in, listen to this. I remember the first time I heard this in that crazy art studio basement club that Pure Filth used to occupy. Absolutely bananas. I liked this one so much I used to refuse to listen to it unless it was on a real system. The lyrics, though &#8211; they are completely over-the-top ridiculous. Seriously. <a href = "www.myspace.com/thebuguk">myspace.com/thebuguk</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Rusko</strong> &#8211; William H Tonkers. </span>Remember me saying that you need a good set of headphones for this one? Exhibit B right here, kids (A was the last one). Dig the synth programming on this one. <a href = "www.myspace.com/ruskonfire">ruskonfire</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Nebulla</strong> and <strong>DJ Dore</strong> &#8211; Poppin (Dirtystep Remix) feat <strong>T.I.</strong> </span>I can&#8217;t say that I like this one better than the original, but it definitely goes kinda hard. The basswork on this one ain&#8217;t bad at all.ã€€<a href = "http://www.myspace.com/djnebulla">myspace.com/djnebulla</a>, <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/djdore">myspace.com/djdore</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Loefah</strong>: Voodoo (666) / <strong>Lord Finesse</strong>: Check the Method (<strong>DJ Premier</strong> Scratch Mix). </span>If you just couldn&#8217;t get into anything else on this ep, wait until this one. This may well be my favorite song on this episode (which is saying a lot considering my feelings towards The Bug). Ripped from the briliant Dubstep Sufferah Volume 3, which is highly recommended if you liked this one. <a href="http://grievousangel.com">grievousangel.com</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Moody Boys</strong> &#8211; Honey Remix feat <strong>Erykah Badu</strong>. </span>I take back what I said on the last one &#8211; if you can&#8217;t get into the other cuts, check <em>this</em> one. Seven minute, dubbed-out workout of one of the best new soul singles in recent memory. Brilliant. I think Mamiko likes this one. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/themoodyboyz">myspace.com/themoodyboyz</a>.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive shouts to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/PUREFILTHDUBSTEP">Pure Filth</a> for throwing some of the most inspiring jams I&#8217;ve ever had the privilege to attend.</p>
<p>And those who know me personally know that I don&#8217;t take statements like that lightly.</p>
<p>So yeah &#8211; while I&#8217;m certainly no dubstep expert, I know enough to know that I like this stuff. What do you think?</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow106.mp3">MIXTAPE 106 -TYPE A PERSONALITY</a></center></p>
<p>You all ever heard of this thing? Type A personality? It&#8217;s like I can&#8217;t even slow down here. Start up this episode, take a deep breath, and try to see the big picture here &#8211; it&#8217;s bigger than just your issues, kids.</p>
<p>Aside from that, though, I got two pairs of tickets to Nicolay + Kay shows to give away &#8211; one in each of these venues:<br />
April 12 â€“ The Forbidden City, Hollywood, CA<br />
April 18 â€“ The Black Cat, Washington, DC</p>
<p>So, I guess I&#8217;m supposed to do some sort of &#8220;contest&#8221; or something. I&#8217;ll make this one easy &#8211; <strong>just write me an email or leave a comment and tell me the number of the last Mixtape Show episode in which Nicolay appeared</strong>. Extra consideration given if you make the comment interesting. I&#8217;ll pick the winners pretty much asap. This will also be going on the Facebook thing too, so&#8230;get moving. Enough of that, let&#8217;s do it&#8230;</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p>Intro beat &#8211; <span class = "hilite"><strong>CL Smooth</strong> and <strong>Skyzoo</strong> &#8211; Perfect Timing instrumental.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Big Boi</strong> &#8211; Royal Flush feat <strong>Andre 3000</strong> and <strong>Raekwon</strong>.</span> It&#8217;s like the three of them sat down and said &#8220;Listen here, Andre. You rap good. Have like seven verses.&#8221; And Andre said &#8220;Okay&#8221;. And it was good. <a href = "http://myspace.com/outkast">myspace.com/outkast</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>The Roots </strong>- 75 Bars (<strong>Black</strong>&#8216;s Reconstruction).</span> I didn&#8217;t count them, but if there are 75 bars here, they are all good. Suburb put me up on this one and I&#8217;m still kicking myself for taking this long to actually get to it. I&#8217;m sometimes not too big on The Roots&#8217; recorded material, but this is just kind of great. Even if there are probably more niggas in this song than bars (bonus points for anyone that counts them up!). <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/theroots">myspace.com/theroots</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Percee P</strong> &#8211; Untitled Percee P Track.</span> Or at least that&#8217;s word-for-word how it was labeled on this CD. Dig the rhyme patterns that dude uses, and the Billy Jack quotes (I think I should check this film). Once again, kids &#8211; the bigger picture. &#8220;<em>Payback&#8217;s a bitch, America / Karma too</em>&#8221; <a href="http://www.myspace.com/perceep">myspace.com/perceep</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; Colors.</span> Seriously, fam? 45 seconds? Don&#8217;t worry, kids, I got more.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Guilty Simpson</strong> &#8211; Pigs.</span> I don&#8217;t think I really forsaw anyone attempting to rap over this <strong>Madlib</strong> jawn. Can&#8217;t hate on this dude for taking this one on, because he kinda tore it up. Quotable lines abound. <a href = "http://myspace.com/guiltysimpson">myspace.com/guiltysimpson</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Rhymefest</strong> &#8211; Mentor Mike feat <strong>Michael Jackson</strong>.</span> What could I possibly have been doing that was so important that I didn&#8217;t listen to this song until this morning? Wow. <a href = "http://myspace.com/rhymefest">myspace.com/rhymefest</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Spec Boogie</strong> &#8211; Bed Stuy.</span> The beat is just ridiculous. This one came highly recommended from our good friend Suburb, who is currently too busy eating Hot Chee-tos or something to let me listen to his new record. That&#8217;s fine, buddy. Spec, though &#8211; this is a great track. Plenty more of the same on his myspace. <a href = "http://myspace.com/specboogie">myspace.com/specboogie</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Nicolay</strong> and <strong>Kay</strong> &#8211; Grand Theft Auto.</span> Yes, the subject matter matches the title. If you dig this cut, hey, maybe try to get yourself a couple tickets. I really shoulda saved this for the next edition of the Nintendo Mixtape, but hey, who knows when that one&#8217;s gonna actually drop&#8230;<a href = "http://www.myspace.com/nicolay">myspace.com/nicolay</a>.</p>
<p>Outro beat &#8211; <span class = "hilite"><strong>Amplive / Radiohead</strong> &#8211; Weird Fishez. You all have the <a href="http://www.onesevensevensix.com/amplive/index.html">Amplive remixes of Radiohead&#8217;s In Rainbows</a>, right? Good.</p>
<p>Shouts to Aimee, and everyone else that made this episode possible. Bedtime.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow105.mp3">MIXTAPE 105 -THE NEW SOUL 5 &#8211; JIMMY JAM + TERRY LEWIS</a></center></p>
<p>Been a long time coming, but here we go with yet another installment of <strong>The New Soul</strong> (see whole series lineup <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/tag/the-new-soul/">here</a>), hosted by Mixtape Show comrade <strong>Black TK</strong>. This time, TK introduces &#8211; or re-introduces, us to two of the true pioneers of this soultronica sound &#8211; <strong>Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis</strong>. What they did with their drum programming and synthesizer lines was groundbreaking &#8211; and continues to influence producers of progressive music to this day. </p>
<p>For you old heads out there who remember these joints, take off those rose-tinted glasses and really listen to what these dudes are doing with their instrumentation, basslines, and production. Then compare with the next installment of the Soultronica Saga&#8230;coming quite soon. Or while you&#8217;re waiting, go listen to some of the old Soultronica episodes and hear whence people like Sa-Ra, J*Davey, and hell, Pharrell are taking their cues.</p>
<p>Tracklist: </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Cherrelle </strong>- I Didn&#8217;t Mean To Turn You On.</span> The bassline on this is mean!<br />
<span class = "hilite"><strong>Janet Jackson</strong> &#8211; Nasty. </span>The clarity of the snares on this cut is brilliant. I remember hearing this as a young child and thinking Janet was talking about boys that played in the muddy part of the sandbox.<br />
<span class = "hilite"><strong>The S.O.S. Band</strong> &#8211; No One&#8217;s Gonna Love You. </span>Check the processed 909 work and basslines on this one.<br />
<span class = "hilite"><strong>Janet Jackson</strong> &#8211; Making Love In The Rain.</span> I&#8217;ve always dug the muted trumpet sound, regardless of the genre. I think I have a Suburb beatflip of this one, now that I listen to this again.</p>
<p>Note that this is also a continuation to the <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/0430/mixtape-70-the-new-soul-2-origins/">Origins Episode</a> &#8211; highly recommended for some more early Soultronica sounds.</p>
<p>And on another note, I have some Black TK material that is going to absolutely blow your mind. I&#8217;m dead serious on this one. Blow your mind. Watch for that.</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow104.mp3">MIXTAPE 104 &#8211; DROPPIN SCIENCE</a></center></p>
<p>This week, a history lesson presented in the form of a bonus episode, mixed by the infamous <strong>J Rocc</strong> of the Beat Junkies. Ladies and gentlemen &#8211; <strong>Droppin&#8217; Science</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you who are not &#8220;up&#8221; on the &#8220;hip slang&#8221; of &#8220;today&#8217;s young hepcats&#8221;, <em>droppin&#8217; science</em> refers to when a professor or scientist accidentally allows a test tube to fall onto the floor. Appropriately enough, then, this mix features a slice of the Blue Note discography that served as the font and laboratory for a major chunk of the production behind many of our favorite rappidy-raps &#8211; right alongside some of those true and actually rappidy-raps.</p>
<p>The selection, of course, comes from the recent <strong>Blue Note</strong> release, Droppin&#8217; Science &#8211; Greatest Samples from the Blue Note lab, which presents the original samples in their untampered brilliance. Some of us may well have these songs already (on vinyl, no less), but for anyone that wants a pristine copy of ten of the most-often raided jawns next to the Funky Drummer, this is not a bad choice. Or, hell, if you&#8217;re a producer, see if you can sample a different part of The Edge and make it sound as legendary.</p>
<p>And of course, I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention a good portion of the reason for posting this episode up while I prepare for the next one &#8211; <strong>I&#8217;ve got 5 free copies of this one on hand to give out</strong> to anyone who wants one. 3 are going out on this site, 2 are going out exclusively to Mixtape Show Facebook Group members &#8211; so join up.</p>
<p>Want one? Pretty easy &#8211; if you listen to this mix, you&#8217;ll hear, as noted above, some of the actual sampled cuts right next to some of the better-known tracks that sample them. Just name any one of the many hip-hop classics that you hear in this episode below &#8211; artist and track, please &#8211; and based upon how quick you are and how much I like you, I&#8217;ll get you a copy shipped out. <strong>Post your answers in the comments</strong>. <font size = "1"><em>(If you&#8217;ve won something in the past, feel free to name cuts, but we&#8217;re trying to let everyone get a chance here, dig?)</em></font></p>
<p>For those interested in the tracklist of the actual CD you&#8217;ll be winning (and if you don&#8217;t win, might as well cop it): </p>
<blockquote><p>1. It&#8217;s Your Thing- Lou Donaldson<br />
2. Mystic Brew- Ronnie Foster<br />
3. Think Twice- Donald Byrd<br />
4. The Edge- David McCullum<br />
5. Oblighetto- Brother Jack McDuff<br />
6. Get Out Of My Life Woman- Joe Williams<br />
7. Down Here On the Ground- Grant Green<br />
8. Spinning Wheel- Lonnie Smith<br />
9. Howling For Judy- Jeremy Steig<br />
10. Who&#8217;s Making Love- Lou Donaldson</p></blockquote>
<p>But for this episode itself &#8211; for the first time in Mixtape Show history, no tracklist. I&#8217;m gonna let you all fill that one out. For the n00bs among us, this is your first introduction to what we in &#8220;the know&#8221; call &#8220;diggin in the crates&#8221;, which of course dates back to the old Chinese railroad workers that would dig about in crates full of railroad ties for particularly shiny specimens which they would sell on the black market so that they could afford Mobb Deep records. It&#8217;s an exciting world, ladies and gentlemen, and we welcome you.</p>
<p>And hey, bonus, you can listen to this one at work and not get in trouble. No curses!</p>

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow103.mp3">MIXTAPE 103 &#8211; BEAT JACKS + REMIXES 3</a></center></p>
<p>So this episode should answer all questions about who I voted for. Let&#8217;s cut the typing and do the rundown, shall we?</p>
<p>(but before I do that &#8211; remember that you can embed this episode in your myspace, blog, etc! Look above!)</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist!</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Mobb Deep</strong> &#8211; Shook Ones (MF Doom Remix).</span> I don&#8217;t think I need to say much about this one. The original was great, this one is possibly greater. <strong>Doom </strong>is just <em>stupid </em>as a producer. Who needs extra drums? Classic. I won&#8217;t be mad at you if you rewind just for this one. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/mfdoom">myspace.com/mfdoom</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Zero 7</strong> &#8211; Somersault (<strong>Dangermouse </strong>Remix feat <strong>MF Doom</strong>).</span> And <strong>Doom </strong>shows up as an MC this time. I had a very good friend once that played Zero 7 incessantly whenever I was at her place. I probably know all the songs from their first CD by heart, and I don&#8217;t even know what the album cover looks like. One of the odd joints out where Doom actually attempts to tell a(n ostensibly) coherent story. Simple, but dope production. Don&#8217;t get it twisted though &#8211; Zero 7 is great by itself. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/zero7official">myspace.com/zero7</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Amplive </strong>- Video Tapez (feat Del the Funky Homosapien).</span> Off the<strong> Zion I</strong> member&#8217;s somewhat infamous Radiohead &#8211; In_Rainbows remix album. There are obvious comparisons to be drawn to <strong>Dangermouse</strong>&#8216;s Grey Album, but it&#8217;s still a good (and free) record. It raises a lot of questions (doesn&#8217;t everything nowadays, though?) about media ownership and rights, as well. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/amplive">myspace.com/amplive</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Donwill </strong>- Camp Cupcake.</span> Off the Beat Thieves Vol 2 record. I will leave the title alone and say that I dig this cut.<a href = "http://myspace.com/donwont">myspace.com/donwont</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite">vicolude &#8211; <a href="http://myspace.com/daedelusdarling">Daedelus </a>- Playing Parties (<strong>Yesterday&#8217;s New Quintet</strong> &#8211; The Stars Remix).</span> Featuring a very prominent figure from my childhood. Okay, who am I kidding &#8211; my teenhood and nascent adulthood.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Daedelus </strong>- Obama 2008 feat <strong>Shariq </strong>and <strong>Taz </strong>of <strong>Sa-Ra</strong>.</span> This song is so ridiculous it&#8217;s not even funny. Wait, it is. This is the jam, official, game over, I could play this 20 times and it would make a great episode. I don&#8217;t know why they have to be so dismissive about my mother&#8217;s opinions &#8211; I think she may very well have voted for Obama. I should ask her. By the way, if you ever get the chance to see Daedelus &#8211; do so. It&#8217;s brilliant.<a href="http://myspace.com/daedelusdarling">myspace.com/daedelus</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Donwill </strong>- Go Head (beatjackee = <strong>Wale Oyejide</strong>).</span> I&#8217;m not sure what Mr. <strong>Oyejide</strong> is doing about the inevitable mixup between him and the other Wale, but I&#8217;ve always dug the former&#8217;s production. Look for more <strong>Donwill </strong>soon, by the way, as soon as I get that Suburban Sprawl record&#8230;</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Q-Tip</strong> &#8211; Breathe and Stop (<strong>Iain Haywood</strong> remix).</span> More solid production work from <strong>Iain</strong> &#8211; dig the saxophones! What, you&#8217;ve heard his stuff before, right? Do your homework. <a href = "http://myspace.com/12pads">myspace.com/12pads</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Muja Messiah</strong> &#8211; Paper Planes (feat <strong>Manifest</strong>).</span> <strong>M.I.A.</strong> gets the beatjack treatment this time (about time, that Piracy Funds Terrorism Vol 1 was pretty much grand larceny &#8211; can we get a Vol 2, by the way?). I obviously like this song. I guess I should be a little troubled that the &#8220;activist&#8221; message has been lost in this version, but really activism is for pansies anyway. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/mujamessiah">myspace.com/mujamessiah</a>.</p>
<p>I kid.</p>
<p>Bonus cut &#8211; </p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Cappadonna </strong>- Slang Editorial (<strong>Madlib </strong>Remix).</span> Or at least that&#8217;s who it&#8217;s credited to, I just happened upon this track while I was mixing this episode down. Remember Cappadonna? That dude was cool. I&#8217;d listen to a Cappadonna record. Apparently he actually made some records, but all I remember hearing about him after Triumph was that he was driving taxis. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/madlib">myspace.com/madlib</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s this episode&#8230;what&#8217;s good?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[MIXTAPE 102 -THE MAMIKO SHOW Yeah, so that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve been the last few days. I got my wisdom teeth pulled, and you know how they usually give you a choice between getting knocked out or just doing anaesthesia?

<a href = "http://mixtapeshow.net/audio/mixtapeshow102.mp3">MIXTAPE 102 -THE MAMIKO SHOW</a></center></p>
<p>Yeah, so that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve been the last few days. I got my wisdom teeth pulled, and you know how they usually give you a choice between getting knocked out or just doing anaesthesia? Well, the surgeon took one look at my X-rays and said &#8220;Son, we generally like to give our patients a choice in the matter, but you&#8217;ve got four impacted choppers in there, and I&#8217;m gonna have to put you under. No arguments accepted.&#8221; I&#8217;ll spare you the bloody details, but suffice to say that there was a lot of sawing involved and I&#8217;m not able to talk just yet.</p>
<p>Now, most people would just take a break and enjoy the vacation from rappidy rap podcasts, but I promised myself February would be special. But I was in no condition to speak into a mic &#8211; so a few scrawled messages on napkins, promises I have no intention of honoring, and sad puppydog looks later, I managed to con Mamiko into recording the intro for me. Everybody, please, a round of applause for <a href="http://mamiko.nu">Mamiko</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of good music this episode &#8211; let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<p><center><font size = "4">Tracklist</font></center></p>
<p><span class = "hilite">mamikolude &#8211; <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/bullionness">Bullion</a> &#8211; God Only Knows.</span> Yes, the Beach Boys flip. I gotta put this dude on &#8211; next beattape, I promise.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Labratz </strong>- Grow.</span> Is <a href="http://mixtapeshow.net/tag/labratz/">Labratz</a> a new name to you? It shouldn&#8217;t be. More of the same raw post-production (especially on the  I mentioned the first time I played these dudes. Too many quotables in here, but all the same &#8211;  &#8220;It gotta precipitate / Before you levitate&#8221;. Take that one with you today.<a href = "http://www.myspace.com/thelabratzmusic">myspace.com/thelabratzmusic</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; When The Levees Broke.</span>  I&#8217;m not sure who produces some of these more unconventional tracks (it may well be Jay himself, come to think of it), but the understatedness of this cut&#8230;man, just listen.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Jay Electronica</strong> &#8211; Departure.</span>  The title of the second part of this cut (not included here &#8211; next time!) is what inspired my original name for this episode before Mamiko took it over, but the spirit is still there. Vividly autobiographical track. See that &#8220;embed&#8221; function up here? You might consider using that to share this with your friends.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Penuckle </strong>- I Love Being Black.</span>  As do I. I&#8217;ve been meaning to get Penuckle on the show for some time, so when he hit me with the track just before February kicked off, I knew this one was a given. Black History Month &#8211; do your research. Thanks again, P (by the way, who handled production on this one?). <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/penuckle">myspace.com/penuckle</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>G.L.C.</strong> &#8211; Honor Me.</span>  <em>Not </em>the Welsh group. Not them. No. The flow and beat on this are obviously dope, but what does it for me is that extra vocal tweaking on there. Everyone, more delay, please. The trash talking at the end is kinda funny, but doesn&#8217;t take away from the intensity of the track. Shouts to Vince for putting me up on this track. <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/glc">myspace.com/glc</a>.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>C.L. Smooth</strong> &#8211; Multi Barz of Fury (prod. <strong>Pete Rock</strong>).</span>  Yes, you read that right. Is the coldness between the two masters over? I have no idea, and technically this isn&#8217;t that much of a new track considering that Pete released this cut on the Surviving Elements as an instrumental called &#8220;You Remind Me&#8221;. So what does this mean, CL? Are more Pete/CL collabs on the way? <a href = "http://www.myspace.com/clsmoothmusic">myspace.com/clsmoothmusic</a></p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Saroc</strong> &#8211; Black Dot.</span></span>   Exclusive courtesy of Sol Messiah (Labratz). I got an email from dude referring to Saroc as his &#8220;secret weapon&#8221; with this cut attached. I&#8217;m not sure how much longer he&#8217;s going to be able to keep her a secret, but the lyrics are definitely impressive. The production? Signature Sol. Make sure to play this back a couple times to make sure you&#8217;re absorbing it all &#8211; in the meantime, I&#8217;m waiting for more from Saroc.</p>
<p><span class = "hilite"><strong>Erykah Badu</strong>- Real Thing (prod. <strong>Madlib</strong>).</span>  Anyone else out there miss Erykah? Fortunately we won&#8217;t have to wait that long &#8211; her new record is coming pretty soon. I wouldn&#8217;t mind hearing more collaborations between these two. <a href = "http://myspace.com/erykahbadu">myspace.com/erykahbadu</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited for the rest of this month. I&#8217;ll post the particulars in a bit, but I&#8217;m craving milkshakes again. Thoughts on the show are welcome, as are suggestions for food that won&#8217;t make me pass out.</p>
