</div><br /><br />2008 Asian champions Gamba Osaka have been cast fully six points adrift of safety ahead of the J. League’s three-week break for the World Cup qualifiers, after Masanobu Matsunami’s men surrendered a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 at home to newly-promoted Sagan Tosu on Friday night.<br /><br />The hosts at Banpaku did get off to the perfect start when, in just the third minute, Paulinho successfully closed down Ryuhei Niwa and sent in a cross for Takahiro Futagawa to open the scoring on his return to the starting XI after five games on the sidelines.<br /><br />Gamba continued to dominate and created a succession of good chances, Yasuyuki Konno going closest when his header struck the right-hand goalpost. But having been frustrated with the 1-0 half-time scoreline, they finally extended their advantage midway through the second period when Akihiro Sato extended a toe to reach Yasuhito Endo’s cross.<br /><br />However, as the home fans continued to celebrate what looked like an assured victory, Tosu hit back right from the restart, when Yohei Toyoda managed to flick a long throw from Naoyuki Fujita inside the far post with the back of his head.<br /><br />Instantly, the momentum of the game flipped completely, and Gamba’s fragile confidence subsided further when Fujita curled the ball home for the equaliser and his own first ever J1 goal with four minutes left on the clock.<br /><br />The hosts sought in vain for a winner but were again caught on the breakaway, and Fujita slotted calmly past Atsushi Kimura to steal all three points for Sagan with the final kick of the game.<br /><br />Nagoya Grampus are another big club with a disappointing league position to ponder over the break after they succumbed to a third successive home defeat, losing 1-0 to Gamba’s city rivals Cerezo Osaka.<br /><br />Brazilian forward Kempes netted the only goal of the game early in the second period following a fine solo run from Kim Bo-Kyung, and a below-par Nagoya were unable to hit back despite Cerezo forward Ryuji Bando seeing red with still half an hour remaining.<br /><br />The result lifts Cerezo above Grampus on goal difference with 17 points, alongside defending champions Kashiwa Reysol who beat Albirex Niigata 2-0 on Saturday. Niigata, like Gamba, remain stuck on just nine.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />At the top, Vegalta Sendai’s lead is down to two points after they came out second best in a five-goal thriller away to Kawasaki Frontale.<br /><br />The visitors fought back from Yu Kobayashi’s opener to lead 2-1 through sensational strikes from Shingo Tomita and Wilson, but Kyohei Noborizato levelled things up again before Takuro Yajima’s header won it for Kawasaki in the final minute.<br /><br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima held onto second with a straightforward 3-1 victory away to bottom club Consadole Sapporo, while Jubilo Iwata leapfrogged local rivals Shimizu S-Pulse into third thanks to a 4-0 drubbing of Omiya Ardija. S-Pulse were held to a goalless draw at home to Yokohama F Marinos.<br /><br />Akira Nishino’s first game in charge of Vissel Kobe did not quite go according to the script, as his side fell two down at home to Kashima Antlers and missed a number of chances before ultimately losing 2-1.<br /><br />FC Tokyo drew 1-1 with Urawa Reds in Saturday’s late game.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	Japan warmed up for their forthcoming World Cup qualifiers with a 2-0 friendly win over Azerbaijan in Shizuoka last Wednesday. Shinji Kagawa gave the Samurai Blue the lead shortly before half time, before an Agil Nabiyev own goal in the second period.<br />-	Alberto Zaccheroni will now lead his side into competitive battle with home games in Saitama against Oman on Sunday 3 June and Jordan on Friday 8 June, before heading to Australia to face the Socceroos on Wednesday 12 June.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 13)</strong><br />Gamba Osaka 2-3 Sagan Tosu<br />Nagoya Grampus 0-1 Cerezo Osaka<br />Consadole Sapporo 1-3 Sanfrecce Hiroshima<br />Kawasaki Frontale 3-2 Vegalta Sendai<br />Shimizu S-Pulse 0-0 Yokohama F Marinos<br />Jubilo Iwata 4-0 Omiya Ardija<br />Vissel Kobe 1-2 Kashima Antlers<br />Kashiwa Reysol 2-0 Albirex Niigata<br />FC Tokyo 1-1 Urawa Reds<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 16)</strong><br />Kyoto Sanga 1-0 Giravanz Kitakyushu<br />Thespa Kusatsu 0-0 Matsumoto Yamaga<br />Gainare Tottori 2-5 Yokohama FC<br />Avispa Fukuoka 1-1 Fagiano Okayama<br />Oita Trinita 0-2 JEF United Chiba<br />Tochigi SC 3-2 Tokyo Verdy<br />Machida Zelvia 0-0 Mito HollyHock<br />Shonan Bellmare 0-0 Tokushima Vortis<br />Roasso Kumamoto 2-1 Montedio Yamagata<br />FC Gifu 0-3 Ventforet Kofu<br />Ehime FC 0-1 Kataller Toyama<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>International friendly<br />Japan 2</strong>-0 Azerbaijan<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br /> <br />Hisashi Kurosaki has resigned as manager of Albirex Niigata in the wake of a 6-1 home drubbing at the hands of Jubilo Iwata which left his team five points adrift of safety.<br /> <br />The visitors raced into an early two-goal lead thanks to close range strikes from Cho Byung-Kuk and Ryoichi Maeda, before a second yellow card for Albirex defender Kim Jin-Su just before half time dealt a fatal blow to any hopes of avoiding a seventh league defeat of the campaign.<br /><br />Jamaican-born Musashi Shingo was introduced for his debut at the start of the second half and immediately made an impact with series of dazzling solo runs, winning the free kick from which Seiya Fujita pulled one back via the head of an opposing defender.<br /><br />But by that point, Iwata had already added a third through Yuki Kobayashi, and they continued on in relentless fashion to storm away with further goals from Takuya Matsuura, Maeda, and Hiroki Yamada in the final quarter of the match.<br /><br />There was an even worse humiliation in store for bottom side Consadole Sapporo, as they went down 7-0 to a Kashima Antlers outfit whose season continues to swing between the sublime and the ridiculous.<br /><br />Without a goal in three league matches prior to Saturday, Jorginho’s men had two in the opening quarter of an hour after a move brilliantly started and finished by central defender Daiki Iwamasa was followed by a penalty from Yuya Osako.<br /><br />Sapporo thought that Ryuji Kawai had pulled one back only for the officials to rule that the ball had not crossed the line, and their hopes quickly faded further when Japan under-23 captain Kazuya Yamamura netted his first J. League goal for Kashima shortly before the interval.<br /><br />Antlers were in rampant mood throughout the second period with four further players finding the scoresheet – Shinzo Koroki, Masashi Motoyama, Juninho, and Yasushi Endo.<br /><br />Gamba Osaka complete the bottom three after they could only move level on points with Niigata, albeit with one game in hand, following a scoreless draw away to Yokohama F. Marinos.<br /><br />Yuji Nakazawa looked to have unwittingly bundled the visitors into the lead only for his own goal to be disallowed for a push by his namesake, Gamba defender Sota. Marinos then had the ideal opportunity to seal a fifth straight league win when Manabu Saito was clipped by Daiki Niwa, only for former Japan star Shunsuke Nakamura to strike the crossbar with the resulting penalty kick.<br /><br />Champions Kashiwa Reysol pulled level with Cerezo Osaka, five points clear of the drop zone, as two assists from Hiroki Sakai laid on a 2-1 away win at the Nagai Stadium.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Despite the slight wobble that had seen them pick up just two points from their previous three matches, Vegalta Sendai laid down another marker of their championship credentials by stretching their lead back out to five with a 4-0 rout of Nagoya Grampus.<br /><br />In another decisively efficient performance, Sendai took the lead on 38 minutes through a tight-angled finish from Ryang Yong-Gi, who then sent in a corner for Shingo Akamine to head in via the unfortunate Takahiro Masukawa right on half time.<br /><br />Grampus sent Marcus Tulio Tanaka up front as they looked to hit back in the second half, but when his 86th-minute attempt was superbly cleared off the line by Jiro Kamata, Vegalta broke for Wilson to coolly seal the win seconds thereafter. Naoki Sugai added a fourth in added time.<br /><br />The chasing pack has become more condensed than ever after Yuki Abe’s solitary goal gave Urawa Reds a 1-0 win over 10-man Shimizu S-Pulse, who fall to third on goal difference. Sanfrecce Hiroshima are up to second after a thrilling late goal rush saw them beat Vissel Kobe 3-2.<br /><br />Kawasaki Frontale climb to seventh thanks to a 2-0 victory at Omiya Ardija, while a hat-trick from substitute Kazuma Watanabe in the final quarter of an hour allowed FC Tokyo to recover from two down and dramatically edge Sagan Tosu 3-2.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	Impressive wins in midweek for Kashiwa Reysol and Nagoya Grampus, away at Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors and at home to Central Coast Mariners respectively, saw them clinch their places alongside FC Tokyo in the last 16 of the Asian Champions League.<br />-	Cerezo Osaka have announced that Japan attacking midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake will leave the club for Bundesliga side 1.FC Nürnberg on 1 July.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 12)<br /></strong>Yokohama F Marinos 0-0 Gamba Osaka<br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima 3-2 Vissel Kobe<br />Albirex Niigata 1-6 Jubilo Iwata<br />Urawa Reds 1-0 Shimizu S-Pulse<br />Omiya Ardija 0-2 Kawasaki Frontale<br />Kashima Antlers 7-0 Consadole Sapporo<br />Vegalta Sendai 4-0 Nagoya Grampus<br />Cerezo Osaka 1-2 Kashiwa Reysol<br />FC Tokyo 3-2 Sagan Tosu<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 15)<br /></strong>Montedio Yamagata 2-1 FC Gifu<br />Mito HollyHock 0-2 Ehime FC<br />Matsumoto Yamaga 0-2 Yokohama FC<br />Kataller Toyama 0-1 Avispa Fukuoka<br />Tokushima Vortis 3-0 Gainare Tottori<br />Giravanz Kitakyushu 1-5 Tokyo Verdy<br />Ventforet Kofu 2-0 Thespa Kusatsu<br />Tochigi SC 1-1 Shonan Bellmare<br />JEF United Chiba 4-0 Roasso Kumamoto<br />Fagiano Okayama 1-2 Kyoto Sanga<br />Oita Trinita 2-1 Machida Zelvia<br /><br /><br /><strong>AFC Champions League group stage results (East Asia, matchday 6)<br /></strong>Group E<br /><strong>Gamba Osaka (JPN) 0</strong>-2 Adelaide United (AUS)<br />Bunyodkor (UZB) 1-0 Pohang Steelers (KOR) <br /><em>Final standings: ADELAIDE UNITED 13, BUNYODKOR 10, Pohang Steelers 9, Gamba Osaka 3<br /></em><br />Group F<br />Brisbane Roar (AUS) 1-1 Beijing Guoan (CHN)<br />Ulsan Hyundai (KOR) 1-<strong>0 FC Tokyo (JPN)</strong><br /><em>Final standings: ULSAN HYUNDAI 14, FC TOKYO 11, Brisbane Roar 3, Beijing Guoan 3<br /></em><br />Group G<br /><strong>Nagoya Grampus (JPN) 3</strong>-0 Central Coast Mariners (AUS)<br />Tianjin Teda (CHN) 0-3 Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma (KOR) <br /><em>Final standings: SEONGNAM ILHWA CHUNMA 10, NAGOYA GRAMPUS 10, Central Coast Mariners 6, Tianjin Teda 3<br /></em><br />Group H<br />Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors (KOR) 0-<strong>2 Kashiwa Reysol (JPN)</strong><br />Buriram United (THA) 1-2 Guangzhou Evergrande (CHN) <br /><em>Final standings: GUANGZHOU EVERGRANDE 10, KASHIWA REYSOL 10, Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors 9, Buriram United 6<br /></em><br /><br /><strong>Yamazaki Nabisco Cup group stage results (matchday 4)<br /></strong>Group A<br />Kawasaki Frontale 0-3 Urawa Reds<br />Cerezo Osaka 2-1 Sanfrecce Hiroshima<br />Sagan Tosu 3-2 Jubilo Iwata<br /><br />Group B<br />Omiya Ardija 1-1 Consadole Sapporo<br />Vissel Kobe 1-2 Shimizu S-Pulse<br />Yokohama F Marinos 3-2 Kashima Antlers<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

Marinos, the 26-year-old spotted the opposing goalkeeper Hiroki Iikura standing on the edge of his penalty area and launched an incredible, unstoppable shot from well inside his own half – behind even the centre circle.<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gUGA9NYwQZs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />The dramatic opening was as good as it got for Hiroshima, however, as Marinos fought back with three goals of their own to seal a fourth successive league victory. Marquinhos levelled the scores on his first start since returning to the club where he first spent a season back in 2003, while Manabu Saito and Seitaro Tomisawa both netted late in the second half.<br /><br />Having failed to muster a single win in their first seven matches, the quick resurgence in form has now taken Yasuhiro Higuchi’s side into the top half of the table.<br /><br />Jubilo Iwata were the weekend’s big movers, with a 3-0 defeat of struggling Kashima Antlers catapulting them up to fourth in the table after all six of the sides that had begun proceedings ahead of the Shizuoka club failed to take three points.<br /><br />Ryoichi Maeda headed Iwata into a tenth minute lead, before Takuya Matsuura and the impressive Hiroki Yamada added gloss to the scoreline with two well-taken strikes in the final ten minutes.<br /><br />Second-placed Shimizu S-Pulse needed a dramatic equaliser from Alex Brosque with the final kick of the game to rescue a point at home to Cerezo Osaka, who had led through Yoichiro Kakitani’s first ever J1 goal, but leaders Vegalta Sendai were unable to take advantage as they were also forced to come from behind to draw 1-1 at the other Osaka club, Gamba.<br /><br />A low, curling shot from Shu Kurata looked set to secure a much-needed three points for the crisis-ridden 2005 champions, but Ryang Yong-Gi and Shingo Akamine combined on their respective returns from injury for the latter to head home an equaliser on 78 minutes.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Elsewhere, title holders Kashiwa Reysol moved clear of the relegation zone with a welcome 2-0 victory away to Kawasaki Frontale. Masato Kudo scrambled the visitors in front midway through the second half, before Jorge Wagner sealed the points with his second in two games late into stoppage time.<br /><br />Nagoya Grampus are up to eighth after putting their recent losing run to an end with a 1-0 win at Vissel Kobe thanks to a single Keiji Tamada strike shortly before half time. FC Tokyo rise to sixth after a first-minute goal from Yohei Kajiyama proved enough to edge fellow newly-promoted side Consadole Sapporo by the same scoreline.<br /><br />Urawa Reds could only draw 1-1 at home to third-from-bottom Albirex Niigata despite a sixth league goal of the season for Marcio Richardes, while a last-minute own goal by the unfortunate Yu Hasegawa of Omiya Ardija preserved Sagan Tosu’s unbeaten home record.<br /><br />The middle order remains typically congested, with just five points separating Sanfrecce in third from Cerezo in 14th.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	It is ‘as you were’ at the top of J2 as both Montedio Yamagata and Shonan Bellmare were held to 1-1 draws; away to Avispa Fukuoka and at home to Oita Trinita, respectively.<br />-	With Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the stands, Shinji Kagawa scored after just three minutes to set Borussia Dortmund on their way to a German domestic double and a 5-2 thrashing of Bayern Munich in the final of the DFB-Pokal.<br />-	Kashiwa and Japan U-23 right-back Hiroki Sakai is set to become the next Japanese representative in the Bundesliga, with a move to Hannover 96 now close to completion.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 11)<br /></strong>Consadole Sapporo 0-1 FC Tokyo<br />Jubilo Iwata 3-0 Kashima Antlers<br />Sagan Tosu 1-1 Omiya Ardija<br />Kawasaki Frontale 0-2 Kashiwa Reysol<br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima 1-3 Yokohama F Marinos<br />Shimizu S-Pulse 1-1 Cerezo Osaka<br />Urawa Reds 1-1 Albirex Niigata<br />Vissel Kobe 0-1 Nagoya Grampus<br />Gamba Osaka 1-1 Vegalta Sendai<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 14)<br /></strong>Ehime FC 2-2 Giravanz Kitakyushu<br />Thespa Kusatsu 1-2 Tochigi SC<br />Tokyo Verdy 0-1 Fagiano Okayama<br />Machida Zelvia 1-6 JEF United Chiba<br />Yokohama FC 3-0 Kataller Toyama<br />Avispa Fukuoka 1-1 Montedio Yamagata<br />Shonan Bellmare 1-1 Oita Trinita<br />Kyoto Sanga 2-1 Tokushima Vortis<br />Gainare Tottori 2-1 Mito HollyHock<br />Roasso Kumamoto 0-0 Ventforet Kofu<br />FC Gifu 0-1 Matsumoto Yamaga<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br /> <br />Shimizu S-Pulse underlined their early championship credentials by inflicting a first league defeat of the season upon J. League leaders Vegalta Sendai at the Yurtec Stadium on Sunday afternoon.<br /> <br />With somewhat temperamental weather sweeping the country on the final day of the Golden Week holiday, a heavy hailstorm caused the top-of-the-table clash to be halted for around 40 minutes midway through the first half.<br /><br />Following the resumption of play, it was the visitors who found their rhythm and opened the scoring five minutes before the scheduled interval when Toshiyuki Takagi crossed for Genki Omae to head past Sendai goalkeeper Takuto Hayashi.<br /><br />Shimizu’s hopes of retaining their advantage took a blow midway through the second period when Dutch defender Calvin Jong-a-Pin was dismissed for two bookable offences. But thanks partly to a fine performance between the posts by Akihiro Hayashi, who joined in pre-season from Belgian third-tier side Charleroi-Marchienne, Afshin Ghotbi’s men held on to close the gap at the summit to just two points.<br /><br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima are two points further back in third after a crazy 5-2 victory away to the struggling title holders, Kashiwa Reysol.<br /><br />J1 leading scorer Hisato Sato struck his eighth and ninth goals of the season to push the away side into a 2-0 lead early in the second half, but a terrific turn and shot from Junya Tanaka inspired a Kashiwa recovery which brought parity when Jorge Wagner netted his first of the campaign with 13 minutes remaining.<br /><br />However, a Mihael Mikić cross found Yojiro Takahagi to tap Hiroshima back in front, and as Reysol desperately sought a second equaliser, Naoki Ishihara took advantage with a stoppage time double to give the final scoreline a somewhat cruel gloss. The champions have only eight points from nine games and are separated from the relegation zone on goals scored.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Kawasaki Frontale moved up to sixth position with their second straight victory under new manager Yahiro Kazama, edging Nagoya Grampus by the odd goal in five at the Toyota Stadium.<br /><br />Takuro Yajima was the hero with two goals and an assist to give Kawasaki a 3-1 lead in a first half that Nagoya boss Dragan Stojković described as “catastrophic”. A major reshuffle at the interval allowed the home side to control the second period, but a single goal in reply from Jungo Fujimoto proved insufficient to prevent first back-to-back defeats since October 2009.<br /><br />Urawa Reds are fourth after a 2-2 draw at seventh-placed Jubilo Iwata, for whom South Korean U-23 international and former Watford youth player Baek Sung-Dong netted his first ever J. League goals, while the ever-impressive new boys Sagan Tosu are fifth after a goalless draw at Kashima Antlers.<br /><br />Fortunes remain quite the opposite for Consadole Sapporo, who fell victim to a third consecutive win for the resurgent Yokohama F Marinos to remain rooted to the foot of the table on four points. Gamba Osaka were punished for their profligacy in front of goal with a 1-0 defeat at Omiya Ardija to stay second from bottom.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Vissel Kobe won 2-1 away to Kansai rivals Cerezo Osaka to make it a maximum six points in two matches under caretaker manager Ryo Adachi, while FC Tokyo were 2-0 victors at Albirex Niigata.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	Vissel Kobe are reportedly set to appoint Akira Nishino, who led Gamba Osaka to six major domestic and Asian honours plus eight top three finishes in the past ten seasons, as their new full-time manager on a contract that will take him up to the end of 2014.<br />-	Shinji Kagawa and Gotoku Sakai both registered assists for their respective clubs on the final weekend of the German Bundesliga season. Kagawa is set to announce a decision on his future following this Saturday’s DFB-Pokal final against Bayern Munich.<br />-	Montedio Yamagata beat Thespa Kusatsu 1-0 to leapfrog Shonan Bellmare, who were held 1-1 by Matsumoto Yamaga, to the head of the J2 table.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 10)<br /></strong>Vegalta Sendai 0-1 Shimizu S-Pulse<br />Yokohama F Marinos 2-1 Consadole Sapporo<br />Cerezo Osaka 1-2 Vissel Kobe<br />Kashiwa Reysol 2-5 Sanfrecce Hiroshima<br />Omiya Ardija 1-0 Gamba Osaka<br />Jubilo Iwata 2-2 Urawa Reds<br />Nagoya Grampus 2-3 Kawasaki Frontale<br />Kashima Antlers 0-0 Sagan Tosu<br />Albirex Niigata 0-2 FC Tokyo<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 13)<br /></strong><em>Tochigi SC 1-0 Avispa Fukuoka (match abandoned)</em><br />Ventforet Kofu 0-3 Kyoto Sanga<br />Kataller Toyama 1-1 Machida Zelvia<br />Tokushima Vortis 1-1 Roasso Kumamoto<br />Oita Trinita 3-0 Gainare Tottori<br />JEF United Chiba 1-0 Ehime FC<br />Matsumoto Yamaga 1-1 Shonan Bellmare<br />Fagiano Okayama 0-1 FC Gifu<br />Montedio Yamagata 1-0 Thespa Kusatsu<br />Mito HollyHock 0-2 Tokyo Verdy<br />Giravanz Kitakyushu 1-2 Yokohama FC <br /><br /><br /><strong>AFC Champions League group stage results (East Asia, matchday 5)<br /></strong>Group E<br />Adelaide United (AUS) 0-0 Bunyodkor (UZB) <br />Pohang Steelers (KOR) 2-<strong>0 Gamba Osaka (JPN)</strong><br /><br />Group F<br /><strong>FC Tokyo (JPN) 4</strong>-2 Brisbane Roar (AUS)<br />Beijing Guoan (CHN) 2-3 Ulsan Hyundai (KOR)<br /><br />Group G<br />Central Coast Mariners (AUS) 5-1 Tianjin Teda (CHN)<br />Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma (KOR) 1-<strong>1 Nagoya Grampus (JPN)</strong> <br /><br />Group H<br /><strong>Kashiwa Reysol (JPN) 1</strong>-0 Buriram United (THA)<br />Guangzhou Evergrande (CHN) 1-3 Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors (KOR)<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br /> <br />Omiya Ardija inflicted a first league defeat since opening day upon neighbours Urawa Reds as Cho Young-Cheol registered a goal and an assist en route to their 2-0 victory in Saturday’s Saitama derby.<br /> <br />A pre-season arrival from Albirex Niigata, the South Korean international cut inside Japan defender Yuki Abe from the left flank to fire a low right-footed shot across Reds goalkeeper Nobuhiro Kato and in off the far post after just eight minutes.<br /><br />Cho then sent in a perfect deep cross for Rafael to head the home side at the NACK5 Stadium into a two-goal advantage twenty minutes later. It was the Brazilian’s seventh strike in just six matches against Omiya’s local rivals.<br /><br />Urawa manager Mihailo Petrović sent on Genki Haraguchi for the visitors to seize the attacking initiative in the second half, but an inspired performance from Takashi Kitano in the Ardija goal ensured that there was no way back for the visitors, who slip to sixth in the table.<br /><br />The result allowed Vegalta Sendai to pull out a five-point lead at the top with a 4-0 hammering of FC Tokyo later the same evening. Shingo Akamine opened the scoring right at the end of the first period, before Kunimitsu Sekiguchi headed home his third goal in as many games to double the lead on 58 minutes.<br /><br />Yoshiaki Ota and Jiro Kamata rounded off the scoring late on to take Sendai’s record to six wins and one draw from their opening seven league games.<br /><br />2010 champions Nagoya Grampus move up to second despite the concession of a 94th-minute equaliser in their 1-1 draw away to fourth-placed Sanfrecce Hiroshima. Ryota Moriwaki hit an unstoppable 25-yard shot in off the crossbar to rescue a point after Hayuma Tanaka’s acute header had seemingly put Nagoya on course for all three.<br /><br />Jubilo Iwata are third thanks to a stunning Hiroki Yamada effort to give them a 1-0 victory at home to winless Yokohama F Marinos. The 23-year-old, who has been called up to the Japan squad for a training camp this week, dribbled past two opponents before smashing the ball through a crowd of defenders and into the roof of the net from the left-hand corner of the box.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Consadole Sapporo looked on course for their first win of the season as they led Kawasaki Frontale 2-0 at half time, only for Kengo Nakamura to come off the bench and inspire a comeback akin to that which his side had suffered at Gamba Osaka last week.<br /><br />The 31-year-old midfielder pulled one back with his first touch of the ball to reverse the momentum of the match, and Kawasaki were level from the spot through Renato ten minutes later to set up a grandstand finish. Another substitute, Koji Yamase, fired home on 88 minutes to complete the recovery and break home fans’ hearts.<br /><br />Kashima Antlers also fought back from two down to move out of the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over Cerezo Osaka. Kim Bo-Kyung’s first half brace counted for nought as strikes from Dutra, Shinzo Koroki, and Yasushi Endo turned around a match that threatened to boil over for much of the second period.<br /><br />Newly-promoted Sagan Tosu moved up to an incredible fifth position thanks to a 1-0 victory against third-from-bottom Albirex Niigata. The game was also notable for the league debut of Koki Kiyotake, younger brother of Cerezo and Japan star Hiroshi.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Gamba followed up their first domestic win of the season with a comfortable second, beating Shimizu S-Pulse 3-1 at Banpaku on Sunday evening, while Vissel Kobe broke their run of six straight losses in all competitions when overcoming Kashiwa Reysol by the same scoreline. The champions have begun their defence with just seven points from as many matches and sit a dozen places and points adrift of the summit.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	Shonan Bellmare kept up their superb start to the J2 season, winning 2-1 at Tokyo Verdy to move six points clear of Montedio Yamagata at the top.<br />-	Shinji Kagawa scored his 13th Bundesliga goal of the campaign to help seal a second straight German title for Borussia Dortmund as they beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 2-0 on Saturday.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 7)<br /></strong>Consadole Sapporo 2-3 Kawasaki Frontale<br />Jubilo Iwata 1-0 Yokohama F Marinos<br />Vissel Kobe 3-1 Kashiwa Reysol<br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima 1-1 Nagoya Grampus<br />Kashima Antlers 3-2 Cerezo Osaka<br />Sagan Tosu 1-0 Albirex Niigata<br />Omiya Ardija 2-0 Urawa Reds<br />Vegalta Sendai 4-0 FC Tokyo<br />Gamba Osaka 3-1 Shimizu S-Pulse<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 9)<br /></strong>Mito HollyHock 1-0 Thespa Kusatsu<br />Tochigi SC 1-1 FC Gifu<br />Ventforet Kofu 1-1 Machida Zelvia<br />Ehime FC 0-0 Roasso Kumamoto<br />Giravanz Kitakyushu 0-1 Montedio Yamagata<br />Yokohama FC 2-1 Kyoto Sanga<br />Tokyo Verdy 1-2 Shonan Bellmare<br />Matsumoto Yamaga 1-0 JEF United Chiba<br />Kataller Toyama 2-3 Oita Trinita<br />Fagiano Okayama 2-0 Gainare Tottori<br />Tokushima Vortis 0-4 Avispa Fukuoka<br /><br /><br /><strong>AFC Champions League group stage results (East Asia, matchday 4)<br /></strong>Group E<br />Adelaide United (AUS) 1-0 Pohang Steelers (KOR)<br />Bunyodkor (UZB) 3-<strong>2 Gamba Osaka (JPN)</strong><br /><br />Group F<br />Brisbane Roar (AUS) 1-2 Ulsan Hyundai (KOR)<br /><strong>FC Tokyo (JPN) 3</strong>-0 Beijing Guoan (CHN)<br /><br />Group G<br /><strong>Nagoya Grampus (JPN) 0</strong>-0 Tianjin Teda (CHN)<br />Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma (KOR) 5-0 Central Coast Mariners (AUS)<br /><br />Group H<br />Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors (KOR) 3-2 Buriram United (THA)<br />Guangzhou Evergrande (CHN) 3-<strong>1 Kashiwa Reysol (JPN)</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Yamazaki Nabisco Cup group stage results (matchday 2)<br /></strong>Group A<br />Kawasaki Frontale 3-1 Vegalta Sendai<br />Jubilo Iwata 1-0 Sanfrecce Hiroshima<br />Urawa Reds 1-4 Cerezo Osaka<br /><br />Group B<br />Consadole Sapporo 1-2 Kashima Antlers<br />Albirex Niigata 1-0 Vissel Kobe<br />Shimizu S-Pulse 1-0 Yokohama F Marinos<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br /> <br />After a relatively low key start to the 2012 season, the J. League burst into life on Saturday with 28 goals scored across the nine top flight matches. Early leaders Vegalta Sendai issued a statement of intent to the rest of the division with a 3-2 victory away to reigning champions Kashiwa Reysol.<br /> <br />The visitors took the lead after just two minutes when a corner from Yoshiaki Ota found the head of Vegalta defender Naoki Sugai. Leandro Domingues levelled the scores with a fabulous free kick early in the second half, but Kashiwa were behind again almost immediately thanks to a second goal in as many matches from Kunimitsu Sekiguchi after Wilson’s skilful footwork tore a hole through the defence.<br /><br />Leandro equalised again, somewhat bizarrely, when his half-hearted attempt from a narrow angle somehow squirmed through the legs of Takuto Hayashi in the visitors’ goal. But Shingo Akamine was on hand to seal all three points for Sendai from another Ota cross, and the champions’ misery was complete when Leandro was sent off for a second yellow card late on.<br /><br />Shimizu S-Pulse leapfrogged local rivals Jubilo Iwata into sixth place in the middle of the chasing pack with a 3-2 win in the first Shizuoka derby of the year.<br /><br />The home side at Nihondaira recovered from the concession of a Cho Byung-Kuk opener to equalise through Toshiyuki Takagi right on half time, before two well taken goals by Genki Omae bookended the second 45 minutes and gave S-Pulse an unassailable advantage despite an even later consolation strike by Kosuke Yamamoto.<br /><br />In the weekend’s third 3-2 scoreline, Gamba Osaka finally secured three points for the first time this season thanks to a dramatic comeback against manager-less Kawasaki Frontale.<br /><br />Despite the midweek sacking of former boss Naoki Soma, Kawasaki came out of the blocks quickly to lead after just 19 seconds through Yusuke Sakata’s header, before Yu Kobayashi was left totally unmarked at a Sakata corner on the half hour to seemingly push Gamba towards their fifth league defeat in six.<br /><br />But a Sota Nakazawa header at the end of the first half restored hope for Masanobu Matsunami’s men, who rose to the occasion to turn things around in the second period thanks to goals from new boys Akihiro Sato and Hiroyuki Abe.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Kashima Antlers moved off the foot of the table with their first win of the season away to highflying FC Tokyo.<br /><br />After Shinzo Koroki dinked the visitors into a first half lead, Tokyo levelled in unusual fashion with just six minutes remaining when Sotan Tanabe eventually fired the ball in through a melee of players at an indirect free kick awarded when Hitoshi Sogahata handled a back pass.<br /><br />Hitoshi Shiota had committed a similar offence earlier in the match after replacing the injured Shuichi Gonda, but although the hosts had survived on that occasion, his day was ruined when a poor parry from Juninho’s attempt left an open goal for Yasushi Endo to win it deep into stoppage time.<br /><br />With Sanfrecce Hiroshima also losing 1-0 away to the impressive J1 newcomers Sagan Tosu, Urawa Reds took advantage to move up as high as second with a 2-0 victory over Vissel Kobe. Yuki Abe netted his first goal since returning from Leicester City, while Marcio Richardes converted a trademark free kick late on.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Nagoya Grampus rose to third with a comfortable 3-1 win over Consadole Sapporo, who drop to the bottom. Cerezo Osaka surprisingly succumbed to Albirex Niigata’s first victory of the campaign, while winless Yokohama F Marinos played out a 1-1 draw with Omiya Ardija.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	Shonan Bellmare maintained their unbeaten start in J2, defeating Yokohama FC 3-2 to stand four points clear of Kyoto Sanga at the summit.<br />-	Shinji Kagawa’s Borussia Dortmund need just one more point to seal their second straight Bundesliga crown after coming from behind to edge Atsuto Uchida’s Schalke 04 2-1 in the Ruhr derby.<br />-	In women’s football, Nadeshiko League champions INAC Kobe Leonessa began the defence of their title in spectacular fashion with a 7-0 thrashing of newly-promoted Speranza FC Osaka Takatsuki on Sunday afternoon.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 6)<br /></strong>Kashiwa Reysol 2-3 Vegalta Sendai<br />FC Tokyo 1-2 Kashima Antlers<br />Yokohama F Marinos 1-1 Omiya Ardija<br />Urawa Reds 2-0 Vissel Kobe<br />Shimizu S-Pulse 3-2 Jubilo Iwata<br />Nagoya Grampus 3-1 Consadole Sapporo<br />Sagan Tosu 1-0 Sanfrecce Hiroshima<br />Gamba Osaka 3-2 Kawasaki Frontale<br />Cerezo Osaka 0-1 Albirex Niigata<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 8)<br /></strong>Montedio Yamagata 1-0 Kataller Toyama<br />Thespa Kusatsu 1-0 Ehime FC<br />Machida Zelvia 0-3 Tochigi SC<br />Roasso Kumamoto 0-3 Matsumoto Yamaga<br />Kyoto Sanga 1-0 Tokyo Verdy<br />JEF United Chiba 0-0 Fagiano Okayama<br />Shonan Bellmare 3-2 Yokohama FC<br />FC Gifu 1-0 Giravanz Kitakyushu<br />Gainare Tottori 0-0 Ventforet Kofu<br />Avispa Fukuoka 1-1 Mito HollyHock<br />Oita Trinita 0-0 Tokushima Vortis<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br /> <br />Vegalta Sendai lost their perfect start to the season but managed to hold onto top spot thanks to a late, late equaliser from Wilson in their topsy-turvy 2-2 draw with closest rivals Jubilo Iwata.<br /> <br />The league leaders exercised their home advantage to gradually take control of the game, and thought they had finally broken the deadlock early in the second half when Wilson converted from Shingo Akamine’s pinpoint pass, only to see the linesman’s flag raised for a narrow offside.<br /><br />Incredibly, Iwata were the ones to open the scoring a few minutes later with their first attempt of the game. Minoru Suganuma was left unmarked at the far post to just about bundle a Hiroki Yamada cross over the line, via the post and Sendai goalkeeper Takuto Hayashi.<br /><br />Vegalta finally found their way level with a quarter of an hour remaining through Kunimitsu Sekiguchi – a popular return to form for the 26-year-old after failing to register a single goal or assist in 2011 – and looked set to push for the win; only to fall behind again to Jubilo’s second shot on goal four minutes later. Kosuke Yamamoto took advantage of a standoffish defence to fire home from the D.<br /><br />At this point, the home side appeared to lose their rhythm and entered the last of five added minutes without coming close to a second equaliser. But with seconds on the clock, Wilson expertly chested down a hopeful long ball from Naoki Sugai before somehow managing to turn and squeeze it home past Naoki Hatta.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />FC Tokyo overcame a second yellow card for Aria Jasuru Hasegawa – who was returning from a one-match ban after a similar sanction against Vissel Kobe a fortnight ago – to clinch a dramatic late win at Kawasaki Frontale and move within a point of the summit. Masato Morishige was the hero with a towering header from Naohiro Ishikawa’s corner.<br /><br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima rose to second, ahead of FC Tokyo on goal difference, with a 4-1 victory over Gamba Osaka, who fall to second from bottom.<br /><br />Jorginho only had to wait two minutes to finally see his Kashima Antlers notch their first league goal of the season against Urawa Reds, but their troubles continued as they conspired to fall behind just three minutes later. Shinzo Koroki’s early header was immediately cancelled out by Marcio Richardes, before Popo gave the away side the lead following brilliant work from Yuki Abe and Yosuke Kashiwagi.<br /><br />Richardes netted from the spot later in the first half to seal a 3-1 Urawa win that keeps Kashima rooted to the bottom.<br /><br />Cerezo Osaka needed a Hiroshi Kiyotake penalty to break down the hosts’ resistance in their game at Omiya Ardija, but demonstrated their fine attacking potential with two goals from Kim Bo-Kyung soon thereafter to win 3-0 and move up to fifth.<br /><br />Elsewhere, champions Kashiwa Reysol won 2-0 at Consadole Sapporo to seal only their second three points of the season, while Nagoya Grampus had an outstanding performance from goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki to thank for a 1-0 home victory over newly-promoted Sagan Tosu.<br /><br />A late Alex Brosque strike enabled Shimizu S-Pulse to edge past Vissel Kobe, while Yokohama F Marinos played out a second successive 0-0 draw – this time away to Albirex Niigata.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	A 4-1 thrashing of the Brazil women’s team on Thursday sealed Kirin Challenge Cup success for Nadeshiko Japan – and a welcome boost ahead of the London Olympics.<br />-	FC Tokyo, Nagoya Grampus, and Kashiwa Reysol are all in position to progress through from the AFC Champions League group stage at the halfway mark, while Gamba Osaka revived their chances with a 3-1 win over Uzbekistani outfit Bunyodkor.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 5)<br /></strong>Consadole Sapporo 0-2 Kashiwa Reysol<br />Vegalta Sendai 2-2 Jubilo Iwata<br />Nagoya Grampus 1-0 Sagan Tosu<br />Vissel Kobe 0-1 Shimizu S-Pulse<br />Albirex Niigata 0-0 Yokohama F Marinos<br />Omiya Ardija 0-3 Cerezo Osaka<br />Kashima Antlers 1-3 Urawa Reds<br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima 4-1 Gamba Osaka<br />Kawasaki Frontale 0-1 FC Tokyo<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 7)<br /></strong>Mito HollyHock 0-1 JEF United Chiba<br />Tochigi SC 2-0 Roasso Kumamoto<br />Tokyo Verdy 2-0 Tokushima Vortis<br />Fagiano Okayama 1-0 Matsumoto Yamaga<br />Ehime FC 4-2 Avispa Fukuoka<br />Giravanz Kitakyushu 1-0 Gainare Tottori<br />Yokohama FC 1-2 Montedio Yamagata<br />Shonan Bellmare 2-0 Machida Zelvia<br />Ventforet Kofu 1-0 Oita Trinita<br />Kataller Toyama 1-2 Thespa Kusatsu<br />FC Gifu 0-1 Kyoto Sanga<br /><br /><br /><strong>AFC Champions League group stage results (East Asia, matchday 3)<br /></strong>Group E<br /><strong>Gamba Osaka (JPN) 3</strong>-1 Bunyodkor (UZB)<br />Pohang Steelers (KOR) 1-0 Adelaide United (AUS)<br /><br />Group F<br />Ulsan Hyundai (KOR) 1-1 Brisbane Roar (AUS)<br />Beijing Guoan (CHN) 1-<strong>1 FC Tokyo (JPN)</strong><br /><br />Group G<br />Central Coast Mariners (AUS) 1-1 Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma (KOR)<br />Tianjin Teda (CHN) 0-<strong>3 Nagoya Grampus (JPN)</strong><br /><br />Group H<br /><strong>Kashiwa Reysol (JPN) 0</strong>-0 Guangzhou Evergrande (CHN)<br />Buriram United (THA) 0-2 Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors (KOR)<br /><br /><br /><strong>Yamazaki Nabisco Cup group stage results (matchday 2)<br /></strong>Group A<br />Vegalta Sendai 2-0 Sagan Tosu<br />Jubilo Iwata 4-3 Urawa Reds<br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima 1-1 Kawasaki Frontale<br /><br />Group B<br />Kashima Antlers 1-0 Omiya Ardija<br />Shimizu S-Pulse 1-0 Albirex Niigata<br />Yokohama F Marinos 1-2 Consadole Sapporo <br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br /> <br />Vegalta Sendai stand clear atop the J. League table after extending their 100% record to a fourth weekend with a 2-1 win away to Cerezo Osaka on Saturday.<br /> <br />Makoto Teguramori’s side survived an early scare when a Hiroshi Kiyotake volley struck their crossbar and opened the scoring themselves on 34 minutes. Wilson carried the ball along the left flank and laid it off for Shingo Akamine to attempt a shot through a crowd of defenders, which then rebounded kindly for the Brazilian to net his first goal since arriving from Shaanxi Chan-Ba of China over the winter.<br /> <br />More efficient counterattacking play brought Sendai their second shortly after the interval. Yoshiaki Ota beat two players and sent in a cross from the right that Hotaru Yamaguchi could only nod into the path of an unmarked Akamine, leaving goalkeeper Kim Jin-Kyeon in no-man’s land for the striker to convert with a simple header.<br /><br />Cerezo battled hard to get back into the game but their only reward came in the form of a consolation strike from supersub Ryuji Bando five minutes from time.<br /><br />Newly promoted Sagan Tosu provided the biggest victory and surprise of the weekend, thrashing big-spending Vissel Kobe 3-0 to move up to fifth position in their debut J1 season.<br /><br />All three of their goals arrived via crosses from the right-hand side, with Kei Ikeda playing the ball across for the 24th-minute substitute Ryunosuke Noda to slide in at the far post for the opener within moments of his arrival. Last season’s 23-goal hero Yohei Toyoda converted in confident fashion just before the break, while Ikeda rounded off a fine performance with the third right on full time.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Jubilo Iwata are in second place with 10 points from a possible 12 after a 1-0 win over defending champions Kashiwa Reysol, whose title defence has begun somewhat inauspiciously with just four points from as many matches.<br /><br />Japan forward Ryoichi Maeda played Takuya Matsuura into space on the right flank, and continued his run towards the far post to divert a low return pass beyond Takanori Sugeno.<br /><br />FC Tokyo suffered their first reverse since returning to the top flight with a 1-0 home loss to Sanfrecce Hiroshima, who join them on nine points to round off the top four. Mihael Mikić rolled a perfect low cross ahead of three opposing defenders for Hisato Sato to slot home the only goal after 56 minutes.<br /><br />Jun Kanakubo cancelled out a glorious opener from Danilson to earn Omiya Ardija a creditable point at home to Nagoya Grampus, while neighbours Urawa Reds were left clinging on to draw 1-1 with Kawasaki Frontale after new signings Yuki Abe and Tomoaki Makino both saw red for two bookable offences in the second period.<br /><br />Seven-times champions Kashima Antlers are still goalless but do at least now have their first point under Jorginho following a 0-0 draw at Yokohama F Marinos. They sit at the foot of the table on goal difference beneath Consadole Sapporo, who lost 1-0 away to Shimizu S-Pulse.<br /><br />A 1-1 draw also brought first points of the season for both Albirex Niigata and Gamba Osaka. New Gamba boss Masanobu Matsunami expressed his satisfaction at the team’s performance in his first game in charge since replacing the hapless José Carlos Serrão last week.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	Shinji Kagawa netted the first in a thrilling 4-4 draw for Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund at home to Gotoku Sakai’s VfB Stuttgart. His goal takes him to 12 league strikes for the season – a record for any Japanese player in a major European competition.<br />-	Shonan Bellmare won 2-1 at Gainare Tottori to retain top spot in J2. Tokyo Verdy are three points back in second following their 2-1 victory away to new local rivals Machida Zelvia.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 4)<br /></strong>Omiya Ardija 1-1 Nagoya Grampus<br />FC Tokyo 0-1 Sanfrecce Hiroshima<br />Urawa Reds 1-1 Kawasaki Frontale<br />Jubilo Iwata 1-0 Kashiwa Reysol<br />Cerezo Osaka 1-2 Vegalta Sendai<br />Albirex Niigata 1-1 Gamba Osaka<br />Shimizu S-Pulse 1-0 Consadole Sapporo<br />Yokohama F Marinos 0-0 Kashima Antlers<br />Sagan Tosu 3-0 Vissel Kobe <br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 6)<br /></strong>Montedio Yamagata 0-0 Mito HollyHock<br />Tochigi SC 2-1 JEF United Chiba<br />Matsumoto Yamaga 0-3 Kataller Toyama<br />Kyoto Sanga 3-2 Avispa Fukuoka<br />Gainare Tottori 1-2 Shonan Bellmare<br />Roasso Kumamoto 3-0 FC Gifu<br />Thespa Kusatsu 1-1 Yokohama FC<br />Machida Zelvia 1-2 Tokyo Verdy<br />Ventforet Kofu 1-2 Giravanz Kitakyushu<br />Tokushima Vortis 1-2 Fagiano Okayama<br />Oita Trinita 1-0 Ehime FC<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br />  <br />Gamba Osaka have quickly lost patience with their hapless manager José Carlos Serrão – announcing the sacking of both the Brazilian and his assistant Wagner Lopes this afternoon after yesterday’s 2-1 home loss against Jubilo Iwata completed a run of five straight losses from the start of the season.<br /> <br />Following another dire defeat away to Adelaide United in midweek, it was a familiar story again at Banpaku as Jubilo midfielder Minoru Suganuma found acres of space to lay on a through ball for Kosuke Yamamoto, who coolly opened the scoring on 23 minutes.<br /><br />The visitors’ lead was doubled on the hour when Ryoichi Maeda netted from the spot after being felled in somewhat comical fashion by goalkeeper Yosuke Fujigaya, who was quite fortunate not to at least receive a yellow card for his actions.<br /><br />Shu Kurata pulled one back with a perfectly placed header on 84 minutes but the Gamba rally was too little, too late, and club president Kikuo Kanamori remained at the ground with other board members until late at night to determine Serrão’s fate.<br /><br />Former striker Masanobu Matsunami, who played for the club in the inaugural J. League season back in 1993 and joined the coaching team after retiring with a title winners’ medal in 2005, will initially take over the managerial reins.<br /><br />A statement from Kanamori read, “Serrão was unable to impose his style of football upon the team, and we have come to this decision in light both of the five consecutive defeats and of the lack of dynamism in the football played throughout.”<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Vegalta Sendai stand on top of the J1 table after thrashing Omiya Ardija 4-1 to record their third win in three league matches.<br /><br />Cho Young-Cheol netted from close range to give Omiya a first-half lead, but Sendai levelled shortly after the restart through Yoshiaki Ota before pulling ahead thanks to an own goal by the most unfortunate Kosuke Kikuchi.<br /><br />Further strikes from Naoki Sugai and Ota again completed the scoring.<br /><br />J2 champions FC Tokyo also retained their 100% record with a 2-0 victory away to fellow high-fliers Vissel Kobe. Naohiro Ishikawa finished off a terrific team goal on the counter after 32 minutes following good work from Yohei Kajiyama and Lucas, while substitute Kazuma Watanabe evaded Masahiko Inoha to seal the win deep into second half stoppage time.<br /><br />Sagan Tosu earned their first ever J1 win with a solitary goal from on-loan Kota Mizunuma against his parent club, Yokohama F Marinos. However, Consadole Sapporo succumbed to a well-taken brace by Yosuke Kashiwagi of Urawa Reds despite leading through Masaki Yamamoto’s second superb strike in two games.<br /><br />Defending champions Kashiwa Reysol followed up their 5-1 AFC Champions League hammering of Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in midweek by securing their first domestic three points of the campaign, but they needed a dramatic late double from defender Tatsuya Masushima to complete a 2-1 comeback victory over Shimizu S-Pulse.<br /><br />Kashima Antlers and Albirex Niigata both remain pointless after defeats away to Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Nagoya Grampus, respectively. Kawasaki Frontale slipped to their first reverse of the campaign, losing 1-0 at home to unbeaten Cerezo Osaka.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	In the two remaining AFC Champions League group games featuring Japanese clubs, FC Tokyo were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Ulsan Hyundai while Nagoya Grampus drew 1-1 at Central Coast Mariners.<br />-	Shonan Bellmare lost their 100% record but held onto top spot in J2 with a thrilling 3-3 draw away to Roasso Kumamoto.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 3)<br /></strong>Vegalta Sendai 4-1 Omiya Ardija<br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima 2-0 Kashima Antlers<br />Kawasaki Frontale 0-1 Cerezo Osaka<br />Vissel Kobe 0-2 FC Tokyo<br />Sagan Tosu 1-0 Yokohama F Marinos<br />Consadole Sapporo 1-2 Urawa Reds<br />Kashiwa Reysol 2-1 Shimizu S-Pulse<br />Nagoya Grampus 2-1 Albirex Niigata<br />Gamba Osaka 1-2 Jubilo Iwata<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 5)<br /></strong>Mito HollyHock 0-0 Matsumoto Yamaga<br />Kataller Toyama 2-3 Giravanz Kitakyushu<br />Kyoto Sanga 2-1 Machida Zelvia<br />Fagiano Okayama 2-1 Montedio Yamagata<br />Avispa Fukuoka 4-0 Gainare Tottori<br />Yokohama FC 0-2 Ventforet Kofu<br />Ehime FC 1-1 Tochigi SC<br />JEF United Chiba 3-0 Tokushima Vortis<br />Tokyo Verdy 2-0 Thespa Kusatsu<br />Roasso Kumamoto 3-3 Shonan Bellmare<br />FC Gifu 0-2 Oita Trinita<br /><br /><br /><strong>AFC Champions League group stage results (East Asia, matchday 2)<br /></strong>Group E<br />Adelaide United (AUS) 2-<strong>0 Gamba Osaka (JPN)</strong><br />Pohang Steelers (KOR) 0-2 Bunyodkor (UZB)<br /><br />Group F<br /><strong>FC Tokyo (JPN) 2</strong>-2 Ulsan Hyundai (KOR)<br />Beijing Guoan (CHN) 1-1 Brisbane Roar (AUS)<br /><br />Group G<br />Central Coast Mariners (AUS) 1-<strong>1 Nagoya Grampus (JPN)</strong><br />Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma (KOR) 1-1 Tianjin Teda (CHN)<br /><br />Group H<br /><strong>Kashiwa Reysol (JPN) 5</strong>-1 Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors (KOR)<br />Guangzhou Evergrande (CHN) 1-2 Buriram United (THA)<br /><br /><br /><strong>Yamazaki Nabisco Cup group stage results<br /></strong>Group A<br />Urawa Reds 1-0 Vegalta Sendai<br />Sagan Tosu 2-1 Kawasaki Frontale<br />Jubilo Iwata 2-1 Cerezo Osaka<br /><br />Group B<br />Consadole Sapporo 0-1 Albirex Niigata<br />Kashima Antlers 2-0 Vissel Kobe<br />Omiya Ardija 1-1 Yokohama F Marinos<br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br /> <br /><br />A minute’s silence was observed at football grounds across Japan as the 2012 J1 season kicked off on the first anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the east coast of the country on 11 March last year.<br /> <br />Defending champions Kashiwa Reysol were fittingly involved in the most entertaining and dramatic fixture of the opening weekend, leading three times but ultimately having to settle for a share of the spoils in a 3-3 draw at home to Yokohama F Marinos.<br /><br />Having suffered a shock defeat away to Buriram United of Thailand in the Asian Champions League in midweek, Kashiwa were quick to demonstrate that they had lost none of their mojo with an eye-pleasing opener on just three minutes. Jorge Wagner executed a spectacular scissor kick to cut back a lofted free kick from Leandro Domingues and into the path of Hiroki Sakai for his first ever J. League goal.<br /><br />Masashi Oguro equalised soon afterwards with a close range volley that was every bit as impressive, but the hosts were back in front in still only the 12th minute thanks to a perfectly placed shot from new Japan international Junya Tanaka.<br /><br />Returning to Marinos after a successful year on loan at Ehime FC, 21-year-old Manabu Saito then exhibited his exciting potential by firing home a second equaliser from just outside the box after three defenders had failed to stop his dribble from the right flank. Again, however, the visitors’ hard work was undone when they left Leandro far too much room to run and size up a delightful effort from 25 yards that left Hiroki Iikura stranded.<br /><br />Yokohama thought they had levelled things up again when Oguro’s shot bounced off the crossbar and seemingly just behind the line, only for the officials to controversially signal play to continue. But their great persistence finally paid off in the second minute of stoppage time when substitute Hiroyuki Taniguchi got his head to a Yuzo Kobayashi cross to tie things up once again.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />Vissel Kobe laid down an early marker for supremacy in the Kansai region with a 3-2 win away to Gamba Osaka that was perhaps more comfortable than the final scoreline appears.<br /><br />A woeful lack of coherency throughout the home eleven was well exemplified when Kobe new boy Takuya Nozawa slipped over in the penalty area, but was still granted enough time and space to stand up and square for an unmarked Yoshito Okubo to slot into the empty net.<br /><br />Paulinho marked his Gamba debut with an impressive equaliser from 25 yards, but Nozawa set pieces laid on further goals for Okubo and Hideo Hashimoto – who left Banpaku after 14 years at the end of last season. A late rally saw Rafinha pull one back deep into added time.<br /><br />Brazilian veteran Lucas hit a stunning winner from the D as J2 champions FC Tokyo, inspired by the heroics of goalkeeper Shuichi Gonda, celebrated their return to the top flight with a 1-0 victory at Omiya Ardija. Fellow promoted sides Consadole Sapporo and Sagan Tosu made steady starts with goalless draws at home to Jubilo Iwata and Cerezo Osaka, respectively.<br /><br />A Joshua Kennedy penalty was sufficient to seal a 1-0 success for an influent Nagoya Grampus against Shimizu S-Pulse, while new Urawa Reds manager Mihalo Petrović and defender Tomoaki Makino suffered defeat by a similar scoreline in their first return to Sanfrecce Hiroshima.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Kawasaki Frontale beat Albirex Niigata 1-0, while a meeting of the two J1 clubs most directly affected by last year’s disaster saw Vegalta Sendai edge Kashima Antlers by the same score thanks to a headed goal from new arrival Taikai Uemoto.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	Japan will renew their rivalry with last year’s Asian Cup final opponents Australia in the final round of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup. Their group also contains Oman, Jordan, and Iraq – who are managed by former Samurai Blue boss Zico.<br />-	FC Tokyo opened their ACL campaign with a 2-0 win away to Brisbane Roar on Tuesday, but there was disappointment elsewhere as Nagoya were pegged back to a 2-2 draw with Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma, while Gamba were thrashed 3-0 at home by Pohang Steelers.<br />-	Tokushima Vortis head the embryonic J2 table after a 3-0 victory over FC Gifu.<br /><br /><br /><strong>J1 results (matchday 1)<br /></strong>Consadole Sapporo 0-0 Jubilo Iwata<br />Vegalta Sendai 1-0 Kashima Antlers<br />Nagoya Grampus 1-0 Shimizu S-Pulse<br />Gamba Osaka 2-3 Vissel Kobe<br />Sanfrecce Hiroshima 1-0 Urawa Reds<br />Sagan Tosu 0-0 Cerezo Osaka<br />Kawasaki Frontale 1-0 Albirex Niigata<br />Omiya Ardija 0-1 FC Tokyo<br />Kashiwa Reysol 3-3 Yokohama F Marinos<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 2)<br /></strong>Mito HollyHock 1-0 Kataller Toyama<br />Tochigi SC 0-3 Oita Trinita<br />Machida Zelvia 0-1 Avispa Fukuoka<br />Matsumoto Yamaga 1-2 Montedio Yamagata<br />Tokushima Vortis 3-0 FC Gifu<br />Giravanz Kitakyushu 0-0 Fagiano Okayama<br />Thespa Kusatsu 1-3 Shonan Bellmare<br />Tokyo Verdy 1-3 Ventforet Kofu<br />Yokohama FC 0-0 Ehime FC<br />Roasso Kumamoto 2-1 Gainare Tottori<br />Kyoto Sanga 2-0 JEF United Chiba<br /><br /><br /><strong>AFC Champions League group stage results (East Asia, matchday 1)<br /></strong>Group E<br /><strong>Gamba Osaka (JPN) 0</strong>-3 Pohang Steelers<br />Bunyodkor (UZB) 1-2 Adelaide United (AUS)<br /><br />Group F<br />Brisbane Roar (AUS) 0-<strong>2 FC Tokyo (JPN)</strong><br />Ulsan Hyundai (KOR) 2-1 Beijing Guoan (CHN)<br /><br />Group G<br /><strong>Nagoya Grampus (JPN) 2</strong>-2 Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma (KOR)<br />Tianjin Teda (CHN) 0-0 Central Coast Mariners (AUS)<br /><br />Group H<br />Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors (KOR) 1-5 Guangzhou Evergrande (CHN)<br />Buriram United (THA) 3-<strong>2 Kashiwa Reysol (JPN)</strong><br /><br /><a name="more"></a>

</div><br /> <br />J. League title holders Kashiwa Reysol clinched the first silverware of the new season with a 2-1 victory over Emperor’s Cup winners and J2 champions FC Tokyo in the Fuji Xerox Super Cup in the capital on Saturday.<br /> <br />Despite opening the game in rather sluggish fashion, Reysol took the lead after 26 minutes with a moment of inspiration from one of their Brazilian stars. Jorge Wagner collected the ball in midfield after a scrambled clearance from the back, and as the Tokyo defenders fatally stood off and allowed him time and space, the 33-year-old set his sights and fired beyond Hitoshi Shiota from almost 30 yards.<br /><br />The advantage was doubled shortly before half time, after veteran forward Hideaki Kitajima was clumsily bundled over in the penalty area by Masato Morishige. Wagner’s compatriot Leandro Domingues made no mistake with the resulting spot kick, placing it calmly into the net high to the ’keeper’s right.<br /><br />Tokyo earned a lifeline 20 minutes into the second period through new signing Aria Jasuru Hasegawa. The former Yokohama F Marinos midfielder saw his initial effort parried by Takanori Sugeno, but pounced to head home when Kashiwa defender Wataru Hashimoto failed to clear the rebound.<br /><br />Ranko Popović’s side steadily recovered their momentum thereafter in search of an equaliser, but were unable to break down the champions’ resistance despite a lively cameo appearance from former Japan international Naotake Hanyu.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />The two newly-promoted sides from the third-tier Japan Football League (JFL) endured a tough start to life in the fully professional ranks as the J2 season kicked off on Sunday.<br /><br />Matsumoto Yamaga, who finished fourth in the JFL last season, put up a determined showing in the first half of their trip to former Japanese champions Tokyo Verdy but were undone by two goals in seven minutes early in the second – Yuki Kobayashi and Josimar the scorers.<br /><br />Meanwhile Machida Zelvia – now under the stewardship of Argentinean World Cup winner Osvaldo Ardiles following the departure of Popović to FC Tokyo – went down by another 2-0 scoreline away to Ehime FC.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Ventforet Kofu and Avispa Fukuoka both made a good start in their bids to return to J1 at the first attempt – winning 2-1 at home to Tochigi SC and Roasso Kumamoto, respectively.<br /><br />However, Montedio Yamagata were beaten 2-0 at JEF United Chiba.<br /><br /><br />TALKING POINTS<br />-	Shinji Kagawa put the memories and jet lag of Japan’s midweek friendly defeat behind him to score the winning goal as Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund clinched a 2-1 victory at home to Mainz.<br />-	Robert Cullen and Maya Yoshida both scored late on to dramatically turn a one-goal deficit into a 2-1 win for VVV Venlo over NAC Breda in the Dutch Eredivisie.<br />-	The group stage of the AFC Champions League gets under way this week, with Gamba Osaka hosting Pohang Steelers of South Korea and FC Tokyo travelling to Brisbane Roar on Tuesday. Nagoya Grampus entertain Korean side Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma and Kashiwa Reysol visit Buriram United of Thailand on Wednesday.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Fuji Xerox Super Cup result<br /></strong>Kashiwa Reysol 2-1 FC Tokyo<br /><br /><br /><strong>J2 results (matchday 1)<br /></strong>Mito HollyHock 2-1 Yokohama FC<br />Tokyo Verdy 2-0 Matsumoto Yamaga<br />Ventforet Kofu 2-1 Tochigi SC<br />FC Gifu 2-2 Gainare Tottori<br />Fagiano Okayama 1-1 Kataller Toyama<br />Avispa Fukuoka 2-1 Roasso Kumamoto<br />Oita Trinita 2-3 Thespa Kusatsu<br />JEF United Chiba 2-0 Montedio Yamagata<br />Ehime FC 2-0 Machida Zelvia<br />Shonan Bellmare 2-1 Kyoto Sanga<br />Giravanz Kitakyushu 1-2 Tokushima Vortis<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>
