The boys are back once again with the hotly-anticipated new podcast.
The people demanded more banter and that is what they have got. Minge and Runyak shoot the shit about Pizza, Nazis, Porn, Joe Kinnear and the Crystal Maze.
Also it's a chance to catch up with Quincy and listen to some 'interesting' music, as well as the airing of a message from a celebrity who is furious over being lampooned.
If that wasn't enough, there is a super special treat for all MingeFans - Hear it all EXCLUSIVELY on the Mingeca5t. Sign up to the forum at http://www.mingeford365.co.uk/forum

After an ENTIRE year off, Runyak and Mingeford are flipping back! Live from the heart of Milton Keynes, the boys are in full control of the radio station.
Some of the mic levels are a bit dodgy at first, but it's all good, and lots of the listeners getting involved which always equates to lols.
