   <description>Another one to file under “cool people I’ve met along the way”. Or should I say *finally* met. I almost crossed paths with singer/songwriters Stephanie Bettman and Luke Halpin several times the past few years (FAR-West, the occasional showcase) but it was always a near miss. We finally got together last fall here for a very fun visit at the house when they came by to do the kitchen-table talk thing.</description>

With a new record out, we figured this was a good excuse to both get together again AND drag the whole band along for this follow-up episode.</description>

   <title>Michael Gaither - Songs and Stories #63: Roads, Rosie, Roselle</title>
   <link>http://michaelgaither.com/b2/blogs/index.php</link>
   <description>
   I've been a guest on Rosemary Charmers' "Good Morning Monterey Bay" several times. (The show airs in Santa Cruz every weekday from 6-9 AM on KSCO 1080 AM.). It's always a great visit, and the conversations seem to always settle on mainly two topics: "How are you dogs doing?" and "Would you please play the 'Highway 17' song again?" This last Tuesday's visit was no different, and I couldn't think of a funner way to start my week.

   <link>http://michaelgaither.com/b2/blogs/index.php</link>
   <description>
    This very cool "Songs and Stories" two-parter features two chats with Antsy McClain, lead singer, songwriter (and fellow podcaster) of the Americana band the Trailer Park Troubadours. I'm finding myself overusing the phrase "gold standard" lately, but Antsy fits the bill. He's just darned good at it. Antsy's also a heck of a lot of fun to hang out and talk shop with, as you'll soon discover. In episode #51, we talk backstage at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz on the night of the "New Good Old Days" release party. We discuss the trailer motif that runs through much of his music and how he came into songwriting as a visual artist.

   <title>Michael Gaither - Songs and Stories #47: The Late-Night Song Circle </title>
   <link>http://michaelgaither.com/b2/blogs/index.php</link>
   <description>
   I've said this more times than I can honestly count, but I'm convinced that the real dividend in this music path is all the folks I keep meeting along the way. Case in point: This podcast is a song circle, a gathering of other players (some old friends, some new) recorded at the American River Music Festival back in September of this year.

   <title>Michael Gaither - Songs and Stories #43: Fall Preview </title>
   <link>http://michaelgaither.com/b2/blogs/index.php</link>
   <description>
   The new TV season always has a "Fall Preview", so why not do the same for the band and this podcast? This episode is a rundown of where we're playing in October (KSCO 1080 AM, Roudon-Smith Winery, Don Quixote's), as well as a quick look at the next few episodes I have lined up for the podcast (interviews with Corrine West and Joziah Longo). You'll also hear live versions of "Spotted Mule" and "Where'd the Time Go", from an appearance last June on KSCO's "Good Morning Monterey Bay" with Rosemary Chalmers.

   <title>Michael Gaither - Songs and Stories #39: Songwriter Vienna Teng (or "When to Leave the Day Job")</title>
   <link>http://michaelgaither.com/b2/blogs/index.php</link>
   <description>
    A question many artists often ask themselves is "When do I leave my day job?" (Not that I have *ever* thought that. No, never. Ever. Well...maybe that's a topic for a future podcast.) Anyway, in Songs and Stories #39, I talk with songwriter Vienna Teng. Vienna and I worked at the same company several years ago, and I still remember the day she left, record deal in hand, to give up the corporate life and go after music full time.

   <title>Michael Gaither - Songs and Stories #37: Chuck McCabe - A Creature of Habit (Part One)</title>
   <link>http://michaelgaither.com/b2/blogs/index.php</link>
   <description>
   Bay area staple Chuck McCabe is one of those "songwriter's songwriter" type of folks. He's well known for writing funny songs that seem to come off easy ("I Miss My Mustache"), while his serious side packs an equal punch. (His song "Mimimum Wager" won the 2002 Woody Guthrie Songwriting Competition.) Chuck also has a great dog song - "Fred"-  and you probably know that anyone who sings about dogs automatically gets high marks in my book.

   <link>http://michaelgaither.com/b2/blogs/index.php</link>
   <description>Fingerstyle guitarist and songwriter Stevie Coyle has a background that puts my own song "Jack of All Trades" to shame. He's toured with The Royal Lichtenstein Circus and has hosted killer whale shows. He's been a member of The Frontmen and The Foremen.

   It's amazing what one little bluegrass song about a mule can do for you. "Spotted Mule" pretty much wrote itself, became the title track to my CD, a video on YouTube, and people are still discovering it. Well folks, Icing, the spotted mule herself, is now up for sale. In this podcast, you'll hear some background on the song *and* an interview with Krista Koenig, Icing's owner/trainer.

   What comes first? The music or the lyrics? That's probably the most-asked question about songwriting, and the answer is simply, "yes". (As in, "Yes, the music or the lyrics definitely come first".) Every song is different, and every one has a different starting point. Some songs - most of mine, actually - start with a title. In this podcast, I talk about how the song "High and Lonesome" came about.  Read the show notes and listen to more podcasts like this one at http://www.michaelgaither.com.
