<p>Okay, I&#8217;ve really got to thank Samsung now, not just for being a sponsor, but also a friend. I&#8217;ve long wanted to do a show with Ben Model, silent film accompanist extraordinaire, and since Samsung&#8217;s latest episode of their comedy series FACT CHECKERS UNIT is essentially an extended chase sequence between the intrepid scandal-rag detectives and a shape-shifting James Franco (creeeeeepy!), it seemed like a good excuse to talk with the man who has scored so many chases they&#8217;re probably a core component of his thought processes by now.</p>
<p>Institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art, Kino Video, and the Library of Congress count on Ben&#8217;s compositional skills and tinkling ivories to bring that final, crucial bit of life to the works of D.W. Griffith, Buster Keaton, Mack Sennett, and on and on, so he&#8217;s managed to develop some unique insights into the art and craft of having people, animals, and vehicles in furious pursuit (not plants, though, unless you want to count DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS). Have a listen to the show, and also check out the special, &#8220;James Franco is Preggers&#8221; episode of FACT CHECKERS UNIT below, &#8216;cuz it&#8217;s pretty damn funny in and of itself.</p>

<p>Probably looked good on paper. A “grown-up” retelling of <em>Snow White</em>, featuring the stars of <a title="THE TWILIGHT SAGA" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/the-twilight-saga/">THE TWILIGHT SAGA</a> and THOR, with additional star-power in the casting of the wicked queen  and the seven dwarfs and a lush, stylish mounting courtesy of the  director of many, visually innovative commercials, here making his  feature film debut — what could go wrong? Well, forgetting to put the  term “entertaining” into the precis for <a title="SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/snow-white-and-the-huntsman/">SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN</a> may have been the first problem. Ripping off concepts from far better  films such as NEVERENDING STORY and TIME BANDITS for no particular  reason certainly didn’t help.</p>
<p>Come join <em>Cinefantastique Online</em>’s Steve Biodrowski,  Lawrence French, and Dan Persons as they discuss how one film manages to  confound not only the talents of the easily susceptible, such as  headliners <a title="Kristen Stewart" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/kristen-stewart/">Kristen Stewart</a> and <a title="Chris Hemsworth" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/chris-hemsworth/">Chris Hemsworth</a>, but also such seasoned performers as <a title="Charlize Theron" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/charlize-theron/">Charlize Theron</a>, Ian McShane, and Bob Hoskins. Then: Steve gives his capsule review of the satiric gore-fest <a title="PIRANHA" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/piranha">PIRANHA</a> 3DD, and Dan weighs in on the animated adventure A CAT IN PARIS. Plus: What’s coming to theaters.</p>

<p>Has the corporate subsidizing of charity gone too far? Well, when KFC strives to become the leading face in the battle against breast cancer, then, yeah, maybe. In the new documentary, PINK RIBBONS, INC, producer Ravida Din and director Léa Pool look at how the activism surrounding a pressing women&#8217;s issue was co-opted by corporations and diverted into high-profile, soft-focused fund raising activities &#8212; walks, runs, and rallies with possibly little pertinence to the disease being battled.</p>
<p>February&#8217;s blatantly political attempted defunding of Planned Parenthood by the Susan G. Komen Foundation for the Cure raised public awareness of the ways that breast cancer charities may have gone astray; PINK RIBBONS is the next logical step, showing that that ill-advised P.R. fiasco was only the tip of the iceberg. In talking with doctors, activists, fundraisers, and women living with breast cancer, the filmmakers not only raise troubling and controversial questions about the current mission of breast cancer charities, but also about the modern definition of charity.</p>

<p>Such a garden of delights for this Memorial Day weekend! First, we pay tribute to horror icon <a title="Christopher Lee" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/christopher-lee/">Christopher Lee</a> on his 90th birthday, as <em>Cinefantastique Online</em>’s Steve Biodrowski and Lawrence French highlight their favorite Lee films and Dan chips in with a memorable TV moment.</p>
<p>Then we delve deeply into the weekend’s major release, <a title="MEN IN BLACK III" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/men-in-black-iii/">MEN IN BLACK III</a>, the return of the frenetic secret agents vs. aliens comedy that reunites actors Will Smith and <a title="Tommy Lee Jones" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/tommy-lee-jones/">Tommy Lee Jones</a> with director <a title="Barry Sonnenfeld" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/barry-sonnenfeld/">Barry Sonnenfeld</a> and, courtesy of a time-travel plot, introduces Josh Brolin as a young  Jones. The film was rumored to have no shortage of problems during the  filming process (even discounting New Yorkers’ complaints about Will  Smith’s Taj Mahal of a dressing trailer), but does the final project  transcend the behind-the-scenes turmoil? Steve, Larry, and Dan discuss  what’s good and bad in the film, and throw in a discussion of the logic  behind building a prison on the Moon.</p>
<p>Plus: Steve and Larry give their capsule reviews of Oren Peli’s return to horror, <a title="CHERNOBYL DIARIES" href="http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/tag/chernobyl-diaries/">CHERNOBYL DIARIES</a>, and what’s coming in theaters.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Such a garden of delights for this Memorial Day weekend! First, we pay tribute to horror icon Christopher Lee on his 90th birthday, as Cinefantastique Onlineâs Steve Biodrowski and Lawrence French highlight their favorite Lee films and Dan chips in with a memorable TV moment.

Then we delve deeply into the weekendâs major release, MEN IN BLACK III, the return of the frenetic secret agents vs. aliens comedy that reunites actors Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones with director Barry Sonnenfeld and, courtesy of a time-travel plot, introduces Josh Brolin as a young  Jones. The film was rumored to have no shortage of problems during the  filming process (even discounting New Yorkersâ complaints about Will  Smithâs Taj Mahal of a dressing trailer), but does the final project  transcend the behind-the-scenes turmoil? Steve, Larry, and Dan discuss  whatâs good and bad in the film, and throw in a discussion of the logic  behind building a prison on the Moon.

Plus: Steve and Larry give their capsule reviews of Oren Peliâs return to horror, CHERNOBYL DIARIES, and whatâs coming in theaters.

<p>The aliens have landed! Yes. Again. This time they’ve invaded off the  coast of Hawaii, so it’s just like Pearl Harbor, if the attack on Pearl  Harbor had included such devastating weaponry as Giant Exploding Pegs  and Hot-Rodding Robot Fireballs. Can slacker sailor Alex Hopper (Taylor  Kitsch), finding himself in command of the lone, surviving ship and  assisted by crewmate Rihanna and visiting captain Tadanobu  Asano (just  to prove we’re all over Pearl Harbor), find a way of defeating the  enemy? Can Hopper’s fiancee Brooklyn Decker, with the help of (actual)  double amputee Greg Gadson, destroy the island-based satellite  substation before the invading force can signal their cohorts, even as  her father, the Admiral (Liam Neeson), stands on the sidelines, shaking  his fist and screaming, “<em>Hopperrrrrr!!!” </em>(not really, but close enough)? C’mon, it’s a movie based on a board game — are these really questions?</p>
<p>Come join Cinefantastique Online’s Steve Biodrowski, Lawrence French,  and Dan Persons as they debate whether director Peter Berg might have  been better served doing a film called CROCODILE DENTIST. Also: Dan  gives his capsule review of LOVELY MOLLY, the new exercise in ominous  horror by BLAIR WITCH’s Eduardo Sanchez. Plus: What’s coming to  theaters.</p>

<p>Two hundred years is a long time to revive a vampire, but then again,  forty years is long time to revive the first horror soap opera (not  counting an earlier, feature adaptation and a TV reboot in the &#8217;90s). In  Tim Burton&#8217;s <em>Dark Shadows</em>, Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is  cursed into vampirehood by spurned lover Angelique (Eva Green) in the  18th century and is buried alive (undead?) to await his unearthing in  the 1970&#8242;s. What he finds is the family fishing empire in ruins, the  occupants of stately Collinswood manor &#8212; including Michelle Pfeiffer as  matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter as drunk doctor, Jackie Earle Haley as  drunker handyman, and Bella Heathcote as a nanny who bears a striking  resemblance to Barnabas&#8217; lost love Josette &#8212; devolved into feckless  dissolution, and Carpenters music everywhere. It will take the  formidable powers of the <em>Nosferatu</em> to rescue the accursed clan, and prove that there is indeed life after undeath.</p>
<p>Cinefantastique Online&#8217;s Steve Biodrowski, Lawrence French, and Dan  Persons have seen the film, and sit down to discuss whether Burton&#8217;s  more comedic take on <em>Dark Shadows</em>&#8216; melodramatics are worth the trip back to the Me Decade. Also in this show: What&#8217;s coming to theaters.</p>

<p>A comedy about dire consequences, WHERE DO WE GO NOW? takes a look at the ease with which humanity slips into war, and the sometimes insurmountable difficulties that arise as people struggle to avoid it. Setting the film in a small Lebanese village where Christian and Muslim live side-by-side, director/writer/actress Nadine Labaki tells the tale of women &#8212; wives and mothers who have seen too many husbands and sons claimed in pointless battles &#8212; attempting to stave off another religious conflict through methods ranging from dissuading the men folk with direct entreaties to distracting them with a bus full of Ukrainian strippers (U.N, take note: works better than a planeload of old white guys).</p>
<p>As with her previous film, CARAMEL, Labaki manages to mix an empathetic understanding of human tragedy with warm, wry humor. For so gentle an outlook, the film has a powerhouse impact, which made it a genuine pleasure to talk with Labaki for this episode.</p>

<p>Like a black velvet reproduction of<em> Guernica</em>, SGT. PEPPER&#8217;S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, the movie, takes one of the landmark works of art of the twentieth century and renders it shallow, pointless and silly. Included in its list of crimes: entrusting the Beatles&#8217; most innovative work to the likes of the Bee Gees, Peter Frampton, Steve Martin and Alice Cooper, among an almost infinite roster of incomprehensible casting choices; and placing the whole mess in the hands of a director who was clearly incapable of telling a coherent story (the magical musical instruments need to be stolen because why? And how exactly does that lead to the charming town of Heartland, U.S.A. being turned into Pottersville?), but never met a cheapjack, circa seventies special effects trope he didn&#8217;t like.
<p>Does that mean the film should be avoided like the plague? Aw, hell, no &#8212; here is a musical (rock opera, actually) so wrongheaded in all its aspects that it manages to work its way around to inventing its own brand of awesomeness &#8212; <em>terrible</em> awesomeness, to be sure, but awesome nevertheless. All of which makes it perfect for worship upon the altar of the Temple of Bad. Come join Andrea Lipinski, Keven Lauderdale, and Dan Persons as they delve into this singular time capsule of seventies pop culture, style, and, most of all, <em>hair,</em> and have a few larfs at its expense.</p>

<p>If truth is stranger than fiction, then can a serial killer inspired  by the eminently strange writings of Edgar Allan Poe be said to be even  stranger still? In THE RAVEN, a mad murderer has managed to engineer the  deaths of his victims in ways that accurately (and in some cases,  implausibly) replicate the works of one of the true geniuses of horror,  and only Poe (John Cusack) can break the clues that will end the crime  spree.</p>
<p>Cinefantastique Online’s Steve Biodrowski, Lawrence French, and Dan  Persons sit down to contrast the film with its source materials and  discuss whether director James McTeigue (V FOR VENDETTA) has succeeded  in turning Poe’s baroque fantasies into a compelling dark mystery. Also  in the show: A brief conversation of THE HOBBIT’s less-than-triumphant  technical sneak preview, and what’s coming to theaters.</p>
