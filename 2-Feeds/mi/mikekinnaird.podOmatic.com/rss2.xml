    <description>Let's start an FM radio station in your school. Live radio with a real audience.  At least let's get started with an internal Intranet service.  I'm Mike Kinnaird and as a ex-BBC radio producer of 15 years plus, I've just about got the hang of it! So let me pass on my experiences to you with these podcasts.Using audio across the curriculum is what I'm about. We can take your lessons to a different level, creating highly customizable resources that you can share with colleagues and create jointly with students. Everything from maths to geography, citizenship to history. Audio resources are cheap and fast to turnaround and recording and editing them well is not the secret so many would have you believe.  Now add that to School FM Radio - even internal radio, and we have a seriously powerful tool that students respond to immediately.  I know because I've tried it again and again -- that's what these podcasts are about.  Hints and tips for you to get started and what the advantages, and crucially, the disadvantages are. Enjoy listening and tell me what you'd like us to talk about.</description>

                So, programmes to plan, guests to fix, competitions to devise, music to choose and some practice in the school's studio would be good.  Will it all come together in time?  Or will they have all fallen out long before!

I have been asked to work with 12 mid-teens who want to make a short radio programme for the first time, to be broadcast on their school's internal intranet system.

Students in the UK and students in the US - four hours time difference, but they joined together for a really sucessful education and radio project.  It was live and it was free!
The end result?  A bit of fun obviously, but also a real prospect of better grades, as Mike explains...</description>
