From Americas hills to its dales and beyond -- curious dude Brad Rowe and keeper of useless knowledge Noam Dromi seek out deep thinkers and shallow swimmers with reckless abandon as they attempt to find out anything and everything that is interesting about the world as we know it.

From quantum psychics to sorcery, from Wall Street to the remote hills of Afghanistan, MIPtalk and its guests will take you there (and that is only in the first month). Each week, your intrepid hosts will mix up these morsels into a hearty stew of superlative podcasting goodness. They do it because they care.</description>

<p>Today she shares that passion with hundreds of kids every year.  This weekend she is putting on an event to bring the work of established artists like Shepard Fairey and John Lithgow to their fans to benefit art programs for children that attend LAUSD schools.</p>
<p>The program is called STARS ALIGNED TO SAVE THE ARTS &#8211; BENEFIT TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ARTS EDUCTION FOR OUR CHILDREN.  This event hopes to protect public school arts programs from the 100% proposed cuts they face.</p>
<p>On Saturday, June 2, 2012, from 3:00pm-6:30pm government officials and celebrities will join Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) teachers, students and parents for  Save the Arts, a benefit that includes performances to resuscitate arts education.  The event will be held at the historic Coconut Grove, 3400 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles 90010.</p>
<p>Listen as Suzanne vamps on all things thespianic (if that’s a word) and academic.  Enjoy 15 minutes with Suzanne and MIPtalk.com host Brad Rowe.</p>

<p>What are the major terrorist threats not yet on our radar?</p>
<p><span id="more-1147"></span></p>
<p>How are New York and other cities around the world adjusting to modern security threats?  Just ask Mitchell Silber. He sat down with <em>The Generation </em>co-editor Brad Rowe in UCLA’s Murphy Sculpture Garden to discuss his new book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Al-Qaeda-Factor-Plots-Against/dp/0812244028">The Al Qaeda Factor</a></em>, terrorist threats in the Western Hemisphere, and his inspiring personal journey from Wall Street to NYPD (which he has served for seven years).</p>
<p>Silber is the Director of both the NYPD Intelligence Division’s Analytic and Cyber Units. He supervises the analysis of the portfolio of terrorism-related investigations within the Intelligence Division.</p>
<p>This episode was produced in partnership with <a href="http://www.the-generation.net/" target="_blank"><strong>The Generation</strong></a>, an online journal featuring students’ perspectives on international relations and global current events. The site’s title is a recognition that — through factors such as news, social media, and diversity — today’s generation of young people are more aware and active in global events than ever before.</p>

<p><strong><span id="more-1140"></span> <a href="http://www.echoparenting.org/who-we-are/about-ruth" target="_blank">Ruth Beaglehole’s</a></strong> story begins in New Zealand; born to Academic parents, with one sister and two brothers.

<p>Her story is triumphant, disturbing, lovely and delivered with the indomitable wry wit many have come to know her by.</p>
<p>From her modest beginnings in the 1970s cutting her teeth on the relevant parenting and teaching issues of the day, she discovered and honed a philosophy that is changing the way we look at our children.  She has had a major impact through her work with LAUSD teachers, founding a Teen Mother Program, creating the Center for Nonviolent Education and Parenting and finally transforming her works into the center that bears the name of the neighborhood it was developed in &#8211; The Echo Parenting and Education Center.</p>

Recently MIPtalk host Brad Rowe had the great pleasure to sit down with the founder of Echo Parenting &#38; Education in LA.
 Ruth Beaglehole’s story begins in New Zealand; born to Academic parents, with one sister and two brothers. Ruth’s childhood was “complicated”, to use her own words. Her own struggle would become Ruth’s biggest asset.
Her story is triumphant, disturbing, lovely and delivered with the indomitable wry wit many have come to know her by.

<p>We&#8217;re back from our summer hiatus. This week&#8217;s guest is former Ning.com CEO <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Bianchini"><strong>Gina Bianchini.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span id="more-1131"></span></strong>I met Gina with a group of friends down in Cabo San Lucas last year.  While enjoying good Mexican food, drink, and sunsets, we got to talking about what is important in the world and what is missing from the business, political and media conversations these days.</p>
<p>What we settled on was a realization that there is a lack of humanity and compassion in how people communicate with each other in these realms.</p>
<p>Together with Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, Gina founded Ning, an online platform for people to create their own social networks in October 2005.   She left the company in March of 2010 to serve as an executive in residence at the Andreesen Horowitz venture firm.</p>
<p>Some time passed and I needed to follow up with her and thought it would be great to get her on film to talk about a new business venture she is launching in Palo Alto.  I asked her why she is working literally blocks from her alma mater Stanford.  For as worldly as she is in some ways, at heart she&#8217;s a Silicon Valley girl: born and raised in the shadow of Apple in Cupertino, a Stanford girl and now ten plus years in business in Palo Alto.  It seems like she may be here to stay.  And why not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Join MIPtalk for a conversation with one of the nicest people around and a look into one of the most brilliant entrepreneurial minds of our day.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the conversation.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tiffanyshlain.com/tiffanyshlain/Home.html" target="_blank"><strong>Tiffany Shlain</strong></a>, celebrated filmmaker and renowned founder of <strong><a title="The Webby Awards" href="http://www.webbyawards.com/" target="_blank">The Webby Awards</a></strong>, wants you to GET CONNECTED. And she has a fascinating story to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-1057"></span>In her new film <strong>Connected: An Autoblogography about Love, Death and Technology, </strong>she rallies audiences to participate in a &#8220;Declaration of Interdependence&#8221;  that celebrates human connection throughout time and the role that technology and social media has in shaping our future.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can see the trailer here:</p>
<p><object width="467" height="264"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ESVfGVQmk6Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="467" height="264" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ESVfGVQmk6Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s what she says in her director&#8217;s statement about the film:<strong><br />
</strong><br />
<em>I hope that  “Connected,” will help create a global conversation about what it means  to be connected in the 21st century.  I believe that by engaging people  to talk about connectedness in their own lives and in the world, the  ripple effect of these conversations will have far reaching impact.   Appreciating that this is a huge subject, I employ many tactics (humor,  animation, archival and my own personal story) to attempt to untangle  what interdependence and connectedness mean in terms of the history of  the human species and moving forward. Through this journey, I wield a  large magnifying glass to look at some of the absurd and beautiful  behaviors of our species and our world. While the core components of  humans desire to be &#8220;connected,&#8221; have not changed since we first  appeared on this planet, I believe a new zeitgeist is emerging through  all these new technologies that are making our world smaller and more  intertwined.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In Part 1 of our interview, we talk about Tiffany&#8217;s upbringing, the work of her father (the late surgeon and author Leonard Shlain), her early career as a filmmaker and how she founded the Webbys.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tiffany is an incredibly inspiring storyteller and we hope you enjoy hearing what she has to say.</p>
<p>Check out one of her TED talks for last year:<br />

<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-1017"></span>But you probably know their story. On January 8, 2011, they were part of a group of roughly 30 people attending a constituent meeting called &#8220;Congress on Your Corner&#8221; being held by Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at a Safeway supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. Shortly after 10am, 22 year old Jared Loughner approached the gathering and shot Representative Giffords in the head before firing indiscriminately at others in the crowd. Those pictured above were killed and 14 others were severely injured. Giffords survived and doctors have been very optimistic about her slow recovery.</p>
<p>In the days after the attack, the national dialogue devolved into blame and recrimination about whether or not heated political rhetoric contributed to Loughner&#8217;s actions.

<p><strong>Jonas Elrod</strong> really does see dead people. Angels. Demons. Auras and ghosts. And he would very much like to know why.</p>
<p><span id="more-869"></span>Jonas searches for answers in the powerful new documentary feature <strong><a href="http://wakeupthefilm.com/" target="_blank">Wake Up</a></strong>.  Here&#8217;s a synopsis:</p>
<p><em>Jonas Elrod was a 37-year-old filmmaker who enjoyed a successful career  shooting commercials, music videos, and documentaries when one day,  while planning his next day&#8217;s shooting schedule in a San Francisco hotel  room, he began to see visions. Since that day, Elrod says he sees  ghosts, demons, angels, colorful clouds of energy, and personal auras  wherever he goes, and he can&#8217;t explain what is happening to him or why.  Elrod and his girlfriend began looking for a reason for this phenomenon,  and visited a long series of doctors, psychiatrists, and spiritual  teachers, trying to determine if his visions were the product of an  illness, psychosis, or a genuine spiritual apparition, and as the  process went on, Elrod found he wasn&#8217;t certain if his visions were a  curse or a blessing. Filmmaker Chloe Crespi (who saw ghosts as a child)  began helping Elrod make a film about his experiences and his search for  an answer to an almost impossible question, and Wake Up is a  documentary about a man chasing a mystery and looking for answers within  and outside himself. Wake Up was an official selection at the 2009  South by Southwest Film Festival.</em></p>
