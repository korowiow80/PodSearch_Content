			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who?</strong> Klute, or as his mum likes to call him, Tom Withers is a London d&#8217;n'b producer with over 20 years experience of tinkering in electronic music production.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Well, as we said, Tom&#8217;s been getting busy production wise for over 20 years now with a CV that includes releases on Ninja Tune, Metalheadz and Hospital. Starting out in techno, he made the sidestep to d&#8217;n'b in the mid nineties, releasing debut LP, &#8216;Casual Bodies&#8217; in 1998. In 2001 he established his label Commercial Suicide and has since released several of his own albums on it. He was also the last artist to ever be played on the radio by the late, great John Peel with his track &#8216;Time 4 Change&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I see him?</strong> Klute will be playing We Fear Silence at London&#8217;s Cable this Saturday (June 2). Catch him lining up alongside Nymfo, Calibre, Marcus Intalex, Dom &amp; Roland plus MC&#8217;s Lowqui, Ryme Tyme and Justyce. Tickets can be bought <a href="http://www.cable-london.com/event/commercial-suicide-nymfo-album-launch-party-with-calibre-nymfo-more/?t=33">here</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you go weak at the knees for a garage beat, silky smooth vocal and incessant chanting of the word rewind, then the names Wookie and Matt Jam are going to need no introduction.</p>
<p>With over 20 years in the business, working with the likes of Soul II Soul and Dynamite MC before making his name as a producer in his own right, it&#8217;s fair to say Wookie has had something of an illustrious career.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.swindleproductions.co.uk/">Swindle</a> and <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/silkie">Silkie</a> make sound system smashing grime and dubstep with a stylish, totally   soulful touch. After having worked in separate circles for some time   (Swindle with heavyweight tracks on Planet Mu and Rwina, Silkie with two   stunning albums on Deep Medi) they came together on &#8216;Unlimited&#8217;, a   collaboration forthcoming on Butterz. The track is a perfect example of   the bass heavy but irresistibly funk inflected sound that the pair have   been championing. It&#8217;s a 140bpm banger that splices grime attitude,   dubstep weight and an ear for melody that sets dance floors on fire.</p>
<p>The duo also stepped into the booth together for the first time   recently, making light work of dropping groove laden grime and dubstep   jams. After hearing them go tune for tune, <em>Mixmag</em> had to get   Swindle and Silkie at the controls for a Mix Of The Week. This is their   first mixtape together and they come armed with cuts from Silkie&#8217;s   massive 2011 album &#8216;City Limits Vol. 2&#8242;, Swindle&#8217;s forthcoming tracks   with Stinkahbell and Footsie as well as the aforementioned   collaboration. If you&#8217;re sick of wobble and bored of flaccid mid range   synths, then this is the perfect antidote. 100% Swindle and Silkie   productions throughout, this is the crucial sound of underground bass   music.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Swindle and Silkie make sound system smashing grime and dubstep with a stylish, totally   soulful touch. After having worked in separate circles for some time   (Swindle with heavyweight tracks on Planet Mu and Rwina, Silkie with two   stunning albums on Deep Medi) they came together on 'Unlimited', a   collaboration forthcoming on Butterz. The track is a perfect example of   the bass heavy but irresistibly funk inflected sound that the pair have   been championing. It's a 140bpm banger that splices grime attitude,   dubstep weight and an ear for melody that sets dance floors on fire.

The duo also stepped into the booth together for the first time   recently, making light work of dropping groove laden grime and dubstep   jams. After hearing them go tune for tune, Mixmag had to get   Swindle and Silkie at the controls for a Mix Of The Week. This is their   first mixtape together and they come armed with cuts from Silkie's   massive 2011 album 'City Limits Vol. 2', Swindle's forthcoming tracks   with Stinkahbell and Footsie as well as the aforementioned   collaboration. If you're sick of wobble and bored of flaccid mid range   synths, then this is the perfect antidote. 100% Swindle and Silkie   productions throughout, this is the crucial sound of underground bass   music.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might recognise Mike Norris as the guy who plays keyboards in La   Roux&#8217;s live band. But you might not recognise him as Fort Romeau, the   one man production unit currently specialising in lush deep house that   nods toward Detroit and Chicago.</p>
<p>His forthcoming debut LP &#8216;Kingdoms&#8217;, out March 6, took <em>Mixmag</em> HQ totally by surprise. Released by the consistently on-point 100%   Silk, it&#8217;s Norris&#8217; very first release as Fort Romeau and contains 8   tracks of retro-referencing house that moves in a forward thinking   direction.</p>
<p>We asked the man himself to go into the mix and he&#8217;s come back with a   45 minute work out that takes in Boddika, Kassem Mosse, Midland and   Evan Tuell. It&#8217;s a highly rhythmic selection from a producer who has   come up with one of the best records of the year so far, which you can   also preview below. Check it!</p>
<p>1. Untitled 1 - Marvin Dash 2. Boddika&#8217;s House - Boddika 3. Voyeruism  - Claro Intelecto 4. Moment (George Fitzgerald Remix) - Lee Jones 5.  Coloured Sands - Glenn Astro 6.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaudi  is a full time internationally touring solo artist, a studio  producer  in demand and a respected musical innovator. In a career that  spans over  thirty years, he&#8217;s had chart hits, gold discs and awards  &amp;  nominations for his work; he has released 12 solo albums, has  more than  250 productions and 90 remixes to his name and his tracks  feature on  more than 120 compilations. His most recent compilation,  EVERLASTING, a  double CD of largely unreleased gems is a must for  electronic music  fans. Check it out <a href="http://www.iboga.dancefoundation.nl/news/2011/11/v-a-everlasting-compiled-by-gaudi-coming-soon/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Also catch Gaudi at Glade Festival 14 - 17th June 2012 <a title="www.gladefestival.com" href="http://www.gladefestival.com/">www.gladefestival.com</a></p>
<p>Gaudi&#8217;s innovative approach to live performance and versatility as a   producer has kept him at the forefront of his field throughout a  notable  and prolific career. His music is stylistically hard to pin  down as he  is an artist in constant evolution. His musical exploration,  over the  last 30 years in the industry, has however seen him foray  into punk, new  wave, dub and reggae, world, experimental electronica  and &#8217;stuff that  rocks dancefloors&#8217;. He has however got deep roots,  which run like a vein  throughout his music, and they are big basslines,  the spacious  soundscapes of dub and the anarchic sonic potential of  the world of  electronic music. <a title="www.gaudimusic.com" href="http://www.gaudimusic.com/">www.gaudimusic.com</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Considered a true pioneer of the scene, DJ Hatcha’s roots in dubstep   go back to the late 90s. His influence over the course of the genre is   undisputed, even playing a part in naming it. It was no surprise last   year when we nominated him in the Greatest DJ Of All Time poll alongside   the likes of Fatboy Slim, Jeff Mills and Carl Cox.</p>
<p>Continuing to dominate the genre whether it’s through his DJ gigs at   the infamous FWD&gt;&gt; nights or festivals across the globe, you’ll   also find Hatcha championing the sound through his weekly Kiss FM show,   whilst keeping you entertained via Hatcha TV. Here he&#8217;s done our   Marooned on Mars feature - a bit like Desert Island Discs, he plays us   the five records he would take with him if he was Marooned on Mars.</p>
<p>Hatcha recently mixed 100% Pure Dubstep Volume 2. Check it out <a href="http://www.facebook.com/100PureDubstep" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>Kicking off the show with a 20 minute mix is Hatcha&#8217;s labelmate,   Lost. His debut release &#8216;Neck Back&#8217; was released on Hatcha &amp;   N-Type&#8217;s Sin City records label. After plays out on Kiss100fm, Lost was   singled out by dubstep don, Jakes, and asked to join the Hench crew.   Take a listen and you&#8217;ll hear why!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2001, Stanton Warriors laid down a fresh new sound with the seminal   ‘Stanton Sessions’ that was instantly signed to XL Recordings.   Overnight, Stanton Warriors became the hottest producers on the planet,   and today they continue to stay at the very pinnacle of their   profession. Stanton Warriors DJ sets are famed for incorporating   exclusive original tracks mixed with homemade edits / remixes of cutting   edge sounds from underground house through to abstract hip hop. It’s   all blended into a melting pot of low down booty-electro-punkishness,   and is continually reminding the world why Stanton Warriors have   remained unrivalled in their genre for more than a decade. So needless   to say we&#8217;re well happy they&#8217;ve done a MOTW for us!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reset! is a collective formed in 2007 in Milan by 5 DJs, producers   and promoters, who have been playing around with decks, keyboards and   samplers for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Whether it’s in the studio, behind the decks or promoting their own   nights, Reset! regularly pull in more than 2000 clubbers to their   parties in Milan and are clocking up the air miles by playing some of   the biggest parties around the world, mixing up everything from electro,   bassline, filtered house, disco and old school party anthems.</p>
<p>It was after playing alongside French housers Cassius that Reset!   were invited to rework the French duo&#8217;s anthemic single &#8220;Youth, Speed,   Trouble, Cigarettes&#8221;. The resulting remix was featured on a Mixmag cover   CD.</p>
<p>Following this breakthrough Reset!’s unmistakable funk yet banging   sound has been in constant demand with the boys adding their Italian   touch to a string of remixes for the likes of Fatboy Slim, Audio Bullys,   Robyn, Fenech Soler, and once again Cassius, remixing the house  classic  Cassius 99. Their latest remix for Bosco Delrey is featured on  Mad  Decent compilation Vol.1 by Diplo.</p>
<p>Signing to Hervé&#8217;s Cheap Thrills label,  the crew released three EPs   and got props from the likes of Justice’s Xavier De Rosnay, Armand Van   Helden, Radio 1’s Annie Mac, Alex Metric, Jaymo &amp; Andy George,  Kissy  Sellout, NAPT and thousands of clubbers around the world.</p>
<p>Reset! play XOYO alongside Plump DJs and Burns on Feb 11.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.swindleproductions.co.uk/">Swindle</a> and <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/silkie">Silkie</a> make sound system smashing grime and dubstep with a stylish, totally  soulful touch. After having worked in separate circles for some time  (Swindle with heavyweight tracks on Planet Mu and Rwina, Silkie with two  stunning albums on Deep Medi) they came together on &#8216;Unlimited&#8217;, a  collaboration forthcoming on Butterz. The track is a perfect example of  the bass heavy but irresistibly funk inflected sound that the pair have  been championing. It&#8217;s a 140bpm banger that splices grime attitude,  dubstep weight and an ear for melody that sets dance floors on fire.</p>
<p>The duo also stepped into the booth together for the first time  recently, making light work of dropping groove laden grime and dubstep  jams. After hearing them go tune for tune, <em>Mixmag</em> had to get  Swindle and Silkie at the controls for a Mix Of The Week. This is their  first mixtape together and they come armed with cuts from Silkie&#8217;s  massive 2011 album &#8216;City Limits Vol. 2&#8242;, Swindle&#8217;s forthcoming tracks  with Stinkahbell and Footsie as well as the aforementioned  collaboration. If you&#8217;re sick of wobble and bored of flaccid mid range  synths, then this is the perfect antidote. 100% Swindle and Silkie  productions throughout, this is the crucial sound of underground bass  music.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might recognise Mike Norris as the guy who plays keyboards in La  Roux&#8217;s live band. But you might not recognise him as Fort Romeau, the  one man production unit currently specialising in lush deep house that  nods toward Detroit and Chicago.</p>
<p>His forthcoming debut LP &#8216;Kingdoms&#8217;, out March 6, took <em>Mixmag</em> HQ totally by surprise. Released by the consistently on-point 100%  Silk, it&#8217;s Norris&#8217; very first release as Fort Romeau and contains 8  tracks of retro-referencing house that moves in a forward thinking  direction.</p>
<p>We asked the man himself to go into the mix and he&#8217;s come back with a  45 minute work out that takes in Boddika, Kassem Mosse, Midland and  Evan Tuell. It&#8217;s a highly rhythmic selection from a producer who has  come up with one of the best records of the year so far, which you can  also preview below. Check it!</p>
<p>1. Untitled 1 - Marvin Dash 2. Boddika&#8217;s House - Boddika 3. Voyeruism - Claro Intelecto 4. Moment (George Fitzgerald Remix) - Lee Jones 5. Coloured Sands - Glenn Astro 6. Palm Trees (Serge &amp; Tyrell Dub Mix) - Gerd 7. The Alps (Kassem Mosse Fix) - Braiden 8. Creepy Crawlies - Ossie 9. Masks - Martyn 10. Tape Burn - Midland 11. Untitled 1 - Evan Tuell 12. I Need U - Fort Romeau

		<itunes:summary>You might recognise Mike Norris as the guy who plays keyboards in La  Roux's live band. But you might not recognise him as Fort Romeau, the  one man production unit currently specialising in lush deep house that  nods toward Detroit and Chicago.

His forthcoming debut LP 'Kingdoms', out March 6, took Mixmag HQ totally by surprise. Released by the consistently on-point 100%  Silk, it's Norris' very first release as Fort Romeau and contains 8  tracks of retro-referencing house that moves in a forward thinking  direction.

We asked the man himself to go into the mix and he's come back with a  45 minute work out that takes in Boddika, Kassem Mosse, Midland and  Evan Tuell. It's a highly rhythmic selection from a producer who has  come up with one of the best records of the year so far, which you can  also preview below. Check it!

1. Untitled 1 - Marvin Dash 2. Boddika's House - Boddika 3. Voyeruism - Claro Intelecto 4. Moment (George Fitzgerald Remix) - Lee Jones 5. Coloured Sands - Glenn Astro 6. Palm Trees (Serge &#x38; Tyrell Dub Mix) - Gerd 7. The Alps (Kassem Mosse Fix) - Braiden 8. Creepy Crawlies - Ossie 9. Masks - Martyn 10. Tape Burn - Midland 11. Untitled 1 - Evan Tuell 12. I Need U - Fort Romeau</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaudi  is a full time internationally touring solo artist, a studio producer  in demand and a respected musical innovator. In a career that spans over  thirty years, he&#8217;s had chart hits, gold discs and awards &amp;  nominations for his work; he has released 12 solo albums, has more than  250 productions and 90 remixes to his name and his tracks feature on  more than 120 compilations. His most recent compilation, EVERLASTING, a  double CD of largely unreleased gems is a must for electronic music  fans. Check it out <a href="http://www.iboga.dancefoundation.nl/news/2011/11/v-a-everlasting-compiled-by-gaudi-coming-soon/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Also catch Gaudi at Glade Festival 14 - 17th June 2012 <a title="www.gladefestival.com" href="http://www.gladefestival.com/">www.gladefestival.com</a></p>
<p>Gaudi&#8217;s innovative approach to live performance and versatility as a  producer has kept him at the forefront of his field throughout a notable  and prolific career. His music is stylistically hard to pin down as he  is an artist in constant evolution. His musical exploration, over the  last 30 years in the industry, has however seen him foray into punk, new  wave, dub and reggae, world, experimental electronica and &#8217;stuff that  rocks dancefloors&#8217;. He has however got deep roots, which run like a vein  throughout his music, and they are big basslines, the spacious  soundscapes of dub and the anarchic sonic potential of the world of  electronic music. <a title="www.gaudimusic.com" href="http://www.gaudimusic.com/">www.gaudimusic.com</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our Mix Of The Week comes from rave legends the Utah Saints. One of  the duo&#8217;s biggest hits was ‘What Can You Do For Me’ .
