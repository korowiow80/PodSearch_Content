Announcement
Going forward Millionaire or Bust will be moving away from a weekly schedule, due to the fact that I need to dedicate more time and energy to our other website, BeingHealthy.TV.  Talli and I are creating more and more content there every week and I needed to decide where to throw my main focus. As the bigger of the two sites, BeingHealthy.TV won.  And speaking of winning, Talli&#8217;s audio podcast Being Healthy for Busy People is a finalist in the 2009 Podcast Awards. Back to the point though, MillionaireOrBust.com will still be producing content, but not on a regular schedule. As time permits and inspiration strikes, I&#8217;ll be producing podcasts and, new for me, blog posts on finance related topics.  I will be moving away from news a bit to focus more on money saving tips and money making tips though.
Thank you to everyone who has supported the podcast and thank you to everyone who stays subscribed. It has been and continues to be an honor to have such a great group of listeners. 
Sincerely, David van Sunder

		<itunes:summary>This week&#8217;s episode of Millionaire or Bust was recorded after a missed week.  I have to apologize because I take my responsibility to my listeners to get a show out weekly, very seriously.

		<itunes:summary>Last week, I said that this week would most likely be a &#8220;vacation week&#8221; unless I received enough user contributed material or a guest hosted the show.  Well, Shawno of the Hyper Nonsense podcast stepped in and did an excellent job. If you enjoy the show on a weekly basis, you&#8217;ll enjoy the show that he&#8217;s put together for this week.  He decided to focus on an area that has been a focal point of the past year: bank failures.  It sounds dry, but he put together an interesting show that I think you&#8217;ll enjoy. I know I enjoyed it.
Here are the articles and links mentioned in this week&#8217;s show:
