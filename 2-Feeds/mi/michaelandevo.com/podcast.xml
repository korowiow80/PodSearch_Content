Silent Studio audience is non existent. They are a bunch of loud drunkards!



First Fifteenth Drink of the Day: Mike breaks open the Rogue HazelNut Brown Nectar,  Brian opens a Stone Smoked Porter and a Young&#039;s Double Chocolate Stout. We also have Thomas&#039;s Hefe, Maibock and Black Ales on tap. Big thanks to him for bringing that down!

Food of the day: Kris and Tim made a metric ass ton of food. Charlie brought his smoked meat. Kebabs for EVERYONE!
	Geeklabel love. Go grab a cool tshirt!
	Enormous gets shot by Brian for messing with Mike.
	The Pool Party needs cabana boys and girls. Don&#039;t drink the pool!
	A toast to Tee Morris since he couldn&#039;t make it - He had to pull out at the last moment.
	First there was elf porn, now we go to Smurf porn. Alec knows about Smurf porn.
	So what does a Smurf tasty like? Ask Smurfette.
	More Smurf talk.
	Yooper mistakes Kenny for a vagina.
	Jarsto brings the B5 vs Wingin&#039; It smackdown.
	Enormous from Australia calls in? Wait isn&#039;t he here?! He&#039;s taking a piss.

	Edmund from Greenville brings in even more B5 vs WI smackdown.
	Professional Air Guitar competition. Yes, it&#039;s real.
	Air Bands? Imagine the tryouts.
	Air teaching? Air beer drinking? Air competitions for everything?
	Mike gets technically geeky. We&#039;ve talked out our content.
	And then...Ooooh SHINY! Things go sideways and Mike loses control.
	Enormous stripping. Be thankful you&#039;re listening and you were not there.
	SciFi Laura is leaving for Beijing for 9 weeks. It&#039;ll be HOT there...oh and humid.
	Doug talks about Carl&#039;s Jr. having machines instead of cashiers. Big and Tasty&#039;s days are numbered.
	Big and Tasty IS the Fifth Cylon!
	Enormous went shopping and found the toast aisle.
	Mike hates the food propaganda. Enormous babbles about chickens, blenders and things.
	Last show forever. Truly. Tune in next week and you&#039;ll hear...nothing! Honest!

		<itunes:summary>On this week&#039;s show we have:  Mike, Brian, Mike Stackpole, Eliza, Alec, Kris and Debbie.

And now for the voicemails:




	Gazerbeam is late to the party. Who says we aren&#039;t drawing in new listeners?!
	Enormous asks Charlie how much is in a crap ton.
	Tony in Minnesota wonders if Summer is going to get her body painted at the pool party.
	Brian has pool party info -- brian at dragonpage dot com to get Pool Party directions if you are attending the Pool Party.
	Moose is being censored by his cell phone. Vespas and something something?
	All sorts of vespa clubs. Here is a site with a bunch of vespa events.
	Andrea thanks Enormous for the well wishes. If Enormous is coming through Chicago email Andrea.
	Andrea doesn&#039;t feel bad for the cicadas.
	Eric in Sydney gives us a clit joke.
	Tony calls in with the nice praise.
	Anna in Washington watched Catwoman on an airplane.
	Enormous asks about the poo talk in the last show. Eliza is a southern Goth.
	Jules from Michigan (?) complains about George Hrab stripping when Leann was a perfect person to strip against George. I&#039;m thinking DragonCon STRIP OFF!
	Big and Tasty has better living through chemistry. Sleep deprivation makes everyone pretty.
	Kevin The Bodypainter tells a story.
	Big and Tasty is excited about the WI documentary. He obviously missed the fact that he should probably email Charlie since Charlie put out the call. Eliza wants a pony.
	Debbie brings the harshness onto B&amp;T.
	Jonathan has some First of May stories. He misses out on a money making opportunity.
	Gazerbeam takes a really long way around telling a bad pun. He is really late to the party.
	Chris the Fixed Kitty thinks we&#039;re taking over her topics. GO LISTEN TO CHRIS.
	Short show. CALL US! We like to respond.

Evo, Mike, Summer, Randy Innuendo, Brian, Tim, Kris the Kitchen Wench, Mistress Laurie, Debbie from East Mesa and all of Joe&#039;s Kinfolk -- We have Cousin John and his girlfriend Justine from California, Cousin Scott the homebrewer.

First Drink of the Day:  Island Brewing Company. Every damn one of their beers. Evo starts with the Paradise Pale Ale, Starry Night Stout for Mike and Brian, Tim has a  Obsidian Stout by Deschutes Brewery, Debbie has her Shut-Up Popsicle Juice from the Fuck You! Brewery in Kiss My Ass Wisconsin. Kris is drinking  Fort by Dogfish Head Brewery.



Kris baked us cherry pie and chocolate chip pumpkin bread.
Evo asks for things to talk about. Mike wants pimp FPM shows. Brian brings up Britney Shears. Kris points out that BS now looks like Mike. Evo asks about Mike if he shaves his pubes like Britney does. Mike pleads the fifth. I need mental chlorine now.
Chris the Fixed Kitty gives a traffic report. 
George Hrab&#039;s podcast check him out. George is DA BOMB YO!
 My God. It&#039;s full of Booookie.
Boookie, Boookie, Boookie
 Time to re-beer. Dude, we have a lot of beer to drink!
 Evo does the blonde -- Island blond that is. Everyone else grabs for whatever they want to drink.
FarPoint Media pimpage -- new shows for your ears people!
-	 Tim and Kris are working on  Foodgeeking .
-	The Zombie Channel.
-	Time for a little SciFi Smackdown 
-	Starship Smackdown
-	Fanboy Smackdown is now a part of  FarPoint Media.
-	Deep Geeking -- A work in progress.
-	Fans Talk Back -- Coming Soon.
Dr. Tran quotes go flying! We love Dr. Tran!
-	Welcome the first sports podcast to FPM.  Astrocast.

Evo wanders off from here thinking we&#039;re talking about ASStrocast. Watersports, Contact sports, and it goes downhill from here.
-	Variant Frequencies has also joined up. FPM really should mean Far Point Mafia.
Evo has an idea for a podcast. A musical podcast for geeks. Of course Summer and Mike are already have something in the works there. Scary isn&#039;t it?
 One last podcast &quot;Holy shit I&#039;m drunk!&quot; Oh wait. Nevermind. We call that Wingin&#039; It!
Karen from Kalifornia calls in and voices concerns for her hearing.  Karen has her revenge. Whoa, she knows Kung-Fu!
FPM gives good Boookie!
Boookie, Boookie, Boookie
Another re-beer? Damn. Evo has the Jubilee Ale. Tim has a 1554 Tim thinks he has to pound this because he missed one re-beer and has to keep up. Tim also thinks that liver damage only happens to those &quot;other&quot; people.
Evo has been following the news by going to  Al Jazeera . Tim and Evo need help with their Middle Eastern accents.
Chinese fraud involving ant breeding.
Tim &quot;needs&quot; more beer. He interrupts Evo&#039;s story and makes him testy. For those of you keeping the time at home, it&#039;s been 2 minutes since he opened that 1554. You think I&#039;m kidding about the liver damage.
Jeff enters the studio. Evo quizzes him about ants and Asians. This conversation goes downhill quickly.
Rapid Eye shares a drunk story.
 Judge me by my boookie?
 Boookie, Boookie, Boookie.
Re-beer time. You thought last week was bad? BWHAHAHHA!
Tim invokes the 2.0 rule set of the drinking game. Midget porn X 6!
 We have a contest! Win an Ohmibod. March 17th is the deadline. Send in your top 5 tunes to get off the ladies. Send it to contest at michaelandevo dot com.
Evo and Mike complain about Summer&#039;s password assignments for them. Do not MOCK YE THE ARCANE ARTS OF UNIX SERVER ADMINISTRATION!?
Mike plugs in Debbie&#039;s ohmibod.
Evo tries to talk to Cousin Scott about his home brewing site but the buzzing keeps distracting everyone. Is it me or does it sound like that sucker could hurt someone? Evo offers five bucks for Debbie insertion.
The last scifi poetry slam - Scott Virtes. He throws in some bonus limericks.
Boookie? We don need no stinkin&#039; Boookie!
 Boookie, Boookie, Boookie!
Re-beer? Sweet mother of GOD! Jeff brought more beer.</itunes:summary>

Get Your Geek Off: The G-Spot.  And on next week&#039;s show, they continue with the theme of &quot;impossible to find&quot; with compassionate conservatives.

A rendition of A Girl, a Goose, and We All Go Home.  Check out King Francis&#039; Live Journal
It&#039;s election week, and Evo&#039;s delving into politics.  And religion.  All he doesn&#039;t do is bring up Heroes to Jack.

Moose from the Great White North has some kind words for Evo about his new exercise program.
John from The Military and the Media Podcast (hope that&#039;s the right link).  We&#039;re his inspiration.  Actually, Jack must be, since he pimped his podcast.
A caller from Ohio works for the cleanest, sweetest McDonalds in the country.
Fred lets us know that &quot;frack&quot; has made it on to Veronica Mars and Gilmore Girls.  I knew that.  It has appeared at least three times on Veronica Mars.  That&#039;s like, three geekgasms in two episodes!  And speaking of &#039;gasms... (Fred, dude, email me the name of the video.  I am so not kidding.)

		<itunes:summary>Mike, Summer, Jack, and Kris the Cheesecake Lady, rock the fuckin&#039; mics!  Yeah!

I couldn&#039;t find the Miller Lite commercial Summer was talking about, but while searching I came across this old favorite.

First Drink of the Day:  Um, no firs... what?  What&#039;s happening?  They&#039;re talking about beer, but no music is playing.

Some news: The VM show is now being limited to a half hour.  We&#039;ll see how long this lasts.

And now for the voicemails:

Scott from Tucson also cuts his hair now.  BTW, Scott, what Safeway do you work at?
Moose from the great northeast didn&#039;t like our grown-up response to Charlie&#039;s beer nemeses.
Leif from wonderocity.com calls Evo to let him know he has some PME pics up at geekingoutloud.com
Rapid Eye, at Disneyland, Disneyworld, the Disney in Orlando, saw a friend of Wingin&#039; It the other night.
Arry from Boston gives us a yiddish lesson on &quot;schlamiel, schlamazel.&quot;
A caller, who doesn&#039;t identify himself, tells Mike he was the one who sent in the Tequila commercial.  We so need a DUMBASS tag.
Laura from Maryland has the crew raise their glasses to Dr. John Mather, who just won the Nobel prize in physics; and to La Vie Boheme.
Tim from Michigan wonders how Evo would have handled the Charlie bashing beercast had he been on the show that week.  Ok, enough with the goddamn beercast.

Andrea from Chicago confirms that Chicago is the angriest city.
Enormous from Australia wants naked painted chics at the pool party next year.
Gil from Milwaukee sends a shout-out to all those stuck in traffic.
Karen from Kalifornia, stuck in traffic, saw herself a loose woman the other day.
Ok, new topic for the voicemailers... you&#039;re at the checkout counter with condoms, what else do you have, make it interesting.  Difficulty: you can&#039;t have any of the items the crew mentions here.
Hey, it&#039;s... Karen!  I so wish I was at the PMEs.
Dwight from Ottawa invites the guys up north to meet some podcasters.
Mike is bitching about the upcoming winter.  In AZ.  Hundreds of North Dakotans are burning Mike in effigy as he speaks.  A fitting way to end the show, don&#039;t you think?

We&#039;re light on content.  People keep sending us stuff, then starting their own shows.  So, wanna start your own show?  Send us stuff!
Jack doesn&#039;t look like Jesus anymore.  All the Weird Al jokes I&#039;ve been saving, useless.  Thanks, Jack.  Thanks.
Mike is going to shave his head!  This is going to be so cool!
Shy?  Awkward?  Have we got the answer for you.
Evo and Mike fill us in on the PME party.  Michael Jordon sucks.  Podcast Pickle rules.

		<itunes:summary>This week, we bring you Mike, Summer, Charlie, and Jack.

First Drink of the Day: Bard&#039;s Tale Dragon&#039;s Gold from Flying Bison Brewing


And on this show:

Summer tells a pseudo-Mur joke.
Lots and lots of comments on the beer.
Big things happenin&#039; at Speaking of Beer.  Apparently, The Beer Report shit all over Charlie&#039;s podcast.  On the plus side, his audience grew a bit as a result.  So, we love these guys, right?
Get Your Geek Off: Does your penis say to-may-toe, or to-mah-toe?
A Haiku Moment: Testicle Discourse
More kilt wedgie and thong discussion.  Ok, I have to interject here.  Mike, what the hell is the difference between a thong and a g-string?
Scott Sigler never orders the macho combo!
Rebeer! with the Northcoast Brewing Company: PranQster, Old Plow Share Stout, and another one I can&#039;t spell or find.
Summer brings science fiction back to Wingin&#039; It, just for a moment.  There&#039;s going to be an animated Space Balls television series.
Are you a credits watcher?
Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp is now on DVD.
Discussion about some shows I was too young to watch: H.R. Pufnstuf, and Lidsville.
Scifi Poetry Slam: The Future, by ???


Next week, Mike and Evo will be out at the Portable Media Expo.  Should be a live show from there.

First Drink of the Day, thanks to Enormous from Australia, and dedicated to Steve Irwin: Cooper&#039;s Dark Ale, the Extra Stout, and OPA(?)


And now for the voicemails:

Scott from Tucson comes up with a name for a Killer Bunny card.  It&#039;s a pun.  Get it?  GET IT!?!
Mike of the Riverbend calls to ZZZzzzzzzzz.
It&#039;s Mark from Fuckin&#039; Memphis!
Megan from California fills us in on The Princeton Review Vocabulary Minute.
To Mason Rocket, from caller: Nipples are not dirty.  To caller, from Mason Rocket: Yes they are... AND THAT&#039;S A GOOD THING, KINDA LIKE PUSSY!  Know what&#039;s dirtier and better than a pair of nipples?  Two pairs of nipples rubbing against each other.  Or, two pussies rubbing against each other.  Or nipples rubbing against pussies.  My point is, nipples are dirty if it&#039;s done right.
What is the punchline to The Breakfast Club joke.  I hear a contest comin&#039; on!
Enormous from Australia can&#039;t figure out the beer openers.  There&#039;s a trick to them.
Scott tells the worst pun ever, but Summer seemed to like it.
Randal talks about Pluto, but he&#039;s wrong.  Pluto didn&#039;t fail to meet the definition of a planet because it crosses Neptune&#039;s path.  It fails because it has a lot of debris around it, therefore it failed to clear out it&#039;s path.  You can find a discussion of this very topic on Skepticality, where they discuss Pluto with Dr. Phil Plait.
Rapid Eye&#039;s had a couple of beers, he&#039;s in a field somewhere with a telescope.  Can&#039;t hear the rest, cause the guys are laughing all over it.
Rapid Eye calls again, and says the same thing, but sober.  I&#039;m thinking the voicemails should have been switched.
Andrea from Chicago was a Catholic school girl.  That is so dirty (see bullet point above).
Scott from Tucson is asking for a bumper.  Dude, if the bumper happens, it happens.  Don&#039;t force it.  Asking for a bumper is like reading what someone wrote in your yearbook right after they wrote in it.  It&#039;s just not cool.  And he says something about doughnuts.
Joel from California lets us know that Classic Episode Number 9 link is broken.
Andrea talks more about Catholic grade school sex education.
Um... that&#039;s mike at dragonpage.com
We changed the voicemail message, and there was much rejoicing.
Joel from California wants the uncensored Episode 30.
Hellziggy, long time listener, first time caller, disses Mike and advises on sending beer.
Anna in Washington has found good beer!  Has she found any more mur jokes?
Anna in Washington recommends to Sheila the Caramel Sugar Bomb... lite.  &#039;cause that one&#039;s good for ya.
How many mur voicemails are there in one show!
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuckity-fuck.
An apology from Alvie in Boulder.
Andrea, stuck in traffic, unloads.
Andrea wishes Charlie a Happy Birthday.
Arry from Boston goes a looooong way for a pun.  At least it&#039;s a clever one.
An opinion about the advertising.
Mike from Florida with a coffee comment.
Enormous from Australia loved our Dragon*Con shows.
Chris the Fixed Kitty has found The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.
Oh, My, God, It&#039;s IMP!  I&#039;m so fucking, god-damned, pissed that I&#039;m not going to the PME.  Son of a bitch!
Enormous from Australia on portion size.
Chad from Florida saw us live at Dragon*Con.  He loooooves us, he wants to maaarrrry us.

We have a list of classic episodes of Wingin&#039; It.  Tell your friends!  Hook &#039;em while they&#039;re young.
Scifi Poetry Slam: Paradox by Robert G. Parent
Starbucks coffees - how healthy are they?
High school football, woohoo!
Birmingham Educational&#039;s My Body Software:  Can you guess what part of the body they&#039;re going to talk about?  I got an idea.  I think that from now on, we should just refer to that part of the body as the &quot;mur.&quot;  So, this episode of BEMBS is about Karen&#039;s mur.  I got another idea.  The part of the male anatomy should be referred to as the &quot;evo.&quot;
A Haiku Moment
Into sex? Check out the bonobo and college coeds.  (And, while you&#039;re at it, check out Robert J. Sawyer&#039;s The Neanderthal Parallax books.)
Then we go into a discussion of &quot;Why do WOMEN lie about sex?&quot;
Evo opens mouth and so fuckin&#039; inserts foot.  Gloria Steinem... &quot;Who&#039;s she?&quot;
A bunch of people born in the &#039;60s and &#039;70s reminisce about the &#039;50s.
Charlie finally mentions the mur.
More Gloria talk.
Rebeer: Raison D&#039;Etre by Dogfish Head
Reverse graffiti, artistic expression, or corporate shit?
We need kilt wedgie pics for kiltwedgie.com
All 23,500 Segways have been recalled.  There are only 23,500 Segways?

Kris brought pumpkin nut chocolate chip bread.  Gods, I love this woman.

First Drink of the Day: Jordon&#039;s Mead by Skyclad Brewing.


And now for the voicemails:

Hey, fuckers!
Philip from Australia gave us some sweet-ass candy and chocolates.  We ate a lot this weekend.

Scott from Tucson suggests a Girls Gone Wild: Dragon*Con edition.
Enormous from Australia Smartie Hottie chats with Andrea and others.  DON&#039;T MIND US!
Andrea Smarty Hottie fills us in on a bunch of stuff.
The villification of nipples.
Not News: Paul in Elk River, stuck in traffic, saw himself a freakshow.  News: Where he saw the world&#039;s smallest woman.  Fark.com: Who was listening to Jack Mangan&#039;s Deadpan.
Philip from Australia: Philip follows a moron through the mountains.
Apparently the new version of iTunes sucks.  Thanks for the tip, Mike from the ???? podcast.
Eric from the OC calls for Joe (woohoo!) about Stephen King&#039;s The Gunslinger (doh!).
ditto suggests a keep Mur drunk fund.
ditto asks, &quot;What ever happened to Mark from Memphis?&quot;
A call about Nazis that at first sounds like it&#039;s going to a bad place, then goes somewhere unexpected.
Evo=Nero.  Duh.
Scott from Tucson drinks a lot of empty calories.  Seriously, a lot doesn&#039;t even cover it.
Reaver in Madison is drunk and dialing, &#039;cuz her momma brought her some brew made by her brother.  Alcoholism, keep it in the family.
A caller from Ottawa always has to watch Deathrace 2000.
Lame Summer is gone joke.
?????????
Michael in Nashville would watch anything by Joss, and recommends a Wingin&#039; It commentary for SNAKES ON A MOTHER FUCKIN&#039; PLANE!!!
Dani in NC calls.  I don&#039;t know what she&#039;s talking about, as her voice just hypnotises me.

Paul from Des Moines has a suggestion for the new My Name is Bruce movie.

		<itunes:summary>Mike, Evo, Jack, Sheila, and Debbie from East Mesa.

Help Evo fight the WIPO Broadcast Treaty.

First Drink of the Day, brought to us by Evo: Pomalucha (?) for Mike, La Bonitas for Evo, Stone Levitation Ale for Sheila, and Shark Bite for Jack.


And now:

Phil Plait, the Bad Astronomer, explained to us what a parsec is at the Dragon*Con LIVE WINGIN&#039; IT SHOW!
Reclitation, a response through essay, by an anonymous contributor.
Evo gives a shout out to the Geeklabel podcast.
We have the best listeners.  They brought all the booze to our parties over Dragon*Con.  Oh, and Langly showed up on Friday night!
Chris the Fixed Kitty has a clit story for Mur.  And tells what movies she&#039;s a sucker for.
Thirty-two ounces is a small?  We&#039;re talking soft drinks, people.  Also, Mike and Evo are fast eaters.  No, really, you have no idea, they&#039;re like Hoover vacuum cleaners.  It&#039;s amazing.
Michael&#039;s Deep Thought of the Week: How do you know if a man wearing wearing a kilt is a real Scotsman?
Rebeer: Monty Python&#039;s Holy Grail Ale, Sam Adam&#039;s Cherry Wheat Beer
Jack and Evo talk about their time at Worldcon.
Evo&#039;s retiring a word from his vocabulary.  Mike also has a word he&#039;s retiring, but it&#039;s a lame one.  So, everyone goes around the table and shares what they think should go from the language.  Guys ever hear of E-prime?
GYGO: Andrea and Jeremy rip off Mur, and talk about the clit.
A little more Dragon*Con talk, mostly about sexy costumes.
A new movie to get behind, My Name is Bruce.  Mike has one too, but it&#039;s a lame one.


Promos:
Sending a Wave Podcast
The Goddess and Banana
The Fanboy Smackdown

First Drink of the Day - paid for by the Magnum&#039;s beer fund:  Summer Solstice Cerveza Crema from Anderson Valley Brewing Co.  Our account&#039;s tapped out people.  Top us off.


And now for the voicemails:

Fans calling right after leaving our party suite.
Enormous from Australia, stuck in traffic, in Australia.  Does traffic swirl around the other way down under?
Enormous from Australia has a word for Spork.
Doug responds to TA (?) from Phoenix.
Scott from Tucson calls and tells us a whole lot of nothing.
Jason in Kansas City&#039;s call reminds me of a joke.  A guy is drinking alone at a bar, obviously sad.  The bartender asks him what&#039;s wrong.  &quot;I am a great architect,&quot; the man replies.  &quot;I have built two of the five largest suspension bridges in the world.  But, do they call me, &#039;Robert, the bridge builder&#039;?  No.  I have built the tallest apartment complexes that have housed hundreds of families.  But, do they call me, &#039;Robert, the home builder&#039;?  No.&quot;  The old man stops.  The bartender asks, &quot;Well, Robert, what do they call you?&quot;  The old man looks up at the bartender, tears in his eyes.  &quot;You suck one cock...&quot;
A caller from Phoenix, whose name I couldn&#039;t catch, wants to give us beer, and visit us.  Like we have a problem with that?
A caller loves the work of Josh Whedon, whoever the hell that is.
A caller rings us while beer and Killer Bunnies sit before him.  Dude, priorities.  Finish off the beer and game first, then call us.
Laura from Maryland recommends making Killer Bunny cards of the Wingin&#039; It crew from the blank cards available.
Jason of West Oz, shouts out to Andrea Smarty Hottie and Enormous.
Thomas from Flagstaff criticizes our lack of scifi shows in Farpoint Media.
Paul in Elk River backs our play here on Wingin&#039; It.
Evo wants you to fight the WIPO Broadcast Treaty.
Chris the Green Man from Florida set us up on 43 Places.
John in Seattle comments on product placement.
Rob from Knoxville has an idea that NO ONE has ever thought of.
Sasquatch in Iowa City wants to mail us some beer, but it&#039;s illegal to send alcohol through the mail.  Also some GYGO commentary that makes me put my fingers in my ears and say, &quot;Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala,&quot; really loud.
Shannon Hinners was the Ian transporter and home brew donator.
Murry from Australia A caller just saw PLANE!! and Clerks II.
Phil Rossi from VA breaks his long silence to bitch at us about some Snakes on the Plane homage?
Walter from LA can&#039;t not watch sports movies.  Shoot yourself, Walter.
Kevin from Sacramento Mounds is a fuckin&#039; genius.  Strip Killer Bunnies.
Wendy from London is happy we like our new posters.  Is it wrong to find her accent so damn hot when she&#039;s calling us pissheads?  Oh, and Mike, Resident Evil 2 is called Apocalypse.
Jason of West Oz wants a home brewing show on Speaking of Beer, Charlie&#039;s smart (and fun, and funny) beer podcast.
Doug from Pennsylvania has an NPR moment listening to Mur&#039;s most recent essay.
Andrea Smarty Hottie, stuck in traffic in LA, looking for movie stars.  Her show opens soon.
Andrea Smarty Hottie, drunk in LA.  The first night of her show.  She sold twelve pieces!!
Barry from Athens was at the Dragon*Con Wingin&#039; It.  Has some commentary on Mur&#039;s essay.
Nutrino from New Jersey is a sucker for Milla Jovovich and Summer Brooks.
Joel from California thinks Jay is no longer the master. (Do I really have to tell you it&#039;s NSFW?)  Long live Mur!
Scott from Tucson brings us a Wingin&#039; It/Nyquil hybrid.
Ray from Idaho wants us to toast his dearly departed father.
ditto, not stuck in traffic, at a bar, recommends Old Engine Oil from the Harviestoun Brewery Ltd.  At least, he would if he could pronounce it.


We go out on Phil&#039;s Snakes on the Plane thing.

George Hrab vs. Jonathan Coultan death match!
Sheila is just a little bit drunk, if you haven&#039;t noticed.
Thanks to our directors and moderators, Derek and Swoopy.

Mur reads to us the hands down, no lie, best fuckin&#039; essay EVAR!  Seriously, I&#039;m not even going to tell you the title, as I don&#039;t want to spoil anything for when you hear it.  God, I love this woman.
Chaz from DC congratulates Mur on her essay.
Derek from skepticality has a question for the guys.
An audience member wants a lesson on finding the clit, so Mur and George demonstrate with a jacket and a musician&#039;s bald head.  Not so funny in audio, but goddamn, to be there.

Another song by George Hrab: B3.  Check him out at the Podsafe Music Network.

Are you the one who ordered the official Michael and Evo Wingin&#039; It beer opener?
Rebeer.  God, I love Karen: Gulden Draak, and Monty Python&#039;s Holy Grail Ale - Tempered over burning witches.
He knows physics, and he knows literature.  Man, Charlie is a smart guy.  Have you checked out his smart (and fun, and funny) show Speaking of Beer?
Pluto is a planet!  A planet, goddammit!!  I don&#039;t care what those fuckers at the IAU say.
The Fanboy Smackdown Podcast was recently asked by Dani in NC &quot;What are you a Sucker For?&quot;  With permission, we discuss the same question here.  And, we have a voicemail show, people.  Chime in.
New drink time: Slow, Uncomfortable Screw Up Against a Movie Screen.
Comedians who do well in dramatic roles.

And now for the voicemails:

Scott from Tucson hasn&#039;t heard of hetero &quot;partners&quot; either.
Robert from New Hampshire singin&#039; the praises of the poetry slam contributors.
Gil from Milwaukee hung out with KfK and Mike at Comic-Con.
Enormous from Australia with his F-word contributions.
Enormous from Australia with another F-word contribution.
Enormous from Australia with something about blind drunk dogs.
Paul from Des Moines with his F-word contribution.  And the guys don&#039;t know the difference between Spicoli and Vinnie Barbarino.
Paul from Des Moines bitches about another weird sculpture, the Plantoir.
WTF!  Mennenga on the Signal!?!
What is Stargate: Atlantis good for?  Snakes on a Plane, man!
Chaz from DC, at Shore Leave, pissed drunk, gonna see the Green Fairy.  Interested in poisoning yourself?  Mike recommends going here.
A caller has some advice on TD0013 and his emotions.
Reaver in Madison is befuddled over Joe&#039;s refusing to accept the existance of the euphonium, to which Joe says, &quot;I&#039;ll believe in the euphonium when the Kansas school board believes in teaching science in science classes.&quot;
Reaver in Madison teaches Joe what a euphonium is.  Now, thanks to education, I believe in the euphonium.  See that Kansas, the power of education?  I&#039;m still a little skeptical of the conical bore, though.  That sounds like bullshit.
Anna from Washington loves the Ale-8-One.  With a little sumpn-sumpn extra.
Andrea from Chicago at home after a night of Sake bombers.
Bronson (?) from Australia has a nomination for the best villian actor of all time, and the next movie he should be in.
Reaver in Madison educates Mark in Memphis about the current state of roller derby.  Man, as much as this show must piss Reaver off, I&#039;m so glad she is still listening.
Gary from Wichita can&#039;t get the good beer.  Hear that, Kansas?  EDUCATION AND BEER!
Yeah, we know about the Dragon Plage thing.
Chaz from DC never got to do the fairy.
A caller tests Evo&#039;s drumming creds.
Rhetro has a metaphysical puzzle.
Enormous from Australia found Joe a little pissy on his last show.
More about absinthe on wikipedia.
Enormous, again, fighting with Lorrie about BSG.
Jack from Montana, willing to donate his frequent flyer miles to the guys.  All you other losers need to pony up!
Liam from Springfield, MO need some Stone substitutes.
Alex from Ohio overhauled our Wingin&#039; It Wikipedia page.
Imp is going to be at the Portable Media Expo!
Imp&#039;s little sister is going to be at the expo!  Jesus, I need to go to more cons.


They say there&#039;s not going to be a &quot;real&quot; show this week.  They&#039;re wrong!  Mwahahahahaha!

		<itunes:summary>This week on Michael and Evo&#039;s Wingin&#039; It, the fans have taken over the asylum, as The Ranting Scotsman, Ian, heads up a crazy crew along with Karen from Kalifornia, Brad from Podculture, and Chris from Two Girls and a Podcast.

The slightly silent studio audience is Christina from Podculture.


First Drink of the Day: Everyone is drinking differently so god knows.

The group talk about their podcasts and segments which they are known for in the Wingin&#039; It World.
Doodle of the Fates: Alvie vs. Evo in a parody of Jack Mangan&#039;s well known segments.
Doodle Reaction: The guys talk about possibly one of the funniest segments in Wingin&#039; It history. Jack is going to be so pissed.
Ian brags on about the Stargate Atlantis Season 3 Premiere whilst Karen and Chris talk about Kyle XY.
Drink Mixology: With Andrew from R&amp;D still missing in his cave, Chris and Eliz from Two Girls and a Podcast take over and invent some new drink.
Rebeer: This week comes from Karen and god knows we still don&#039;t know what each other is drinking, listen carefully and you might be able to tell through all the rambling.
The gang talk about Dragon*Con and Comic-Con. A clash between Wingin&#039; It, Podculture, and The Ranting Scotsman is expected sometime during Dragon*Con. Whilst Karen will need to try and subdue Mike at Comic-Con, god help both of them.
Sci-Fi Poetry Slam: Isabella.
Dumb-Ass-News: The gang prove that Wingin&#039; It listeners aren&#039;t the most brain dead people in the world with a selection of whacky stories from all over the world.
Haiku for You: Another great segment from Karen with a little teaser of a question with haikus on our beloved other presenters!
The guys wrap up the show by thanking everyone in the IRC every week.
Ian comments on the crazy ass goings on in the forums.
The guys make a call out to break Jack Mangan&#039;s Deadpan comment record of some 1200.

Only two episodes away: Episode 69.  Huh-huh.

Jack and Chris have seen Pirates of the Carribean 2: Dead Man&#039;s Chest.  Jack gives it a thumbs up.

First Drink of the Day: Magnum&#039;s got a lot of new shit in.  Grotten Brown Cave-aged Ale (aka Grottenbier Bruin) from Pierre Celis&#039; signature selection.  Joe&#039;s having an Ale-8-One sent to us by James Wright.


And now for the voicemails:

Somebody from some podcast has been to Origins, has Killer Bunnies for Evo, and doesn&#039;t know who The Kick-Ass Mystic Ninjas are.

Sean Connery wants to kick Tee&#039;s ass, and Ian talks big about kicking Jack&#039;s ass, now that he knows Jack isn&#039;t coming to Dragon*Con, so he knows he can talk all he wants and he&#039;ll never have to suffer the humiliation of getting his clock cleaned by a guy in a Charlie Brown shirt who weighs a buck forty soaking wet.

Karen from Kalifornia leaves the best message for Lorrie.
Scott from Tucson with his own drink suggestion.
The Darby Beer Festival has some Wingin&#039; In appropriate names.
Ed from Texas reveals a sad truth.  The Mennengasia post in Wikipedia is gone.  The posts for Farpoint Media, Wingin&#039; It, and GeekFu Action Grip could use some help, or they may disappear as well.  Oh, and the Joe Murphy who plays that fake game, hockey, is not me, though my name is linked to that post.  I so need a new fucking name.

Our in studio guest today: Chris from Tempe brought cheesecake, and Steve the Guitar expands his beer horizons.

Hellziggy sent us some Gray&#039;s Oatmeal Stout and an IPA, Jack and Doug down the Coopers Vintage Ale, Steve is also trying the Sparkling Ale.  Chris tries the Coopers Dark Ale, &#039;cause apparently she needs some hair on her chest.


And now the voicemails:

Reaver from Madison loving the show and google searches.

Paul from Des Moines bemoans the Chicago Bean Sculpture.  And that is how the show ends.

Jack brags about the size of his comment cache.
A voicemail, on this show?  A caller presents some help for when Evo&#039;s not around.
Jack didn&#039;t care for the new Superman movie.  Wait, these guys already saw the new Superman movie?  What the fuck!?!  WHAT THE FUCK!?!  Any particular reason I wasn&#039;t informed about this?  I&#039;m a fucking email away!  I mean, Jesus Christ on a crutch, people.  Why do you think I do this thankless job?  This podcasting sidekick gig hasn&#039;t gotten me any poonani (well, except that one time), the least you can fucking do is tell me about the freaking sneak previews, okay?
A Scanner Darkly is coming out July 7th.  Guess who&#039;s starring in it.
Jack has been watching the old school BBC The Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy.  Netflix people, Netflix.
Charlie didn&#039;t so much like the recent movie, though.
Mike is putting out the call.  Movies, TV shows, Books, etc. to choose a mate by.  Email and voicemail your suggestions.
A sex(y) researcher studying Mennengasia?  What the hell, I&#039;ll buy it, &#039;cause she found a great cure for the disease.
Rebeer: Gulden Draak from the brouwerij Van Steenberge.  That&#039;s Belgian for &quot;packs a wallop.&quot;
Scifi Poetry Slam: Wow.  Dani just raised the bar.  Ok, all you would-be poets, take some notes and send us your stuff!
Some Duel of the Fates cock-teasing.  And some brilliant Farpoint Media pimping.
A Haiku Moment: I Love Wolverine.
Ok, I like happy drunks.  Really happy drunks.  If you have a podcast, it gets mentioned somewhere around this point.
Ok, call in with your favorite &quot;fuck&quot; sayings.  &quot;Fuck a duck&quot; already taken.
Ewww.  I sleep on that bed!
I really need to consider cutting my vacation short and reigning these guys in.  I&#039;m just saying.
