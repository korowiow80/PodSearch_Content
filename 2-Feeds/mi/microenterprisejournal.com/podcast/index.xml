<title>MNB 02/05/07: Micros on the International Stage</title>
<description>As I mentioned earlier, I spent most of last week in Spain (or en route to Spain), where I delivered the keynote address to the eighth annual Escala Mikros Congress in Bilbao. The conference is all about microbusinesses - their...</description>

<title>Jet lag reigns supreme</title>
<description>Greetings! Having returned from my trip abroad over the weekend (of which you&apos;ll hear more later), I&apos;m just a little behind here. So, I deeply regret that the MNB Podcast will be a tad late this week. I do expect...</description>

<title>MNB 01/29/07: Bush Floats an Almost-Good Health Care Plan</title>
<description>Well, President Bush got to make a bit of history with the first-ever State of the Union speech that began with the words Madam Speaker -- a fact that he graciously pointed out as soon as he took the podium...</description>

<title>MNB 01/22/07: Lawmakers Spat Over Small Business Tax Cuts</title>
<description>I suppose it&apos;s possible that there&apos;s just something in the air that makes people serving in Congress slowly lose their minds, but I doubt it. And maybe the fault could lie in House Democrats trying to score rhetorical brownie points...</description>

<title>MNB 01/15/07: Velazquez Starts Out With A Steady Hand</title>
<description>A lot of people seemed to think that the Democrats would surge into Washington at the start of the 110th Congress, frothing at the mouth and starting fights with President Bush just because they&apos;re Democrats and he&apos;s ... well ......</description>

<title>MNB 12/18/06: Credit Card Use by Micros Was Up in 2005</title>
<description>Since Congress is in recess and pretty much all is quiet on the policy front, this seems like a good week to check out some new research. We cover two Advocacy reports this week, one with more information on microbusiness financing and one on small business contributions to urban economic development.</description>

<title>MNB 12/11/06: Small Business Tortoises Beat Hares</title>
<description>About the only thing to say about the research released by Advocacy that is the subject of this week&apos;s lead article is, &quot;Wow!&quot; These findings are a major big deal for micros. Plus final moves on both the House and Senate sides of the Small Business Committees just before final adjournment of the 109th Congress. R.I.P.</description>

<description>It&apos;s mostly about money this week, with our lead story on the release (finally!) of the latest Federal Reserve Board Survey of Small Business Finances. There&apos;s also a relevant piece this week about microenterprise development, and microfinance, in the U.S.</description>

<title>MNB 11/06/06: FTC Welcomes The Micro Perspective</title>
<description>A couple of months ago, I was complaining in The MicroEnterprise Journal about the FTC&apos;s &apos;Protecting Consumers in the Next Tech-ade&apos; hearings because the voice of microbusinesses was likely to be absent from the proceedings. Well, now, I&apos;ve been invited to participate.</description>

<title>MNB 10/30/06: Small Business Policy in a Democratic House</title>
<description>What would this midterm season be without a bit of a preview of what will become of the House Small Business Committee under Nydia Velazquez? Especially since current Chairman Don Manzullo brought the subject up by distributing a press release last week that was scarifying enough to be a worthy segue into Halloween week? </description>

<title>MNB Podcast Special: An Interview with Senator Blanche Lincoln</title>
<description>We&apos;re launching a new project here at The MicroEnterprise Journal, to conduct interviews with members of the Senate who are also members of Generation Jones: born between 1954 and 1965 and mistakenly called Boomers for most of our lives. We begin with Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, on the issue of rural development.</description>
