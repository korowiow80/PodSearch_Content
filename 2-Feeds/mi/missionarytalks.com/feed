He seeks to connect missionaries and church people through the wonders of technology. Much of his ministry is helping to facilitate communications between the two groups.</p>
<p>Join Josiah and me as we talk about how he works out his goals and how God led him to where he is in ministry today. Bro. Josiah also shares a couple of stories illustrating the power of technology to change people&#8217;s lives. One of the things he mentions is programs which teach discipleship lessons through cell phones. This is like the project missionary Brad Rhoads mentioned in his first interview on <a title="Brad Rhoads" href="http://www.missionarytalks.com/2008/02/04/missionary-talks-43-brad-rhoads/" target="_blank">Missionary Talks episode 43</a>.</p>
<p>Bro. Ritchie has a website where you can <a title="Josiah Ritchie" href="http://missions.ritchietribe.net/" target="_blank">learn more about him and his ministry</a>. You can also <a title="Josiah on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/tech4fim" target="_blank">follow his ministry on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Mike Pettengill works in Honduras in a church planting ministry. Unlike many missionaries he works in a team with other missionary couples and individuals. In this episode of Missionary Talks Mike talks about some of the blessings and struggles of having a team on the field. Each team member brings his or her own abilities and skills so that the team can accomplish much more than each person individually.</p>
<p>Another thing that Bro. Pettengill shares with the listeners is his experience of going to language school and taking his kids to the mission field at an older age than most missionaries. He and his wife worked in professional fields before being called to Honduras. We also talk a little about recreation and staying healthy on the field.</p>
<p>You can visit the website that talks about <a title="Serving in Honduras" href="http://servinginhonduras.com/Serving_in_Honduras/Home.html" target="_blank">the team of missionaries</a> Mike works with. <a title="Pettengill Family" href="http://www.pettengillmissionaries.org/" target="_blank">The Pettengill family</a> also have their own personal website so that you can learn more about Mike and his family.

After the destructive earthquake there was a tsunami that destroyed lives and cities in the northern part of the country. Fortunately for Katie she lives in a mountain city far from the coast, but she is affected spiritually and emotionally for the people of Japan with whom she works.</p>
<p>Katie shares with the listeners how they can specifically pray for the people of Japan and the rescue and relief efforts that are taking place. She also mentioned a couple of agencies that she recommends that could use contributions.</p>
<p><a title="CRASH Japan" href="http://crashjapan.com/" target="_blank">CRASH Japan</a> is a relief organization that Katie and other missionaries are working with to physically help the people of Japan while sharing the love of Christ in word and deed. By visiting <a title="Donate to CRASH" href="http://crashjapan.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=15&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">the donation page at the CRASH website</a> you can see various options for properly donating to the needs in Japan.</p>
<p>She also mentioned that the church she works with in Japan is putting together care packages and helping to prepare housing and shelters for refugees. Those donations can be sent through <a title="Central Missionary Clearinghouse" href="http://cmc.missions.net/" target="_blank">Central Missionary Clearinghouse</a>. Checks need to say &#8220;Japanese Emergency Fund&#8221; on them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bro. George Zarris is a missionary working to help pastors and other missionaries share the Gospel by means of mass media and broadcasting.

<p>In some cases this ministry has him talking with people inside government agencies trying to work through the legal paperwork to get a station on the air. At other times he is raising funds and physically constructing radio stations in foreign countries.</p>
<p>Bro. George was a pastor for many years and was led into radio ministry by seeing how effective radio and TV can be in spreading any message. God led him to resign the church he started so that he could begin bringing people to the Lord through the power of radio. During the first years he learned the programing side of radio and has been using that information to help other Christian radio stations be more effective in their ministry.</p>

They were intrigued by <a title="First interview with Brad Rhoads" href="http://www.missionarytalks.com/2008/02/04/missionary-talks-43-brad-rhoads/">the original interview</a> because God had used Brad to show them that not all missionaries were church planters and that they could use their skills on the mission field.

<p>Tony will be working with Bro. Brad Rhoads in <a title="MAF Learning Technology" href="http://maflt.org/">MAF&#8217;s Learning Technologies</a>. As an educator he will help the men who are learning from the Bible training tools that are created by Learning Technologies to know how best to use these tools. He will also be working with the curriculum creators to help them to understand what is needed in the field to help the students learn well.</p>
<p>Laura will work as an Orality Specialist. She will help train missionaries and nationals on how to teach the Bible in oral societies. These could be either non-literate people groups or people whose culture is more of an oral one&#8212;relying on verbal stories as opposed to written word to transmit information. She will be using the <a title="God Story" href="http://www.gods-story.org/">God Story&#8217;s</a> program called <a title="Simply the Story" href="http://www.gods-story.org/sts/">Simply the Story</a> as the basis for what she will be teaching.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bro. Jim Belisle is a missionary evangelist. He travels to different fields helping missionaries conduct evangelistic crusades as well as teaches in Bible Institutes around the world. Bro. Jim shares with us some of the different ways he helps missionaries. He also encourages listeners to do their part is assisting missionaries in two specific ways. First he encourages the listeners to pray for their missionaries. The second thing he encourages friends and supporters back home to do is realize that missionaries have taken a financial cut recently because the US dollar is not as strong now as it had been. Without losing any support missionaries are taking a financial cut because of the weakened dollar. Continue to support and consider raising your financial commitment to your missionaries.</p>
<p>Please take time to <a title="Jim Belisle Missionary Evangelist" href="http://jbelisleme.com/">visit Bro. Jim&#8217;s website</a> and pray for him and his family as he travels.</p>

Bro. Jeff has been used by the Lord to start a church that has already started another church and is looking to begin two more in the coming year.</p>
<p>Enjoy the conversation as Bro. Bush talks about how the Lord led him to the field and some of the details of his preparation for the ministry he is doing today. He also shares information about language school that many missionaries will need to attend as they prepare for ministry on a foreign field.</p>
<p>If you are considering missionary work, or just want to know more about life as a missionary, be sure to <a title="Jeff Bush: Reaching All" href="http://www.reachingall.com">visit Bro. Jeff&#8217;s website</a>. Along with having his prayer letters and ministry information, he has good resources to help a missionary on deputation and to avoid some common mistakes of the ministry.</p>
<p>He also has a <a title="Macedonia Argentina" href="http://macedoniaargentina.com/">website for his ministry in Argentina</a> that is written in Spanish.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I talked with LaMoin Cunningham about culture shock. In this first part of the conversation we define how culture shock can effect a missionary and how friends back home can communicate with missionaries to help them through their time of culture shock, or culture fatigue.</p>
<p>I <a title="Missionary Talks 74: Bill and LaMoin Cunningham" href="http://www.missionarytalks.com/2010/04/06/missionary-talks-74-bill-and-lamoin-cunningham/">interviewed LaMoin and her husband</a> in a previous episode of Missionary Talks.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to talk with LaMoin about this is she gave a lecture to missionaries last year that I was privileged to hear. In it she talked about many of the same things we cover in this conversation. Her focus then was on the missionary and what he could do to help overcome culture shock. In this conversation we tried to focus on the friends back home and explain to them how they can be a help to the missionary on the field.</p>
<p>You can get <a title="Life with LaMoin" href="http://www.lifewithlamoin.com/">more information about LaMoin at her website</a>.</p>
<p>Please be back next week for the conclusion of the interview.</p>

<p>LaMoin has written a wonderful book that will help the reader understand that missionaries are normal people. While the outside struggles may be different on the field from what it is back home, the internal struggle, and fleshly battles are the same no matter what country you are in.

He was not in Chile when the earthquake hit last week, but has contacted many of his friends and co-workers to find out what relief efforts are taking place around the church members.</p>
<p>Here are some missionaries that Phil and I know who are doing relief work in the effected areas. Feel free to contact them and see how you can help. Let me encourage you to contact any missionary that your church supports in Chile and see what more you can do to help those you are already supporting.</p>

<p>To send money through Missionary Phil Rogers to help the local pastors with rebuilding and relief, you can send a check to Liberty Baptist Church at the following address and write &#8220;Chile Earthquake&#8221; in the memo field.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Missionary Chats episode is to help you see that you can be a real help in times of crisis. Even though the news may no longer be obsessing over the crisis in a far off land, remember that the missionaries are still there giving help and comfort as they share the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-122" title="Snode Family" src="http://www.missionarytalks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/snodefamilyphoto.png" alt="" width="275" height="259" align="right" />Join me as I talk with Travis Snode, Missionary to Northern Ireland. Travis and his wife have been in Northern Ireland for 5 years as church planting missionaries. Like many missionaries, he is pastoring two churches; one he started and another one started by a fellow missionary. He shares with us the need for men to pastor one of the many churches in the United Kingdom that are without any kind of shepherd.</p>
<p>Bro. Snode also talked about how he was called to missions as a young boy. Outside of building a good personal relationship with God and His word, he said that he was encouraged by his parents and an older man in church to continue to pursue the ministry that God had called him to. Travis is a good example of what God can do with a child or teen that you may know who is called to be a missionary if you will just take a few minutes to encourage them to follow God&#8217;s leading.</p>

One of the questions that came up in our discussion is, &quot;How do you, the one praying for the missionary, want to be kept up to date?&quot; Please send me an email, or post a comment with your response.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not a traditional feedback episode in that I am not sharing news from you for other listeners. However, I am asking for some feedback on some possible additions at <a href="http://www.missionarytalks.com/" title="Missionary Talks">Missionary Talks</a>.</p>
<p>I am proposing a new show format that would be in addition to the interviews. This new format will be called Missionary Chats. The format will have me talking with a co-host. The co-host will not always be the same person. This will be a less edited conversation focusing on some particular topic.</p>
<p>I am looking for feedback on Missionary Chats in the following areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you like to be able to ask questions to previously interviewed missionaries?</li>
<li>The Missionary Talks will stay in the current format. The Chats will be in addition to, not in replacement of the Talks. Would you be interested in only one or the other? Or, would you prefer to get all the Talks and Chats in the same &#8220;feed&#8221; like you are currently getting the Missionary Talks and the Listener Feedback episodes?</li>
<li>Can you give suggestions for intro/outro music for the Chats?</li>
<li>The Chats will allow more interaction for you. Would you be interested in being able to leave a voice mail that could be played, or just be able to email questions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically I asked you to email me or go to one of the discussion threads on Facebook concerning this topic. Alternatively, you are welcome to leave a comment on this episode posting.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/topic.php?uid=57619849699&amp;topic=13974&amp;ref=nf" title="Facebook Group: Missionary Talks discussion">Facebook Group discussion</a> is where I originally asked the questions. I have also set up a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Missionary-Talks/249219809097?ref=ts" title="Facebook Page: Missionary Talks">Facebook Page</a> that I plan to migrate more personal interaction to.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Coleman is a pastor who thinks of his ministry as missionary work. He pastors the Deaf in Schaumburg, IL near Chicago. Pastor Coleman shares with the listeners how the Lord led him through various stages of ministry starting when he was a teenager, through college and now in 20 years of ministry with the Deaf. He urges the listener to allow God to lead in each step of their life; not to step ahead of God&#8217;s leading. Bro. Mark also tells why ministry with the Deaf, even in the United States, should be considered missionary work.</p>

His main ministry is teaching weekly &#8220;release time&#8221; classes for children in public elementary schools in Pennsylvania. He also has several week-long camps during the summer months. He is able to work with the elementary children in a two county area in all but three of the public schools. It is refreshing to talk with someone who has a passion for sharing the Gospel with the most open and receptive people group in America.</p>
<p>I first met Bob several years ago through a mutual pastor friend. Since then Bob has asked me to speak in a couple of his summer camps. It was a blessing to be with him again this summer and to share this interview with you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You will find Bro. Lonnie Blount to be very personable in this interview. As a missionary on deputation, but returning to the field, he shares with us some of the things he is looking forward to seeing and doing when he returns to Ethiopia. He and his family came home from the field due to medical needs. They were not sure that they would get to go back, but they are excited about the fact that they are now on their way to Ethiopia once again.</p>
<p>One of the things he shares with us is a change in motivation behind deputation this time around. The thought that drives him through deputation is that, as Revelation says, Jesus Christ is worthy to recieve the praise from every nation. He wants to be a part of bringing people from the nations to Christ, because Christ is worthy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the privilege to talk with missionary Jim Menkhoff and let him share about his current ministry of assembling and shipping Bibles to missionaries as well as his former ministry as a missionary in Zambia. Jim talks about how just a few dollars each month put into a Bible printing and shipping ministry like <a href="http://www.bpsmilford.org/" title="Bearing Precious Seed Milford">Bearing Precious Seed</a> can be used to share the Gospel. He also talks about starting churches in Zambia. He gives a testimony of a man that he was privileged to lead to the Lord and culminates in the story of how the man was baptized in a pool of water filled with leeches.</p>
<p>Bro. Jim closes with encouraging young people towards missions. He admits that mission work is not easy, but with the Lord&#8217;s help a person could carry out the Lord&#8217;s work. He also talks about the need to reach whole groups and countries of people who are currently not being reached by any missionary.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.bpsfremont.org/" title="Bearing Precious Seed Fremont">read more about Bro. Menkhoff at his website</a>. He has a link there where you can contact him if you would like more information about his ministry.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for your patience. I am glad to get this episode out and should be able to get another interview on the site within a few days. We have been doing a lot of traveling lately which has kept us busy in a good way. There are downsides to that as well.</p>
<p>In this episode I explain some of the reasons for the delays and what you can expect from Missionary Talks in the near future. I also spend time thanking you, the listener, for putting value to the content at Missionary Talks. I am not here to make money off the podcast, but one of the listeners has recently sent a generous gift. While I appreciate the money and it will go to fulfill a need, it helped me understand that Missionary Talks is being used to minister to people. While most of the listeners never write to tell me how Missionary Talks has been a blessing, I am thankful to God for allowing me to see in a real way that people put value to the content that I am trying to provide.</p>
<p>At then end of the recording I also share a story from one of the future guests at Missionary Talks.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Thank you for your patience. I am glad to get this episode out and should be able to get another interview on the site within a few days. We have been doing a lot of traveling lately which has kept us busy in a good way. There are downsides to that as well.

In this episode I explain some of the reasons for the delays and what you can expect from Missionary Talks in the near future. I also spend time thanking you, the listener, for putting value to the content at Missionary Talks. I am not here to make money off the podcast, but one of the listeners has recently sent a generous gift. While I appreciate the money and it will go to fulfill a need, it helped me understand that Missionary Talks is being used to minister to people. While most of the listeners never write to tell me how Missionary Talks has been a blessing, I am thankful to God for allowing me to see in a real way that people put value to the content that I am trying to provide.

At then end of the recording I also share a story from one of the future guests at Missionary Talks.

Enjoy!</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nathan is a third generation missionary kid (MK) who grew up in Nigeria where his mother and grandfather were also raised. Nathan shares with the listeners about the ministry in Nigeria as well as his thoughts about growing up on the field. He shares some great insight for other MKs about taking advantage of the opportunities they are given on the field as well as some thoughts on returning to their home country.</p>
<p>One question I posed to Nathan was what he thought was needed, as far as types of missionaries, on the field. I was surprised by his answer. Instead of specifically mentioning types of work that needed to be accomplished by missionaries, he talked about the personality and attitude that is needed in missionaries.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bethany Thompson is a missionary whom I met when I was still in college. We both worked in the deaf ministry at the church that we attended. She was very involved and was always focused on the goal of serving the Lord on the mission field. It was an honor to be able to speak with her for this interview.</p>
<p>In this episode Bethany shares with the listeners her desires as an educator and deaf worker. She encourages the listeners to spend as much time as possible learning about the field to which you will be ministering. Bethany also emphasizes the need of missionaries to continue their language studies if they are ministering in a new language. She does not do this in a way to discourage those who are struggling with language, but tries to be an encouragement that it is a life-time process to learn a foreign language.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode I give an update about <a href="http://www.dpeach.com" title="Peach family ministry">our ministry</a>. What has been happening in the last couple of months and where we are going as a family and as a podcast. I know things have slowed down on your end with receiving Missionary Talks, but I assure you that on my end things are just getting exciting.</p>
<p>I have been waiting a long time for this to come. We are going back to the US for a year and I will be meeting new missionaries every week! I don&#8217;t know if that means that there will be a new episode posted weekly, but I will be grabbing recordings everywhere I get a chance. I really am looking forward to our time on furlough to be with our supporting churches and to be able to get new interviews.</p>
<p>I do have another interview currently recorded. I just have not had the time to do the necessary editing. With the move back to the US and having just finished another week of camp, my computer time has been somewhat limited. But that is the beauty of recording. I will be able to get this interview to you when it is ready.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect new interviews to be coming left and right immediately, but I would think by the time October gets here I will be able to give more content on a regular basis. Thanks for hanging in with me through this time.</p>

<p>We discussed the different reasons why a missionary would take a longer or shorter time for furlough.</p>

My family and I are about to leave the field for a year to take a furlough.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode I talked with Bob Patterson who recently took a mission trip to Uganda. This was a short term trip in which Bob helped with a medical team. Though Bob is not a long term missionary today, he grew up on the mission field in Mexico.</p>
<p>Because he sees missions from both sides, he really has a great perspective on what the average person in the church can do to help their missionaries. He knows how to connect the person on the field to the person in the pew.</p>
<p>His recent trip was with <a href="http://www.operationrenewedhope.org/" title="Operation Renewed Hope">Operation Renewed Hope</a>. This is a short term group that is based out of his church.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an interview I did while returning home from a medical mission trip. It is a discussion that I had with Larry and Phillip Allred along with Armando Yam. We were in a van going down the highway, so there is a bit of road noise, but not enough to be a real distraction.</p>
<p>In this episode we talk about the trip that we are returning home from. It was a trip put on by <a href="http://www.cmda.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Global_Health_Outreach&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=14459" title="Global Health Outreach">Global Health Outreach (GHO)</a>, the missionary arm of <a href="http://www.cmda.org" title="Christian Medical and Dental Association">Christian Medical and Dental Association (CMDA)</a>. Larry, Phillip and I went to be interpreters for the group of doctors and dentists. Armando was part of the group who shared the Gospel with the people we were ministering to.</p>
<p>Armando mentions the testimony of a lady named Candi who accepted the Lord. She is the government representative who worked with us all week. She was convinced that she was good enough to earn her salvation. After we were all done and packed up on the final day of the trip Armando was privileged to lead her to the Lord.</p>

In this episode we talk about the trip that we are returning home from. It was a trip put on by Global Health Outreach (GHO), the missionary arm of Christian Medical and Dental Association (CMDA).

<p>One project that I asked listeners to help me with is suggesting historical missionaries to write a biographical sketch about, like I did with <a href="http://www.missionarytalks.com/2007/05/20/missionary-talks-25-david-livingstone-part-1/" title="David Livingstone">David Livingstone</a> and <a href="http://www.missionarytalks.com/2007/12/21/missionary-talks-41-william-carey-part-1/" title="William Carey">William Carey</a>. This time I am asking listeners to give a suggestion as to who I should study. Those take quite a bit of time to research and write, but I look forward to reading who listeners want to know more about.</p>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:david@missionarytalks.com" title="Write me!">write me</a> with suggestions or comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bob Taylor is the director of <a href="http://www.gfbm.com/" title="Go Forth Baptist Missions">Go Forth Baptist Missions</a>. I talked with Bro. Taylor specifically about different needs that he knows of on the foreign field. We also talked about how people with specialty training can be used on the field. He mentions that missions has always been, and will always be, about planting churches, but even if you are not called to be a pastor, there are many other areas you can be used on the field.</p>
<p>If you have questions about Go Forth specifically, or just about being a missionary, I feel confident that Bro. Taylor would love to point you the right direction. Go Forth is very selective about who they take on as missionary candidates, but Bro. Taylor sees much of his purpose in ministry with Go Forth is to talk with potential missionaries to help them prepare themselves for God&#8217;s service. <a href="http://www.gfbm.com/" title="Go Forth Baptist Missions">Visit their website</a> to get more information and don&#8217;t hesitate to call him if he can be a help to you. Their office number is 850-471-0990. All of their <a href="http://gfbm.com/Contact_us.htm" title="Go Forth Baptist Missions: Contact">contact information</a> is available at their site.</p>
