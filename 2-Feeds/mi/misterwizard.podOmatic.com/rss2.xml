But first....

Listener e-mail:

Open relationships do not have to be about &quot;desperate times&quot; as you described it. Nor are they a sign somebody can't commit to a single relationship.

For the poly/open people I know, they just don't put the limits on love that monogamists do. Polyamory, for instance, is based on the principle that you can love more than one person at a time. 

Even in monogamous relationships this is true if you look at it closely. When a couple has a baby, they are adding a new person to their relationship. Obviously, there is no sexual connection to that relationship, but there is most certainly committed love. 

Do parents love each other any less once a baby has arrived? No, often times it builds an even stronger bond between them. When they have a second child, do they love the first child any less? No. Are they any less committed to the happiness and well being of the first child? Again, no.

So the difference between Monogamy and Polyamory is only about sex, not love or commitment. More to the point, it's about you controlling what sex your significant other can have.

Personally, I am happy about anything that brings pleasure to my girlfriend. I don't feel the need to control her. 

A real relationship is built on a lot more than sex.

-Slacker

From there we talk about the oddities of sex with people who text during sex, attractiveness and date-ability. Why women are insecure, men cynical, and what makes a person date-able? Dani's miracle cure in meeting the parents! GAH! Women who are cryptic, and aren't straight forward.

We start the show off with some competition through jealousy, where any guy that's in the picture of the lady you're fond of, friend or more, can mean a competitor in the eyes of us men. We also talk about how our crush and our likes and our loves sometimes molds the things we're into in life. We then tag the dilemma of listening to people outside of the relationships and even the thought of an open relationship. Could that work for you?

Bringing back the Geek Love Tip of the week with places online and off where you can find your potential date. It's all that and more in this week's Geek Love Radio.

Dani the Universe, and myself Francis Fernandez take on the world of love, sex, and relationships from a geek's perspective. What does that entail this week on this off scheduled GLR? We talk a little Avengers in the beginning, how can you not, but then...we want to know...How to flirt with someone when you don't know if they're taken? Leading men on, the female dilemma on taking men's gifts. Noticeable differences after post coital interactions. &quot;Women who worship the cock worship the body.&quot; Women like men who look the same. Men like women of all shapes and sizes.

You'l find this episode has a bit more movie talk than normal, with scenes from romantic films as well as what can be considered good love stories on film. We also touch on how the hair can make the man, obsessive men and their need to be loved. Or maybe the man who will love a girl no matter what kind of hell she puts him through. And we also get on about some awesome, new, and specific dating websites. All that and more on this week's Geek Love Radio.

But first, we give homage to Andy Garcia, our favorite impression, as it was his birthday last week, but that's beside the point. From young love to first loves, we talk about what was, and what was funny about it. Then it's onto love for live versus love at the moment, to parents trying to help us look for love.

An incredibly fun episode with our resident Batman and Robin and yes, some singing from myself and Dave. It's not pretty, but it's great fun on this week's Geek Love Radio.

      <title>Geek Love Radio BONUS! Ep. 87</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1306361/600x600_3961038.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge shout out and thank you to Thomas Johnson for donating to the show. Your contribution is awesome and this show goes out to you.

This week it's Dean Hanson and me talking the geek love with an all discussion show from online dating and the older generation to misinterpreting a woman's actions. Long distance love dilemmas and the reason why we actually love people. It's all that and so much more on this week's bonus episode of GLR.

This week we discuss all manner of relationship topics from pets as a pick up tool, men and women as friends, the double standard, and so much more.

Take part in our discussion with an e-mail, or a message on Twitter or our Facebook page. You can also leave us a voicemail if you want your opinion to be heard. And as always, fun times here at GLR as we keep mixing it up every week with something a little different. Hope you all are liking it.

First off we have Dean back on the show guest hosting with us. We also have a ton to discuss, from Dave's continued pursuits in making new friends, to people who come on too strong to how sometimes we meet a person and we make that eye contact and...it's all over.

Apparently gaming or spending time away from your significant other is a bad idea. Unless you share the same hobbies.

Life is full of regrets sometimes, and we can either pretend they don't exist, or learn from them. This one though, is apparently the biggest regret of all.

She'll be back for more in later installments and we look forward to having her. We also continue to discuss Dave's experiences in being going out and being social. His attempt to make a new female friend didn't quite work out as planned, but there's Lei's new challenge for him. To make two female friends, which is just cruel, but fun.

We also discuss tips for Valentine's, where we reiterate what one should do during this moment of love. Alas, we here at GLR are a little more cynical, but we do our best to give something for you all to work with. For more gift ideas, please visit SincereSarcasm.net as we kind of move on to all sorts of different articles this week.

http://www.trcbnews.com/truth-is-stranger-than-fiction/111739/ (I don't know how real this is, but if it is, it's crazy)

Japan wins another wiener related competition.

Our Geek Love Tip of the Week, how to make friends and get rid of annoying people. It's not easy, but we all have to build up to it sometime.

We also have a listener voicemail in response to last episode's listener e-mail. It's like this weird conversation we're all having, but no one know's who's who.

Then we wrap up our show with a few articles from the internet, the first one is about a woman who sues a cop over asking her out on a date after giving her a ticket. Creepy or romantic?

http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/45860217/ns/today-today_people/#.TxpDuyMVzL8

Is it better to be right or just have a relationship?

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stronger-the-broken-places/201201/when-being-wrong-is-right-0

Finally, there is power of good intentions. Yes, good triumphs over uhh, things.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120118165137.htm

There is of course all that and much more on this week's episode of Geek Love Radio.

Then we wrap up our show with a few articles from the internet, the first one is about a woman who sues a cop over asking her out on a date after giving her a ticket. Creepy or romantic?

Is it better to be right or just have a relationship?

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stronger-the-broken-places/201201/when-being-wrong-is-right-0

Finally, there is power of good intentions. Yes, good triumphs over uhh, things.

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120118165137.htm

There is of course all that and much more on this week's episode of Geek Love Radio.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1306361/600x600_3961038.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year everyone! We start off a brand new Geek Love Radio with listener e-mail and a shout out to the All Games Considered podcast, the place to go for all things Table Top RPGs and more, &quot;Because There's More Than One True Way To Play&quot;. Check it out here: http://www.agcpodcast.info/

This week we also have a guest amongst us. Dean Hanson, a friend of mine from the old Scott Pilgrim days. Which was really, just last year. He's a writer, a movie buff, and he gives some good insight on geek love. You can find him on Twitter @djhanson87 and you can check out his blog http://justdean.tumblr.com/

Discussion and Geek Love Tip of the Week deals with Dave the Drummer and his new project. He's going to try to get out more, and possibly make new friends. With a bit of a push from me, I give him his first task.

Article 1: For our first article of the new year we cover what men love about women:
http://glo.msn.com/relationships/unexpected-things-men-love-about-women-7315.gallery

Then we go the opposite way and well, apparently, a marriage isn't all that great after all and can be damaging to your mental health:
http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/intelligent-lust/201201/the-case-against-marriage

Finally, we don't really get to this, but go ahead and check it out on your own. Scammers take advantage of those looking for romance. Horrible, but happens all the time:

As if you weren't tired of Reality TV, a new one based on Geek Speed Dating gives Dave and I some fodder for the &quot;stereotypical&quot; geek.

As you know we love those studies, and it comes with an infographic you can find here: www.gamehouse.com/blog/women-who-game/

And with the holiday of gift giving just around the corner, we give our two favorite sites for all things geek gifts. My go to site is ThinkGeek.com, and now, I have a new suggestion, thanks to a listener who suggests ShanaLogic.com. Both great places to find your guy or lady, that special gift.

We wrap up the show with the Geek Love Tip of the week with places you can take your special date to for the holidays. Of course, we can't all be couples during the holidays, so on the next episode, expect some advice and suggestions for the single people out there. Thanks again, everyone for listening.

Please don't forget to check us out on iTunes and rate the show, and also check out the blog at SincereSarcasm.net. And finally, spread the word and share this podcast with other people. Also write in today with your suggestions on what you like and don't like about the show, because to use, listener feedback is important. E-mail us at theglshow@gmail.com or call us and leave a voicemail on the number below. See you all in a two weeks.

Dave is interested in a MILF and talk about cougars. Also how gender roles seem to be reversing as it seems more okay for the guy to have a more submissive role while the women are more dominant.

We then talk about how to try to survive the holidays being single and suggestions on what to do if you're a single nerd. LAN parties anybody? Sometimes just doing something fun or getting together with friends isn't  a bad way to spend the holidays.

      <title>Geek Love Radio Ep. 76 Solo Saturday Edition</title>

Solo Saturday! Halloween Party and the fun of the sexy dressed up people. Then I discuss insecurities and how drama is why relationships will always stay &quot;fun&quot; and interesting. 

Articles: 

Harry Potter teaches us about the power of positive thinking.

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-novel-perspective/201110/spells-and-charms-harry-potter-and-the-power-positive-thinking


Geek Love Tip of the Week:

Sometimes the key to the best relationships is flirting with other people. Not flirting to hook up or leave your significant other, but flirting to simply have fun and just revel in the attentions of others. Can be a good idea, if don't in moderation and trust.

Solo Saturday! Halloween Party and the fun of the sexy dressed up people. Then I discuss insecurities and how drama is why relationships will always stay &quot;fun&quot; and interesting.

Geek Love Tip of the Week:

Sometimes the key to the best relationships is flirting with other people. Not flirting to hook up or leave your significant other, but flirting to simply have fun and just revel in the attentions of others. Can be a good idea, if don't in moderation and trust.

The term Fanny and it's iterations depending on the country. Also we talk porn once again, but now it's impact on society.

Articles: 

A Cosmopolitan survey says 20% of women prefer Facebook over sex, and we just share what Gizomodo had to say about that.

Then there's the sweet and sad story of a couple who had been married for almost 3/4ths of a century who die together in a very movie-esque way.

http://theweek.com/article/index/220645/72-years-together-the-couple-who-died-holding-hands

Then we discuss that maybe it's better to just keep your nose out of things if you want your friendships to survive. But maybe it's much harder than we think.
