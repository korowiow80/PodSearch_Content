      <itunes:author>Dr. Todd Curtis</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>How media coverage affects fear of flying, and ideas for preventing bird strikes</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>On 15 January 2009, a US Airways A320 encountered a flock of birds shortly after takeoff. Both engines lost power, apparently as the result of experiencing multiple bird strikes, and the crew was able to successfully ditch the aircraft in the Hudson River. All five crew members and 150 passengers survived the accident. The following day, Dr. Todd Curtis was a guest of Dean Richards on Chicago's WGN radio. They discussed the US Airways event, how the public's fear of flying is affected by extensive media coverage of airline accidents, and what kind of measures could be taken to deal with the threat of bird strikes.

  <title>Risks from Incapacitated Pilots and Pilots Who May Deliberately Crash Airplanes (audio - MP3)</title>
      <itunes:author>Dr. Todd Curtis</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>What an Air Canada Event Says About Incapacitated Pilots </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>AirSafe.com reviews the investigation into a January 2008 incident where an Air Canada pilot became mentally incapacitated and had to be removed from the cockpit. Once the first officer was removed, the captain was able to safely land the aircraft. The event caused some in the aviation community to question whether this kind of incident may have led to serious problems in the past. While a review of the available incident and accident record by AirSafe.com revealed no proven cases of a mentally incapacitated pilot deliberately causing death or serious injury to passengers, there have been several cases where such behavior was suspected, and one case where a pilot crashed an airliner on purpose.

  <title>Interview on 'The Gregg Knapp Experience' - 18 November 2008 (audio - MP3)</title>
      <itunes:author>Dr. Todd Curtis</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>A discussion about the effectiveness of a TSA program to choose passengers for further security screening based on their behavior. </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>This interview from the Radio America show The Gregg Knapp Experience focused on a TSA behavior detection program that singles out passengers for extra screening based on what the TSA describes as suspicious behavior. Since the program began in 2006, over 160,000 passengers were pulled aside for additional checks such as a pat-down search or an interivew. Less than one percent of those passengers were arrested, often on charges related to drugs or carrying false identification. The TSA didn't mention whether any of those searched or arrested were on any kind of terror watch list, or intended to commit a terrorist act. For more information about what passengers can do to deal with TSA security issues, please visit tsa.airsafe.org. There you'll a number of resources, including extensive information on current TSA rules, advice on packing, advice on traveling with duty free items such as alcohol and perfume, and links to airline complaint resources.

  <title>Complacency and the Qantas A330 Accident of 7 October 2008 (audio - MP3)</title>
      <itunes:author>Dr. Todd Curtis</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>A review of the lack of interest by the US media in this event reveals that the US is in the middle of a record breaking period of no passenger fatalities on US airlines. </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>The accident earlier this month involving a Qantas Airbus A330 on a flight from Singapore to Perth seriously injured several passengers, but didn't result in any fatalities. The event drew substantial news media attention in Australia and Asia, but very little attention from major US media. Dr. Todd Curtis of AirSafe.com believes that this may be an example of how when it comes to airline events, it's difficult to get the attention of the US public, or of the policy makers in the US, if no one is killed, especially when there have not been any fatal airline events involving US airlines in over two years. The current 26-month period since the last fatal US event is the longest period without a passenger fatality on a US airliner since airlines in the US first began using jet aircraft in 1958. Dr Curtis suggests that there is always room for improvement, and one way to improve the system is to study the results of accident investigations, including the ongoing Qantas investigation. AirSafe.com provides links to that investigation at http://qantas.airsafe.org.

      <itunes:author>Dr. Todd Curtis</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>Review of the facts about the discovery of the Fossett crash site </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>On September 3rd, 2007, adventurer Steve Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada on a short flight in a Bellanca Super Decathlon, and went missing. After more than a year, a hiker found some of his personal effects high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California on September 29, 2008. Two days later, authorities spotted wreckage from his aircraft. Possible human remains were also found at the site.

The aircraft crashed into a steep granite slope at an elevation of about 10,000 feet, seven miles west of the town of Mammoth Lakes, California. The crash site is about 93 miles or 150 kilometers south of Yerington, Nevada. Pieces of the plane were scattered over a steeply sloped area, with the engine about 300 feet from the fuselage wreckage. There was also evidence of a post crash fire. Fossett was the only occupant.</itunes:summary>

  <title>Fatal Jet Crash Injures Blink-182 Drummer Travis Barker (video - WMV)</title>
      <itunes:author>Dr. Todd Curtis</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>An overview of the fatal aircraft accident that injured Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Travis Barker, former drummer for the music group Blink-182, Adam Goldstein, more widely known as DJ AM, and two other passengers were in a Learjet 60 aircraft that was on a chartered flight from Columbia, South Carolina to Van Nuys airport in Los Angeles. The crash, which happened shortly before midnight, occurred during takeoff. The crew was attempting to abort the takeoff because of what they thought was a blown tire. The NTSB also reported that accident investigators reviewing the recording heard sounds consistent with a tire blowout.

The crew was unable to stop the aircraft before it departed the runway. The plane struck a series of antennas and lights, crashed through a fence, crossed a nearby highway, and came to rest on an embankment where it burst into flames.

The crash and subsequent fire killed both flight crew members and two of the four passengers. The two survivors, Barker and Goldstein, escaped the aircraft but suffered severe burns.</itunes:summary>
