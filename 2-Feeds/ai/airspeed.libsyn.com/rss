			<title>Airspeed - VIDEO - Acro Camp Sneak Peek 04 - With Friends Like These . . .</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://airspeed.libsyn.com/airspeed-video-acro-camp-sneak-peek-04-with-friends-like-these]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Despite the aggressive schedule around here (glider training, trying to find a new acro ride, doing really cool legal work for the best clients on the planet, etc.), I managed to get some time this weekend to do some editing on the movie. &nbsp;The result is this sneak peek, "With friends like these . . ."</p>
<p>The campers at both of the Acro Camp shoots were very collaborative and supportive of each other. &nbsp;But that doesn't mean that there wasn't at least a little laughter with (okay, at) each other when stuff went wrong. &nbsp;And stuff is bound to go wrong when you're learning to fly an aircraft whose center of gravity is behind the mains.</p>
<p>In the course of logging all of the footage, I've noted when both IPs were in aircraft and noted opportunities to synchronize the conversation across both cockpits. &nbsp;Usually based on ATC calls or radio communication between the aircraft. &nbsp;This was one such pair of sequences. &nbsp;I loved the big bounce on Jim's wheel landing and I loved the reaction that it got from Barry and Lynda. &nbsp;I lined them up this evening and&nbsp;<em>voila</em>! &nbsp;Tailwheel magic! &nbsp;</p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[In the wake of a difficult weekend (and, indeed, a difficult season) for the airshow community, I asked John Cudahy to sit down for a few minutes to talk about airshow safety.
&nbsp;
John has been the president of the International Council of Air Shows, Inc. (&ldquo;ICAS&rdquo;) since 1997.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard him speak at the annual convention in Las Vegas for the past two years and I&rsquo;m returning to Las Vegas again this December.
John is one of those people who has always been on my list of people to bring onto the show at some appropriate time.&nbsp; I had thoughts of bringing him on as a part of the upcoming episode encapsulating my experience attending ICAS&rsquo;s Airshows 101 class at the last convention.&nbsp; But the events of the summer conspired to make it more important to bring John onto the show now to talk about the ICAS safety culture.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, I attended the Civil Air Patrol&rsquo;s National Emergency Services Academy (&ldquo;NESA&rdquo;) this summer at Camp Atterbury in Indiana.

To that end, I invited CAP Lt Col John Desmarais, CAP&rsquo;s interim national Director of Operations, to talk about NESA.<br /><br />There&rsquo;s more information about NESA at <strong><span style="color: #4386ce;"><a href="http://www.nesa.cap.gov/">http://www.nesa.cap.gov/</a></span></strong> and more information about CAP (including a unit locator that can help you find a unit to visit and maybe join) at <strong><span style="color: #4386ce;"><a href="http://gocivilairpatrol.com/">http://gocivilairpatrol.com/</a></span></strong>.<br /><br /></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Here's the first trailer for Airspeed's upcoming independent documentary feature film: Acro Camp. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Four pilots. &nbsp;Two men and two women. &nbsp;None has a tailwheel endorsement. &nbsp;None has ever flown aerobatics. &nbsp;But, last May, they came together in southeast Michigan, took over a Part 61 flight school, and flew aerobatics for the first time. &nbsp;This is the story of their experience. &nbsp;Captured in glorious HD and digital audio by an irregular team of pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and new-media producers.</p>
<p>At some point, you quit wondering, climb over the fence, and go find out.</p>

I loaded all of the angst and energy into a song called <em>First Solo</em> and recorded it and gave a copy to Don Fuller, the CFI who soloed me.

			<title>Airspeed - Ballistic Recovery Parachutes with BRS CEO Larry Williams</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/airspeed/AirspeedBRS.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Long-time listeners to Airspeed will recall the episode we did last February about whole-airplane ballistic recovery parachutes and about Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc., better known to some as BRS Parachutes.<br/><br/>I’m a fan of the whole idea of ballistic recovery chutes. They provide an out in those relatively rare cases where no amount of diligence, skill, or luck will prevent you and your aircraft from having an unplanned interface with the planet. I’m talking about a control surface malfunction, loss of certain instruments in IMC, midair collisions, and engine failures where you’re too low, over unlandable terrain, or flying at night.<br/><br/>Recent deployments in both a Cirrus SR22 and a German ultralight that produced the company’s 200th and 201st saves – as well as the popularity of the systems in new light sport aircraft – warrant revisiting the company and its products.<br/><br/>BRS was founded in 1980 and is based in South St. Paul, Minnesota. The company develops and commercializes whole-aircraft emergency recovery parachute systems for use primarily with general aviation and recreational aircraft.<br/><br/>BRS parachute systems are designed to safely lower the entire aircraft and its occupants to the ground in the event of an in-air emergency. The parachute system is designed for in-air emergencies that include mid-air collisions, structure failure, engine failure, pilot incapacitation, and unstable meteorological conditions, among other things. BRS is the largest manufacturer of whole-aircraft recovery systems in the world. Since inception, the company has delivered more than 23,000 systems that have been installed on general aviation aircraft (including more than 2,800 on FAA-certified aircraft).<br/><br/>As I disclosed the last time I covered BRS, I continue to own a small amount of the company’s stock and have held it since 2001. I try to let you guys know every time that I have anything that approaches a conflict of interest, so there it is. Take it for what it’s worth. I look at it as putting a little bit of my retirement fund where my mouth is.<br/><br/>We talked to Larry Williams, who is the chief executive officer, president, chief operating officer, and a director of BRS. Prior to joining BRS in 2000, he was vice president of business development at AmSafe Aviation in Phoenix, Arizona, the world’s largest manufacturer of aviation restraint systems. Prior to that and since 1995, he was group president at Rural/Metro Corporation, a Scottsdale, Arizona -based services company that engages in mobile health services, including emergency and non-emergency fire and ambulatory services. From 1985 to 1995, he was executive director of the Emergency Response Training Academy, a firm specializing in training of airport emergency response personnel.<br/><br/>Let’s go to the interview.<br/><br/>[Interview audio.]<br/><br/>E-mail us at <a href="mailto:steve@airspeedonline.com"><strong><font color="#4386ce">steve@airspeedonline.com</font></strong></a> or leave voicemail at 206-339-8697 any time - day or night.<br/><br/>BRS contact information:<br/><br/>Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc.<br/>300 Airport Road<br/>South Saint Paul MN 55075-3551<br/>Phone: 651.457.7491<br/>Fax: 651.457.8651<br/>e-mail: <a href="mailto:info@brsparachutes.com"><font color="#4386ce"><strong>info@brsparachutes.com</strong></font></a><br/><a href="http://www.brsparachutes.com/"><strong><font color="#4386ce">www.brsparachutes.com</font></strong></a><br/><br/>Associated Press: Bigger Planes Need Bigger Parachutes - <a href="http://news.postbulletin.com/newsmanager/templates/localnews_story.asp?z=7&a=292524"><strong><font color="#4386ce">http://news.postbulletin.com/newsmanager/templates/localnews_story.asp?z=7&amp;a=292524</font></strong></a><br/>]]></description>

I’m talking about a control surface malfunction, loss of certain instruments in IMC, midair collisions, and engine failures where you’re too low, over unlandable terrain, or flying at night.Recent deployments in both a Cirrus SR22 and a German ultralight that produced the company’s 200th and 201st saves – as well as the popularity of the systems in new light sport aircraft – warrant revisiting the company and its products.BRS was founded in 1980 and is based in South St. Paul, Minnesota. The company develops and commercializes whole-aircraft emergency recovery parachute systems for use primarily with general aviation and recreational aircraft.BRS parachute systems are designed to safely lower the entire aircraft and its occupants to the ground in the event of an in-air emergency. The parachute system is designed for in-air emergencies that include mid-air collisions, structure failure, engine failure, pilot incapacitation, and unstable meteorological conditions, among other things. BRS is the largest manufacturer of whole-aircraft recovery systems in the world. Since inception, the company has delivered more than 23,000 systems that have been installed on general aviation aircraft (including more than 2,800 on FAA-certified aircraft).As I disclosed the last time I covered BRS, I continue to own a small amount of the company’s stock and have held it since 2001. I try to let you guys know every time that I have anything that approaches a conflict of interest, so there it is. Take it for what it’s worth. I look at it as putting a little bit of my retirement fund where my mouth is.We talked to Larry Williams, who is the chief executive officer, president, chief operating officer, and a director of BRS. Prior to joining BRS in 2000, he was vice president of business development at AmSafe Aviation in Phoenix, Arizona, the world’s largest manufacturer of aviation restraint systems. Prior to that and since 1995, he was group president at Rural/Metro Corporation, a Scottsdale, Arizona -based services company that engages in mobile health services, including emergency and non-emergency fire and ambulatory services. From 1985 to 1995, he was executive director of the Emergency Response Training Academy, a firm specializing in training of airport emergency response personnel.Let’s go to the interview.[Interview audio.]E-mail us at steve@airspeedonline.com or leave voicemail at 206-339-8697 any time - day or night.BRS contact information:Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc.300 Airport RoadSouth Saint Paul MN 55075-3551Phone: 651.457.7491Fax: 651.457.8651e-mail: info@brsparachutes.comwww.brsparachutes.comAssociated Press: Bigger Planes Need Bigger Parachutes - http://news.postbulletin.com/newsmanager/templates/localnews_story.asp?z=7&amp;a=292524]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Airspeed - Test Pilot: You</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/airspeed/AirspeedTestPilot1.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div>Many of us think of test pilots as leather-faced guys in Nomex flight suits with eyes permanently reduced to slits by squinting into the sun across Rogers Dry Lake Bed at Edwards Air Force Base. And there are some of those.<br/><br/>But today we're going to talk about some test pilots who look a lot more like you and me. In fact, they are you and me.<br/><br/>Now I'm not suggesting that you go strap some JATO rockets to your RV-4 and push the big red button. What I'm talking about is systematically exploring the operating characteristics of the aircraft you fly and yourself as the pilot.<br/><br/>Here's an example. I've always wondered just how much altitude I would need to have before I'd consider trying to turn around and land on the departure runway if I lost the engine shortly after takeoff. There's even a great article about that very subject in AOPA pilot from four or five years ago. But I wanted to know what the numbers would be for the aircraft that I regularly fly and especially for me personally as the pilot in command.<br/><br/>So I decided to go play test pilot.<br/><br/>I set up a profile for the test in advance of the flight. I briefed it on the ground with the instructor and then briefed it again in the air right before the maneuvers. This isn't something you want to pull out of your ear while in flight. You won't have the test fully thought-out and you'll be distracted to boot.<br/><br/>So here's the test:<br/><br/>1. Establish a full-power climb at 79 knots (which is Vy - or best rate of climb - for this aircraft).<br/><br/>2. At a known altitude, pull the throttle to idle.<br/><br/>3. Wait for five seconds. This pause is to simulate the amount of time that it would likely take for a pilot to realize that he had an engine-out, evacuate his bowels, and initiate action.<br/><br/>4. Initiate a turn at 65 knots (which is the best glide speed for this aircraft) and up to 45 degrees of bank.<br/><br/>5. After 210 degrees of turn (180 degrees to reverse direction and another 30 degrees to point back at the runway), level out and note the altitude loss.<br/><br/>Because I'm already recording this for the podcast using an MP3 recorder plugged into the intercom, I don't have to worry about capturing data on paper or remembering it. I can just call out the data as it happens. Everything I'm calling out is something that I'd have to monitor anyway as a part of flying the airplane, so I'm not worried about being distracted. The only additional workload beyond that required to fly the plane in the first place is saying the instrument readings out loud so I can record them. Being that I'm preparing for my instrument checkride concurrently, Iâ??m already doing my John King call-outs, so this isn't much of a departure from normal procedure.<br/><br/>After putting together this rough outline of the test, I thought about what, if anything, might approach the operating envelope of either the aircraft or the pilot.<br/><br/>As far as the aircraft is concerned, the only thing I could think of that would approach the edge of the envelope would be being banked over pretty far and flying pretty slow. Any slow-speed maneuver necessarily makes one think about possible stalls and spins. So I looked at the pilot's operating handbook to verify that I'd have enough of a margin above a stall during the turn. The POH says that, in the clean configuration and with the weight and balance we had for that flight, the stall speed with 45 degrees of bank is 53 knots indicated. Plenty of room.<br/><br/>How about the pilot? I'm pretty good at slow flight and my steep turns are great. But I can't say that I'm good â?? or current â?? at doing both simultaneously. So I'll practice both separately before we do the test and I'll have a high-time CFII in the right seat and close to the controls as a safety measure.<br/><br/>There is perhaps some benefit to not being very current with slow steep turns. It might be a good proxy for being surprised or stressed. Additionally, low-speed, steeply-banked turns are not something that itâ??s likely that Iâ??ll end up practicing that often anyway, so not being current is a great proxy for not being current, too!<br/><br/>So, all that said, ace flight instructor Jamie Willis and I got into the plane on a beautiful severe-clear Thursday morning and went up to see what we could find out.<br/><br/>I hadnâ??t been up in months, so we went through some VFR basics to warm up. The steep turns were like the airplane was on rails. A nice little burble at the end of each one to tell me that I had flown through my own wake turbulence from the start of the turn. Slow flight and stalls were also all fine.<br/><br/>So we set up to do the test. Three iterations with the same procedure each time.<br/><br/>Hereâ??s the first one.<br/><br/>[Audio 1]<br/><br/>The airspeed was all over the map. As expected, I had a lot of trouble nailing the airspeed while rolling into the turn and then getting her around those 210 degrees. So we tried it again. This time, I asked Jamie to really ride me about the airspeed and he obliged.<br/><br/>[Audio 2]<br/><br/>Guys, this podcast is the real deal. Who else would let more than a thousand people sit in the back seat while he got dope-slapped by his instructor for chasing the airspeed needle up and down the dial? Iâ??m learning stuff here. But Iâ??m also not going to let it go at that. This needs another try, so here we go.<br/><br/>[Audio 3]<br/><br/>Much better. Iâ??m a little happier with that one.<br/><br/>So thatâ??s the test run. We proceeded to knock off the rest of the VFR rust on that flight and Iâ??m pleased to say that I greased all four landings after not having flown since September. I didnâ??t hurt that the wind was dead calm, but Iâ??ll take at least some credit for pilot skill.<br/><br/>Like any good test pilot, my debriefing included a frank discussion of the shortcomings of the test. Here's what I identified.<br/><br/>Â· The five-count may or may not be a good proxy for the amount of time that I might need to identify an engine-out and make the decision to turn back. I've never had an engine out, so I really don't know how I'd react.<br/><br/>Â· Accomplishing a 210-degree turn is not the same as getting back to a runway. Depending on the wind and any number of other factors, even a 210-degree turn might leave you a long way laterally off the runway and needing to glide back to the centerline â?? and then turn back that 30 degrees to align the aircraft with the centerline. If you're at, say, Willow Run airport with lots and lots of flat real estate even if not all of it is paved, that's less of a problem. Grass is okay by me in a pinch and I'll even take out a marker if I have to. But if you're at Troy Executive Airport with shopping centers, industrial buildings, and power lines hemming in the runway, that's an issue. Shopping centers are harder to land on than grass. I took a handheld GPS up on the flight with the intention of analyzing the vertical and horizontal track so that I could correct for winds at altitude (the preflight briefing called for winds at 320 at 33 at that altitude), but it turned out to be too complicated to work out in time for this episode. Maybe again on a day where the winds at altitude are closer to what you'd expect on the surface.<br/><br/>Â· The data I got would all go out the window if I don't pre-brief the procedure on every takeoff. That includes wind and turn direction. It also includes situational awareness of what's going on other runways, especially if the wind is such that your best turn direction is toward a parallel runway. The offset is good because you have less lateral distance to travel back to a runway (assuming that you're going to land on the parallel), but, if you're not sure that the parallel is clear, you could risk eating Learjet. Learjets are sometimes worse to land on than shopping centers. And they usually cost more.<br/><br/>Â· I need to work on my ability to establish and maintain pitch for a given airspeed when in steeply-banked turns. I was all over the map on two of the three trials and even the last trial had me behind the airplane a little. I think Iâ??ll make this maneuver a consistent part of my periodic VFR training.<br/><br/>Long story short, I now know that, if Iâ??ve pre-briefed the procedure before taking off and Iâ??m a little better than I have been at maintaining the best-glide speed of 65 knots while banked over 45 degrees, I could get probably get the plane turned 210 degrees within four hundred feet. What I donâ??t know is what kind of lateral position Iâ??d be in after the turn and whether Iâ??d be in a position to make it to the runway from there. Before I turn this into an actual operating procedure, Iâ??m going to have to figure out how to get event data out of the GPS and figure out the lateral part â?? and the remaining horizontal part â?? of the situation.<br/><br/>But thatâ??s whatâ??s good about going out and â?? within reason â?? being a test pilot. You add to what you know and you figure out what you donâ??t know. Done well within the flight envelope of the airplane and the pilot in command, and with appropriate safety precautions (and seasoned flight instructors who have had upset training tend to be good safety precautions), youâ??ll be a better, safer, and more thoughtful pilot.<br/><br/>Long-time listeners wonâ??t be surprised by the following disclaimers. I am by no means suggesting that you go out and do risky stuff. All of the maneuvers that I'm talking about are well within the normal operating envelope of the aircraft involved.<br/><br/>I have well over 100 hours in C-172s and probably 20 hours in this particular airplane. I went up with a 900-hour CFII who has hundreds of hours more than I do in C-172s and who has had training in unusual attitude and upset recoveries. The CFII had the seat forward and was close to the controls the whole time. It was a severe clear day over known territory. And we had flight following from Flint Approach the whole time for traffic advisories and in case we needed to talk to someone immediately in an emergency.<br/><br/>Nothing in what you've heard here is flight instruction or a recommendation about aircraft operations. Consult a qualified flight instructor before attempting anything you hear about on Airspeed.<br/><br/>Different aircraft do different things at different airspeeds and in different configurations and even the characteristics of the same model of aircraft will vary from specific aircraft to specific aircraft.<br/><br/>Donâ??t integrate anything you heard on this episode into your operating procedures. As you can tell from my commentary, Iâ??ve only figured out about half of what I need to know before even thinking about making any firm decisions about what Iâ??d do at any particular altitude or situation. And bear in mind that my personal flight skills and biases are inseparable from the results that I got. None of this is transferable to your particular situation because youâ??re probably not flying the same aircraft and youâ??re definitely not me (the latter of which will probably come as a relief to many of you).<br/><br/>Remember your training, observe the limitations in the pilot's operating handbook, and - above all - fly the airplane. But you knew that.<br/><br/>See also:<br/><br/>ASF Safety Advisor â??

Any slow-speed maneuver necessarily makes one think about possible stalls and spins. So I looked at the pilot's operating handbook to verify that I'd have enough of a margin above a stall during the turn. The POH says that, in the clean configuration and with the weight and balance we had for that flight, the stall speed with 45 degrees of bank is 53 knots indicated. Plenty of room.How about the pilot? I'm pretty good at slow flight and my steep turns are great. But I can't say that I'm good â?? or current â?? at doing both simultaneously. So I'll practice both separately before we do the test and I'll have a high-time CFII in the right seat and close to the controls as a safety measure.There is perhaps some benefit to not being very current with slow steep turns. It might be a good proxy for being surprised or stressed. Additionally, low-speed, steeply-banked turns are not something that itâ??s likely that Iâ??ll end up practicing that often anyway, so not being current is a great proxy for not being current, too!So, all that said, ace flight instructor Jamie Willis and I got into the plane on a beautiful severe-clear Thursday morning and went up to see what we could find out.I hadnâ??t been up in months, so we went through some VFR basics to warm up. The steep turns were like the airplane was on rails. A nice little burble at the end of each one to tell me that I had flown through my own wake turbulence from the start of the turn. Slow flight and stalls were also all fine.So we set up to do the test. Three iterations with the same procedure each time.Hereâ??s the first one.[Audio 1]The airspeed was all over the map. As expected, I had a lot of trouble nailing the airspeed while rolling into the turn and then getting her around those 210 degrees. So we tried it again. This time, I asked Jamie to really ride me about the airspeed and he obliged.[Audio 2]Guys, this podcast is the real deal. Who else would let more than a thousand people sit in the back seat while he got dope-slapped by his instructor for chasing the airspeed needle up and down the dial? Iâ??m learning stuff here. But Iâ??m also not going to let it go at that. This needs another try, so here we go.[Audio 3]Much better. Iâ??m a little happier with that one.So thatâ??s the test run. We proceeded to knock off the rest of the VFR rust on that flight and Iâ??m pleased to say that I greased all four landings after not having flown since September. I didnâ??t hurt that the wind was dead calm, but Iâ??ll take at least some credit for pilot skill.Like any good test pilot, my debriefing included a frank discussion of the shortcomings of the test. Here's what I identified.Â· The five-count may or may not be a good proxy for the amount of time that I might need to identify an engine-out and make the decision to turn back. I've never had an engine out, so I really don't know how I'd react.Â· Accomplishing a 210-degree turn is not the same as getting back to a runway. Depending on the wind and any number of other factors, even a 210-degree turn might leave you a long way laterally off the runway and needing to glide back to the centerline â?? and then turn back that 30 degrees to align the aircraft with the centerline. If you're at, say, Willow Run airport with lots and lots of flat real estate even if not all of it is paved, that's less of a problem. Grass is okay by me in a pinch and I'll even take out a marker if I have to. But if you're at Troy Executive Airport with shopping centers, industrial buildings, and power lines hemming in the runway, that's an issue. Shopping centers are harder to land on than grass. I took a handheld GPS up on the flight with the intention of analyzing the vertical and horizontal track so that I could correct for winds at altitude (the preflight briefing called for winds at 320 at 33 at that altitude), but it turned out to be too complicated to work out in time for this episode. Maybe again on a day where the winds at altitude are closer to what you'd expect on the surface.Â· The data I got would all go out the window if I don't pre-brief the procedure on every takeoff. That includes wind and turn direction. It also includes situational awareness of what's going on other runways, especially if the wind is such that your best turn direction is toward a parallel runway. The offset is good because you have less lateral distance to travel back to a runway (assuming that you're going to land on the parallel), but, if you're not sure that the parallel is clear, you could risk eating Learjet. Learjets are sometimes worse to land on than shopping centers. And they usually cost more.Â· I need to work on my ability to establish and maintain pitch for a given airspeed when in steeply-banked turns. I was all over the map on two of the three trials and even the last trial had me behind the airplane a little. I think Iâ??ll make this maneuver a consistent part of my periodic VFR training.Long story short, I now know that, if Iâ??ve pre-briefed the procedure before taking off and Iâ??m a little better than I have been at maintaining the best-glide speed of 65 knots while banked over 45 degrees, I could get probably get the plane turned 210 degrees within four hundred feet. What I donâ??t know is what kind of lateral position Iâ??d be in after the turn and whether Iâ??d be in a position to make it to the runway from there. Before I turn this into an actual operating procedure, Iâ??m going to have to figure out how to get event data out of the GPS and figure out the lateral part â?? and the remaining horizontal part â?? of the situation.But thatâ??s whatâ??s good about going out and â?? within reason â?? being a test pilot. You add to what you know and you figure out what you donâ??t know. Done well within the flight envelope of the airplane and the pilot in command, and with appropriate safety precautions (and seasoned flight instructors who have had upset training tend to be good safety precautions), youâ??ll be a better, safer, and more thoughtful pilot.Long-time listeners wonâ??t be surprised by the following disclaimers. I am by no means suggesting that you go out and do risky stuff. All of the maneuvers that I'm talking about are well within the normal operating envelope of the aircraft involved.I have well over 100 hours in C-172s and probably 20 hours in this particular airplane. I went up with a 900-hour CFII who has hundreds of hours more than I do in C-172s and who has had training in unusual attitude and upset recoveries. The CFII had the seat forward and was close to the controls the whole time. It was a severe clear day over known territory. And we had flight following from Flint Approach the whole time for traffic advisories and in case we needed to talk to someone immediately in an emergency.Nothing in what you've heard here is flight instruction or a recommendation about aircraft operations. Consult a qualified flight instructor before attempting anything you hear about on Airspeed.Different aircraft do different things at different airspeeds and in different configurations and even the characteristics of the same model of aircraft will vary from specific aircraft to specific aircraft.Donâ??t integrate anything you heard on this episode into your operating procedures. As you can tell from my commentary, Iâ??ve only figured out about half of what I need to know before even thinking about making any firm decisions about what Iâ??d do at any particular altitude or situation. And bear in mind that my personal flight skills and biases are inseparable from the results that I got. None of this is transferable to your particular situation because youâ??re probably not flying the same aircraft and youâ??re definitely not me (the latter of which will probably come as a relief to many of you).Remember your training, observe the limitations in the pilot's operating handbook, and - above all - fly the airplane. But you knew that.See also:ASF Safety Advisor â?? Would You Make It? http://www.aopa.org/asf/publications/inst_reports2.cfm?article=5317]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Airspeed - Aircraft Icing and the Researchers of the Icing Branch at NASA Glenn Research Center</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/airspeed/AirspeedIcingGlenn1.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[It's the season for icing here in the midwest. As some instrument-rated and other pilots can tell you, few things have higher pucker factor than looking out at your wings while you're in the clouds and seeing ice begin to form. Most general aviation aircraft don't have de-icing equipment on board and even those that do often aren't certified for flight into known icing conditions.<br/><br/>For most GA pilots, that means avoiding icing in the first place - and that requires the development and use of the most effective anti-icing tool you have. Your noggin.<br/><br/>Few are more qualified to provide authoritative information about icing than the professionals on the Icing Team and in the Flight Operations team at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. We had the opportunity recently to talk to NASA Glenn pilots Kurt Blankenship and Bill Rieke and researcher Dr. Judy Van Zante, a contractor with ASRC Aerospace.<br/><br/>Bill Rieke is chief of aircraft operations at the NASA Glenn. He began his flying career with the U. S. Navy in 1966 and flew with Fighter Squadron 74 aboard the USS Forrestal and later flew tactical aircraft with the U. S. Air Force (Air National Guard). He also flew as a captain for the Standard Oil Company before joining NASA. He has flown research and test missions for NASA since 1981.<br/><br/>During his time at NASA he has been the lead project pilot for numerous projects ranging from zero-gravity flight to advanced cockpit technology for the U. S. Air Force. He has also been deeply involved in airborne icing research since 1982.<br/><br/>Bill has an airline transport certificate, five type ratings and 12,000 hours of flight time. His military flight experience was almost exclusively in tactical jet aircraft.<br/><br/>Kurt Blankenship is an NASA Icing Research Tunnel Operator, NASA Glenn Research Center Pilot and the Centerâ??s Aviation Safety Officer. He served in the United States Marine Corps as a CH-53 Helicopter Crew Chief from 1981 to 1985 and then worked for Continental Air Lines as a mechanic. He then attended Bowling Green State University and was a flight instructor and director of maintenance for the schoolâ??s flight department during that time. He was a corporate pilot and mechanic from 1990 to 1994 and has been with NASA Glenn since 1994. He holds commercial, flight instructor, and airline transport pilot certificates and, in addition to flying NASA Glennâ??s icing research aircraft, he is type rated in Learjets and has over 1,000 hours of flight research time.<br/><br/>Judy Van Zante is a researcher and project lead for the pilot training aids at NASA Glenn and has also done flight test engineering. She holds a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering. She flew on the icing research aircraft and did substantial other research as part of the NASA/FAA Tailplane Icing Program.<br/><br/>NASA Glenn's icing research aircraft is a modified DeHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter. It is powered by two 550 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-20A turbine engines that drive three-bladed Hartzel constant speed propellers. Its relatively large size makes this aircraft a versatile test bed for in-flight icing research reaching speeds of 150 knots with a range of 500 nautical miles with a maximum fuel load. The Twin Otter has been modified to carry a full complement of sophisticated instruments that measure and record important properties of icing clouds. A stereoscopic camera system documents ice accretion characteristics of the aircraft in flight.<br/><br/>Most test flights are conducted below 10,000 ft., but the Otter has an oxygen system onboard for flight up to 16,000 ft. Research flights are performed with two pilots and up to three research personnel on-board. The ice protection system on the Otter is a combination of pneumatic boots, electrothermal anti-icing, and electrothermal de-icing. NASA has added pneumatic de-icing boots to the vertical tail, wing struts, and main gear struts. The high level of ice protection allows safe flight into known icing conditions, as well as the ability to selectively de-ice aircraft surfaces. By selectively de-icing, it is possible to evaluate the performance, stability, and control effects of ice on various surfaces. The Twin Otter supports the Icing Research Tunnel research and new icing protection systems. It has two experimental sites, the overhead hatch and the wing cuff, that subject test models to the icing environment while the aircraft remains clear of ice through de-icing. This aircraft is currently being used to acquire extensive experimental data about icing effects on aircraft flight. The aircraft has been used for, and is adaptable to other flight research projects.<br/><br/>Those who aren't pilots or who haven't undertaken instrument training might be a little mystified by some of the terminology that you're about to hear, so here's a quick glossary.<br/><br/>MEA: Minimum Enroute Altitude ( or &quot;MEA&quot;) is the recommended minimum altitude that an aircraft should fly on a segment of an airway in instrument meteorological conditions. Flying at or above the MEA ensures clearance from terrain and obstacles, ensures reception of signals from ground-based navigation aids and, in a radar environment, makes it so that relevant air traffic controlfacilities can see the aircraft on radar.<br/><br/>Pirep: A pilot report. It is a report of weather conditions given by a pilot of an aircraft that is aloft. Pireps for turbulence, icing, and visibility are considered particularly valuable pireps.<br/><br/>STC: A supplemental type certificate. Aircraft that have type certificates (such as most production airplanes) must conform to the specifications in their type certificates or be registered as experimental or not flown. You can't mess much with an aircraft without losing the type certificate. An STC issued by the FAA permits the owner of an aircraft to make the covered modifications while maintaining the aircraft's type certificate. Frequent subjects of STCs are engine modifications and de-icing systems. There are also several STCs that allow installation of ballistic recovery parachutes in various production aircraft.<br/><br/>So on to the interview with NASA Glenn pilots Kurt Blankenship and Bill Rieke and researcher Dr. Judy Van Zante.<br/><br/>[Interview audio.]<br/><br/>Thanks to Bill Rieke, Kurt Blankenship, and Judy Van Zante and thanks to NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio!<br/><br/>With all this talk of icing, it might be easy to forget that NASA Glenn does a lot more than icing research.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[It's the season for icing here in the midwest. As some instrument-rated and other pilots can tell you, few things have higher pucker factor than looking out at your wings while you're in the clouds and seeing ice begin to form. Most general aviation aircraft don't have de-icing equipment on board and even those that do often aren't certified for flight into known icing conditions.For most GA pilots, that means avoiding icing in the first place - and that requires the development and use of the most effective anti-icing tool you have. Your noggin.Few are more qualified to provide authoritative information about icing than the professionals on the Icing Team and in the Flight Operations team at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. We had the opportunity recently to talk to NASA Glenn pilots Kurt Blankenship and Bill Rieke and researcher Dr. Judy Van Zante, a contractor with ASRC Aerospace.Bill Rieke is chief of aircraft operations at the NASA Glenn. He began his flying career with the U. S. Navy in 1966 and flew with Fighter Squadron 74 aboard the USS Forrestal and later flew tactical aircraft with the U. S. Air Force (Air National Guard). He also flew as a captain for the Standard Oil Company before joining NASA. He has flown research and test missions for NASA since 1981.During his time at NASA he has been the lead project pilot for numerous projects ranging from zero-gravity flight to advanced cockpit technology for the U. S. Air Force. He has also been deeply involved in airborne icing research since 1982.Bill has an airline transport certificate, five type ratings and 12,000 hours of flight time. His military flight experience was almost exclusively in tactical jet aircraft.Kurt Blankenship is an NASA Icing Research Tunnel Operator, NASA Glenn Research Center Pilot and the Centerâ??s Aviation Safety Officer. He served in the United States Marine Corps as a CH-53 Helicopter Crew Chief from 1981 to 1985 and then worked for Continental Air Lines as a mechanic.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/airspeed/AirspeedSCA2.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the second episode in our two-part series covering the modified Boeing 747s that NASA uses carry the space shuttle orbiters when they need to be repositioned between Edwards Air Force Base in California, Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and other locations. </p>
<p>We talked about the basics of the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, or &quot;SCAs&quot; in Part One, in which we also interviewed SCA crew chief Pete Seidl. If you missed that episode or if you're a recent subscriber, please be sure to download that episode as well.</p>
<p>Today we're going to talk to one of the pilots who flies NASA's SCAs. </p>
<p>To say that Gordon Fullerton is an SCA pilot would be true, but to stop there would be to fail to outline as rich an aviation and aerospace career as anyone could claim.</p>
<p>He's presently associate director of flight operations at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in Southern California. In addition to flying the SCAs, his assignments include a variety of flight research and support activities piloting a variety of multi-engine and high performance aircraft.</p>
<p>Fullerton entered the U.S. Air Force in 1958. After primary and basic flight school, he trained as an F-86 interceptor pilot and later became a B-47 bomber pilot. In 1964, he attended what is now be called Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base and was later assigned as a test pilot with the Bomber Operations Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.</p>
<p>While still in the Air Force, he went on to become a NASA astronaut and served on the support crews for the Apollo 14, 15, 16 and 17 lunar missions.</p>
<p>[Audio]</p>
<p>The voice there saying &quot;Roger, you have good thrust&quot; is Fullerton, who was the man at the CAPCOM station in Houston for Gene Cernan and Jack Schmidt's liftoff from the Taurus Littrow Valley as part of Apollo 17 - the last manned mission to the moon.</p>
<p>In 1977, Fullerton joined one of the two two-man flight crews that piloted the Space Shuttle prototype Enterprise during the Approach and Landing Test program, which involved flying the orbiter to altitude on an SCA, separating the orbiter from the SCA, and then gliding the orbiter to a landing to validate landing procedures.</p>
<p>Fullerton logged 382 hours in space during two space shuttle missions. He was the pilot for the eight-day STS-3 orbital flight test mission in 1982. STS-3 landed at Northrup Strip at White Sands, New Mexico because Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards Air Force Base was wet due to heavy seasonal rains. He was also the commander of the STS-51F Spacelab 2 mission in 1985, which landed at Edwards.</p>
<p>Fullerton has logged more than 16,000 hours of flying time and flown 114 different types of aircraft, including full qualification in the T-33, T-34, T-37, T-38, T-39, F-86, F-101, F-106, F-111, F-14, F/A-18, X-29, KC-135, C-140 and B-47.</p>
<p>Since joining Dryden as a research pilot, Fullerton has piloted nearly all the research and support aircraft flown at the facility and currently flies the center's Beech King Air 200 as well as the B-747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft.</p>
<p>He was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2005, and the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982.</p>
<p>We started the research for this episode intending to focus on the SCAs themselves. We were delighted to have access to one of the pilots of these magnificent machines. But we had no idea when we submitted the initial inquiry that that we'd end up talking to a man whose career has been so intertwined with the space program and the national dream that has captured so many imaginations. With your indulgence, then, we couldn't help also asking Gordon for his thoughts about the space program - where it's been and where it's going.</p>
<p>We caught up with Gordon by phone at his office at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in Southern California.</p>

			<title>Airspeed - NASA's Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (Part 1) - Interview with SCA Crew Chief Pete Seidl</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/airspeed/AirspeedSCA1.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<strong>Subscribe to Airspeed through iTunes or your other favorite podcatcher using the feed </strong><a href="http://airspeed.libsyn.com/rss"><strong>http://airspeed.libsyn.com/rss</strong></a><strong> or listen to audio at </strong><a href="http://airspeed.libsyn.com/"><strong>http://airspeed.libsyn.com</strong></a><strong>.<br/><br/></strong>Everyone knows that the orbiter of the Space Transportation System (or &quot;STS,&quot; and more popularly called the &quot;Space Shuttle) doesn't always land back at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Sometimes, it lands at Edwards Air Force Base and, if needed, it could land at White Sands or one of several other emergency landing sites around the world.<br/><br/>That's great, but it puts the orbiter several thousand miles away from its launching facility at the cape.<br/><br/>So how does the orbiter get around? Most of you know that the answer is that you mount it on the top of a specially-modified Boeing 747 called a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft or &quot;SCA.&quot; But, if you're like me, you probably didn't know much about the SCAs. How are they different from a stock 747? How many are there? What's it like to maintain an aircraft like that? What's it like to fly it?<br/><br/>Well, if there's one thing you know about Airspeed, it's that we never pass up the opportunity to go right to the source to get real answers from the people closest to the aircraft. And that's just what we did for this special two-part series.<br/><br/>First, a bit about the SCAs. There are two of them. NASA 905 (tail number N905NA) is a Boeing 747-100 and the other, NASA 911 (tail number N911NA) is a short-range Boeing 747-100SR.<br/><br/>The two aircraft are very similar and have nearly identical operating characteristics. If you happen to be lucky enough to see one on the ramp but can't see the tail number, NASA 905 has two upper-deck windows on each side while NASA 911 has five.<br/><br/>The SCAs have a maximum gross taxi weight of 711,000 pounds. A stock 747-100 weighs about 380,000 pounds empty and an SCA weighs even more than that. Once you add 180,000 pounds or more for the orbiter, you have less than 140,000 pounds or so left for fuel and other stuff. And there's precious little other stuff because even using the entire remaining 140,000 or so pounds for fuel only gives you about a 1,000-mile range.<br/><br/>That's actually a little gratifying, because these are some of the same concerns that those of us who have flown ultralights, Cessna 152s, or light sport aircraft know a thing or two about. If you've ever left your flight bag, spare change, and shoelaces back at the FBO and still had to closely manage the amount of fuel in the plane to get two average-sized guys into a C-152 under max gross, you've had the same thing on your mind - at least at some scale - that our guest today deals with very frequently.<br/><br/>We start off the series on the SCA by talking to SCA crew chief Pete Seidl. Pete started working with the SCAs in 1979. He's an employee of Computer Sciences Corporation (or &quot;CSC&quot;) under contract to NASA's Shuttle Support Operations Office at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in Southern California. He heads a team of five at NASA Dryden that does the regular maintenance on the two SCAs. Among other things, Pete was on the crew that took NASA 905 and the Enterprise orbiter to the Paris Airshow in 1983.<br/><br/>Before we get going, a couple of notes for non-space-junkies.<br/><br/>You'll hear us talk about hypergolic fuels. Hypergolic fuels ignite immediately when the two components of the fuel come together. They're very reliable, even if their components are sometimes highly toxic. Examples are <a title="Hydrazine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine">hydrazine</a> paired with <a title="Nitric acid" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid">nitric acid</a> and monomethylhydrazine (<a title="Monomethylhydrazine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomethylhydrazine">MMH</a>) paired with <a title="Nitrogen tetroxide" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_tetroxide">nitrogen tetroxide</a>, the latter pair of which is used in the space shuttle's reaction control system. Early uses included a critical application for the Apollo program's lunar modules.<br/><br/>One other insider point. Moving orbiters is complex enough with a crack team, lots of support, and only one orbiter at a time to move. But, in early 2001, NASA came within 37 minutes of having a formation flight of the two SCAs, each with an orbiter aboard.<br/><br/>On February 20, 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis unexpectedly had to land at Edwards. Atlantis needed to be received, processed, and ferried back to the Orbiter Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Space Shuttle Discovery was undergoing upgrades at Boeing's facility in nearby Palmdale and needed to be at the cape in preparation for launch by March 8. NASA 905 was already in Palmdale awaiting mating of Discovery for the ferry flight, but NASA 911 was at Evergreen Air Center in Marana, Arizona undergoing maintenance.<br/><br/>Two orbiters, two SCAs, an almost simultaneous deadline, and not much time to organize and carry out an amazingly complex set of operations. Pete and his team faced an unprecedented challenge. But, on March 1, 2001, the two SCAs, each with a national treasure mounted atop it, launched for Kennedy Space Center with NASA 905 and Columbia taking off at 11:00 a.m. local and NASA 911 with Atlantis taking off at 11:37. Although each encountered bad weather and other difficulties, each made it to Florida in time.<br/><br/>The aircraft took separate routes and a formation flight would have been impractical and beyond the mission risk profile, but at least I'm not the only one to have allowed the thought to enter my head and think that that would have been a deeply moving picture.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the interview.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Subscribe to Airspeed through iTunes or your other favorite podcatcher using the feed http://airspeed.libsyn.com/rss or listen to audio at http://airspeed.libsyn.com.Everyone knows that the orbiter of the Space Transportation System (or &quot;STS,&quot; and more popularly called the &quot;Space Shuttle) doesn't always land back at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Sometimes, it lands at Edwards Air Force Base and, if needed, it could land at White Sands or one of several other emergency landing sites around the world.That's great, but it puts the orbiter several thousand miles away from its launching facility at the cape.So how does the orbiter get around? Most of you know that the answer is that you mount it on the top of a specially-modified Boeing 747 called a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft or &quot;SCA.&quot; But, if you're like me, you probably didn't know much about the SCAs. How are they different from a stock 747? How many are there? What's it like to maintain an aircraft like that? What's it like to fly it?Well, if there's one thing you know about Airspeed, it's that we never pass up the opportunity to go right to the source to get real answers from the people closest to the aircraft. And that's just what we did for this special two-part series.First, a bit about the SCAs. There are two of them. NASA 905 (tail number N905NA) is a Boeing 747-100 and the other, NASA 911 (tail number N911NA) is a short-range Boeing 747-100SR.The two aircraft are very similar and have nearly identical operating characteristics. If you happen to be lucky enough to see one on the ramp but can't see the tail number, NASA 905 has two upper-deck windows on each side while NASA 911 has five.The SCAs have a maximum gross taxi weight of 711,000 pounds. A stock 747-100 weighs about 380,000 pounds empty and an SCA weighs even more than that. Once you add 180,000 pounds or more for the orbiter, you have less than 140,000 pounds or so left for fuel and other stuff. And there's precious little other stuff because even using the entire remaining 140,000 or so pounds for fuel only gives you about a 1,000-mile range.That's actually a little gratifying, because these are some of the same concerns that those of us who have flown ultralights, Cessna 152s, or light sport aircraft know a thing or two about. If you've ever left your flight bag, spare change, and shoelaces back at the FBO and still had to closely manage the amount of fuel in the plane to get two average-sized guys into a C-152 under max gross, you've had the same thing on your mind - at least at some scale - that our guest today deals with very frequently.We start off the series on the SCA by talking to SCA crew chief Pete Seidl.

<p><br/>An air traffic controller gave me a number to copy the other day. And it was a good thing.<br/><br/>I spent a little time this week on the phone with Mark Schad, who is a terminal area controller for the area surrounding Lambert-St.Louis International Airport. 13 million passengers went through the airport in 2004. Besides being the airport featured in <a title="Planes, Trains & Automobiles" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planes,_Trains_&_Automobiles">Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles</a> and a <a title="The Airport (Seinfeld episode)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Airport_(Seinfeld_episode)">Seinfeld episode</a>, it has 25 separately-charted approaches, including simultaneous close parallels. And that doesn't include all the satellite airports for which St. Louis approach provides approach and departure control. More than enough for any controller or pilot to shake a stick at.<br/><br/>Mark is also a pilot with enough ratings to have to get a separate bag for his logbook, and his perspective as both a provider and a customer of the air traffic control system is invaluable.<br/><br/>I called Mark at the control facility this week and we spent some time demystifying the men and women at the scopes and talking about what it's like at a workstation, how best to interact with a controller, what happens in an emergency, and lots of other good pilot talk. So, if you've copied your ATIS (and, for the love of Pete, copy your ATIS when you're in Mark's airspace!), let's go to the interview.</p>

			<title>Airspeed - The Ballad of the Sandman</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>See the Airspeed blog and show notes at </strong><a href="http://www.airspeedonline.blogspot.com"><strong>www.airspeedonline.blogspot.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, it's good to stir things up a little. <br/><br/>This episode has nothing to do with aviation, aerospace, jet fuel, or tearing up the sky. If you're in the mood for an aviation-related episode and don't want to listen to anything else, please skip this episode and pick us back up in January. If you're tuning in ffor the first time, my apologies. This really is an aviation and aerospace show and you can check out prior episodes for your aviation fix until the first new episode of 2007 comes out. <br/><br/>But we're going to change things up this time. Airspeed is about to pay an homage that the podsphere owes to a very special medium and a very special time. <br/><br/>Airspeed is finishing out a great first year. A year in which we've met lots of new people, flown in a lot in different aircraft, and realized the dream of the podsphere - Ordinary people making the closest thing they can to art and reaching out to touch other ordinary people. <br/><br/>If you're older - over 40 or so - and you lived close enough to a metropolitan area - and you had an FM radio receiver in the mid to late 1960s - and if you were very lucky - you had a front-row seat for one of the most magical times in all of media before or since. When FM radio reached its critical mass and a backwater of the electromagnetic spectrum leaped up and captured imaginations and expanded horizons. <br/><br/>By the 1960's AM radio was a homogenious morass of largely mediocre programming. Relatively few people had FM receivers and FM radio stations were relatively few and far between, so you pretty much listened to what was on AM or you didn't listen at all. <br/><br/>Then, in the mid to late 1960s, guys like Jonathan Schwartz on WNEW FM in New York City started playing eclectic but carefully-chosen music and put out programming of a kind that you just can't get on the radio any more. It wasn't long before the iron heels of the program directors homogenized the airwaves and turned FM into the stereo version of AM that continues through to today. But, for a short time, there was a renaissance on the airwaves. <br/><br/>Podcasting brings back a little bit of what it was like during those pioneering years. It's as though your radio dial has grown by thousands of stations and, if you look, you can find places in the podsphere that are as eclectic, entertaining, and inspiring as the airwaves were in the late 1960s. <br/><br/>All of which is by way of introduction of what you're about to hear. <br/><br/>This, by very special permission, is The Ballad of the Sandman by Mike Agranoff. Mike is a folk musician from New Jersey who plays a mean fingerstyle guitar, concertina, banjo, and ragtime piano and sings. I have seen him live at a library, in a church basement, and in a community center and he is the consummate journeyman purveyor of melodies, spoken word, and traditions new and old. <br/><br/>I heard this piece for the first time in 1998 or so on public radio in Detroit. Mike has been kind enough to perform this at every show that I have attended. He does it entirely from memory and with a conviction that puts you in the darkened studio of the narrator. <br/><br/>The airing of this piece around the end of the year has become a tradition on WION in Ionia, Michigan, where this podcast also airs as a radio show. And it's always a part of my listening around the same time. I hope that you will adopt it as your own as well. <br/><br/>So, without further ado, let's let the podsphere pay tribute to the magic of the radio - Magic that once was and magic that can be again. <br/><br/>Here's Mike Agranoff with <em>The Ballad of the Sandman</em>. <br/><br/>[Audio] <br/><br/><br/>The Ballad of the Sandman, (c) by Mike Agranoff.

If you have an audio input to the intercom in the aircraft you fly or otherwise have a means of listening to music while you fly here's some music that you should consider adding to your playlist.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that safety comes first. If the music results in any chance of discraction or a miscommunication or failure to give or receive a communication necessary for the safety of the flight, leave your music player at home. But if you can manage the volume of the player, not have to fumble with it when your should be doing other things (playlists are helpful here), and satisfy yourself as pilot in command that you can hear and be heard in the cockpit and at the controller's workstation (such as by using a squelch or cutout feature like I use), by all means add a soundtrack to your flight.<br/><br/>Here's what has been in my iPod while I fly.<br/><br/>Eric Johnson has a way with the Fender Statocaster that is unlike that of any other player. He's melodic and heavily jazz-influenced. Music from his <em>Ah Via Musicom</em> and <em>Venus Isle</em> albums got lots of airplay in the 1990s and he has toured with the likes of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani and recently hit the road with Sammy Hagar. This is <em>All About You</em> from <em>Venus Isle</em>. Note the arpeggios and underlying drive. Really good for high airwork.<br/><br/>[Audio]<br/><br/>(Buy Eric Johnson albums, DVDs, and other stuff at <a href="http://theconnextion.com/ericjohnson_index.cfm?ArtistID=175"><font color="#666666">http://theconnextion.com/ericjohnson_index.cfm?ArtistID=175</font></a>.)<br/><br/>I'd be really surprised if composer and conductor John Williams isn't a pilot. I promised myself that I would use the word &quot;evocative&quot; only once in this episode, and this is it. I put this on one of the first flight mixes I ever made and it was one of the first tunes that jumped off the CD player and became a soundtrack for what I was doing at the time. It was on short final at Lapeer in southeast Michigan. Nothing quite like Williams to swell up when you're locked in to approach and have your attitude and airspeed nailed.<br/><br/>This is, of course, <em>Flying</em> from <em>E.T., The Extraterrestrial</em>. Those who fly aircraft with yokes instead of sticks will have an easier time imagining that they're holding on to bicycle handlebars, but both should avoid the temptation to strap a milk craft to the cowling for your little buddy to ride in.<br/><br/>This version comes from John Williams and the Boston Pops Orchestra's album, <em>The Classis Spielberg Scores.</em><br/><br/>[Audio]<br/><br/>(Buy the album at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Williams-Classic-Spielberg-Scores/dp/B000002C0F/sr=8-1/qid=1165705583/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-4775352-7547032?ie=UTF8&s=music"><font color="#666666">http://www.amazon.com/Williams-Classic-Spielberg-Scores/dp/B000002C0F/sr=8-1/qid=1165705583/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-4775352-7547032?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music</font></a>).<br/><br/>No playlist is complete without some heavy metal. And there's none heavier than Iron Maiden. This is <em>Aces High</em> from 1984's <em>Powerslave. </em>Great driving metal groove and lyrics that tell a story of aerial combat in World War II.<br/><br/>[Audio]<br/><br/>(Buy the album at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Powerslave-Iron-Maiden/dp/B000063DFN/sr=1-5/qid=1165706163/ref=sr_1_5/103-4775352-7547032?ie=UTF8&s=music"><font color="#666666">http://www.amazon.com/Powerslave-Iron-Maiden/dp/B000063DFN/sr=1-5/qid=1165706163/ref=sr_1_5/103-4775352-7547032?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music</font></a>).<br/><br/>Unless you count the diggery-doo, the English accordion, or the great highland bagpipes, there is probably no more technically ungainly instrument than the bassoon. It's four or five feet tall and has a double-reed that begs to sqwawk and evade the player's efforts to control it. There's an old joke that the definition of an optimist is a bassoon player with a pager.<br/><br/>Well, if there's one guy who can carry both a bassoon and a pager with confidence. He's Paul Hanson. Paul has taken the bassoon into jazz and other circles with amazing aplomb. He can out-sasxophone a saxophone and it all sounds completely organic. Ever run into one of those phases in your training when the controls seem to defy you, nothing goes the way it's supposed to, and you're constantly behind the aircraft? Usually right before you solo or right before get the hang of the landing flare or just before you start to nail your instrument approaches? This one is for you, my brothers and sisters.<br/><br/>Let Paul remind you of what can happen with even the most ungainly of hardware if you train hard and believe that the music will come. This is <em>The Gold Coast</em> from <em>Voodoo Suite.</em> It's in 7/4 and he's playing a bassoon and yet it sounds great. Yeah, your first full-procedure VOR approach is going to be ugly, but that's okay.

When Sony went looking for a great song to use in its ads celebrading the 20th anniversary of the compact disc, it looked no further than Joe Satriani's <em>Summer Song</em> from his album, <em>The Extremist.</em> This is great music for whatever you want to do while listening to it. It has energized me in the wee hours studying for exams and it has caused more than a few oscillations over the speed limit out on the highway. Now I'm no A&amp;P and this is largely unscientific, but I'll bet that, if you plug <em>Summer Song </em>into the intercom of your aircraft, you'll get two or three additional knots of airspeed.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We all love those gorgeous air-to-air photos of aircraft that grace the covers and the insides of our favorite flight magazines. We even like the ones in the ads. Sometimes especially the ads. Ever wonder who shoots those pictures or how they do it?<br/><br/>Enter ace aviation photographer Dave Higdon.<br/><br/>Dave has been a working journalist for more than 25 years and currently freelances for a number of media outlets. His magazine work lands his images on several covers each year and on ever more advertising pages. He is an accomplished pilot with almost 5,000 hours flown in a variety of aircraft, including hang gliders, ultralights, and light-sport aircraft, as well as general aviation aircraft ranging from piston singles to light business jets.<br/><br/>He is the president and creative director of PhotoProse Productions in Withita, Kansas. He is also a regular part of the panel on Uncontrolled Airspace, a relatively new entry to the podsphere that just hit its sixth episode and is one of the best hangar-flying shows out there.</p>
