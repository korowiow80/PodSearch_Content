<itunes:summary>
5 Questions is an interactive podcast quiz show. Each week we post 5 questions to our website and encourage our listeners to answer them through e-mail, skype, audio comments, or by calling our listener hotline. On Thursday we will compile the best answers to the questions into a show for podcasting on Friday. We also include a guest on every show and allow our listeners to be stars themselves.

<title>Semi-Permanent Hiatus</title>
<itunes:subtitle>Semi-Permanent Hiatus</itunes:subtitle>
<description>The last set of questions came out in May and it&apos;s now August. If you haven&apos;t guessed it by now my focus on 5 Questions as a show is pretty much shot. After 2 years and marginal success my focus is more on projects that are shorter term and less of an overwhelming experience for me. 5 Questions was a project where I did everything from content creation to engineering to publishing to marketing and that takes a toll on a person. 

One thing that has been great is the audience. Your answers have shocked and surprised me. Your participation helped to make this show great. While there will be episodes in the future, they will be fewer and far between on no set schedule. I have some answers for the last set and still need audio files but I don&apos;t know when it will be coming out. 

Thank you for your continued support of the show and dealing with all of my delays. A new show will come out, I just don;t know when. Until then feel free to check out my other project 365 Tao or catch me from time to time as a contributor on GuildCast</description>

<itunes:subtitle>Questions for Show 53 on April 30th, 2007</itunes:subtitle>
<description>A bit of a NYC theme today with some Mashups and questions. Announcing the new site  

To answer the questions, use our answers form leave a message at our Skype number at fivequestions or e-mail us an MP3 file to comments@5questions.net. Call our hotline at 206-350-0261. If you call the listener hotline, send an MP3 or Skype, make sure to leave your name and location if you want it used on the show. 


What is your best Scrabble word?
Would you attend a party with many fascinating people you have never met if you had to attend alone?
Is it the language that someone speaks or the culture in which someone lives that influences their viewpoint the most?
If you were to add a 13th month into the year, where would you put it and what would you call it?
Would you take 5 months off to travel the world if you only had a 50/50 chance of being employed when you got back?


Remember that creativity when answering the questions counts. Creative answers are more likely to get you on the show.

Don&apos;t forget to leave a review in iTunes, vote at Podcast Alley, or stop by and say hi when I am presenting at PodcampNYC next weekend.

What villain from literature or history do you relate to the most?
Is society overtly obsessed with celebrities?
Dogs or Cats and Why?
What gift would you like to receive for the holidays? (Must be something tangible)
If you could name a planet, what would you name it and why?

<title>Why there are so many delays</title>
<itunes:subtitle>Why there are so many delays</itunes:subtitle>
<description>Well, we definately didn&apos;t plan on only doing one show a month but that is how this year seems to be shaping up. There are many reasons for the delay which I wanted to let you all know about. 

First, I am building a new office in the house which has sucked down a lot of my time. When I say building, I mean put up walls, wire for power and network, insulate, put up drywall, mud and tape the walls, paint (where we are now), arrange and rebuild studio, empty boxes, then hopefully be done. The reason for this to take priority has to do with the weather. It&apos;s starting to turn cold in the north so I needed a completed office with heat to just be able to work. 

Second, a different audio project has taken up some of my time. We are still looking for voice talent on that so if you are interested, drop me a line through comments. 

Third, the holiday season is right around the corner in the US and I am just getting run down. The company has taken on some good new contracts which meand more money for Christmas gifts as well as 100 and 1 things to be done for the new year. 

I sincerely apologize for the delay and new shows are on tap for the near future. We will hit our podcasting stride again. </description>
