The number seven is a symbol of completeness, just as Creation was completed in seven days. Each of the qualities listed here is representative of a type of quality and there are seven types altogether. All other good qualities are included in these seven types or are similar to them.

That&#8217;s why He applauded the initiative of those individuals from the Children of Israel who could not bring the Passover offering on its appointed date, and established the &#8220;minor&#8221; festival of the Second Passover, which comes out this year this Sunday, May 6th. Those people just wouldn&#8217;t be denied the opportunity of proving their mettle and coming close to G-d, which is exactly how we feel about the State of Israel! However, as in this week&#8217;s Torah portion of <em>Emor</em>, there will always be those who blaspheme, and doubt that G-d even cares about this world &#8211; the worst blasphemy of all. Tune into this week&#8217;s Temple Talk as Yitzchak Reuven and Rabbi Richman connect the dots and find a Divine recipe for living life to its fullest in this week&#8217;s Torah portion!</p><p><strong><br

Shining Like the Menorah in Parashat Emor: A Recipe for Living with G-d
Who believes in second chances? Evidently, Hashem does! That&#8217;s why He applauded the initiative of those individuals from the Children of Israel who could not bring the Passover offering on its appointed date, and established the &#8220;minor&#8221; festival of the Second Passover, which comes out this year this Sunday, May 6th. Those people just wouldn&#8217;t be denied the opportunity of proving their mettle and coming close to G-d, which is exactly how we feel about the State of Israel! However, as in this week&#8217;s Torah portion of Emor, there will always be those who blaspheme, and doubt that G-d even cares about this world &#8211; the worst blasphemy of all. Tune into this week&#8217;s Temple Talk as Yitzchak Reuven and Rabbi Richman connect the dots and find a Divine recipe for living life to its fullest in this week&#8217;s Torah portion!Temple Institute Links:
