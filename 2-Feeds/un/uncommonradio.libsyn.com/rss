            <link><![CDATA[http://uncommonradio.libsyn.com/uncommon-radio-31-interview-with-yesh-aka-yeshua-da-poed-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On this special episode of Uncommon Radio Nasa sits down for a one on one interview with Yesh aka Yeshua DaPoed.&nbsp; The episode recaps Yesh's career from the recording process of Siah &amp; Yeshua's classic "Visualz EP" on Fondle Em Records all the way up to Yesh's current projects.&nbsp; In between they talk about the 90's NYC Indie Scene, the legendary Braggin Writes battles, what happened to Siah, Yesh's solo career, travelling to Europe and the West Coast, Yesh's outlook on music today and much more.&nbsp; The episode ends with a breakdown of exactly how the classic "A Day Like Any Other" was created.&nbsp; The run time is 2 full hours and we played lots of music as well including rarely heard tracks from the 90's and a brand new track from Yesh, produced by Soze, that's never been heard before and still not even fully mixed.&nbsp; Here's a tracklist of what we played during the episode:</p>
<p>1 - Gravity - Siah &amp; Yeshua DaPoed (1996)</p>
<p>2 - The Visualz - Siah &amp; Yeshua DaPoed (1996)</p>

<p>10 - Sinister - Aesop Rock, Vast Aire &amp; Yeshua DaPoed (2000)</p>
<p>11 - Lucky 7 - Ace Lover feat. A.L., Lil Sci, Pumpkinhead, Wordsworth, Vast Aire &amp; Yeshua Da Poed (2000)</p>
<p>12 - Catch That Feeling (Exclusive Unreleased New Track)</p>
<p>13 - A Day Like Any Other - Siah &amp; Yeshua DaPoed (1996)</p>
<p>Many of the tracks above can be bought on the highly suggested re-issue, titled "<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-visualz-anthology/id321882716">The Visualz Anthology</a>"</p>
<p>Also be sure to check out Yesh on <a href="http://twitter.com/ClassicYESH">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://classicyesh.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> as well.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode Nasa sat down with Aeon Grey for an in depth interview.&nbsp; Aeon Grey is the Producer behind Maxilla Blue and Co-Owner of Central-Standard Records as well as being a solo artist.&nbsp; Listeners to Uncommon Radio have heard Maxilla and Aeon tracks already in rotation.&nbsp; Since Aeon is originally from Des Moines, IA this gave us a great opportunity to delve deep into the Midwest Hip-Hop scene and the way it works.&nbsp; We, of course got into releases and the creation process for Aeon and his recent move to the Bay Area in California.&nbsp; We played tracks from the artist for this episode including some unreleased music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - Vision Twunny Twunny - Maxilla Blue</p>
<p>2 - Shovel Kids - Maxilla Blue</p>
<p>3 - Mad Galactus - Maxilla Blue</p>
<p>4 - Moms &amp; Meth - Aeon Grey</p>
<p>5 - Of All Evil - Aeon Grey</p>
<p>6 - EasyFlowBadFlowIntheWater - Maxilla Blue</p>
<p>7 - Art of Selection - Maxilla Blue</p>
<p>8 - Live Stock - Aeon Grey (Unreleased)</p>
<p>9 - Madness - Aeon Grey (Unreleased)</p>
<p>10 - Dead Meat - Aeon Grey (Unreleased)</p>
<p>All beats played during the show were Produced by Aeon Grey.</p>
<p>*Note - After the recording of this episode we discovered that all the Aeon Grey tracks are pitched down because of a conversion issue.&nbsp; The interview and Maxilla Blue tracks are all fine.&nbsp; Sorry about the inconvenience, the songs are still remarkably enjoyable and this gives you an excuse to head on over to www.central-standard.com and make some purchases to get the official copies.</p>

			<title>Uncommon Radio #16 (95-97 NYC Indie Hip-Hop Tribute)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/uncommonradio/Uncommon_Radio_16.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode #16 is a very special one for Uncommon Radio.&nbsp; Nasa &amp; Cirrus did a retrospective on the mid 90's indie hip-hop scene in NYC.&nbsp; They featured tracks from only the earliest period of 1995-1997.&nbsp; Not only did the guys play tracks, but also tried to give some history and context to that era in hip-hop for those that weren't there or that are too young to have experienced it as it was taking place.&nbsp; The attempt was to create a historical record of the vital records and people of that movement, and to share some personal stories from two guys that were fans throughout that time taking part in the scene, later becoming members of it.</p>
<p>As is explained on the show, we didn't want to jock or slight anyone in the compiling this episode.&nbsp; Even though this episode ran over 100 minutes, there were many other tracks that we wanted to have as part of this and we could have told many other stories from that time.&nbsp; We felt that in 2010, the context of that scene in NYC was becoming lost in the shuffle as more and more things change about underground hip-hop over the years and wanted to put our narrative out there.</p>
<p>Please check out the "Uncommon Radio #16 Addendum" at www.uncommonmusic.net/theprogblog.&nbsp; You can find some Youtube streams of tracks that we couldn't fit in, some bonus tracks and original show flyers from that era from Nasa's collection.&nbsp; Here's the tracklist:</p>
<p>1- Braggin' Writes by J-Live on Rawshack Records</p>
<p>2- Legacy by Non-Phixion on Serchlite Music</p>
<p>3- How the Fuck You Get a Deal? by The Cenobites on Fondle Em Records</p>
<p>4- 8 Steps to Perfection by Company Flow on Official Recordings</p>
<p>5- The Session by The Arsonists on Fondle Em Records</p>
<p>6- Negro League Baseball by Natural Resource on ???</p>
<p>7- Hey! by MF Doom on Fondle Em Records</p>
<p>8- Radiohead by Cage on Fondle Em Records</p>
<p>9- So Intellegent by Sir Menelik feat. Kool Keith on Rawkus Records</p>
<p>10- Da Vizuals by Siah &amp; Yeshua DaPoed on Fondle Em Records</p>
<p>11- Dynamic by Pumpkinhead on Makin Records</p>
<p>12- Fires In Which You Burn Slow by Indelibles on Official/Rawkus Records</p>
<p>The Instrumentals we played in order of appearance were:</p>
<p>"Tried by 12" by East Flatbush Project feat. DeS</p>
<p>"Repetition" by Siah</p>
<p>"Alcoholic Vibes" by Lord Sear</p><p>Subscribe on Itunes:  http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/uncommon-radio/id251561695</p>]]></description>
