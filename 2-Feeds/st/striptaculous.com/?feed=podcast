		<itunes:summary>West Palm Beach, FL- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News – In this sun and fun episode of the “Tales From Tony Batman” Show, we tell you all about our weekend in South Florida where we partied it up a little too much at the West Palm Beach Sunfest. Who else listening to this is old enough to party with the “Foreigner” Band?
We talk about our call to duty, Jury Duty that is. Since we have a house in Tampa Bay Florida we got on the list for the great civic duty of being a Juror of someones peers. The problem is we just don’t fit into an good categories of peers. You have to listen to our experience at the Pinellas County Florida courthouse and how we scared all of our fans with our check in on the FourSquare app…….
We tell you about our Cinco De Mayo in South Florida and how we tried not to drink alcohol that day, but ended up at a Mexican Cantina, also known as Rocco’s Tacos. We then grill the staff at the Mexican Restaurant about the history of Cinco De Mayo and how American it really is…..
We tell you about hanging out at Aaron Wells house for the rest of the weekend and then we get into our time at the West Palm Beach Sunfest. We  got to go VIP in the back door with our friends Jared and Sethand how we were turned on to the Jewish musician Matisyahu. We did roam around the Sunfest where Snoop Dogg, Pittbull, The Frey, and Foreigner all played that same night… Let’s not forget about Girl Talk…. Who were pretty bad ass as well…. Listen to what happened there….
We talk again about our American Idol obsession and how we think that Joshua Ledett could be the next Al Green – James Brown of the music industry. We don’t care for Phillip Phillips but we think he will probably win….
We also tell you our personal story about super model Kate Upton, and then we talk about that Cat Daddy video and how everyone is trying to copy the video…. A must listen… Kind of….
We tell you about our next upcoming events, we are hosting the Skindustry Productions “Stripperpalooza 5? at the Angels Club in Kalamazoo, Michigan and then we are off to Atlanta for the 2012 Exotic Dancer National Championships at the Pink Pony Club…..

		<itunes:summary>Chicago, IL- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News – In this episode of the nationally traveling “Tales From Tony Batman” Show we tell the entire story about our experience as one of the co hosts of the famedChicago Sexcon Show, a one night balls to the wall adult party that is held at the Excalibur Night Club in Downtown Chicago.
We talk about co hosting the show with one of it’s founders, and owner of the Born A Babe website, Larry Goone,(Larry even comes on the show), and the beautiful adult star turned mainstream actress Angelina Armani. We can tell you this, it was a night to remember, and we already can not wait for next years Sexcon.
We tell you about the Skindustry Productions booth and how popular the pole dancers were during the Sexcon show. The worlds most famous pole dancer, Pantera Blacksmith was there with us and she had the crowd in a roar, Feature Mina Harker also was a show stopper, and  we also got to hang with Sarah from the On The Borer Club, who as you will hear on the show, hypnotized us all night long with the way she made us stare at her butt.. Sure, play on our addictions……
We tell you about the 3 stages we were performing on throughout the night and how, as we were hosting the famed Screaming O Stage Show, the crowd sort of overran us and it turned into a wild, crazy, stripper fest each time.. You have to hear how crazy it was, we were just not prepared for that kind of action, but we can admit that we really, really liked it…..
We give thanks to the people at the Lovers Playground who also had a booth at the Sexcon show,for helping us out. And our peeps from the Nudes A Poppin Festival also came to hang out during the show.
Maybe the funniest part of the show was when we started talking about how we tried to find the huge Marlyn Monroe statue in Downtown Chicago, and we got lost under a series of bridges. We thought we might die, or at the least get stuck in an underwater tunnel, thank goodness we were able to be lost on Wacker Street….. You have to hear it to even believe it….
During the break we give you some old school break beat dance music, mixed and produced by our friends at Rage Media Studios…. You have to check them out
Of course we went to eat at Gino’s Pizza, how could you be in Chicago and not eat a good pizza. The funny stuff started when Brian from Skindustry, drove us to this Mexican place next to a Blues Club at 4am. Listen to how we now really wish we knew how to speak Spanish, and we tell you why Brian wished he did to…
Then at the end there was the invisible train station, Curtis and his HoJo Hotel and how we almost did not make it to the airport, in Milwaukee… Yes in Milwaukee…
There a ton more in the show but we just can’t remember it all, so just listen to it….
We preview our next trips, one to Florida where we have a day of jury duty, then were heading the the West Palm Beach Sunfest, and then it will be time to head to Kalamazoo Michigan  for the “Stripperpalooza 5? at the Angel’s Gentlemens Club..

		<itunes:summary>Milwaukee, WI- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News – In this up and down episode of the crazy “Tales From Tony Batman” Radio Show we give you all the inside scoops and stories from our time in Franklin Wisconsin hosting the Skindustry Productions “Vertical Pole Showdown 2? at the On The BorderGentlemens Club.
Of course we go on and on and on about the most famous pole dancer in the world, Pantera Blacksmithbecause we got to work with her at the Vertical Pole Showdown 2. We were very impressed with her stage show and her crowd interaction during the show.  We learned a lot from being around her, and the Skindustry Pole Coordinator, Kim Anderson who runs a Fitness Pole Studio herself called Metamorphosis Arts
Look were not in romantically involved with Brian from Skindustry Production, we just think he does one hell of a job running a smooth event, so get off my back people…LOL
We give thanks to Di Carlo Italian Restaurant, or you might call it, Trattoria di Carlo and the Silk Exotic Club in Milwaukee for all their hospitality they gave us on our off day between the Vertical Pole Showdown 2 and the Chicago Sexcon. We had a great day off in between gigs away from home.
Then we get into a long, tall, and deep discussion about the difference between a Fitness Pole Dancer and a Stripper Pole Dancer, and we also ask, why can’t we all just be the same and go for the love of the show?..
We then tell a little story about Cassandra Jane and her Bring Back The Showgirl Burlesque Tour that we have been covering since it started in Australia. And then how we have been asked by some smaller but snippy, burlesque troupes not to cover them because they did not want to be associated with anything adult. We tried a couple of times to explain that the A Entertainment News was formed to bring the people the news of ALL sexy entertainment. But to no avail, some people who are doing things that were started in the adult industry, are discriminating against that very industry.Thats alright by us, we will just tell our 4 million readers some people just don’t like them…..
We tell about how there is some of that same discrimination in the Pole Dancing world, you have to hear what the end result of the rant was…
UPDATE: We asked the Striptaculous crew to go and cover the upcoming Pole Dancing Convention in Los Angeles and they were told ” We Are Sorry but we can not approve your request, we can not be associated with any adult industry people” Are you kidding me?… Where did that dance pole come from again?….
We tell you all about the shows, the winners and all the things that happened on stage.. But of course you have to listen to the show for all that…  The name Schevelle comes to mind though, and we had a Gooch sighting as well…..
We did not have time to tell you about the Chicago Sexcon so we have an entire show dedicated to that crazy one night show coming for you in just a few days…

		<itunes:summary>Tampa, FL- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News – In this latest episode of the nationwide phenomenon that is the “Tales From Tony Batman” Show we take you back stage telling you all about the Screaming O Stage Show that we hosted at Thee Dollhouse in Tampa Florida with out sexy co host Lelu Love.
When Jason from Honey Hole Entertainment brought up the idea to do the Screaming O Show at Thee Dollhouse, we were ecstatic because coming from the Tampa Bay area originally we have always loved Thee Dollhouse, but have never done a show there before. Then when we got Lelu Love to co host with us, it was a lock that we were going to have a great time.
We also get in on the Friday the 13th hoopla by asking some very astronomical questions to our producer Jim, just to see if he may have been abducted by cosmic aliens and replaced with a drone.
We hand out our condolences to the friends and family of our ex roommate in Los Angels, Sledge Hammer, who was killed by LAPD during an incident. We then do the same thing for television and radio legend Dick Clark.
We might be going to the Republican National Convention this August in Tampa and that brought to mind the Secret Service Scandal that has been in the news.. What out of the country service people are partaking in that countries fruits, such as prostitutes?  Well this is probably the first time thats ever happened in history…. NOT… Hear what we find out on the show.
We get all in to the Screaming O Show we did at Thee Dollhouse in Tampa Florida and how our girl Lelu Love was a great co host, Jason and Honey Hole Entertainment News did a great job promoting it and the staff at Thee Dollhouse made us feel, really …um comfortable… LOL (Hear the dirt in the show)
We get the sexy Lelu Love on the show and she tells the story about how during the blow job contest on stage, one of the females dropped the penis out of her mouth and it broke into pieces, then hear Lelu tell us how Jason dropped a penis on the floor as well… You have to hear this one…
We preview our next couple of shows which will be in Milwaukee Wisconsin where we will host the Skindustry Productions “Vertical Pole Showdown 2? and then we are off to Downtown Chicago to co host the crazy Chicago Sexcon Party.
A show packed with funny talk, goofy stories and tons of entertainment information

		<itunes:summary>Topeka, KS – Tony Batman’s  A Entertainment News – In this silliest episode of the stupid Tales From Tony Batman Show we take you into the rabbit hole that is April 1st… Why is it ok to tell a bunch of lies on this day and how deep does the rabbit hole go?
We ask to go to see the NCAA Basketball National Championship, but we fly to Kansas instead of New Orleans so we call our ticket broker to complain… Sure its funny but not really!
We tell you about our next mainstream movie we are acting in at the end of the year. It is a scandalous tale of an alligator farm owner and his gator trainer that betrays him only to end up like dead meat after being stranded in the swamp on a bright moonlit night.
We tell you about the new fitness craze that is designed to take the place of the popular Zumba Fitness Class at the gyms and studios around the country. We called it “Crunkersize” and you don’t even have to pull your pants up to do it…
We go all “Brian” from Family Guy while talking about the group that is protesting the use of the “Angry Birds” game claiming animal abuse.  listen to the word “Thwart” why does that word come out of your mouth that way?
We give you a little peek into how the premiere of the Girls Gone Dead movie went in Miami and how by the end of the night we ended up lost in space eating a nasty Checkers cheeseburger …
We can NOT verify the truth or Fib of this show or anything in this one, we were participating in April Fools Day but we may have done it all wrong.. You will have to listen to find out…
We preview our big Screaming O Club show and contest at Thee Dollhouse in Tampa Florida and the upcoming Vertical Pole Showdown 2 at the On The Border Club near Milwaukee, WI, and the 2012 Chicago Sexcon that same week, both of which we are hosting

		<itunes:summary>Atlanta, GA- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News- In this latest episode of the nationally syndicated Tales From Tony Batman Show we ask “Is going to a strip club cheating?” Is is bad for your religion to just go in and watch exotic dancers? Would New York Jets back up quarterback Tim Tebow accept the offer from theRick’s Cabaret New York? Listen to the show and hear what was said.
We also give you the lowdown on the big mega ball lottery and how the winning numbers may say something about the Untied States as a whole today.
We talk about the merger of the SAG and AFTRA merger and how this will affect actors, radio personalities and maybe even IPTV actors, what about podcast shows? Will those people be eligible for the new union?
We touch on some funny videos that have surfaced, especially the drunk driver singing the full version of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody. Hear some of the clip right here on the show.
We preview our big Screaming O Club show and contest at Thee Dollhouse in Tampa Florida and the upcoming Vertical Pole Showdown 2 at the On The Border Club near Milwaukee, WI, and the 2012 Chicago Sexcon that same week, both of which we are hosting

		<itunes:summary>Rome, GA- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News- In this episode of the “Keepin It Real” Tales from Tony Batman Show we talk about a few things that happened this past week that made us just want to quit the entertainment industry and get a job making donuts for a living.
We talk about a club that pulled a fast one and tried to do their Screaming O Contest after tell us they want us to come to town and do it, then changing the game in midstream and figuring they don’t really need the official show.
We compare the Entertainment Industry to the auto industry and the fast food business, its almost scary how similar every one tries to be to attract customers.
Listen to our story about our one day trip from North Georgia to Tampa Bay, and how we let the Georgia Girl come with us to a different area of the country, a blatant violation of out One Girl Per City traveling rule.
We preview the big premiere of the mainstream movie “Girls Gone Dead” that we had a part in, opposite Jerry “The King” Lawler, Ron Jeremy, Sal the Stockbroker and Beetle Juice from the Howard Stern Show, Janessa Brazil, Katie Peterson and a bunch of full time actors. We set up the after party with Sal and ourselves at the world famous Tootsies Cabaret.
We give you a little insight on out plans to open a string or donut shops in the South East and why our holes will taste better than any other ones being eaten today. Then we go into some fun ideas about what our slogans should be…
We then tell you about all the spicy slogans we came up with for the Wendy’s Restaurants and how we think have a big piece of Cod on a bun is pretty funny stuff.
We do the research for you and find out why the urban legends started about White and Yellow lightersbeing bad luck. We got the dirt for you, just listen to the show…
Finally we tell you about our upcoming shows, the next one being The Girls Gone Dead Premiere in Miami, then we have a Screaming O Club Show at The Dollhouse in Tampa, then its off to Milwaukee for theSkindustry “VPS2?, and then from there were off to Chicago to host the wild and crazy “Chicago Sexcon”show.

		<itunes:summary>Rome, GA- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News- In this Mash-Up episode of the informative Tales From Tony Batman Show we tell you about a week that drove us to sing, Nobody Knows our sorrow up in here. A story of deceit, backstabbing and noogies.
We start by giving you a little background on St Patrick’s Day and then we ask how you like to celebrate it?… Drinking, Eating, Fighting and all those traditional fun activities…
We try to figure out just what the “Hunger Games” are and how all of a sudden they got so popular when in the real non public relations world the books have been out for a long time and millions of people did not read them…
Why are restaurants in the Southern United States “stealing” cheese curds from the good people of Wisconsin, we think its just wrong and we tell you what we have come across on our travels.
We then tell you about a club that booked a world famous Screaming O Club show, canceled it and then put on their own shallow, half assed version by themselves the same night we were suppose to be there..
We tell you all about some of the latest cool commercials on television and how some very, very good music is playing in the background. The A Entertainment News crew went back and posted the full songs on the site along side a copy of the commercial advertisement, you should really listen….
We tell you about our big mainstream movie premiere for the “Girls Gone Dead” movie where we had a good 10 seconds of screen time, Maybe more but we were in costume and can’t tell you, you have to watch it to see for yourself. We also talk about co hosting the after party with Sal the Stockbroker of the Howard Stern Show at the world famous Tootsies Cabaret in Miami Florida.
We profess our love for the television show “The Shark Tank” and we wonder why its not on as many time as America Idol during the week and why on Friday night while most people are getting ready to go party…. We then prepare to sell the “A Entertainment News” to the sharks, “We are here to offer you a 20% share in my company for …….

		<itunes:summary>Tempe, AZ- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News- In this latest episode of the circus like, traveling radio show we tell you all about out time in Phoenix-Tempe, Arizona where we hosted the Arizona Porn Star Ball for the people at Coolin Out Entertainment.
We touch on the Rush Limbaugh “Slut” scandal and then go into the Southern California protesters who are ll up in arms about the new Carl’s JR/Hardee’s commercial featuring our friend and super model Kate Upton. Apparently she is too sexy to sell hamburgers on television, but the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover was acceptable.
We have a little discussion about super Tuesday and how Ron Paul has no chance, which makes us like him even more. How is Newt Gingrich winning votes? Listen to the show…..
We tell you about our time hosting the 5th Annual Arizona Porn Star Ball and how the Hip Hop stars seemed to have more fans than the porn stars at the event, or we could be wrong…..
Dylan Ryder, Taryn Thomas, Joslyn James, Priya Rai, Nikki Delano, Kayla Carrera, Raylene, Yurizan Beltran, Emy Reyes were all there but the stage was occupied with live music both nights and the people really came out to see with Kool Keith, Pittsburgh Slim, Dirt Nasty, The Beatnuts, Riff Raff, Gentlemen Ether and a cool dude named simply Herman.
We had our Screaming O Show all ready to go, and we must have given away hundreds of Screaming O condom packs from the stage, we think the safe sex message is strong in the Phoenix area.
We reminisce about when ephedrine was legal and how we bought cases of it at the Vitamin store and would stay up for days, and now we only feel slightly affected by our years or speeding around…
We talk about the upcoming premiere of the horror movie “Girls Gone Dead” which we had a role in along with several other “Mainstream Actors”, some of which include Jerry “The King” Lawler, Ron Jeremy, Sal and Beetle from the Howard Stern Show and many more….

		<itunes:summary>Elberton, Georgia, USA- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News – This very important episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show tells many stories but one of them may be the most important story of the year. Our trip to North East Georgia to visit the “Georgia Guidstones”, which are sometimes referred to as the “American Stonehenge” may have given us the enlightenment and knowledge we need to know to survive December 21, 2012. Want to know what we found there? Listen to the show…..
We tell you about the “strange” forces that could have prevented us from us making the trip to the cow field in the middle of nowhere to see the stones of the “Age of Reason”…. BTW- Listen to the story of our new friends we made at the pasture…..
We get going on Talent Agents, Booking Agents, Feature Dance Agents and how things are getting a bit strange in the industry, or how they have been the whole time and we just started to notice….
We tell a story about the Rick’s Cabaret New York Gentlemens Club and how they caught “LinSanity”(Which is already over) and how we think they are good luck for New York Sports teams…
We preview our trip to Arizona for the 5th Annual Arizona Porn Star Ball in Tempe and how we wonder how it will go with all the different types of entertainment coming to the show…
We talk about the upcoming premiere of the horror movie “Girls Gone Dead” which we had a role in along with several other “Mainstream Actors”, some of which include Jerry “The King” Lawler, Ron Jeremy, Sal and Beatle from the Howard Stern Show and many more….
Where you aware that we are just about related to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Cover Model and Hardee’s/ Carl’s JR Sexy commercial star Kate Upton… Listen to our story on that one and remember Kevin Bacon has his own game……

		<itunes:summary>Milwaukee, WI- Tony Batman’s  A Entertainment News – This episode of the world wide Tales From Tony Batman Show tells all about our weekend in Wisconsin hosting the Skindustry Productions first ever“Vertical Pole Showdown” at the Show Palace Club in Darien, WI which is right on the border of Illinois.
We also talk about how we are starting to send girls we know with crazy stories over to the Jerry Springer Show for them to get on the show. We plan on going on the show as well to tell our Strip Club stories, should be a funny time to say the least..
We tell you our story about our hotel and how sometimes you have to be careful what you ask for because you just might get it. Listen to the show to see why you should always stay at the same hotel that the girls are staying at…
We get into the Vertical Pole Showdown contest, which was the first of many throughout the year put on by the Skindustry Productions people. The Same people that run the Stripperfest and Stripperpalooza contests in the Midwest.
We tell you about all the media that was in Darien Wisconsin, Midwest Nights Magazine, Psycho Babble TV, and how we are writing our article for the Xcitement Magazine in South Florida.
We tell the funny ass story about trying to get the entire crew to the Denny’s for breakfast after the VPS1 show. It was an adventure worthy of its own story, police, drunk girls, closed gas stations in the middle of nowhere, yep there all in there….
We preview our next gig coming up in Phoenix Arizona where we will be hosting the 5th Annual Arizona Porn Star Ball, and then how our next mainstream movie that we were in “Girls Gone Dead” is finally having it’s premiere March 28th in South Beach Florida….
We pat ourselves on the back for helping the Elite Webcam Models website get a ton of traffic and new hot ladies, it’s probably the things they are doing themselves but we like to take credit for some things… LOL

		<itunes:summary>Tampa, FL- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News- In this latest episode of the nationally syndicated “Tales From Tony Batman” show we give you our recap stories from hosting the LeLu Love Feature Dance night at the Bliss Cabaret, and the incredible weekend we had hosting the Digital Playground contract star Bibi Jones weekend at the Gold Club in Tampa Florida. The two events were produced and booked by theHoney Hole Entertainment people.
We also talk about our trip to South Florida for the Super Bowl and how our one night trip turned into a week long adventure.  You have to hear the story about the grand opening of the Iron Lion Fitness Center and the other one about the charity event called “Arti-Bras” to benefit breast cancer awareness.
We go into some more detail about our upcoming Emcee duties at the 5th Annual Arizona Porn Star Ball, and how we are amazed at how many porn stars and hip hop stars have already signed on to perform, dance, sign, appear at this event. Fox News and CBS have already done reports on us, we tell you all about that to…
We give a RIP to the beautiful Whitney Houston and talk about how there are some severe mixed reactions to her death and the memorials that have followed.
We then give you a full understanding on the Skindustry Productions first ever “Vertical Pole Showdown” and how they are gearing it towards the Fitness Pole Industry to make sure both Strip Clubs and Fitness clubs are involved equally. Of course if you are a long time listener of the show you know we talk about us hosting it and how much fun we will be having at the Show Palace Club in Wisconsin ….

		<itunes:summary>Tampa, FL- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News- In this latest episode of the worldwide syndicated “Tales From Tony Batman” Show we bring you the full recap from the Gasparilla Pirate Invasion and Porn Star Nikki Delano’s Feature Dance appearance weekend in the Tampa Bay area…
We tell you all about our weekend with Porn Starlet and super sexy Latino Nikki Delano. We were at two different clubs with her Feature Dance weekend in the Tampa Bay area, The Bliss Cabaret and the Emperors Tampa Club. We had a great time with her and the entire crew from the Honey Hole Entertainment Company, who produced the Nikki Delano appearance.
Now Sarah is the Administrative Assistant and on location wrangler for the Honey Hole Entertainment Company and she just also happen to have an English accent which made me want to hear her say Caulkover and over again… Oh its the little things that amuse us, and then she told us all about “Figging”, the definition is surprising and … Well listen to the show or look it up…
While we were in the Tampa Bay area for the weekend, it just happened to be the Saturday that the Gasparilla Pirate Invasion  was taking place, so of course we went down to the shore to see what that was all about… We still can’t tell you everything but there was lots of wenches with those shirts that push their boobs up to their chins and dirty pirates drinking excessively …. Who would not enjoy that?
We talk about the Super bowl and how we want the  Giants to whip the Patriots and how we would be happy about that… Listen to find out why.
We touch on the Demi Moore alleged drug addiction and how we heard she might be huffing cool whip cans… Really?  Then we talk a little about Don Cornelius and how we watched Soul Train religiously every Saturday afternoon when we were kids…
We tell you about our doctor visit and how maybe, just maybe we might need to slow down on the 7 days a week party, but then again that would not be very Batman of us huh?
We give you a preview of our next couple of gigs, first one being the LeLu Love Feature Dance appearance at the Clearwater Florida Bliss Cabaret and then on to the big Digital Playground Contract Star Bibi Jones appearance at the Tampa Gold Club. And we are getting really excited about hosting the Skindustry Productions “Vertical Pole Showdown” at the Show Palace in Wisconsin and then the Arizona Porn Star Ballin Tempe Arizona….

		<itunes:summary>Clearwater, FL – Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News -  In this technically inept show we fight the powers that be to tell you all about our new contracts we have signed to travel the United States hosting parties and events all year long.
We tell you about our new contract with the Honey Hole Entertainment company and how they have booked 36 weekends with us all in one day.. It was a very tough calender VS eraser day.. Listen to how this all went down and how this is going to work out for the A Entertainment crew. The Honey Hole Entertainment people are based out of Florida and most of the gigs are somewhere in the Sunshine State which makes us happy during the winter months..
We then tell you all about our signing on with the Skindustry People in Wisconsin to be at all of their scheduled events this year which include all the “StripperFests, StripperPaloozas, and Vertical Pole Challenges”. We will be traveling the Midwest throughout the year and will be bringing you some good stories from the events all the way through December, weather permitting. Most of the Skindustry events are hosted in Gentlemens Clubs across the Midwest of the United States.
We tell you all about our upcoming Feature Dance Emcee gig with the sexy Latino porn star Nikki Delano. We are going to be at the Bliss Cabaret and the Tampa Emperors Clubs in the Tampa Bay area and we are even throwing in the annual Gasparilla Pirate Invasion  and what we plan to do there with all the wenches ….
We tell you about this new starlet Molly Bennett that we went crazy for ….
We congratulate Ron Jeremy on his AVN award for Crossover Star of The Year, we think he may be able to get this award every year, but he doesn’t for some reason.
We also tell you some eye witness reports from the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo and Awards show, some good some bad, all funny…. We did not attend the event so all accounts are just here say of course… Umm yea here say…
We tell you a great old story about our first AVN show we attended and the people we met there, some good friends were made that first year.
We go into detail about the 5th Annual Arizona Porn Star Ball, which we are hosting March 3-4 in Tempe Arizona. There are so many people coming we can name them all here, (Look Here for list), it will be held on a block of real estate that includes the hot 910 Live Club in Tempe…
Upcoming Events We are Hosting: Lelu Love @ Bliss Cabaret, Bibi Jones @ Gold Club, Vertical Pole Challenge @Show Palace, Arizona Porn Star Ball, StripperPalooza 5, Exxxotica Miami, Exxxotica Chicago,Nudes A Poppin, Stripperfest 11, Exxxotica New Jersey

		<itunes:summary>Rome, GA- Tony Batman’s A Entertainment News- In this latest episode of the informing “Tales From Tony Batman” show we tell you all about our recent travels in the South East of the United States and how we ended up in Rome Georgia on New Years Eve and Day…
We get into a discussion on the prices of things these days and how traveling to different places in the country can really educate you on the “different” prices of things such as gas, food, drinks….
We go off about how the police sit in waiting on every holiday to pull people over to ask them where they are going, is this really fair? Are they keeping us safer by doing this?
Listen to us talk about the 14 different adult awards shows that are going on in the beginning of the year, websites are now making up their own awards and then putting out press releases when someone wins something. We are about up to HERE with all this awards thing. Which ones are real now and which ones can be fixed to win?
Jim plays a song called “Without You” I never heard it before but I liked it, check the song out atwww.Timminchin.com
We preview our trip we want to take to Las Vegas for the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo which is one week before our first gig under contract with the Honey Hole Entertainment people in Clearwater Florida. Sexy Adult Starlet Nikki Delano will be performing at the Bliss Cabaret and Emperors Tampa January 26-28.
We give props to our sponsors the Screaming O, ,Elite Webcam Models,  2001 Live, AEBN Network,Fountain Of Youth Center, and Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.
And a few of our syndication media outlets such at GTxxxTreme, ABN, Black Pearl Radio, and 32 others…

In this Christmas episode we give you some history on the Holiday Season, a few very funny holiday song renditions as sung by our crew, and we recap our weekend volunteering for the Toyâ€™s For Tataâ€™s Charity in Tampa Florida and our time with adult superstarÂ KatsuniÂ and Honey Hole Entertainment.
We spent an early morning with theÂ Bubba The Love SpongeÂ Show, theÂ 2001 OdysseyÂ Gentlemens Club Crew, and a bunch of very sexy â€œSantaâ€™s Helpersâ€. Our friends Christy Wild, Penthouse Pet Janessa Brazil, and wild rockers ShuTang were all with us during the early morning charity drive to benefit theÂ Toys For TotsFoundationâ€¦Â Read Full Storyâ€¦.. Or just listen to the showâ€¦
We go over our weekend we had with Adult Movie Star Katsuni, with our friend from Honey Hole Entertainment at both theÂ Emperors ClubÂ in Pasco County Florida and at theÂ Gold ClubÂ in Tampa Floridaâ€¦ Good times were had by all for sure , Katsuni is one of the most erotic Feature Dancers we have ever seen and Honey Hole Entertainment really knows how to take care of you at an eventâ€¦ Listen belowâ€¦
Hear all the crazy stories of our adventures and then listen to our after show breakfast story.. We ended up at a Tampa landmark calledÂ â€œPop N Sonsâ€Â and we talked Jason Lange fromÂ Honey Hole EntertainmentÂ into his first cup of coffee in yearsâ€¦ The results are hilariousâ€¦
We then end the show with some Christmas trivia and fun facts you may not know and everyone will love the great Christmas songs sung in the style of the A Entertainment News crew. What does that mean?â€, you will have to listen to know exactly how it wentâ€¦
We wish you a Happy Holidays and a Merry Christmas to that applies to, we hope you have a great day and celebrate safely with family and or friendsâ€¦

		<itunes:summary>Cartersville,GA- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this Pre-holiday episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show, we try to look at the â€œFunnyâ€ of the Holidays with our own versions of the â€œComedyâ€ of Christmas.
All of the characters on the show come up with some sort of comedy skit about the holidays and the funniness of trying to be funny is funnier than the funny of it all, does that make sense?
We tell you about our trip to West Palm Beach Florida and then we tell you we were really inÂ WellingtonÂ but we did not trust you to know that unless you were a big Polo fan or player..
We beg to answer the the age old question, â€œAre Video Games more fun if your really stoned?â€
We talk about out trips to North Georgia and why the hell we keep coming back to one of the most country places we have been to in a long time, ok, maybe everâ€¦.
We tell the story about living in the south during the winter season and and how after a while you just do not want to put pants on anymore, I think they invented â€œWalking Shortâ€™s in South Georgia, SavannahÂ  we think it was, nut donâ€™t quote us in your school papers because were wrong sometimes.
We ask the apocalyptic question about the 12-21-2012 date and how we are scared this will be the last Christmas ever, Do we open presents onÂ  December 20th next year?â€¦ TheÂ Mayans think soâ€¦
We touch on the younger generation and how NO holiday or community event is how is used to be back in the day, give a big shout out to â€œcommercialismâ€
What are your three Christmas wishes?, We all tell ours, wellâ€¦ Sort ofâ€¦
Then we all do our Christmas Holiday skits, Raven reads a cool holiday poem with a twist, Jim throws a tantrum since his story was touched on before he had a chance to talk, and Curtis, well what can we say about Curtis and his comedy skit he had preparedâ€¦. You have to listen to the show to really understand and take it all inâ€¦.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Fountain Of Youth Center, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us
And a few of our syndication media outlets such atÂ GTxxxTreme,Â ABN,Â Black Pearl Radio, and 32 othersâ€¦.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa, FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this eclectic episode of the popularÂ â€œTales From Tony Batmanâ€Â show we take you on a crazy ride through our week in North Georgia, West Palm Beach Florida and in Tampa Bay where we did what might turn out to be our last weekend at the Tampa Deja Vu Gentlemens Club.
We talk about silly commercials and how they have to put all those disclaimers at the bottom of the screen.. Whatâ€™s the point if you have to tell us your lying at the end of your spielâ€¦
After about 10 years this weekend at the Tampa Deja Vu Gentlemens Club might have been our last one as they are doing that we are going in a different direction thing that clubs sometimes do.. Hear what we have to sayâ€¦
Have we gotten to be a really mean emcee? Is it the withdraws from trying to stop smoking the couple of cigarettes a day that we have been smoking?â€¦ We will see what happens next..
What do you think is scarier? Living out in the woods all alone in the silence, or living on a crime ridden block where the police spent a lot of their time?â€¦. We have both and tell you about the latest incidentâ€¦
Tampa Bay Florida Voted the â€œSaddest Cityâ€ to live in, all the beaches, great weather, sunshine and smiles just donâ€™t work for most people there?â€¦ Really? â€¦. Listen to why we like it thereâ€¦
The damn old ass issue comes up againâ€¦. What makes a Porn STAR? Waht makes a Feature Dancer different from a Traveling House Dancer?â€¦. We donâ€™t have a full answer but we do have a big opinion about itâ€¦ Listen to the show..
Is Herman Cain really a horn dog, or did they just make him go away so the next 4 years can be business as usual?
We preview theÂ Toys for Tataâ€™sÂ event were doing and the upcomingÂ KatsuniÂ appearance in the Tampa Bay area with our friends atÂ Honey Hole Entertainmentâ€¦.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us
And a few of our syndication media outlets such atÂ GTxxxTreme,Â ABN,Â Black Pearl Radio, and 32 othersâ€¦.

		<itunes:summary>Savannah,GA- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this post Thanksgiving Holiday episode the Tales From Tony Batman Show tackles the tough subjects about the American Holidays and of course we add in our weekend at the Strip club for extra holiday flavorâ€¦.
We tell you about a straw poll we conducted on Facebook about how much people spent onÂ Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Mondayâ€¦ The answers might surprise you..
We talk about our Thanksgiving day and how we went to a house that did not watch football, if that is at all conceivable, listen the conversation that came upâ€¦.
I reminisce about my big audition for the famed old people channelâ€¦ TheÂ Home Shopping Network.. Itâ€™s a great story on how I almost changed destiny in one long afternoonâ€¦
We talk about our party night in Savannah Georgia and how you can have too many people on the streets at one time, ode to the holiday seasonâ€¦.
We touch onÂ Miley CyrusÂ and her alleged love of pot smoking, we tell some celebrity stories about all the pot smokers we know in the Entertainment Industryâ€¦
Is it possible to prejudice if your repeating rap song lyrics and say the N word?Â  This is a long running debate and we seen the ugly side of it this past weekâ€¦. Oh Myâ€¦.
We spent the weekend at the Tampa Deja Vu Gentlemens Club hosting the weekend Late Night After Party, as always we have stories from our weekendâ€¦.
Spokes People, Hosts, Shills, Pitch Men, Emcee,â€¦.. Want to know why we can make or break your event or show?â€¦. Why people still just donâ€™t get itâ€¦.
Then the question.. Would you buy a huge house in the country or a condo in the city for the same priceâ€¦ We tell you how we are scared of the back woods and whyâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us
And a few of our syndication media outlets such atÂ GTxxxTreme,Â ABN,Â Black Pearl Radio, and 32 othersâ€¦.

		<itunes:summary>Largo,FL-Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this latest episode of the â€œTales From Tony Batmanâ€ show we go off on some of the things that have been bothering us in the daily news as of late..
We also talk about the revolving door that is the Strip Club Waitress position, why canâ€™t these girls keep this seemingly easy job?â€¦ We give you our opinionsâ€¦.
We go off about the travesty that is the holiday shopping season, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, Cyber Mondayâ€¦ Really? Come onâ€¦.
We talk about the NASCAR fans booing the First Lady Michelle Obama in Miami at the championship raceâ€¦ Listen to our unique take on the lack of respect for our leadersâ€¦.
McDonalds fires itâ€™s Egg production farm, they did not know anything was wrong?â€¦. Really?
The music awards deems Taylor Swift the best musical entertainer of the year? overall?â€¦. Come onâ€¦
Oh and the Adult Awards season is starting to get on our nerves, we tell you what we think about thatâ€¦.
We tell you what we know about this story where strippers were getting butt injections from a strange trans-gender person in a hotel room. How the hell can someone let a person inject â€œFix A Flatâ€ in their body.. Just another reason why ourÂ Loans For LooksÂ company is a necessity â€¦ Listen to what we say about thisâ€¦.
We tell you about our girl Amber Lynn and her calendar release party in Brandon Florida, the drinks were good at the Loftâ€¦.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us

		<itunes:summary>Clearwater,FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News-Â  In this once in a lifetime episode of theÂ Tales Form Tony Batman ShowÂ we are proud to bring you our personal story of eleven eleven eleven eleven eleven and where we were at that single moment in time.. Do you remember where you were at 11:11pm on November 11th 2011? OrÂ Â 11,11,11,11,11â€¦
We happen to be hosting the one year anniversary of theÂ Bliss CabaretÂ in Clearwater Florida with Honey Hole Entertainment with porn star and Feature Entertainer Ashley Fires as our headliner for the nightâ€¦
We tell you exactly what we were doing and how we attempted to stop time for one moment so everyone of the people in the Bliss Cabaret would be forced to stop and remember exactly where they were and the fact that they were looking at me,Tony Batman and Ashley Fires on the stage at the Clearwater Florida Gentlemens Clubâ€¦
We then go on the explain to you everything about the night which included an open bar, catered Italian food from one of our favorite Italian restaurants in the country,Â DonatelloÂ Tampaâ€¦
Our Italian crew was out in full force as Jason Lange fromÂ Honey Hole EntertainmentÂ was coordinatingÂ  the night.. Tampa legend,and our friend,Â Jimmy The ShoeÂ was out in an almost out of control party mood and we could not have asked for a better nightâ€¦
Our DJ Wild Bill who also goes by the moniker ofÂ â€œThe Voice ofÂ  Adult Entertainmentâ€, was great to work with as always, thank goodness he knows how to fix computers and saved the night with his technical skills as wellâ€¦
We talk about Ashley Fires stage shows, Ashley is the spokesperson for the websiteÂ Clip4Sale, and like we do for the people at theÂ Screaming O, she travels the country for them to spread the good wordâ€¦
You will have to listen to the show to hear all the juicy details but we can say that Ashley Fires is a dirty, dirty girl and it showed on stageâ€¦ The crowd had a blast with her and so did weâ€¦.
We had fun with the crew from theÂ All Adult NetworkÂ who came out to cover the event, I like hanging out with their crew because they are a couple of cool dudes and we think alike when it comes to natureâ€¦.
Then we talk about spending the next night at theÂ Tampa Deja VuÂ Gentlemens Club, we hosted the after hours late night party.. They stay open until 6AM in the morning which is just crazy, but when people want to party all night thery are going to find a place to do itâ€¦
Some of you may not know that the Deja Vu Showgirls Gentlemens Club Tampa Florida, was the first thing we ever did in the Adult Industry, where we worked as a DJ and Emcee for over 3 straight years, thatâ€™s a long time on one project for us as you know by listening to our radio show from a different city every week..
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us

		<itunes:summary>Columbus, OH- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this latest comedic gold episode of the Tales From Tony Batman show we tell you all about our trip to Columbus Ohio for theÂ Screaming O Stage Show at the Ugly Tuna Saloonaâ€¦.
We give you the full run down of our 20 hours in Columbus and how we fit in a weekends worth of fun in less than a day..
Our time withÂ Wicked Pictures star jessica drake, the Lions Den Adult Stores, and the Screaming O was great and we tell you some of the funny things that happened while we were there.
We tell you about our historic late lunch at a place called theÂ â€œElevatorâ€, the place had a ton of characterâ€¦.
Then we tell you about heading to theÂ Ugly Tuna Saloona, which is on college bar row, right in front of the Ohio State University, so you know we had a great timeâ€¦.
We talk about our DJ for the nightÂ Cameron GreY, who is actually one of the most talented white rapers we have ever heard, listen throughout the show we play some stuff from his albumÂ N.A.S.A, were pretty sure you going to love itâ€¦
We talk about jessica drake doing her Wicked Games show on the stage at the Ugly Tuna, she is pretty funny and the people seemed to love herâ€¦
We tell you how we drank a bunch of different alcohols during the night and how our waitress rocked. The people that were at the Ugly Tuna were so much fun to be with it was contagious, everyone had fun with themâ€¦.
Some for the college guys invited us back to the dorms to show us something calledâ€ Hydroâ€, I am just going to plead the fifth on that oneâ€¦ We had a good time, listen to what we said in the showâ€¦.
After theÂ Cameron GreY songs we remember that we never played you the songs from theÂ â€œShuTangâ€ group we worked with a month ago, so we played them in this show, they are really good and the songs make you moveâ€¦ You have to hear them to know what I meanâ€¦.
Another one dayÂ Screaming O show in a city on our way to another city, thatâ€™s how we roll with the Screaming O team, we go everywhere it seemsâ€¦.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us

		<itunes:summary>Los Angeles- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- Striptaculous Radio Network- In this special episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show we celebrate our two year anniversary of the show with all of our friends, fans, and listeners, which to us are all in the same..
In this special â€œReCapâ€ show we take you back to some of our funny and exciting highlights from the past two years of showsâ€¦
We go back to some of our spontaneous phone calls, some funny, some gone really wrong, all very entertainingâ€¦

We start off the weekend at the Scores Gentlemens club in Tampa to celebrate the birthday of the our friend and underground legend â€œJimmy The Shoeâ€. We even sang happy birthday to him in the middle of the clubâ€¦. With our megaphoneâ€¦ Hear what else we didâ€¦
We also go into how Halloween has been expanded into 4 days and nights this year because it fell on a Monday, Is it really that big a celebration to last for 4 days?â€¦ We ask the zombie strippers and get some funny answersâ€¦
We talk about theÂ Deja Vu Gentlemens club costume party and how its hard to tell is exotic dancers are wearing a Halloween costume since they dress us as someone else every day, Well its true, listen to the outcome on this one..
Then we tell you about the Guavaween celebration in Ybor City Florida, which is a Latin inspired party that has a long history in the Tampa Bay areaâ€¦
We talk about everyoneâ€™s costumes, the big black pope?, Sex Toy Man?, Bubba Sparxxx, yea there just a few that are in thereâ€¦..

		<itunes:summary>Kalamazoo,MI- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this paranormal episode of the Tales From Tony Batman show we tell you all about our haunting experience at theÂ Kalamazoo Horror Festival in Michigan.
So many strange things happened in our short 4 day trip that we can hardly fit it all into one show, but we try, just like a bum tried to get money from us as soon as we landed in Detroitâ€¦
You really have to listen to the entire show to get the full experience but listen for theÂ Professional Bass Fisherman and the reality show we sold him onâ€¦
TheÂ Horror Fest Girls were a big attraction both at the festival and the after parties, but they were by far not the only thing to look at over the weekend..
We tell you all about theÂ Screaming O show that we did at theÂ Angels Gentlemens Club, which was the official after party for Friday nightâ€¦There was lots of drinking and some slightly indecent behavior which all ended with a dozen girls on stage chanting â€œWe want Vibrators- We want Vibratorsâ€â€¦ Oh the Screaming O brings out the inner sexy in just about everyone we meetâ€¦..
We tell you all about the horror movie stars that were at the festival all weekend,Â Fred â€œThe Hammerâ€ Williamson, Mike Perez, Vernon Wells, Mark Patton, Felissa Rose, Danny Hicks, Jonathan Tierston, Ari Lehman, Jennifer Black and the incredibleÂ Margot Kidder were all great people to be around and we made some great friendshipsâ€¦..But listen to how we got all of their movie credits wrongâ€¦ All in a days work for usâ€¦
We go on about the Saturday night after party at theÂ Metro/411 club, one side was a rock and roll, DJ type bar and the other side was a gay dance barâ€¦ Listen to hear how much fun we had, on both sidesâ€¦.
We talk about how the festival was held at a huge 3 story video store, Video Hits, and how it was right next toWestern Michigan University, which means there must be some great bars and drunken breakfast placesâ€¦.
Thank you to Gary Allen for all the photos and assistance throughout the weekend, you and Heather were incredible assets to the festivalâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us
And a few of our syndication media outlets such atÂ GTxxxTreme,Â ABN,Â Black Pearl Radio, and 32 othersâ€¦.

		<itunes:summary>Franklin Wi, now boasts a new Queen of the pole from Stripperfest 10. Â Gara the winner, now we talk with Gara about all the fun that is stripperfest as well as our usual banter to find the girlÂ behindÂ the pole&#8230;.. Â If you get a chance to see this hottie, go, she will entertain and dazzle you.

Here is the recap from Stripperfest 10
$7,000.00 was awarded during an evening of exotic dance fireworks provided  by a pool of competitors that came from across the country for Stripperfest 10.  The tenth chapter of the Stripperfest series was another history making event  that saw the induction of four previous champions into the Skindustry Honor  Society along with crowning two current champions in three categories; Queen of  the Stage, Hottest Stripper and Queen of the Pole.
The Hottest Stripper  category provided the highest level of drama for the night with a tie score of  46.25 (50 highest possible score) between Candy (Wild Jâ€™s, OK) and Simone Dana  Lustrous (Cheetahs, NV) for first place in the final round prompting a sudden  death dance between the two to decide a winner. In the dance off Simone (48.75)  walked away with the decision over Candy (46.75). Coming in third place was  Lacey Rain (independent) who missed out on the sudden death dance off with a  score of 46.25. Rounding out the final round of the Hottest Stripper category  was Mariah (Miss Pole, WI) &#8211; 45.25, Whitney (Angelâ€™s, MI) &#8211; 44 and Vanessa (On  the Border, WI) &#8211; 43.75.
Simone took her second Skindustry Hottest Stripper  title, having won the same title along with Queen of the Stage at  StripperPalooza 3 in August. This was also Whitneyâ€™s second trip to the finals  of the â€œHottestâ€ category, with her first coming at StripperPalooza 2.
The  stage category was provided with two early on favorites with StripperPalooza 2  Queen of the Stage Lacey Rain and StripperPalooza 3 Queen of the Stage Simone  Dana Lusterous. This also became a rematch of sorts due to the fact that Lacey  edged out Simone by half a point at StripperPalooza 2. By the end of the final  round Simone avenged her previous defeat with a score of 29.75 (30 highest  possible score) to Laceyâ€™s 28.5. This marked Simoneâ€™s second straight double  victory in the stage and Hottest Stripper category at a Skindustry competition.  Taking the third place position was Harley (Parkway Tropics, MI) &#8211; 26.5 making  her first trip to the stage finals at a Skindustry competition, having made the  final round of the pole at SP2 and slated to compete in the final round of the  pole category later in the night.
The pole competition was the fiercest  category of the evening featuring 6 contestants that had made multiple trips to  final rounds, at previous contests, including 3 former Queens. Gara  (independent), a two time Stripperfest pole winner wowed the audience and judges  as she made her way to Stripperfest history as the only lady to ever win 3  Stripperfest titles with a score 29.75 (30 highest possible score). She bested  StripperPalooza 3 Queen of the Pole, Cassie Sterling (The Clubhouse, TX) â€“ 29.25  by half a point in the final round. Harli was the third place finisher with a  score of 24 making her just the third lady in history to ever make it to the  finals of both the pole and stage category at Stripperfest.
The night was  highlighted with the first Skindustry Honor Society ceremony with the induction  of Tawnie Monroe (SF3 QOS), Cali (SF4 QOP), Kozmina (SF1-2 QOP) and Autumn  (SF4-6 QOS). Inductees were introduced to the stage, awarded plaques and gave  speeches to the sold out audience.
Stripperfest 10 was the fourth Skindustry  event of the year and all attention is now shifted to StripperPalooza 4 as we  return to Angelâ€™s Gentlemenâ€™s Club in Kalamazoo,MI for the last event of the  year Sunday Novemebr 6, 2011.

		<itunes:summary>Des Moines, IA- Tony Batmanâ€™s A entertainment News-Â  In this episode of the nationally syndicated â€œTales From Tony Batmanâ€ show, we welcome our newest syndication outlet,Â GTxxxtreme.com, and then we recap our week in Des Moines Iowa at the Big Earls Goldmine Gentlemens Club hosting the 48th running of the Miss Nude World Pageant.
We tell you about arriving at the Des Moines airport and the Big Earls van picking me up to start the week, people just stared at me like I was an alien or something.
We tell you all about the girls that were there including the Australian Cassandra Jane, the two Canadians Kelly Kayne and Lulu Taylor, the several girls that lived in Wes Virginia and the slew of ladies that came from everywhere else in the United States.
We tell you about our sponsors theÂ Screaming O andÂ SugarDVD, who both send tons of great gifts for the contestants and customers watching the pageant in Iowa.
We reminisce about the time we were pulled over on I-80 outside of Des Moines and put in the back of a police car while drug sniffing dogs were sent into my denali SUVâ€¦ Good timesâ€¦
We go on and on about the host hotel that was once called the Bavarian Inn which is now called the Budget Inn, but we donâ€™t thing anything else was changed in the past 100 yearsâ€¦.
We check for ghosts, but all we found was naked girls and waspsâ€¦
Then we go into the shows and how the top 3 girls had very different styles and how all the shows were so good I was happy I was not a judge and how the finals night went till 5:15amâ€¦.
We ate at a place called Montana Mikeâ€™s three times in a row and we got to know a bunch of the waitresses, I even introduced them to Four Square, it was a funny timeâ€¦.
We tell you about taping a video for a DVD or an Internet broadcast, we are still not sure, but we were miked up every night, like the sideline mike at a football game, and how the producer David could hear everything that I said, or anyone said to me, even in the bathroomâ€¦
Then we tell you about all the new girls we met, and how a couple of them were so so pretty. Then we give you the full run down of the winners, which you will hear if you listen to the show.
Then we preview the Stripperfest 10 competition and how we did not get to sleep before we got on the plane to Milwaukee Wisconsin and how our photographer Ricky Rich left right from the Des Moines club in his carâ€¦
We also go into the details about the upcoming Kalamazoo Horror Fest that we are hosting October 21-23 in Michigan and the Screaming O VS Scream Queen contest we are having at the Angels Gentlemens Clubduring the festival, and the Exxxotica Expo New Jersey in November.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us

		<itunes:summary>Wellington, FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this latest episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show, we go south/south east to hang out with our â€œA Entertainment Girlâ€ Krystle Cummings while she does her Feature Dance shows at the famed Tâ€™s Lounge in West Palm Beach.
While we are in SOFLA we spend a handful of days with our friendsÂ Aaron Wells and Donna, Aaron is a mainstream director and Donna does promotions atÂ JoJoâ€™s Bar and Grill in Wellington.
We tell yo0u about picking up Krystle Cummings and going over the Jojoâ€™s to shoot a beer commercial and promotion, we also shot a couple of short and funny YoutubeÂ  style videos where we ask important questions and Krystle answers them, well sort ofâ€¦. You have to see them to believe them.. The beer commercial wonâ€™t be out for a while but it was fun shooting it..
We talk about the Tâ€™s Lounge some more and how they had a spinning stage and lots of crazy things going on in the club. We then go into who has the strangest stage in a strip club in theÂ  countryâ€¦.
We give you an update on our upcoming marathon trip where we go to Des Moines Iowa for the Miss Nude World Pageant, then to Milwaukee Wisconsin for the StripperFest contest then we go to Tampa Florida for the Nightmoves Adult Entertainment Awards.
We also go into the details about the Kalamazoo Horror Fest that we are hosting October 21-23 in Michigan and the Screaming O VS Scream Queen contest we are having at the Angels Gentlemens Club during the festivalâ€¦..
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Hollywood Sex Toyz,Â Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.
This week we want to welcomeÂ www.GTxxxTreme.com as our newest syndication outlet for the showâ€¦ Thank you GTXXXTREME weâ€¦. Love you guysâ€¦

		<itunes:summary>Tampa, FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News-Â  In this weeks super funny episode of theÂ Tales From Tony Batman, we go in to some deep thinking subjects such as â€œWhy are the waitresses so sexy and desirable?â€ .. Why do we also want want we can not have, and why is is to cool to â€œmake it rainâ€?
We just got over a flu type bug and we tell you some disgusting things people do when they are sick, including us and just donâ€™t care about anything.
We get back into the â€œHottest Waitressâ€ a contest we are having at the Deja Vu and Hustler Clubs to see which club has the hottest waitresses, I believe the winners will be onÂ Deja Vu.Com . We came up with this idea because the Tampa Deja Vu keeps hiring these hot waitresses and when we go back to host the â€œLate Night After Partyâ€ in Tampa we always fall in love with a new waitress.
Speaking of new waitresses and the Tampa Deja Vu Gentlemens Club,we were just there last weekend for that very â€œLate Night After Party, and we met the new waitress Allyâ€¦.. Listen to the showâ€¦.
We tell you all about our new syndicated columns that were now running in magazines and sties all over the country and the two new internet radio channels that have piked up the â€œTales of Tonyâ€ show.. WelcomeAdult Broadcast Network, Tuesday nights, andÂ Black Pearl Radio, Thursday nights.. We love when a plan come together wellâ€¦.
We wish Raven Alexis good luck on her fight against cancer, they have T-Shirts to help raise funds to help that fight atÂ Naughty Swag.â€¦ $10 from each shirt goes to herâ€¦
We give you the update on the A Entertainment Girls,Â Dakota Skye is in Detroit, Krystle Cummings is in West Palm Beach andÂ Wendy Ramage is in Jackson, Mississippiâ€¦â€¦
We give the updated on the Miss Nude World Pageant in Des Moines Iowa, The Stripperfest 10 Contest in Milwaukee, WI, the Nightmoves Awards in Tampa, FL and the Kalamazoo Horror Festival in K-Zoo, MI, all of whice we are doing some sort of hosting or filming at in Octoberâ€¦.
Check out our upcoming events where you can meet us: TheÂ Miss Nude World Pageant,Â StripperFest 10,Â  TheÂ Kalamazoo Horror Fest, TheÂ Nightmoves Adult Entertainment Awards

		<itunes:summary>Palm Harbor,FL- TonyÂ  Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News-Â  In this episode of the mass syndicated Tales Of Tony Batman Show, we welcome two more new channels to our list of syndication partners, but what we really talk about all show is strip clubs, Feature Dancers, beautiful women and the A Entertainment Girls.
We give you the recap of our weekend in which we went to the Oasis Adult Tavern to see our friend Robyn Foxx perform her signature Feature Dance shows in Palm Harbor Florida. It has been a year or so since we have seen the Oasis club and they have done some remodeling and we were happy to see the club busy forÂ Robyn Foxx when she hit the stage Friday night.Â  When we arrived we seen that the Nightmoves crew was there already, so we watched the show then went over and talked with Robyn afterwords.
We also met a girl there named Mercedes who turned out to be a true beauty and very cool woman, listen to the comments in the showâ€¦
We then, as we always do when we are int he Tampa Bay area, wen over theÂ Deja Vu Gentlemens Club in Brandon Florida and hosted their â€œLate Night After Partyâ€. Itâ€™s fun to come in late and start talking it up with the dancers and the crowd for the rest of the night, the place stays open till 6 AM on the weekends so you can imagine how crazy that can get..
We then tell you all about our upcoming gig as host/emcee of theÂ Miss Nude World Pageant which is going to be held at the Big Earls Goldmine Club in Des Moines Iowa. The topÂ  features are flying in from all over the country and all over the world. Cassandra Jane from Australia, Taylor Tease from Canada, Aspen Reign from Illinois, Krystle Cummings from North Carolina, its going to be pretty bad ass, and we tell you our plan to make it funny tooâ€¦.
We give you the recap and previews of where all the A Entertainment Girls are this week,Â Dakota Skye, Krystle Cummings and or new girlÂ Wendy Ramage from Mississippi â€¦.
We would like to welcome two newÂ  syndication slots for the Tales From Tony Batman show, Tuesday nights on theÂ Adult Broadcast Network and Thursday Nights on theÂ Black Pearl Radio Channelâ€¦ We will hopefully keep expanding to reach our goal of a million listeners a WEEKâ€¦. Thank you to all of you already here we appreciate everything you doâ€¦

We ask the question, â€œDo you talk like the people around youâ€? Do you get an accent from being in an area of the world or being around a group of peopleÂ  that talk with one?â€¦ We get all scientific on you about it, well sort of, you have to listen to understand.
Then we ask the question, is Tony Batman really crazy?â€¦ We get get a couple of interesting answers, none of them goodâ€¦
We talk about our night at a charity event in Palm Harbor Florida at the Fountain of Youth Cosmetic Surgery Institute, we get to debut the â€œHarrells Hottiesâ€ which is a group of classy promotional girls that go to Cosmetic Medicine functions in their now signature â€œLittle Black Dressesâ€, we will be doing a ton of new things with the Black Dress girls in the near future, hear all about out time with them this past week.

		<itunes:summary>Los Angeles, CA-Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- This episode of the nationwide broadcasted, sexy entertainment, Tales From Tony Batman Show comes to you from downtown Los Angeles and tells all the tales from the 2011 Exxxotica Los Angeles Expo.
We give you step by step details as we drive in a rental car form Las Vegas, where we were in town for theExotic Dancer Gentlemens Club Expo, to downtown Los Angeles to prepare for for our time on stage hosting the Screaming O Stage Show and orgasm contest, we also had the Screaming O booth rocking all weekend long as we took the mic in the booth with our man DJ Naylor on the wheels of sound.
It was a big weekend for us and theÂ Screaming O novelty company as we made our way over to Los Angeles a day early to have a day long meeting in the Screaming O office. We met the new marketing guy Daniel who bring s his talents to the company after traveling the country from east to west, he will be a great pick up for the team.
On Friday it was on at the LA Convention Center, not only were we all there for theÂ Exxxotica Expo but in the next Expo hall was the wild HempCon, which I did partake in by the way, its all on tape somewhere, and its pretty funnyâ€¦
We talk about staying at the historicÂ Hotel Figueora in downtown LA and how we are pretty sure itâ€™s haunted and just may be the basis for the theme park ride â€œTower of Terrorâ€.
We reunited with a bunch of our West Side friends while in LA, the crew from Black and Blue Media, Jim and Raven fromÂ Striptaculous, my boys from Cali Chronic Magazine and of course the Screaming O Scream Team Girls.
On stage at Exxxotica we did our thing again with DJ Ryan Smith and Emcee Dan Diamond, we have now worked on stage together so many times it just seems like second nature.
We tell you about the Screaming O shows and how we â€œborrowedâ€ the girls from theÂ Adult Trading Card Company booth to be our â€œassistantsâ€™ â€¦ We also gave away 6Â RealTouch devices from the stage over the weekend and again guys were clamoring to get the prize, even if they had to do some silly things to win themâ€¦
We talk about meeting the girls from The Rub PR and how Nikki Delano has to be one of the sexiest women we ween there all weekend long. We talk about doing our customary porn star interviews with Frank formÂ Adult News Flash over the weekend, and how we got into a bunch of trouble at the Playboy Mansion togetherâ€¦

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s Entertainment News â€“ In this late night episode of the wild and crazy Tales From Tony Batman Show we give you all the behind the scene details of theÂ Screaming O Show at Scores in Tampaâ€¦
TheÂ StorErotica Award winning Screaming O Club Tour made a stop in Tampa Florida at the world famousScores Gentlemens Club and Steakhouse. This is our 12th Gentlemens club stop on the Screaming O Club Show tour and sometimes these things get a little crazy, but itâ€™s been a fun ride so far no matter what type of club we have stopped at.
Our friend Jason fromÂ Honey Hole Entertainment booked the show for us and the people at Scores were all great during the show, you have to hear all about â€œJimmy The Shoeâ€ who is probably one of the most recognizable characters at the Scores Club in Tampa. You have to hear the story on how he made the Sucker contest so much better for the nightâ€¦
Adult Starlet Grace Evangelina was our co host stage partner during the show, this is the second time Grace has graced the stage with us for aÂ Screaming O Show and she looked great as always.
The people fromÂ LoansForLooks.com came out and gave away gift bags filled with cosmetic medicine gifts and free procedures at the Premiere Cosmetic Center in Tampa Bay, the girls went crazy for the prizes and we donâ€™t blame them there were a couple hundred dollars worth of prizes in each bag.
We tell you about finding a sexy red head girl to be a part of the show, we do this in every city because we get weak around red headed women, Amber was great all night long and boy did she deserve to win that sucker contest, and probably the Big O Orgasm contest as wellâ€¦.
We fill you in on where we are going to be next with the Screaming O show, Exxxotica Los Angeles, TheKalamazoo Horror Fest, Exxxotica New Jersey, and the Little Darlings in Las Vegas,Â  all before the end of the yearâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Brandon, FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this bumping episode of the the reality radio show, Tales From Tony Batman we take on theÂ Hot Summer Nights Car Show and Sound Off Competition held at the Deja Vu Gentlemens Club in Tampa Florida over the weekend.
We do our best to explain to you just what a â€œSound Offâ€ is and how that translates into the bump in the trunk and hot Deja Vu Summer Girls. Remember we still think those old school blue Jenson speakers are an upgrade, so you may find this story particularity funny if you know anything about automotive audio systems, if not, then just go with itâ€¦â€¦
We give you another round of â€œThe New Girls Are Hotâ€ from our weekend at the Deja Vu where we did our Emcee duties during the Late Night Party till 6am, this time its Gabby and Skittlesâ€¦.
We recap where the A Entertainment Girls were over the weekend,Â Dakota Skye in the Poconos at theGrandview, during the NASCAR race, Krystle Cummings debuts her brand new A Entertainment Banner at the Lumberyard 2 in Cedar Rapids Iowa, and thenÂ Wendy Ramage grabs a magazine cover in Mississippiâ€¦ Jim tries to make a joke about Iowa, thatâ€™s worth listing to the show right thereâ€¦..
We entertain the thought of quitting the adult industry side of entertainment and taking a mainstream publicity job, hear the story on how that wentâ€¦
We then comment on theÂ Jerry Lewis Telethon and how we wonâ€™t host it anymore, and how we got denied when we offered to volunteer to work the telethon in Tampa even though we did a couple years in Los Angeles, discrimination?
Then we ask the question of the week â€œWhat is a Feature Entertainer?â€ and comment how no one will commentâ€¦
We preview our sponsorship during the upcomingÂ Gathering of the Juggalos, the ADâ€™s are out now and we are happy with our involvementâ€¦. We Talk about the nextÂ Screaming O Club show at theÂ Scores Gentlemens Club, and how we are all getting together for theÂ Exxxotica LA show at the end of Augustâ€¦.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Los Angeles,CA- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News-Â  This episode ofÂ â€œTales From Tony Batmanâ€ fits in more stories then the United States has debt.Â  We even give you some great DJ tips at the end of the show while telling you some of our favorite songs to play in a strip club, even though we have not done that in years and years. Music and emotion is timeless.
We give you an update on the mainstream horror movie we did with Jerry â€œThe Kingâ€ Lawler, Janessa Brazil, Ryan Keely, Sal the Stockbroker and Beetle Juice from the Howard Stern Show and of course Ron Jeremy. The â€œGirls Gone Deadâ€ movie seems to be taking a long time to release in theaters, but we tell you what just happened.
We talk about our hosting something called a White Party at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu, itâ€™s just another reason to break out the White Summer Pimp Suit, Labor Day is fast approaching though. Then we beg to ask the question â€œShould we wear the white suit to theÂ Gathering of the Juggalos when we go hang with our friendsWolfPac who are playing the concert along with 50 other great bands, itâ€™s hosted by Charlie Sheen, what will he wear?
We then tell you about our first experience at the famedÂ Fetish Con Show in Tampa Florida. We went to the show for the first time and hung out with Jason fromÂ Honey Hole Entertainment and a new model Brooklyn Dayne who we were very smitten with. TheÂ All Adult Network and Nightmovies Magazine people were there and we were surprised that they had the .XXX people with them, we ask if it might be a good idea to listen to what they have to say, and Jim goes crazy on us for even asking.
We preview our upcoming schedule which includes anotherÂ Screaming O Club show at the Scores Gentlemens Club in Tampa, TheÂ Exoitc Dancer Awards and Expo, Were hosting theÂ Miss Exotic United States atÂ Little Darlings Las Vegas and then driving to Los Angeles for theÂ Exxxotica LA show, we just canâ€™t slow down, even if we wanted to.
We give you a slight insight on what might turn out to be theÂ LoansForLooks.com tour, and how it might eat up the rest of our waking hours. Listen to the whole show and let us know what you thinkâ€¦â€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL-Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this screaming good episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show we are all a buzz about the latestÂ Screaming O Stage Show on the national tour. We made our second stop at the Deja Vu Gentlemens Club in Tampa Florida forÂ  the second annualÂ â€œScreaming O Show Weekendâ€
In this episode we give you all the info from the stage at the Tampa Deja Vu, our second year doing the show there, in fact we go into a nice rant about how theÂ Tampa Deja Vu was the first Gentlemenâ€™s club to book the Screaming O show and the same week
we win theÂ StorErotica Award for â€œMarketing Campaign of the Yearâ€ for the Screaming O Tour we head back to the place that broke us into the Gentlemens Club market. Ironic? Crazy? Fate?â€¦ You have to listen to find out..
We give praise for theÂ Deja Vu people actually putting up all the promotional material that the Screaming O sent from Los Angeles, itâ€™s does not always happen to perfectionâ€¦
We tell about the girls that were in to contest and how we were really surprised about some of the quiet girls that come out of the crowd to really get sexy on the stage during the contest.
Frank fromÂ www.LoansForLooks.com came out and gave out prizes from the Fountain
of Youth Cosmetic Surgery Institute in Palm Harbor Florida. Anna fromÂ Gentlemenâ€™s Club Live TV came out to see the show, Al fromÂ Mad Creativity andÂ Carmen Valentina stopped by to see some of the show as wellâ€¦
We talk about our A Entertainment GirlsÂ Dakota Skye,Kryltle Cummings and Tawnie Monroe who are all nominated for different awards in theÂ Exotic Dancer Awards this year in Las Vegas during theÂ Gentlemens Club Expoâ€¦
We tell you about our upcoming events starting with theÂ Gathering of the Juggalos in Cave in Rock Illinois where we will be sponsoring the cool assÂ WolfPac Band during the wild weekend concert gathering, we are all excited because we will get to see our heroÂ George Clinton again during that show. Then we head to the Exotic Dancer Expo in Las Vegas then we drive to Los Angeles the same week for the Exxxotica Los Angelesâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Chicago,IL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News-Â  In this episode of the all aboutÂ Chicago Exxxotica, Tales from Tony Batman Show, we take you on an adventure through the Exxxotica Expo in Chicago. From the airport to the Hyatt Hotel to the Donald E Stephens Convention center, we talk you on a full round trip ride during the show.
We Talk about our stage time with theÂ StorErotica Award winningÂ Screaming O Show and Contest and the AVN â€œOâ€ Award WinningÂ AEBN â€œRealTouchâ€ Contest. Maybe were good at marketing and all the naysayers are wrong, we now have the awards to prove it.
Our stage shows atÂ Chicago Exxxotica were awesome and itâ€™s partly because we hadÂ Dan Diamond andDJ Ryan Smith working with us, that always rocks.Â  We will never forget our time with adult starlets Ivy Winters and Aubrey Lee who were our models during the shows.
We go into the upcomingÂ Nudes A Poppin Festival Weekend in Roselawn Indiana. Naomi Knight was at theChicago Exxxotica Expo in the Nudes A Poppin booth along with the owners and coordinators. It was a great time there but the Nudes show this weekend, July 16-17 is going to be awesome.
We talk about some of the porn stars at the Exxxotica Show telling us we need to pay them to take pictures of them for our article, you have to hear what we said about that.
Phil Varone who was in the bands Saigon Kick and Skid Row was a cool dude to meet at Exxxotica and now we find out her is co hosting with Us, Ron Jeremy and Bree Olson at theÂ Nudes A Poppin this weekend, who would have thought..?
We have tons of stories about Chicago and how we went down town, and had dinner at theÂ Navy Pier.. Ricky Rich doesnâ€™t look at menu prices, usually no big deal, listen to what happened this time though.
A good show with tons of funny stories in it, listen to it all the way though and tell us what you think..
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Well the government has done it again.  This time it is the state of California with SB 459 Link here . Â This bill would change theÂ independentÂ contractor status for Strip Club workers and make them all Employees. Â  Now I do not see the hit on the Adult film industry, but the law is poorly written and could be streched to cover that as well. Â Â sb_459_bill_20110527_amended_sen_v97 Here is a copy of the bill in pdf format, read it for yourself and contact your state rep to complain. Â  This could close down many clubs in the state, that is why I think California Hates Us&#8230;&#8230;

We talk about people being afraid to say whatâ€™s on their minds in the Entertainment Industry while at the same time fighting for freedom of speech.
We talk about our weekend at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu and what â€œBeach Weekâ€ actually means in a Gentlemens Club. We are a big part of the Deja Vuâ€™s Sexy Summer of Fun and we tell you about our next Strip Club version of the famous â€œScreaming O Club Showâ€ which will be at the Tampa Deja Vu July 22-23rd.

A bigÂ 4th of July party for us in Clearwater Florida and how you can help our American troops live a slightly more comfortable life by helping the people atÂ Treats For Troops in Land O Lakes Florida.

		<itunes:summary>Clearwater,FL-Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- This is the latest episode of the real life radio showâ€œTales From Tony Batmanâ€.Â  This week we come to you fromÂ Clerwater Florida where we just wrapped up another awesomeÂ Screaming O Club Show, this time at theÂ Bliss Cabaret.
We tell you all about our week and why we are grumpy and why we feel like the hot spotlight might be killing us. We always air our real feelings on the show and this week is no different.
We talk again about the waitresses at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu and how we named another one this week, Bubbles is a cute girl but we canâ€™t stop staring at her butt, you have to hear the story about thatâ€¦
Then we go right into theÂ Screaming O show at the Bliss Cabaret. We had so many people there it seemed to be chaotic at times, but then we argue that may be the sign of a good event.Â Honey Hole Entertainmentbooked the night for us and we had a blast with out co hosts, starletÂ Grace Evangeline and AVN award winnerÂ Delilah Strong who was debuting her newÂ Jean Ass Lovers website.
We tell you about our experience with the Bang Bros people and how they are expanding in the Tampa Bay area, we tell you how they did at the show with usâ€¦
Our man Frank from Cosmetic Surgery USA, the parent company toÂ LoansForLooks.com came out to Bill to see us and brought prizes from theÂ Fountain of Youth Institute a local plastic surgery center.
The Nightmoves Magazine people were there filming for theirÂ All Adult Network, we tell you about our interview.
We get into ourÂ 4th of July plans and then how we are traveling to Chicago two weeks in a row for theExxxotica Chicago Expo and then again for the bigÂ Nudes A Poppin Festival in northern Indiana.
In between those two trips we were going to try to make it to Burbank CA for theÂ StorErotica Awards and to Pasadena CA for theÂ AVN O Awards because we are nominated at both for theÂ Screaming O Club Tour. We have now been nominated for every major adult industry marketing campaign award there isâ€¦ Must be something good about our show right?â€¦.
You have to listen to the entire show to hear all the funny things that happened to us this week, thereâ€™s some good music in there as well from our friends theÂ Heavy Grindaz
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Loans For Looks, we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL-Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this latest episode of the widely syndicatedÂ Tales From Tony Batman Radio Show we dig into the age old question â€œWhy are the waitresses at a strip club more appealing than the dancers most of the time?â€
What is is about the waitress in a strip club that makes you want her more than most of the dancers? It may be the old adage you always want what your told you canâ€™t have. We tell you our story of the Tampa Deja VuGentlemens Club and how most of the waitress are take home quality and how that messes with our mindsâ€¦.
We tell you about a new waitress at the Vu that we affectionately named Thunder Foot, we think her name it Kathy or something like that, but now she is Thunder Foot because she is fast and always moving.
We talk about Jubilee and how she made a guest appearance at the Tampa Deja Vu all the way from theAngels Gentlemens Club in Kalamazoo Michigan. She always places on the podium when she competes in theÂ Stripper Palooza Contest there.
We talk a bit about some topical news including the rumor thatÂ Shaquille Oâ€™Neal is back in the scandal spotlight again with an alleged sex tape.
We tell how A Entertainment News girl and Feature EntertainerÂ Dakota Skye got the cover of Desire Magazine and how she is really doing well out on her dance tour. Then we go into how we are still trying to get things together with Feature EntertainerÂ Tawnie Monroe and how we will be wearing a kilt the next time we go to Wisconsin for theÂ Miss Nude Wisconsin Pageant.

		<itunes:summary>Atlanta, GA- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- This is a story filled episode of the nationally rankedâ€œTales From Tony Batmanâ€ Show. We stuff three cities several strip clubs and 20 exotic dancers into this one our fun filled show.
We talk about our time atÂ Honey Hole Entertainment CEO, Jasonâ€™s birthday opening night atÂ Donatelloâ€™sandÂ Scores Tampa, we even got to name someone at the party, itâ€™s an Italian thing, Dirty Foot J was the most appropriate name we could give him, listen to hear whyâ€¦
We then go into our trip to Atlanta Georgia for the 2011Â Exotic Dancer National Championship at the Pink Pony. We will make you listen to the show to hear the winners, but we will tell you that there were over 20 top named Feature Dancers from all over the country that competed including A Entertainment GirlsÂ Dakota Skye, Krystle Cummings, and Amber Roseâ€¦ We hung out with Amish J and Tawnie Monroe, a funny story.Â  This is an awesome tale of the weekend and well worth listening to the whole show to hear every bit of it.
We tell everyone how we saved a little kittens life in the hotel parking lot in Atlanta and how it was pretty scary to everyone involved. Did you know that firemen donâ€™t really come out to save kittens like on TV?
We announce a few things for the first time ever in this episode, such as our new partnership with the Cosmetic Surgery promotion and finance service atÂ www.LoansForLooks.com â€¦ Itâ€™s a new company that is set up to help entertainers,dancers, models and such get the Cosmetic work they want done without waiting, they can have a bad credit score, because that it ok, it really looks great so far and we have had 5 girls sign up already â€¦
We then go into our upcoming weekend at the Tampa Deja Vu for theâ€ Late Night Weekend Partyâ€, and our nextÂ Screaming O Club Show which is being held June 25th at theÂ Bliss Cabaret in Clearwater Florida in conjunction with the people at Bang Bros and Honey Hole Entertainment.
Then we announce for the first time publicly that we now haveÂ Motley Crue front man Vince Neil and former Charlie Sheen Goddess Bree Olson added to the bill at this yearsÂ Nudes A Poppin Festival to go along with our yearly crew of Ron Jeremy, Adara Michaels, Chicago Radio Personality Freak, and our very own Tony Batmanâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, and Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- This big ass episode goes on and on about our week in West Palm Beach, Tampa and St. Petersburg Florida. We cover a lot of ground in one hour and this action packed episode is one you donâ€™t want to miss.
We tell about hanging at theÂ Tâ€™s Lounge in West Palm Beach Florida with A Entertainment Girl and Feature EntertainerÂ Dakota Skye. We invaded the VIP area with a bunch of people that work in the mainstream movie world, Aaron,Jared, and Greg came with us and we threw money around like rappersâ€¦ Our porn actress friend Victoria Norton, form Los Angeles was there as well and we just had a great time.. A scene from theÂ â€œGirls Gone Deadâ€ was actually shot in the Tâ€™s Lounge and the DJâ€™s wife is in the movie as well.. Jamie is one of the best DJs in the country and took care of us like gold.. PS-Â Burt Reynolds did NOT come with us
We then move on to our time in Tampa at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu Gentlemens Club, it was a long but good time all weekend long there as well, we do discuss the fact that they are open to 6 am and how the hell people can keep partying all day and night.
We then go into our day in St.PetersburgÂ  at theÂ 97X Backyard BBQ and Rock Concert where we were there representing the Screaming O and hanging in our booth with theÂ Todd Couples Superstore. We have some fun times giving away prizes to some of the 10,000 people that were there but the best time was when we took our camera guy Bill, who also runs theÂ Tampa Bay Nightlife website, back stage and started filming the bands on stage and in the VIP, they all had Screaming O gift bags that the girls form theÂ Backstage Artists Lounge were handing out and fun was had by allâ€¦
Panic at the Disco,Sick Puppies,Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Hugo,AwalNation, Airborne Toxic Event, andAnchor Atlantic were the bands that played that day, and before we almost got thrown out by security for filming we had a great timeâ€¦ You have to listen that that part twice, its funny as hellâ€¦.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, and Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Miami Beach, FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this latest broadcast of the latest South Florida approved episode of the Tales Form Tony Batman Show we get big in Miami Florida at theÂ Exxxotica Show.
We attended the Expo in Miami with our friend fromÂ Honey Hole Entertainment, Jason Lange who was surprised to say the least about how it all went down in Miami.. We had Jason on the show to see if he was still mad about me getting us lost while walking to eat dinner and sober up a little bit before the after partiesâ€¦ You will have to listen to see if he forgave usâ€¦
We spent some time in the booth with a group of BBWâ€™s (Big Beautiful Women). Letâ€™s just say they gave usa whole lottla love, just like Led Zeppelin sang about in the 70â€²s..
We talk about not really enjoying the price at theÂ South Seas Hotel on the beach since we would be at the convention center the entire time we were there, the MojitosÂ  were really good though..
We then turn the discussion to our Saturday night that we Emceed at theÂ Deja Vu Gentlemens Club, We had the late night party going well, and then we got hypnotized by some very stare-able female booties ..
We tell about our trip to West Palm Beach and hanging out at theÂ Tâ€™s Lounge with our friends from the mainstream movieÂ â€œGirls Gone Deadâ€ and some porn star friends from Los Angeles as wellâ€¦
We fill everyone in about theÂ 97X Back Yard BBQ and Concert with theÂ Sick Puppies andÂ Panic At The Disco. We will be filming our day with the Backyard Artists Lounge,Â The Screaming O, TheÂ ASFX, (Association of Safe &#38; Fun Sex ). We have Bill McArdle fromÂ Xtra Medium Productions shooting the video back stage and in the crowd.
We talk about our new model and partner in a new business we are starting, Sally Jean Batee, who will also be at the rock concert this coming weekend with us, she will probably be a lot of places with us in the near futureâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this riveting episode of the Tales FromÂ Tony Batmanwe talk about our weekend at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu and the fact that traveling from Strip Club to Strip Club can be both a good and bad thing.
Our weekend at the Deja Vu Gentlemens Club in Tampa Florida was a fun time and that is partly because we have not been there in a month. Why is that a good thing? We tell you in the show how excited it is to walk into the club and see a bunch of new girls and thatâ€™s just what happened this past weekend. We met some very interesting Exotic Entertainers that we though were fun to work with. There was Dallas who we nicknamed â€œBig Texasâ€ because she has a nice round ass. She called us out asking if we meant she had a big fatâ€¦â€¦ Well listen to the showâ€¦. There was also Amber or Autumn, who was so hot that I could not even talk to her.. And we can not ever forget to talk about Summers assâ€¦
We had three new waitresses to rename on the mic, lets see there was Mata-Dor-Able, Sassy, and then there was M &#38; M but she only lasted about 3 hours before she decided I was not, I mean the job was not for herâ€¦.
We go back a week and talk more about theÂ Skylar Neil Golf Charity put on by Vince Neil fromÂ Motley Crue, we again thank all of our models and theÂ Striptaculous team for doing such a great job.
We talk about our upcoming weekend where we will need to be in Tampa for theÂ JT Money After Party and in Miami for the opening of theÂ Exxxotica Miami Beach show. Were getting used to being in two places at once these daysâ€¦
We learn some new key words for the show that you will just have to hear to believe, we think they are funny not sure if its true, you be the judge of it after you listen to the whole showâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Rome, GA- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News-Â  In this latest episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show we get to talk about going Bi-coastal over the weekend as we had events going on in Rome Georgia and Simi Valley California at the same time and on the same day.
We tell you all about our time in Georgia at the Entice Couples Boutique 5 Year Anniversary Party and the Lovers Expo that was held in a big circus tent on the property of the adult store.We were in charge of theScreaming O Booth who was one of the sponsors of the event along with another one of our sponsors,WET personal lubes. Our Screaming O Scream Team girlÂ Linsey, or Fire Woman as I liked to caller because of her vibrant, red hair, did an excellent job and we give her props for it.
You have to hear the story about the sex and the hotel and the crazy night that went from fun gathering to drunken fest of crazy. There were about 2000 people at the Entice store that night and it was plain country craziness. We also tell the story about our time with Adam &#38; Eve StarÂ Alexis Ford, and how we messed that one up,Â Charlie Chase and Wicked PicturesÂ Stormy Daniels were also there but things went smooth with themâ€¦LOL
On the Same day an at the same time, we had the Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News Tee at the Skylar Neil Charity Golf Tournament in Simi Valley California. We talk to theÂ Striptaculous team that was there at what is now being affectionately being called the â€œA-Holeâ€.Â  We tell you how our girls kicked ass at the event and took the flag for the most exciting hole on the golf course.Â Eve Batelle,Â Scarlett Fay, Nicki Daniels, andKimber Peters were there representing the A-Hole with supervision byÂ Tony Bonesâ€¦ We tell you the drama about the hole having the two DJâ€™s and how DJ Revenue and DJ Alyfe tore it up all day long and made the people stay at the A -Hole longer than they should have.
We talk about this being a tough trick to pull off being coast to coast on the same day and how ourÂ A Entertainment Crew rocked it like it was an everyday thing,â€¦. You have to listen to hear some of what happened on that golf course and in that country club clubhouse afterâ€¦
We then tell you about our next two events, theÂ Â Exxxotica Miami Show and theÂ JT Money Party at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu Gentlemens Club.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â AEBN Network,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

We try to explain how it is different at Wal-Mart in West Virginia than any other state, how talk about eating dinner at theÂ Sheetz Convenience store and how Taya Parker can draw a crowd and make any counter surface a dancing stage. You have to listen closley to hear about our $13 dollar sandwich from there.
We tell you all about the crowd at theÂ Legz Gentlemens Club, the girls and how we really wanted to steal a couple of them for the hotel room, listen before you judgeâ€¦. The Bad Girls Club Show came up againâ€¦.and we loved it.
TheÂ Screaming O Stage Show and contest gave us all kinds of different stories for this show, some girls can orgasm, some can not, then some others are really good at sucking for sex toysâ€¦
Hear all about Taya Parkerâ€™s stage shows, and how you can never bring enoughÂ Penthouse magazineswith you to Legzâ€¦ Sheâ€™s not prissy like you might think, youâ€™ll hear what we mean after listening to the show.
The drinks, the bar food that tasted good, the sexy girls and the moving wall, yeas we give all kinds of praise to the Legz Martinsburg Gentlemens Club.. Then thereâ€™s Troy and Troy, you have to hear that partâ€¦
We got to meet the guys that own theÂ Warrior Energy Drink Company, we had drinks with them and well we liked them and their energy drink.

		<itunes:summary>Atlanta,GA- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News â€“ In this episode of theÂ Tales From Tony Batman Show,which is being dubbed the detox episode, we give you in graphic detail our experience in Georgia with theÂ Screaming O and A Entertainment News crews.
We give love to our friends at theÂ Sezy Suz Couples Boutique where we did the grand opening last Friday in Athens Georgia, we think they have 138 stores in Georgia now, but donâ€™t quote us on that.
We get to host the world famousÂ Screaming O Stage Show and Contest at two different clubs in two different cities and we also get to work with some of the hottest Screaming O Scream Team Girls we have seen in a while. Atlanta has some really pretty girls and we tried to talk to every single on of them.
We talk about our appearances on Rock 100 in Atlanta with theÂ Regular Guys and Southside Steve, and onPower 100 in Athens during the live remote. We are proud of being as clean and mainstream as possible while still telling about the Sex Toys from the Screaming O.
We did our show at the biggest party spot in Athens Georgia, right in front of the University of Georgia, theBad Manor. They had a lot of drunk girls for us to play with that night. We then go on and on about the Combat Sports Expo held in Atlanta at theÂ Wild Bills Concert Complex and Bar. It was most likely the biggest venue we have been on stage at in the non adult industry world.
We talk about going to the gun range with heÂ Scream Team Girls and shooting machine guns for a few hours, you have to hear the reaction of the owners of theÂ Gun Range, its hilarious.
We are impressed by the fun Text To Screen thing they had atÂ AJA in Downtown Tampa while we were there Wednesday night doing aÂ Tampa Deja Vu promotion, ever give a group of strippers a couple of free bottles of Vodka?, Makes for some funny stories.
We then tell you how we totally messed up our Easter dinner in North Carolina and how our girl Tina was left alone due to our lack of mapping skills. StupidÂ Tony Batman, Stupid
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â Adult Model Call,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>West Palm Beach, FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this feel good nostalgic episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show the crew says its good byes to theÂ Tampa Deja vu Gentlemens Club where we have been on a month long Emcee show, and we give full moon details about our last weekend in Tampa Bay for a while.
You have to hear about the practical joke that played out with caution tape and shaving cream, and you have to hear all about the sexyÂ Samara fromÂ Saginaw Michigan Deja Vu, who made her way to the Tampa Deja Vu for the weekend just to meet the Tony batman Crew.
We tell you who won theÂ Miss Nude International Pageant that was just held in Carbondale Illinois, you have to listen to see who it is, but we can say she is a sexy red head..
We ask the age old question, â€œIs New Orleans Haunted or Mind Bending?â€ The question came up again whenÂ Nicholas Cage was arrested then bailed out of jail by Dog The Bounty Hunter after a strange night on the streets of NOLA.
We have our very own A Entertainment Girl Jennifer Lynn on the show talking about her Feature Dance booking at theÂ Tâ€™s Lounge here in West Palm Beach Florida. We ask her about her time with the country bandÂ Confederate Railroad and then we talk about our next trip with her in West Virginia.
A quick note about the Tampa Deja VuÂ Mansion Party in Tampa that we will miss because weÂ  will be hosting the Screaming O Show in Athens Georgia during the Grand Opening of the latestÂ Sexy Suz Couples Boutique and the after party at the biggest dance club in Athens the â€œBad Manorâ€.
We then try to figure out how we are going to make theÂ Combat Sports Expo sexy as we are going to host a bunch of events there atÂ Wild Bills right outside of Atlanta Georgia with the sexy Screaming O â€œScream Team Girlsâ€. We are so confused, but its going to be a great time anyway.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â Adult Model Call,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

We try to forget last Friday ever happened but we tell you all about our Saturday night that was more than news worthy. The Rodeo was in town and were not just using that as a phrase, theÂ PBR Professional Rodeo was in Tampa Bay and we tell the story of the Big Black Cowboy, denim pimp suit and all..
We take some fun shots at Sunshine and Bootsâ€¦ Two new employees at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu, we got a non counting vote in their hiring, well sort of,Â  you have to listen to hear want we mean. You will also want to know why Tiffany was nicknamed â€œBootsâ€ on just her first night. And Sunshine, well Sunshine is just her name, hear how we handled that one in our classic, foot in our mouth, styleâ€¦.
We have our newest A Entertainment News Girl, and Feature Entertainer,Â Amber Rose on the show to talk about her big weekend headlining atÂ Ervâ€™s Ladies and Gentlemenâ€™s Club in Allentown Pennsylvania. Amber was so nice and sweet on the show, so we all make predictions on how long that will lastâ€¦
We go into our next few weeks of events that will include the Jimmy Buffet Margarita Ville Tailgate party and Concert, we really want to take our team there, listen to our ideasâ€¦
We are booked for aÂ Screaming O Show at the â€œCombat Sports Expoâ€ in Georgia. What? We ask ourselves how we are going to not get pummeled over the weekend by the MMA fighters, even though their girlfriends will probably be in the contestâ€¦ We are also suppose to do the grand opening of the newest Entice Couples Boutique in Georgia with Sexy Suz and Charles..
We tell about all the cool things going on for our gig in West Virginia April 28-30 at theÂ Legz Gentlemens Clubs, we are doing theÂ Screaming O Stage Show and Contest along with Taya Parker. And Joslyn James will be at the Legz Club across town the same weekendâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â Adult Model Call,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- Football,Rock and Roll, Beer and Naked Chicks. Thatâ€™s what we recap on the new Tales From Tony Batman Radio Show this week because we have more stories than hours of sleep from this past weekend.
As always and as promised we are still Keeping It real and making sure there is no fake in our funk, you donâ€™t get that kind of real talk from some of the other shows out thereâ€¦ You know where to go for a good strip club storyâ€¦Right here with us babyâ€¦
We go over our time at theÂ St Petersburg Times Forum for the Arena Football game between theÂ Tampa Bay Storm and the Jacksonville Sharks, most of the discussions is about the Exotic Dancers from theÂ Tampa Deja Vu that we had with us and how you have to drink Guinness in different cups than regular draft beerâ€¦
We Tell of the â€œMake It Rainâ€ guy at the Deja Vu after the Football game and how we wanted to Wrestle us to the ground because we just happen to be there..
Then we tell some of the Rock and Roll Stories from our time at the local Tampa radio stationsÂ â€œ98 Rock Festâ€ where we seenÂ Stone Sour andÂ 3 Doors Down. There were many other great bands like Theory of a Deadman, Seether and Skillet but we did not see them.. Listen to the show to find out why?
We touch on some of the weeks news, theÂ Condoms in porn ruling, the WikiLeaks for the adult Industry, and why there are so many lawsuits in the music industry lately.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â 2001 Live,Â Adult Model Call,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>This week is Stripperfest 9 wrap up. Â Curis our mid west correspondent covered the event in true Curtis style rocking us some great pics to follow this post.
This was version 9 of the Stripperfest francise of shows held at ClubOTB with Brian Hopkins as the gm, Â Now we have had Brian on the show before and is a great gm for the club. Â  There was plenty of action all night long at the competition and the winners we discuss in the show as we find out Curtis is a valiant note taker&#8230;.

As a side note, I guess fun was not had by all, Â especially this man. Â This happened the same night.
Franklin, WI-Â FranklinNow.com- An Illinois man apparently believes a promise is a promise, even if itâ€™s from two unnamed strippers.
According to a Franklin Police report:
The 37-year-old Illinois man, who was staying at a Franklin motel went toÂ On The Border Gentlemenâ€™s club, 10741 S. 27th St., on Sunday night.
The man told police he spent $1,000 on lap dances from two dancers who told him they would come to his hotel room later that morning for private lap dances â€œon the house.â€
When the women failed to show up at the manâ€™s hotel room, he called police at 1:26 a.m. Monday morning believing he had been cheated.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this latest Feel Good episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show the times seems to evaporate like ApplesÂ Worldwide Developers Conference Tickets. The Showâ€™s available for free onÂ iTunes you know..
We tell our story from our time at the TampaÂ Tattoo Fest where the A Entertainment News was a media sponsor. The story of the cyborg half face tattoo and the guy that got one on his Addams apple are too good to miss. We Get up on stage withÂ Cowhead from â€œThe Bone 102.5â€³ a radio station in Tampa Florida
We have Jason from Honey Hole Entertainment on the show this week. Jason who did an impressive job producing theÂ Tattoo Fest but the big event came at the after party at the Scores Gentlemenâ€™s Club and Steakhouse.
Listen to the events of the night as we remember them, from the club. Bikini contests, porn stars and hot honey chicks all night longâ€¦
We talk about our night at the Bliss Cabaret with Adult Actress Angel Vain and then go on to our Emcee weekendÂ  at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu where we thought we saw Belladonna, you be the judge. We give the Vu a call and harass the door girl for a bit, she didnâ€™t even hang up on this oneâ€¦.
We show our respects toÂ Elizabeth Taylor andÂ Pinetop Perkins from theÂ Muddy Waters Band.
Another exciting must listen, Keeping It Real, Show about hot chicks, strip clubs and tattoos. Now thereâ€™s something you can stick a champagne bottle inâ€¦

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- You are going toÂ love this new episode of the popularity surgingÂ Tales From Tony Batman Show.
In this episode we begin with our tale of Green and Pink on St Patrickâ€™s Day, Itâ€™s a Guinness good time for everyone and the birth of Â Â â€œGreen On The Outside, Pink On The Insideâ€ which is a promotion we hosted at theÂ Tampa Deja Vu St. Patrickâ€™s Day night.
In our second â€œKeeping It Realâ€ show we go into our time spent with the girls from the Finals of theÂ Miss PoleChamp USA competition.
The top ladies from each regional were in Tampa to compete for the first ever Miss PoleChamp USA title. We were even graced with A Entertainment News photographer, andÂ â€œYour Killing Me Rickyâ€ star Ricky Rich who flew down from Wisconsin for the show.
We talk about our opening night meet and greet at the Penthouse Club in Tampa, where we did our opening interviews with the girls with our friend and photo genius Alphonso fromÂ Mad Creativity. We had such a great meal at theÂ Penthouse Club we feel compelled to tell you all about it. And you have to listen to Rickyâ€™s Ordering habits when someone else is paying.
Then we go into the Finals show which was held at theÂ Pink Pony Showgirls Gentlemens Club, we hosted the show and Spice from theÂ Bubba The Love Sponge Show emceed for a few hours as well.
The contestants were great, the show went well, and fun was had by all, we tell some funny stories from stage that night and how theÂ fitness pole dance studios almost rumbled during the night
We gloating a bit after beating Strip in theÂ first round of the March Madness Tournament, but give him a chance to make it up by picking the sweet 16 games live on the show, hey we Keep it real, itâ€™s in thereâ€¦
AÂ must listen for those who like to laugh and throw up a little in your throat at the same time..
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars,Â 2001 Live,Â Adult Model Call,Â Tampa Deja Vu, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>This time around we visit with Daisy Duxe. Â When we saw Daisy last we were at AVN 2011 in Vegas and had a chance to go to Ricks Cabaret for two stellar shows. Â Ricks is a great place to hang out and has a great staff that we met that night. Â Daisy rocked the house with two great shows in typical Daisy fashion.
Besides the shows at Ricks we talk about the Stripperfest contest coming up that Daisy is involved in.

		<itunes:summary>Nationwide- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- This episode of the wildly popular Tales From Tony Batman show talks about a plethora of sexy subjects including of course Strip Clubs, Gentlemenâ€™s Clubs, and Cabarets.
We talk about the new trend of Gentlemens Clubs lettingÂ outside promoters work the clubs, with different promotions on different nights though different promoters.
We tell how sexy exotic dancers are reading TonyBatman.com so much now that its internet ranking is passing some of the biggest news sites in the business and now rests in theÂ top 10 in the WORLD. (Pat on Back). We talk about how our readers donâ€™t care as much as others if there are a couple of misspelled words in the story.
We go over the upcomingÂ Miss PoleChamp USA finals at the Pink Pony Showgirls in Tampa Florida that we are hosting, and how itâ€™s on the same night as theÂ NCAA Tournament in Tampa Bay.
Then we go into theÂ Tattoo Fest Event we are one of the media sponsors for in the Tampa Bay area and how it is on the same weekend as theÂ St Petersburg Grand Prix Race.
We clear up the fact that we had nothing to do with theÂ Penthouse G String Awards in New Orleans and that we don;t even know who won.
And then we go over a few fun stories from TonyBatman.com, TheÂ One Legged Stripper and the Rick Ross One Million DollarÂ Strip Club Birthday Party.
Of course we preview our upcoming tour dates in April, one with Joslyn James at the Oklahoma City Little Darlings, and then the Weekend atÂ Legz Clubs in Martinsburg West Virginia withÂ Taya Parker, Joslyn James and theÂ Screaming O Club Show.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars,Â 2001 Live,Â Adult Model Call andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa,FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this special throwback episode of the Tales From Tony Batman Show, we take you back to when we started as a disc jockey in a strip club and how things were in the clubs back then, we give several good laughs explaining how our attire has changed through the years, long live Miami Viceâ€¦
We tell all about our speech we gave at the latestÂ Adult Seminars seminar in Tampa Florida, our bonding moment with the people in the seminar and then our tipsy night at the Deja Vu Gentlemens Club.
We go into a long debate about the trend in strip clubs right now were the â€œHeadliningâ€ entertainment is more then ever the girls who are in the news at that time for scandals and woe. We ask if it is better for the club to hire the IT news girl to appear over a weekend or if it would be better going with a trained Feature Dancer as they have traditionally done in the past.
The question is public opinion and draw vs stage show talent. Do you want to see an awesome themed show from a showgirl that you may not have ever heard of or do you want to just hang out on stage with the girl you seen on TMZ and Entertainment Tonight the past month?
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars,Â 2001 Live,Â Adult Model Call andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.
Listen to the show below, on iTunes or on any of your favorite podcast outlets. The show is produced in the Los Angeles area by the good people atÂ Striptaculous Radio. The Pod-casts have now been downloaded over a million times by fans of the show. Thank you for listening !

		<itunes:summary>Hollywood, CA- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- In this special episode of theÂ Tales From Tony Batman radio show we give you some insight our strip club experiences through out our career. They like to be called Gentlemens Clubs now to start.
We also go into the Oscars and why they are still so boring no matter how they try to spice it up, Kind of like the Adult Expos and Tattoo Expos now a days.. They all claim bigger success but they all seem to be on the same decline.
We went to see out girls of theÂ Le Teaze Burlesque Troupe again. We drank a few too many drinks that night but we think we left with our dignityâ€¦
We tell our entertainment trade secret that we learned from the US Government as a youngster, and why fun was had by all can save anything.
We are spending a lot of time in theÂ Deja Vu/Â Hustler Clubs as of late, and we reminisce about when we were exclusive with the company years ago. New York, New Orleans, Tampa and St Louis were just a few of the places we got to go and WORK with them during grand openings.
We talk some Charlie Sheen of course, who in the media isnâ€™t right now, we just want to be winners.
Melissa Molinaro, our formerÂ Screaming O spokes model and her Old Navy commercial where everyone in the news is saying she is trying to be like Kin Kardashian. We give our opinion, you know Melissa has musical talent..
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars,Â 2001 Live, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa, Fl- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News-Â  This episode is almost entirely about our weekend as the Emcee at the Tampa Florida Deja Vuâ€¦ We asked the question â€œWill something interesting happen this weekend at the Strip Club since it was a full moon?â€
The answer takes up the entire show, we had a series of events that included blowing up electric transformers, being in aÂ  dark room with hundreds of people. Catching a counterfeiter and then watching him get away. The Police visited multiple times, and fun was had by all, sort ofâ€¦..
And through all of this we still had to try to make sure we did not spend the weekend alone, if you know what we mean..
We did take a few hours and made out way to go see the ladies of Le Teaze Burlesque Troupe at the Eyez Wide Shut Club, we are going to hold on our stories on that one, but it has to do with the sphincter muscle and every girls ability to gapeâ€¦
You will just have to listen to the story on the show, its odd, funny and a little sad, just like our real livesâ€¦ Enjoyâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars,Â 2001 Live, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Wichita Falls Texas- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- This is the episode from hell where we tell you about all that happened during out trip to Dallas Texas for Superbowl week. The party problems, the iced over roads, the 400 accidents in one day on one highway while heading to Wichita Falls to see Feature Dancer Jennifer Lynn.
We also go back over the night in Tampa Florida when we hosted theÂ Miss Nude Florida Pageant at the Deja Vu Gentlemens Club. There are some more fun stories from there.
We talk about the Grammys and how something just was not right with them this yearâ€¦ Some funny opinion stuff on that subject.
We are loving Florida right now and the temperatures in the 70â€²s every day, donâ€™t get angry with us when you hear us brag about not being in the snow.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars,Â 2001 Live, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Tampa, FL- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News- Join us for this very cool episode of the Tales From Tony Batman where we talk about the Miss Nude Florida Pageant that we hosted in Tampa Floria at the Deja Vu Showgirls Gentlemens Club.
We had a great show and tell you about the trick that was played on us while we were on the stage hosting the event, itâ€™s a funny story and you have to hear it.
We also talk to Feature Entertainer Jennifer Lynn who is making her comeback in the industry with her first Gentlemens Club booking in years. Jennifer tells us about her upcoming trip to Texas and what she has planned for us in the near future.
We talk about the superbowl in Dallas and how we made plans to be at the Rickâ€™s Cabaret in Dallas the night before the big game.
We also talk about our Xbiz Awards nomination for â€œBest Marketing Campaignâ€ of the year for our Screaming O Club Show tour that we have been on all year long.
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars, andÂ Wet Personal Lubricants,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Jupiter Florida- Tony Batmanâ€™sÂ A Entertainment News- After we did our week of shooting, we had so much fun on the set that we invited the cast and crew from the mainstream horror film â€œGirls Gone Deadâ€ to be on our show to talk about how it all went down.
The movie had around 45 actual shooting days and several different locations and actors, the one thing that remained the same was the incredible crew and co directors Michael Hoffman andÂ Aaron Wells.
We had so many people on the show I can not even begin to tell you all of their names, the best phone call was to a â€˜Wrong Numberâ€ where I insisted I was right and the poor lady on the other end turned into a different person as she â€œExplainedâ€ to me just how wrong I wasâ€¦
We had several stars besides us at our week of shooting on location, Wrestling and Andy Kaufman star Jerry â€˜The Kingâ€ Lawler,The Legend Ron Jeremy,Â  Penthouse Pets Ryan Keely andÂ Janessa Brazil,Â Howard Stern Show characters Sal the Stockbroker and Beatlejuice.
This is a great show with a bunch of information on it, so we ask that you listen to it in it;s entirety.
While I on set one of the days, I did som flirting with a middle aged lady wearing a red dress. All I got in in return was this crazy eyed look from her, I did not stop trying and I never got to first base with her. Turns out she happens to be one of the main scary actresses in the movie and after the shoot was over she told me show was amerced in character. I replied sure if you were playing a bitch in the movie, you would have it down patâ€¦.Again turns out show was, now that her part in the movie is over, I have gotten all the way to second baseâ€¦ I am slow but that makes for a great story how inept I am a laying hot women if they donâ€™t just GIVE it to me. Listen you will love itâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars,Â Wet Personal Lubes,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.

		<itunes:summary>Las Vegas- Tony Batmanâ€™s A Entertainment News-Â  In this thrilling episode ofÂ  Tales from Tony Batman we bring you the inside story about the Rickâ€™s Cabaret in Las Vegas. We spent a sexy and fun eventing at theRickâ€™s Las Vegas while we were in town for the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo and the CES Electronics Show.
We tell all about out time with Gary Dellâ€™Abate and his appearance at Rickâ€™s for a book signing for his now book â€œThey Call Me Baba Booeyâ€
We also hang out with Feature DancerÂ Daisy Duxe who writes a blog for the A Entertainment News and was performing live at the Rickâ€™s during the event. We have hosted several event with Daisy in the past and always had a good time with her, this even was no different, shots always taste better with friends.
We again praise Rickâ€™s Cabaret GM Andy Studabaker for the way he handled the event, we were truly impressed with how it all went off.
We also talk about out time at the CES Electronics show and how we met Ozzy and Lady Gaga there, it was a good time for sure and we tell you all about it.
If you listen to the entire show you even get to hear about our awesome public blow job we got outside the Sand Convention center, in front of a bus load of tourists no less, Vegas is always good times, actually we have a good time in every city we go toâ€¦
We give props to our sponsors theÂ Screaming O,Â Adult Seminars,Â Honey Hole Entertainment,Â  we are thankful to have such great companies on tour with us.
