<p>There&#8217;s a lot of discussion on Twitter, Quora, blogs, et al. about whether we&#8217;re in another Internet bubble.<a title="New Rules for the New Internet Bubble" href="http://steveblank.com/2011/03/18/new-rules-for-the-new-bubble/" target="_blank"> Steve Blank makes a</a> <a title="New Rules for the New Internet Bubble" href="http://steveblank.com/2011/03/18/new-rules-for-the-new-bubble/" target="_blank">compelling case for a bubble</a>; while we see no errors in his reasoning it&#8217;s a red herring for those of us in Atlanta.</p>
<p>This phenomena is occurring outside of the Southeast. Deal flow is better than in years past but it hasn&#8217;t approached levels reached during the dot-com bubble. A few investors looking to add startup investing for portfolio have returned to real estate lured by the ease of credit and firesale of certain asset classes. Competition for seed funding and series A is still very high e.g. Toomah and ScoutMob. There just isn&#8217;t any evidence to support a bubble in Atlanta.</p>
<p>None of this should make you change your plans. Of the many different things you need to think about, this isn&#8217;t one of them. Keep your head down and focus on execution. The fundamentals of the startup game haven&#8217;t changed. Your goal is to build a business and generate profit for your shareholders.</p>
<p>Whatever all of us are doing is working. The startup ecosystem is very strong; we can&#8217;t emphasize that point enough. We have a solid base of knowledgable, experienced entrepreneurs. We have a groundswell of young entrepreneurs. We have a wealth of people across industries who are donating their time to startups. Investors are returning because they&#8217;re seeing good businesses with good teams. Innovation is happening here. Right now.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-153" title="Hello Savannah!" src="http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/savannah21.png" alt="Hello Savannah!" width="420" height="245" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126" title="changes" src="http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/changes.png" alt="changes" width="382" height="157" /><br />
<br style="clear:both" /><em>Crossposted from <a title="_blank" href="http://www.unblakeable.com" target="_blank">Unblakeable.com</a>&#8230;</em></p>
<p>2010 marks a new direction for <a title="StartupLounge" href="../" target="_blank">StartupLounge</a>.  We are shifting our conversation away from funding businesses to building businesses.  This doesn’t mean that we think that funding businesses is unimportant.  However, other grassroots organizations are picking up that banner and our voice, frankly, is no longer needed in that particular discussion.  For any organization to remain relevant, it must evolve.</p>
<p><span id="more-123"></span>So, to get to the point:  We believe that the “capital availability” discussion has fundamentally changed.  There is capital available, even now.  Deals are getting funded, even now.  And, it is, as always and as it should be, tough to get funded.  Atlanta does not generally fund science projects; we fund businesses that we understand and where we have a natural advantage, such as information security, mobile technology, business informatics, payments and transaction processing and media content.  We are showing increasing comfort with cleantech deals and medical devices.  We generally don’t fund consumer products (although four such deals have been funded through connections made at StartupLounge so far), social networking deals, and pharmaceutically-based biotechnology.</p>
<p>We know that capital is available because we  see deals getting funded.  We see the investors come to StartupLounge Atlanta (formerly known as CapitalLounge) and AngelLounge.  They are engaging as mentors in PitchCamp.  And it’s not just us.  <a title="StartupRiot" href="http://startupriot.com/" target="_blank">StartupRiot</a> has become a must-attend event and the investors turn out in force there.  <a title="StartupChicks" href="http://www.startupchicks.net/" target="_blank">StartupChicks</a> is seeing investor interest.  I saw a few investors at Startup Atlanta’s inagural event.  The <a title="Atlanta Technology Angels" href="http://www.angelatlanta.com/" target="_blank">Atlanta Technology Angels </a>have gotten “back on the line”.  Welcome back, guys.  We missed you.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem.  The deal flow here is just not good enough.  Just so there’s no mistake – there are not enough good companies worthy of investment in Atlanta.  There are good entrepreneurs, and some really good ideas, but the companies themselves are half-baked.  Not ready for prime time.  So, rather than simply complaining about the weather, we’re going to do something about it.  Putting half-baked companies in front of investors is not all that productive.  Oh sure it feels good and everyone loves the sweet and sour meatballs.  But,<a title="Force of Good - Nobody Told Me" href="http://blog.weatherby.net/2010/02/nobody-told-me.html" target="_blank"> as Lance so eloquently articulated</a>, there are lots of organizations out there trying to help.  We need to make sure we are really helping in order to remain relevant, or we can just shut it down and I can play more <a title="Star Trek Online" href="http://www.startrekonline.com/" target="_blank">Star Trek Online </a>(an astonishingly good game, BTW.  I am terrified it will one day assimilate my life.)</p>
<p>Atlanta has lots of marketing professionals, accountants, lawyers, strategic consultants, coders, engineers, and outsourced CFOs.  And <a href="http://www.hawcpa.com/_home/michael_blake.asp" target="_blank">business appraisers</a>.  We don’t see a great many crack salesmen and operators.  They may be out there, but because they know how to sell and operate, they either don’t need to raise money or they already have.   Which means they don’t need us.</p>
<p>If companies don’t sell well and/or operate well, that in itself is a big hurdle to overcome.  So, at StartupLounge, we are going to focus our attention on companies that either a) already have strong operating and sales potential/talent, or b) have other pieces in place and we can help them build more complete companies.  Here’s what that means in more practical terms.</p>
<p>First, StartupLounge Atlanta is going to be smaller. It’s cool to fill up a room and it’s a great boost to the ego.  It’s also not as effective as it could be so we are focusing on quality over quantity.  It is going to be harder for companies to get in.  This is an absolute necessity for the following reasons -</p>
<ol>
<li>We don’t want to encourage mediocrity.  Entrepreneurship is about excellence.  Only companies that investors perceive to be excellent are going to be funded.  And, we want to encourage entrpereneurs to keep improving their companies to improve their chances at being issued an invitation the following quarter.</li>
<li>We need to keep investors interested by showing better deal flow.  When investors spend 3 hours talking to people and at most run into a deal or two that’s even interesting, they think twice about continuing to show up.</li>
<li>We need to keep entrepreneurs interested by improving the investor/entrpreneur ratio.</li>
<li>With finite resources, we need to focus our effort on those companies we are in the best position to help.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what does it mean that it will be “harder to get in”?  Well, to be blunt, just because you’ve gotten in before, it doesn’t mean that you will next time.  Our criteria for admission will be (roughly) will boil down to this:  If we heard your pitch and you were a complete stranger, would we be inclined to introduce you to our personal contacts in the venture (note we didn’t say “investor”) community in Atlanta?  Things that will help you get in will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can make sense of your business.  StartupLounge is allowed to have a rambling manifesto.  You’re not if you want to come to our events.</li>
<li>We can do some background research online on you and your business (Facebook, LinkedIn, and a company web site).  If you’re basically a blind box, we’re not likely to keep someone known out to let you in</li>
<li>Your business appears to have the potential to grow to $50 MM in value in 5-7 years (you’re not a “lifestyle” business.  Lifestyle businesses are fine but you’re not our target market)</li>
<li>Your business is driven by critical intellectual property that you or your business owns (not licenses)</li>
<li>You have some form of customer validation by way of beta testing, alpha testing, letters of testimonial or even *gasp* paying customers.  Honestly, why would you spend time and money developing a business to produce something that you have no clue if someone will buy?  Market research does not answer that question.  Conversations with customers do.</li>
<li>You make substantive progress over time.  If you’re “just waiting for capital”, you can continue waiting on someone else’s nickel</li>
<li>Your business is looking for a reasonable amount of capital.  If you’re looking for $10 MM for example, just hire an investment bank</li>
<li>Better yet, your business is viable with or without external capital.  Capital would accelerate, not enable, your business</li>
<li>You’re in the business more or less full-time</li>
</ul>
<p>The refinements above should improve the overall event by making it more accessible, with more, higher-quality connections being made.  Oh, and by the way, the color coded badges are gone.  Done.  We don’t want investors to feel like targets anymore, and we want to impress upon everyone that there are many kinds of connections that can help build the company other than with check-writers.  Many attendees have told us that connections made at StartupLounge helped sell product, find talent, find technology and find strategic partners.  With a smaller event, color-coded name badges should be less important anyway.  If we let them in the door, assume those people are worth introducing yourself to.</p>
<p>Second, we’re not letting investors off the hook.  You can’t just say you’re an angel investor and get a free ride.  We have asked all AngelLounge participants to sign a commitment that indicates:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have the funds to invest if they so choose</li>
<li>They will commit to attend at least one StartupLounge event per year</li>
<li>They will participate in at least one PitchCamp/StartupSeminar per year</li>
</ul>
<p>This is already working.  One angel attended the first StartupSeminar and he said that document was the reason why.  Others have withdrawn from AngelLounge, feeling that they do not meet our definition of an active angel investor.  Again, we’re focusing on smaller groups to make a bigger impact.  We’d rather have 15 real angels in the room than 50 who say they are and then have to try to play a game of Clue to figure out who the actual check-writers are.</p>
<p>Third, we are changing our educational focus.  It’s no longer all about PitchCamp and raising money.  If you don’t meet our admission criteria for StartupLounge Atlanta right now, we are offering free help to get you there.  We are launching monthly StartupSeminars.  The StartupSeminars will include PitchCamp on the months directly preceeding a StartupLounge Atlanta event, but mostly, they will cover topics that help entrepreneurs build companies  Specifically, we are targeting areas of knowledge that are important, and might be too expensive for entrpreneurs to access directly.  Our first StartupSeminar, “Get Retail Ready”, was a smash success.  After PitchCamp in February, we have Kenji Kuramoto and <a title="AcuityCFO" href="http://www.acuitycfo.com/" target="_blank">AcuityCFO</a> coming in to lead a workshop on building financial models for startups.  We are working on legal workshops, sales workshops, bootstrapping workshops, hiring workshops and other toolsy content that you can take home with you and move your venture forward starting that day.  Our podcasts will still occasionally cover funding topics, but we already have 30 or so of those podcasts online.  We’re going to focus more on entrepreneurs who have built businesses and can share real world advice that entrepreneurs can use as tools to move their own ventures forward.</p>
<p>Fourth, as a personal commitment, I am re-starting my monthly office hours, without fail.  An announcement on that will come soon.  My job has taken me out of one of the things I like doing most, which is mentoring.  No longer.</p>
<p>We are excited about this new direction.  We are re-energized.  Our sponsors have voiced universal approval, as have the investors, entrepreneurs and friends of StartupLounge to whom we have spoken.  We think we are going to help more entrepreneurs be successful, whether they raise funding or not.  Some of our community, for now, will be left behind.  We hope you will take it as a challenge to be met for the betterment of your company.  For most of you in the community, the result is going to be a more focused, effective StartupLounge, and we can’t wait to get started.</p>

<p><strong>Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>AJ</strong>: Recently there was some drama around an academic paper co-authored by Georgia Tech professor Danny Bresnitz.  In the paper, the authors came to a number of conclusions about the Atlanta startup ecosystem – what do you guys think?  I’d also be curious to hear Gordon Rogers’ thoughts on this topic as well.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Karl</strong>: Scott/Mike, I just discovered your podcast and absolutely love it! I have an issue that you guys can hopefully help me with.  I have been asked by a friend of mine to function as the Company&#8217;s CFO and Treasurer during the development phase of the Company. The agreement is for this not to be more than 20 hours per week and involves maintaining the accounting records, preparing corporate tax filings, develop the business plan and to assist in the search for venture or angel capital funding. Whatever equity interest I agree to take will be substantially diminished by the introduction of outside capital. I have some thoughts of my own, but I&#8217;m interested to see what you guys think is a fair way to go about measuring this?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Guest Bios:</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Gordon Rogers, President, Atlanta Technology Angels</em><em><br />
</em></span></p>
<p>Gordon is an economist, entrepreneur and angel investor. After working as a financial analyst, in 1988 he established a business (Meliora Systems, Inc.) that created one of the pioneering products in the corporate e-learning &amp; talent management field (Ingenium). He guided the growth of the company from a start-up to IPO through a merger in 1998 with Paul Allen&#8217;s company, Asymetrix Learning Systems (ASYM). This exit event yielded a 12X return for initial investors in the business.</p>
<p>After leaving ASYM/CLKS/SUMT in 2000, he spent the next several years investing in and serving on the advisory boards of various tech startups in the e-learning and online coaching sectors. He now focuses primarily on helping early stage ventures in the the digital media and edutainment sectors raise capital and create strategic partnerships.</p>
<p>He is President of <a title="_blank" href="http://www.angelatlanta.com" target="_blank">Atlanta Technology Angels</a>, and a member of <a title="_blank" href="http://www.startuplounge.com/tag/angellounge/" target="_blank">Angel Lounge</a> , the MIT Enterprise Forum, and the Atlanta CEO Council. He is also Managing Director of Vernon Bridge Ventures, an early stage capital/advisory firm. He serves on the boards of Rapid LD and Good Egg Studios.  He is also an angel investor in <a title="_blank" href="http://www.elfisland.com" target="_blank">Elf Island</a>, a new social MMO for kids.</p>
<p>He has extensive experience serving on boards of non-profit organizations (YMCA of Greater Atlanta, Interfaith Outreach Home, Teacher Support Network, The Lionheart School). He received the 2006 Volunteer of the Year Award from the YMCA of Metro Atlanta. He recently completed his first Olympic distance triathlon to raise money for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.</p>

<p>Podsafe music used within this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Underground </em>by Roadside Attraction</li>

<li><em>All the Money in the World </em>by Hutch</li>
</ul>
<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.  And if you still think our shows are too long, frankly, we just don&#8217;t care.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft sponsor_logo" style="border: 1px dotted #a0a0a0; margin: 10px; padding: 2px" title="Lee Provow" src="http://www.startuplounge.com/images/guests/flemingsung.gif" alt="Stephen Fleming and David Sung, ATDC" width="122" height="144" align="left" />Welcome to SL #42! Unless you&#8217;ve been under a rock for the past few weeks, you are no doubt aware that change is in the air down at the <a title="_blank" href="http://www.atdc.org" target="_blank">ATDC</a>.  Stephen Fleming, recently promoted from his post overseeing Georgia Tech&#8217;s VentureLab is now the Vice Provost of the Enterprise Innovation Institute, and has folded VentureLab and the SBIR program into the new ATDC. Additionally, they&#8217;ve implemented a billion changes &#8230; and man, they&#8217;re good.  Stephen stopped by along with David Sung, who runs the ATDC Seed Fund, and we had a blast.  If you are an entrepreneur in Georgia, an investor that would like to gain a deeper understanding of these changes, you won&#8217;t want to miss this podcast.</p>
<p>We also dug up some old incriminating tape of Stephen sharing his true feelings on running VentureLab &#8230; <em><strong>a rare moment for sure</strong></em> &#8211; definitely tune in for that.  We also discussed the upcoming Venture Atlanta 2009 conference, and some of the new opportunities (and focus) on true early-stage companies.  Good stuff.</p>
<p>The good Mr. Blake suits up, takes the mound, and throws heaters at a a group of folks in Atlanta that just can&#8217;t seem to get with the program.  Another great selection of listener emails and a dash of StartupLounge humor to top it all off. Enjoy!<br style="clear:left" /><br />

<p><strong>Shownotes and Interview Questions:</strong></p>
<p>As usual, we had lots of related follow-up questions and side discussions, but here is a good sampling of the questions we asked on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give us the pitch for the new ATDC, EII, adn the ATDC Seed Fund!</li>
<li>Talk about the ATDC re-organization.  Why now and why this way?</li>
<li>How long have you had the idea for re-organizing the ATDC/VentureLab/SBIR entities the way you have?</li>
<li>How is the reorganization going to impact the ATDC Seed Fund&#8217;s operations?</li>
<li>How will the reorganization impact your deal flow?</li>
<li>As you were being considered for your new post, clearly this was on your agenda.  How prominent were these ideas as you discussed the new position?</li>
<li>Why should entrepreneurs be excited about the reorganization?</li>
<li>Is the ATDC still considering a bricks-and-mortar facility in Gwinnett County?</li>
<li>Will the reorganization change how you make investment decisions and commitments?</li>
<li>Could the reorganization increase ties with state entities with similar missions, such as the GRA Seed Fund or some of the programs the Georgia Department of Economic Development?</li>
<li>How long will it take to complete the reorganization?</li>
<li>What has the reaction been from the VC community to the reorganization?</li>
<li>What are existing companies within the ATDC saying about the reorganization?</li>
<li>Why is GA Tech on board with this concept?  You are seemingly diverting away captive resources.</li>
<li>As you execute upon the reorganization, what do you see as the greatest challenge?</li>
<li>What do you see as the greatest need that the reorganization will address?</li>
<li>How do you see your role as a startup catalyst changing?</li>
<li>How will you measure success?</li>
<li>How long until we see the changes on the ground?</li>
<li>In the ATDC press release, you said, &#8220;ATDC will open its membership to all technology entrepreneurs in Georgia, from those at the earliest conception stage to the well-established, venture-fundable companies. We’re interested in any technology business opportunity.&#8221;  How much more open will the organization be to supporting early-stage companies?</li>
<li>Does the ATDC need an image makeover to get buy-in from entrepreneurs and if so, how do you go about that makeover?</li>
<li>You have started making open office hours available.  Is that going to become a permanent activity?</li>
<li>If you were to give one piece of advice to entrepreneurs listening to this podcast, what would it be?</li>

<p><strong>Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Alicia</strong>: I am currently at a crossroads in my business. I started the company in 2004 and filed a provisional patent application in Oct. 2008 based on some methodologies that I created in working with my small business clients. I have financed my company via &#8220;bootstrapping&#8221; and have now reached a point where I realize that I need a capital &#8220;angel.&#8221; I need to develop a prototype for the technology I&#8217;ve created, but I&#8217;m not sure if I should raise funds, seek a technology partner, or simply sell/license the idea. Any advice and support is greatly appreciated.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Erica:</strong> I am launching a new internet business and I need to get a quote for web design work.  My question is this.  How can someone get an accurate quote for Web design on their new internet business without giving away the idea?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Karthik:</strong> I am sick of all the conflicting messages and behavioral “to-do lists” from investors!  One investor says he wants to see 10-12 slides in my pitch, another guy tells me that with only 12 slides I didn’t give him enough information.  One investor told me that he expects his entrepreneurs to have maxed out credit cards before he will take me seriously, and another investor told me that maxing out personal credit cards was a sign that I take too much risk and am potentially irresponsible with money, as it is expensive debt.  It seems like investors nitpick on everything, and I am spending a lot of time lately creating revisions of presentations and other documents just to make some potential investor happy.  Any advice?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Rob MacArthur: </strong>Scott, I read your post &#8220;<a title="_blank" href="http://www.scottburkett.com/index.php/entrepreneurship/2006-07-23/creating-a-winning-advisory-board.html" target="_blank">Creating a Winning Advisory Board</a>&#8221; &#8211; and had a question. I am currently in need of such a board. I have a list of potential board members and have done up a short package for them. I will send an introductory letter or email and attached will be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 page summary on why I need a board;</li>
<li>1 page on expectations, mix of board I am looking for;</li>
<li>1 page on existing businesses;</li>
<li>1 page reference letter for those who do not know me at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>From your perspective, is this too much info/not enough? Any thoughts or advice on what should/should not be included would be appreciated.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.  And if you still think our shows are too long, frankly, we just don&#8217;t care.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Welcome to SL #42! Unless you've been under a rock for the past few weeks, you are no doubt aware that change is in the air down at the ATDC.nbsp; Stephen Fleming, recently promoted from his post overseeing Georgia Tech's VentureLab is now the Vice Provost of the Enterprise Innovation Institute, and has folded VentureLab and the SBIR program into the new ATDC. Additionally, they've implemented a billion changes ... and man, they're good.nbsp; Stephen stopped by along with David Sung, who runs the ATDC Seed Fund, and we had a blast.nbsp; If you are an entrepreneur in Georgia, an investor that would like to gain a deeper understanding of these changes, you won't want to miss this podcast.

We also dug up some old incriminating tape of Stephen sharing his true feelings on running VentureLab ... a rare moment for sure - definitely tune in for that.nbsp; We also discussed the upcoming Venture Atlanta 2009 conference, and some of the new opportunities (and focus) on true early-stage companies.nbsp; Good stuff.

The good Mr. Blake suits up, takes the mound, and throws heaters at a a group of folks in Atlanta that just can't seem to get with the program.nbsp; Another great selection of listener emails and a dash of StartupLounge humor to top it all off. Enjoy!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="sponsor_logo" style="border: 1px dotted #a0a0a0; margin: 10px; padding: 2px" title="Mike Blake, StartupLounge/AWE" src="http://www.startuplounge.com/images/guests/awe-june-2009.png" alt="Mike Blake, StartupLounge/AWE" align="left" />Welcome to SL #41! Mike Schinkel was kind enough to ask us down to speak at the monthly gathering of the <a title="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/atlantawebentrepreneurs/" target="_blank">Atlanta Web Entrepreneurs</a> (AWE) group.  Initially, we were going to host a panel on raising capital (or something similar), but after a few conversations, the three of us decided to change it up a bit.  We presented our view of the current state of the Atlanta startup scene, how far we&#8217;ve come in just a few short years, and where we think it is going.  We also issues a call to action to members of the Atlanta startup community to help us build what we call the &#8220;Atlanta Startup Cloud&#8221; &#8211; a virtual incubator.</p>
<p>Apologies to everyone for us going over our time limit.  We quite literally threw the presentation together a day or two before the event.  In retrospect, we probably could have done a better job in marrying our content to Schinkel&#8217;s schedule.  We will most likely have an initial meeting with all the volunteers, then have another community meeting which will be a *very brief* presentation of where the group is, and to solicit additional ideas and direction.  As Schink points out in his opening remarks, this particular meeting was just the first meeting of many, and will eventually involve a lot of other groups within the community (not just AWE).<span id="more-108"></span></p>
<p>This edition of the StartupLounge.com podcast is actually a screencast/video.  You can use the links below to view.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In short, our Startup Cloud concept is an effort to address provide several key services to the community:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a &#8220;jumpoff&#8221; point &#8211; where new entrepreneurs and investors can &#8220;get plugged into&#8221; what is happening within the Atlanta early-stage scene.</li>
<li>Provide better event coordination between the bazillion startup groups in Atlanta &#8211; i.e. shared calendar .. yay!</li>
<li>Provide a &#8220;virtual incubator&#8221; whereby the community incubates itself</li>
<li>Provide a vehicle to bridge into the corporate world, to bring Atlanta&#8217;s corporate players to the table to look at the innovations that are happening here (side note: Since this meeting, we&#8217;ve made some progress on this front &#8211; looks like we have quite a number of Fortune 1000 companies already interested in hosting events and playing an active role in this).</li>
</ol>
<p>This was a platform that we started building about a year ago, but as we mention in the presentation, it will take us 20 years to finish the thing given our current schedules.  So, we decided that opening up the initiative to the community is an even better way to go &#8211; more hands involved, and more importantly, additional voices and input.</p>
<p>Oh, and for the person who emailed me about the &#8220;Boss Hogg&#8221; slide &#8211; the three personas illustrated are not a reference to anyone specifically, but rather stereotypes that we&#8217;ve all come to know and love.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our A/V guy had to leave the event after the break, so we were unable to record the audio Q&amp;A session at the end.  Which is probably a good thing, because some of it went a bit tangential.  But we did take copious notes, so we&#8217;ll be putting something up online soon.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we pitched a very abstract concept, and managed to get an absolute boatload of people to sign up to volunteer to pitch in and help with the project.  Since the night of the AWE meeting, we&#8217;ve since reached out to some of our VC and startup contacts in North Carolina, and they are interested in simultaneously launching the Startup Cloud concept in North Carolina as well.</p>
<p>We have been woefully behind in our reaching out to those who have volunteered to help.  Thanks for your patience!</p>
<p>More soon &#8230;</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

At the end of the day, we pitched a very abstract concept, and managed to get an absolute boatload of people to sign up to volunteer to pitch in and help with the project.nbsp; Since the night of the AWE meeting, we've since reached out to some of our VC and startup contacts in North Carolina, and they are interested in simultaneously launching the Startup Cloud concept in North Carolina as well.

We have been woefully behind in our reaching out to those who have volunteered to help.nbsp; Thanks for your patience!

More soon ...

Enjoy!

There have been a number of new venture funds cropping up in Atlanta lately, which is helping to propel Atlanta&#8217;s early stage scene.  One of those funds, Value Plus Ventures (co-founded by former Noro-Moseley partner Steve Nusrallah), has entered the market with a very unique, hybrid venture model.  There have been a lot of questions floating around about the viability and credibility of their model, so we invited VPV partner Lee Provow to come on and share their story.  We&#8217;re not big fans of the &#8220;consultative&#8221; venture model, but I&#8217;ll tell you, we were pleasantly surprised with what we learned.</p>
<p>Unblakeable brings the heat behind the wheel of the bus, this time knocking some pretenders silly.  And, to commemorate Memorial Day, Scott spontaneously bursts into song with an acappella stadium rendition of the Star Spangled Banner (yes, lol &#8211; that is really Scott singing &#8211; your call as to whether it is comedy, tragedy, or both). Another great selection of listener emails and a dash of StartupLounge humor to top it all off. Enjoy!<br style="clear:left" /><br />

<p><strong>Shownotes and Interview Questions:</strong></p>
<p>As usual, we had lots of related follow-up questions and side discussions, but here is a good sampling of the questions we asked on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give us the 30-second elevator pitch on Value Plus Ventures</li>
<li>Describe your consulting/investing hybrid model</li>
<li>The model sounds as if you invest in companies with the result that they turn around and pay you for consulting fees?  Is that an accurate picture?</li>
<li>How does the hybrid model differ from any active early stage investment firm&#8217;s model?</li>
<li>Are there other investment firms that have had success with a similar model?</li>
<li>Have you found the model makes it harder or easier to do deals?</li>
<li>Why did you choose that model?</li>
<li>Your web site mentions that VPV will look at deals across most any sector – but are there sectors or trends that are of particular interest to you right now?</li>
<li>Can you talk about some deals that VPV has done recently?</li>
<li>Was it hard to raise this fund, given the economic climate?</li>
<li>What is the story you tell potential limited partners that excites them about investing in Georgia and the Southeastern US?</li>
<li>How long does your deal evaluation process take?</li>
<li>How do deals generally find you?</li>
<li>What is the impact of the current economic climate on your investing behavior?</li>
<li>What impact is the current economic climate having on your portfolio companies?</li>
<li>What advice do you give to entrepreneurs regarding addressing the current economic environment?</li>
<li>What impact is the current economic climate having on your deal flow?</li>
<li>What is the VPV view of the Atlanta and Southeast early stage venture scene right now?</li>
<li>When looking at a deal or an entrepreneur, what gets you very excited?</li>
<li>When dealing with you guys, what’s one thing that’s an absolute no-no?</li>
<li>How involved are you day to day with your portfolio companies?</li>
<li>If you were to “sell” yourself to an entrepreneur to take you on as an investor, what do you think is your biggest selling point?</li>
<li>What is a piece of advice you would give to new early-stage investors?</li>
<li>If you could change something in the environment to make your jobs easier, what would that be?</li>
<li>What is the best way to get an opportunity in front of you?</li>
<li>If you were to give one piece of advice to entrepreneurs that might want to approach you for capital, what would that be?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bill:</strong> I have reached the point where I am talking to an angel investor about my project. They are interested and trying to evaluate whether my invention has the potential to succeed. O.K. that’s great… but my mind is reeling, what happens next? What are the next steps to when an angel does say, “Yes, I want to get involved and supply you with funding.”???I want to stay ahead of the curve, and not get caught flat footed, if I get the green light.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>MarketMaker John:</strong> All investors are obviously looking for a strong return on their investments. I&#8217;m interested in those who want a high capital ROI but also want those investments to simultaneously influence positive change in the world. I am of the belief that “social” and “capital” investments do not need to be separate. How do I find investors that share this same viewpoint? Do they exist?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>MGreene:</strong> Scott has said many times before that entrepreneurs should never be afraid to reinvent themselves (as it pertains to the direction and focus of their company).  Thinking about that earlier today made me curious about something.  If you guys (Scott and Mike) could create StartupLounge all over again, what would you do differently?</p></blockquote>

<p>Podsafe music used within this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Underground </em>by Roadside Attraction</li>
<li><em>10,000 Friends on MySpace </em>by Project Sisyphus</li>
<li><em>All the Money in the World </em>by Hutch</li>
</ul>
<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We unfortunately have to announce that we are moving the date of the upcoming CapitalLounge event to <strong>June 10, 2009</strong>.  The time and location will remain the same.</p>
<p>We have made this decision so as to avoid a conflict with the BIO conference that week, which is the largest biotechnology investing and innovation trade conference in the United States and is being held in Atlanta this year.  We are concerned that too many entrepreneurs with biotechnology businesses (medical devices, drug discovery) and investors will be forced to make an unfortunate choice between CapitalLounge and missing part of the BIO conference.  Therefore, while we are confident in our ability to hold a well-attended and energetic event, we don&#8217;t want to put our bio/medical technology community members in a bad position.</p>
<p>In the interest of encouraging the fullest participation possible in CapitalLounge, we have made the decision to move the event to June 10th.  The status of your invitations to the event is unchanged.  If you have received an invitation, it is still valid. If you have not yet received a response from us regarding your application, there is no need to re-apply &#8211; just stay tuned as we&#8217;re still evaluating the flood of applications for the event.  If you received an acceptance of your application to attend, but can no longer make the event, please drop a quick reply to this email so we can remove you from the list and make room for someone else.</p>
<p>We will send reminders as over the next few weeks.  We apologize for any convenience the change might cause, and look forward to seeing as many of you as possible on June 10th.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>

In our first broadcast from our new recording home in the plush new offices of <a title="_blank" href="http://www.hawcpa.com" target="_blank">HA&amp;W</a> (a staunch sponsor and advocate of our efforts here at StartupLounge), we sat down and a fantastic chat with John Glushik of Intersouth Partners.  In addition to the staple series of questions we ask of every investor that appears on the show, we also had a very interesting discussion comparing the similarities and differences of the startup scenes in North Carolina and Georgia.  We hit a number of other topics as well, including Intersouth&#8217;s investment in Atlanta-based Purewire, and some of the ramifications of cloud-computing and SaaS models.</p>
<p>The bus is back, and man is the driver upset.  Scott brings the hammer down on another misguided service provider who recently took advantage of a local entrepreneur. Another great selection of listener emails and a dash of StartupLounge humor to top it all off. Enjoy!<br style="clear:left" /><br />

<p><strong>Shownotes and Interview Questions:</strong></p>
<p>As usual, we had lots of related follow-up questions and side discussions, but here is a good sampling of the questions we asked on the show:</p>

<li>How does the general preparedness of entrepreneurs in North Carolina contrast to that of Georgia?</li>

<li>In which Atlanta-area companies has Intersouth made investments?</li>
<li>What is Intersouth doing to establish a name or presence in the local market?</li>

<p><strong>Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Kevin (from Michigan):</strong> I am loving the show and think you guys are doing an awesome job. I stumbled across your Podcast a few weeks ago while searching for an entrepreneur/venture capital educational program. The first show I listened to was <a title="_blank" href="http://www.startuplounge.com/sl-28-angels-in-atlanta/">Angels in Atlanta</a>, from then on I was hooked. I then started listening from the beginning &#8211; I am currently on #23 and listen to at least one show every 1-2 days while driving back and forth to work.</p>
<p>I have always had the entrepreneur spirit but it really caught on fire a few years ago with some consumer product inventions we developed. My recent interest in learning how to raise capital is due to a new venture my partners and myself are taking on, a high performance, high tech, electric motorcycle. It is very exciting and everyone we end up working with is just as passionate about it as we are.</p>
<p>We have completed the bike design and almost finished with our business plan. It appears our seed capital will at least need to be $1M for the R&amp;D phase. This would give us all engineering, tooling and prototypes where we can go into production.</p>
<p>I think the capital lounge is an awesome opportunity for start-ups and I wish we had a connection like that up here in Michigan. Do you think entrepreneurs from outside the Atlanta area could benefit from this event? What areas of the country do the attending investors like to play in? Would a EV start-up from Michigan be considered? Thanks again for the education guys!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Danna:</strong> If I were interested in funding a start-up&#8230;what is the initial range of buy-in and then return on investment?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>David:</strong> Just found you last week and listening to your podcast &#8211; In the <a title="_blank" href="http://www.startuplounge.com/sl-11-pandora-a-dot-com-survival-story/" target="_self">Pandora episode</a> you slammed the slime who prey on start-ups &#8211; I actually did a “wahoo!” at <a title="_blank" href="http://www.jchristophers.com" target="_blank">J. Christopher&#8217;s</a> in Midtown to a series of strange stares. I have recently started focusing on the new venture area and I am disappointed at how far some people justify taking advantage of those who are at maximum flexibility.  When someone has a concept &#8211; so often they are willing to do almost anything to see that realized &#8211; often to their own detriment.  Not only in the financing arena &#8211; but on our side too &#8211; the technology side.  U guys rock!  Thanks for doing what you are doing &#8211; it is badly needed!</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Comedy Break Lyrics:</strong></p>
<p>Just in time for tax season &#8211; enjoy <em>&#8220;Kiss This! (Hey IRS)&#8221;</em>, by Robert Lund/Michele Davis/Spaff, a parody of Faith Hill&#8217;s &#8220;This Kiss&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t want no April 15th<br />
I don&#8217;t need another judgment day (no)<br />
Anything the good Lord giveth<br />
Uncle Sam he<br />
Taketh<br />
A-way<br />
&#8216;Cause Big Brother&#8217;s got a big debt<br />
Baby, guess who has to pay?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you mug me<br />
It&#8217;s unspeakable pain<br />
It&#8217;s a personal washout<br />
Down a bottomless drain<br />
It&#8217;s abhorrently taxing<br />
It&#8217;s (uhhnn) believable</p>
<p>KISS THIS! KISS THIS!<br />
Hey IRS -<br />
KISS THIS! KISS THIS!</p>
<p>Doing taxes ain&#8217;t so scary<br />
Simply add up what you made (oh)<br />
Take it to the actu-ary<br />
Where he sub-tracts<br />
The tax<br />
You&#8217;ve paid<br />
Then you mail in twice the difference<br />
Plus a check for Medicaid</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Form 1040<br />
It&#8217;s a penalty clause<br />
It&#8217;s inscrutable worksheets<br />
It&#8217;s nonsensical laws<br />
It&#8217;s unspendable income<br />
It&#8217;s (uhhnn) deductible</p>
<p>KISS THIS! KISS THIS!<br />
Hey IRS -<br />
KISS THIS! KISS THIS!</p>
<p>You can tax me on my taxes<br />
Then you tax the funds that remain (oh)<br />
You can tax me on bikini waxes<br />
For a jolt of similar pain (ow)<br />
Slap on sadistic audits<br />
Don&#8217;t let anything pass<br />
You&#8217;ve bent me over<br />
So kiss &#8211; my &#8211; assets</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you mug me<br />
It&#8217;s relentlessly lame<br />
It&#8217;s aggressively wasteful<br />
This unwinnable game<br />
It&#8217;s unsportsmanlike conduct<br />
It&#8217;s (uhhnn) depreciable</p>
<p>KISS THIS! KISS THIS!<br />
It&#8217;s criminal<br />
KISS THIS! KISS THIS!</p>
<p>Kiss &#8211; my bottom line there, baby<br />
Kiss &#8211; my bottom line there, darlin&#8217;&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Podsafe music used within this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Underground </em>by Roadside Attraction</li>

<li><em>All the Money in the World </em>by Hutch</li>
</ul>
<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.</p>

Shownotes and Interview Questions:

As usual, we had lots of related follow-up questions and side discussions, but here is a good sampling of the questions we asked on the show:

	Give us the 30-second elevator pitch on Intersouth Partners
	Why does Intersouth have a large geographic investing area (primarily the Southeast U.S)?
	What are the challenges of investing out-of-state for Intersouth, and how do they impact how you do business?
	Why do more early-stage investors seem to be more comfortable with investing outside their immediate area?
	What is attractive about Georgia to Intersouth, and what types of deal flow do you see here?
	How does the deal flow you see in North Carolina contrast to that coming from Georgia?
	How does the general preparedness of entrepreneurs in North Carolina contrast to that of Georgia?
	Where do most of your investment opportunities come from, and what is the best way to get a deal in front of you?
	In which Atlanta-area companies has Intersouth made investments?
	What is Intersouth doing to establish a name or presence in the local market?
	Why is it that a number of North Carolina venture capital firms appear to be actively developing a presence in Georgia?
	Do you see any Georgia investors doing deals in North Carolina?
	How active or strong is the angel investment community in North Carolina and Georgia?
	Do you any regional or local trends in deal valuations?
	Do terms and valuations for investments in Georgia differ significantly from those in the other states where you operate?
	Do you agree with the common perception that there is insufficient capital available in Georgia to fund good opportunities?
	What are some characteristics in our market that make Georgia more challenging than other states? Are there things we can do better?
	Are there certain business models that you see evolving within the technology space that are of interest to you right now?
	What mistakes do you see entrepreneurs with SaaS deals make?
	How do taking advantage of things like cloud-computing factor into deal quality?
	Can you walk us through your investment in Atlanta-based Purewire?
	Tell us one mistake that entrepreneurs make that is an instant turn-off?
	How is Intersouth responding to the current economic environment?
	What are you advising entrepreneurs to do as they react to the economy?
	What is the one piece of advice you'd like to leave with entrepreneurs listening to this show ?

There has been quite a bit of discussion over the past year or so about the possibilities of a Y-Combinator type venture fund here in the Southeast. After a few failed efforts (notably Boostphase), we finally have one off the ground here in Atlanta.  David Cummings and Sanjay Parekh, two of the founders of Shotput Ventures join us for a chat about this new venture model, the Atlanta early-stage scene, and other things that melt in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Comedy Break Lyrics:</strong></p>
<p>Featuring <em>&#8220;Frank&#8217;s Garage&#8221;</em>, by Steve Goodie, a Bob Dylanish tribute to going green &#8230; with cars.   Enjoy!</p>
<blockquote><p>So you’re in an economic pickle<br />
With your great big sports utility vehicle<br />
Can’t afford the fuel, can’t sell it<br />
Can’t trade it, what the hell you gonna do?</p>
<p>I know a guy, he’s been turning wrenches for years<br />
You should give him a try, and yes, you can pay him with beer</p>
<p>Come on down to Frank’s garage, bring him your big old motor<br />
He’ll take your SUV apart, and build you two Toyotas<br />
Forget bio-diesel and solar<br />
He’ll cut your SUV in half, and make two Corollas</p>
<p>Tired of getting thirty gallons to the mile?<br />
Need something smaller than your domicile (that means your house)</p>
<p>Come on down to Frank’s garage, with that Hummer you’re so fond-a<br />
He’ll take your SUV apart, and build you two damn Hondas<br />
He’s got the tools, and a price you can afford<br />
He’ll cut your SUV in half, and make four Accords</p>
<p>Gas is twenty bucks a quart<br />
But Frank don’t want you in no import<br />
See how many Mini Coopers he made<br />
Out of one excessive Escalade<br />
Escalade, Escalade, Escalade, Escalade<br />
Escalade, Escalade, Escalade, Escalade</p>
<p>Come on down to Frank’s garage, with that big old Dodge Dakota<br />
He’ll take your freakin truck apart, and build you eight Toyotas<br />
Frank’s not out there hugging tree-es-es<br />
He’s cutting Navigators into Prius-es-es</p>
<p>Frank once worked at the Hummer plant, but last year he got fi-red<br />
Now he turns two-ton Tonka tanks into tiny little hybrids</p>
<p>Come on down to Frank’s garage, just east of Escondido<br />
He’ll take your SUV apart, and build you a fleet of Geos<br />
There’s no need to fret bro<br />
With a new Suburban and a case of bourbon, he’ll make you sixteen Metros</p>
<p>Yeah come on down to Frank’s garage, it’s worth the wait in line<br />
Come on down to Frank’s garage, it’s two for one all the time<br />
Yeah come on down to Frank’s garage, are gas prices killin ya?</p>
<p>Come on down to Frank’s garage, yeah you can run on one cylinder!</p></blockquote>

<p>Podsafe music used within this episode:</p>
<ul>

<li><em>All the Money in the World </em>by Hutch</li>
</ul>
<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.</p>

<p><strong>Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gia:</strong> Gia: Hey guys love the show!  I’ve heard you guys use the phrase “cram down” several times in past shows. What the heck does it mean?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Cassandra:</strong> Cassandra: Scott and Mike, I am starting up a new company and as part of this I am trying to put together a detailed breakdown of my target market.  It seems that the data is readily available out there if I am willing to pay for it.  I am bootstrapping this company by working two jobs, sometimes three.  What’s a poor girl to do?  I can’t afford to spend thousands of dollars on marketing reports.  Help!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>ImTakingoff:</strong> I am moving forward with filing a series of patents around my technology and have a question regarding the selection of the best attorney/firm to do the job.  I have done a good bit of research into firms that have done a great bit of work in my industry, but I’ve compiled a rather nice list of potential candidates.  Should I be worried that these firms have worked or continue to work with my competition on adjacent patents??</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Comedy Break Lyrics:</strong></p>
<p>Featuring <em>&#8220;Hooked up with a Bigfoot&#8221;</em>, by Robert Lund, sung to the tune of Billy Joel&#8217;s <em>Big Shot</em>.  Even though they didn&#8217;t find Bigfoot in the North Georgia Mountains, we&#8217;re still holding out hope.  Enjoy!</p>
<blockquote><p>Well -<br />
You left Georgia riding in your Cherokee<br />
Into Blue Ridge National Park<br />
You stopped for drinks with the bulky brunette<br />
That you met in the dark<br />
Ooh -<br />
But when you wake up in the morning with your hair on fire<br />
And you&#8217;re tied face-down from a tree<br />
You know it&#8217;s no urban legend<br />
The same thing happened to me</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause she turned out to be a Bigfoot creature<br />
You should have known from how she growled<br />
She&#8217;s definitely a Bigfoot creature<br />
&#8216;Cause your limbs are all yanked out<br />
You had to stay till last call last night<br />
That will teach you to get plowed<br />
You thought you&#8217;d met a tall babe &#8211; not quite<br />
You hooked up with a Bigfoot last night<br />
Oh no!</p>
<p>So -<br />
You went chasing tail on the Blue Ridge Trail<br />
&#8216;Cause the women seemed aggressively game<br />
Like the Chattahoochee mama with fangs<br />
Who just grunted her name<br />
Ooh -<br />
But now you just don&#8217;t remember all the things she did<br />
And you ask why it hurts when you cough<br />
I&#8217;ll give you one hint, buddy<br />
Your Jeep ain&#8217;t all she ripped off</p>
<p>No no no no no no you didn&#8217;t believe in Bigfoot, didja?<br />
She seemed abominably endowed<br />
Undoubtedly a Bigfoot creature<br />
Her perfume was Rainbow Trout<br />
You almost had your last rites last night<br />
Got Sasquashed into the ground<br />
You&#8217;re covered with a rug burn &#8211; shag type<br />
You hooked up with a Bigfoot last night<br />
Oh no!</p>
<p>So, baby, have you ever considered laser hair removal?<br />
Or there&#8217;s always waxing.<br />
Or you know, you could always just borrow my razor&#8230;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Podsafe music used within this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Underground </em>by Roadside Attraction</li>
<li><em>Hooked up With a Bigfoot </em>by Robert Lund</li>
<li><em>All the Money in the World </em>by Hutch</li>
</ul>
<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="sponsor_logo" style="border: 1px dotted #a0a0a0; margin: 10px; padding: 2px" title="Ken Stewart" src="http://www.startuplounge.com/images/guests/ken_stewart.png" alt="Ken Stewart" align="left" />Welcome to SL #34 (originally recorded on 12-15-2008)! We thought a great way to close out the 2008 year would be to sit down with someone who can provide some valuable insights for Georgia-based entrepreneurs who are looking at an uncertain economic climate in 2009.  We sat down and had a nice chat with Ken Stewart, the Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development.  We talk about a smattering of topics, ranging from their position on SB-80 to Georgia&#8217;s view on the current startup environment within the State.</p>
<p>Scott hops behind the wheel of the bus and plows over some silly entrepreneurs who just can&#8217;t seem to practice the fundamentals.  At the end of the podcast, we drop a tease on a new type of event we are planning for 2009. Another batch of your emails and a musical ballad that speaks to the impact of offshoring jobs round out another great show. Enjoy!<br style="clear:left" /><br />

<p><strong>Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Barry:</strong> I love the StartupLounge way and our podcast has a permanent home on my playlist.  Keep up the good work!  My question is this:  I have recently begun a new startup venture, but do not yet have a “business plan”. I don’t have any investors yet.  I have seen lots of business plan templates, and many of them have lots of things that are not really relevant to me at this stage in my venture (since I’m still just in the idea phase really).  When is the best time to really sit down and flesh out a full plan?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>GT2008:</strong> I have what I think is a really great idea and am beginning to get serious about it.  The play is basically an open source software play, with a business model around the platform.  What are some of the business risks of an open source company that I should be aware of now at this stage of my planning?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Ari:</strong> Thanks for your efforts at StartupLounge!  I love what you are doing and it has been a huge help to me.  I am an Israeli-American, and am working on a new startup of my own.  I am considering approaching the American-Israeli Chamber of Commerce to see what help they can provide.  My venture will be U.S. based, and won’t send any jobs back to Israel, but I am wondering if this will factor into my discussions with them.  Any advice?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>MarkF:</strong> Hopefully you guys can help me, because I am pulling my hair out on this. I have a new startup that I am working on that is a SaaS model.  I am really struggling with where to set my price points.  My competitors are in the market with a very low price point.  If I use a comparable price point, I won’t make enough cash flow to survive in the short-term (because I am bootstrapping while working for someone else right now, and I’m having to pay people to work for me on the side). If I charge too much, I’m worried obviously about the adoption rate.  Thoughts?</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Comedy Break Lyrics:</strong></p>
<p>Featuring <em>&#8220;Take my Job Away&#8221;</em>, by Project Sisyphus, sung to the tune of Berlin&#8217;s <em>Take My Breath Away</em>.  A hilarious look at offshoring/outsourcing in a bad economic climate.  Enjoy!</p>
<blockquote><p>Watching all the want ads, padding out my resume<br />
Wishin’ I had got that discount online MBA<br />
Rumor mill is turning, labor’s cheaper in Norway<br />
Lawyers filing motions, hoping they can find some way (to)</p>
<p>Take my job away&#8230;</p>
<p>(I’m) such a workaholic—how could they send my job offshore?<br />
Always in by ten, sometimes I stayed as late as four<br />
Except for four-day weekends and random ethnic holidays<br />
Now some dude named “Gunnar” got my manager to say:</p>
<p>Take my job away&#8230;</p>
<p>Umlaut-guy won’t have my knowledge<br />
of YouTube video<br />
or my B.S. from that classy college<br />
where they filmed “Don’t Tase Me, Bro”<br />
And I taught the CEO<br />
Super Mario™</p>
<p>Take my job away&#8230;</p>
<p>Security escorts me out so I don’t make a scene<br />
Stuffed my clothes with pens, some post-its and a fax machine<br />
Ate up all the donuts, sued for months of severance pay<br />
Prayin’ I get sick, ‘cause medical’s on them ‘till May</p>
<p>Take my job away<br />
Take my job away&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Welcome to SL #34 (originally recorded on 12-15-2008)! We thought a great way to close out the 2008 year would be to sit down with someone who can provide some valuable insights for Georgia-based entrepreneurs who are looking at an uncertain economic climate in 2009.nbsp; We sat down and had a nice chat with Ken Stewart, the Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development.nbsp; We talk about a smattering of topics, ranging from their position on SB-80 to Georgia's view on the current startup environment within the State.

Scott hops behind the wheel of the bus and plows over some silly entrepreneurs who just can't seem to practice the fundamentals.nbsp; At the end of the podcast, we drop a tease on a new type of event we are planning for 2009. Another batch of your emails and a musical ballad that speaks to the impact of offshoring jobs round out another great show. Enjoy!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="sponsor_logo" style="border: 1px dotted #a0a0a0; margin: 10px; padding: 2px" title="Glenn McGonnigle" src="http://www.startuplounge.com/images/guests/glenn_mcgonnigle.png" alt="Glenn McGonnigle" align="left" />Welcome to SL #33! We sat down and had a blast with Glenn McGonnigle, one of the founding partners of Atlanta&#8217;s newest venture capital fund &#8211; <a title="_blank" href="http://www.techoperators.com" target="_blank"><em>Tech Operators</em></a> (founded by Glenn, Tom Noonan, David Gould, and Said Mohammadioun). We discussed a variety of things, including the details of the new fund, the landscape in the Southeast, and what types of plants Mike grows in his backyard for &#8220;medicinal purposes&#8221;.</p>
<p>The bus is back and ready to rumble with Mike at the wheel &#8211; this time, he plows headfirst into entrepreneurs who seem to think that circumventing AngelLounge and trying to get us to champion their deal is a good idea.  FAIL!  Mike also segues into a nice monologue on the angel perspective of the current economic downtrend.  Some great listener emails, a musical tribute to the $700B government bailout, and a sprinkling of StartupLounge humor round out another great show. Enjoy!<br style="clear:left" /><br />

<p><strong>Shownotes and Interview Questions:</strong></p>
<p>As usual, we had lots of related follow-up questions and side discussions, but here is a good sampling of the questions we asked on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give us your elevator pitch for Tech Operators</li>
<li>Tell us about your recent closing of a new fund</li>
<li>Was it hard to raise this fund, given the economic climate?</li>
<li>You’ve raised a virgin fund, which is very hard to do.  Why do you think you were so successful where many others have failed?</li>
<li>What is the story you tell potential limited partners that excites them about investing in Georgia and the Southeastern US?</li>
<li>Do you anticipate a great deal of competition for deal flow?</li>
<li>When will the fund begin investing operations?</li>
<li>You have four people on your founding team.  Have you identified particular strengths and roles?</li>
<li>A lot of people have a view that Atlanta VCs, don’t have much of an interest in seeing true early-stage companies.  Their perception is that most regional VCs have moved upstream to more emerging growth type deals.  Are you observing something similar?</li>
<li>When you receive an opportunity and you’re inclined to pursue it, what is your process for examining that opportunity?</li>
<li>There seems to be a lot of venture fund raising activity here in Atlanta – some existing venture players that have been dormant for a while are raising new funds (e.g. Kinetic, Noro-Moseley), and several new funds are in the works.  From your perspective, is this a positive thing for Atlanta or a negative thing for TechOperators?</li>
<li>Recently, there was some commotion around the notion that some regional/local VCs are “spreadsheet jockeys”, meaning they tend to invest based on analytics and business models rather than a simple opportunity to create value in the marketplace without necessarily having an easily illustrated business model firmly in place. What is your take on this?</li>
<li>On average, how long does it take to get you from that starting point to an agreement on an investment?</li>
<li>What is the best way to get an opportunity in front of you?</li>
<li>How many opportunities do you expect to look at each year and how many investments do you expect to make in a given year?</li>
<li>When dealing with you guys, what’s one thing that’s an absolute no-no?</li>
<li>How involved do you plan to be day to day with your portfolio companies?</li>
<li>If you were to “sell” yourself to an entrepreneur to take you on as an investor, what do you think is your biggest selling point?</li>
<li>What is a piece of advice you would give to new early-stage investors?</li>
<li>If you could change something in the environment or ecosystem to make your job easier, what would that be?</li>
<li>What’s your overall assessment of the Atlanta early stage market? Is it improving, and if so, how do you see that?</li>
<li>If you were to give one piece of advice to entrepreneurs that might want to approach you for capital, what would that be?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>jswanson:</strong> Hey guys, love the show.  I have a quick question for you this morning.  I am contemplating raising a small round of angel financing for a new software startup.  I am concerned about the current market conditions and I’m wondering what you’re seeing out in the angel sector.  What can I expect to see in terms of angel interest, activity, and ultimately valuation?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Patesh:</strong> I have a strange cap table problem that I’m hoping Mike can help me with.  I am losing a co-founder due to his personal medical situation.  Currently, he owns 30% of the company.  I need to find a replacement for him, and will need to give the new guy an equity stake.  The guy I’m losing knows that I’m going to want to reduce his equity stake to some extent, as its only fair. Any suggestions on how best to tackle this?  Do I just suggest a number and work it out with him, or is there a better way?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Sam:</strong> Greetings guys.  I am very interested in starting up a new video game studio here in Atlanta, primarily because I’m from here, but secondarily because I’d like to take advantage of the generous tax credit incentive from the state.  Even though we have a nice incentive here to build this type of company in Georgia, we don’t seem to have a lot of investors in that sector.  Any tips?  Can I convince an outside investor to invest in this deal, and allow me to stay in Georgia?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Carmine:</strong> Scott and Mike, I love the show, it has been a huge help to me.  I visit the StartupLounge site daily to see if there are new episodes posted.  Please keep it up!  I am curious about one thing, though. How do you guys find the time to do these podcasts, blog posts, speak at various events, and hold really cool events like PitchCamp and CapitalLounge?  From what I gather from your bios, you both have day jobs.  How can this be?  Have you secretly invented a cloning machine?  If so, tell me where I can get one!</p></blockquote>

<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Welcome to SL #33! We sat down and had a blast with Glenn McGonnigle, one of the founding partners of Atlanta's newest venture capital fund - Tech Operators (founded by Glenn, Tom Noonan, David Gould, and Said Mohammadioun). We discussed a variety of things, including the details of the new fund, the landscape in the Southeast, and what types of plants Mike grows in his backyard for "medicinal purposes".

The bus is back and ready to rumble with Mike at the wheel - this time, he plows headfirst into entrepreneurs who seem to think that circumventing AngelLounge and trying to get us to champion their deal is a good idea.nbsp; FAIL!nbsp; Mike also segues into a nice monologue on the angel perspective of the current economic downtrend.nbsp; Some great listener emails, a musical tribute to the $700B government bailout, and a sprinkling of StartupLounge humor round out another great show. Enjoy!

Shownotes and Interview Questions:

As usual, we had lots of related follow-up questions and side discussions, but here is a good sampling of the questions we asked on the show:

	Give us your elevator pitch for Tech Operators
	Tell us about your recent closing of a new fund
	Was it hard to raise this fund, given the economic climate?
	Yoursquo;ve raised a virgin fund, which is very hard to do.nbsp; Why do you think you were so successful where many others have failed?
	What is the story you tell potential limited partners that excites them about investing in Georgia and the Southeastern US?
	Do you anticipate a great deal of competition for deal flow?
	When will the fund begin investing operations?
	You have four people on your founding team.nbsp; Have you identified particular strengths and roles?
	A lot of people have a view that Atlanta VCs, donrsquo;t have much of an interest in seeing true early-stage companies.nbsp; Their perception is that most regional VCs have moved upstream to more emerging growth type deals.nbsp; Are you observing something similar?
	When you receive an opportunity and yoursquo;re inclined to pursue it, what is your process for examining that opportunity?
	There seems to be a lot of venture fund raising activity here in Atlanta ndash; some existing venture players that have been dormant for a while are raising new funds (e.g. Kinetic, Noro-Moseley), and several new funds are in the works.nbsp; From your perspective, is this a positive thing for Atlanta or a negative thing for TechOperators?
	Recently, there was some commotion around the notion that some regional/local VCs are ldquo;spreadsheet jockeysrdquo;, meaning they tend to invest based on analytics and business models rather than a simple opportunity to create value in the marketplace without necessarily having an easily illustrated business model firmly in place. What is your take on this?
	On average, how long does it take to get you from that starting point to an agreement on an investment?
	What is the best way to get an opportunity in front of you?
	How many opportunities do you expect to look at each year and how many investments do you expect to make in a given year?
	When dealing with you guys, whatrsquo;s one thing thatrsquo;s an absolute no-no?
	How involved do you plan to be day to day with your portfolio companies?
	If you were to ldquo;sellrdquo; yourself to an entrepreneur to take you on as an investor, what do you think is your biggest selling point?
	What is a piece of advice you would give to new early-stage investors?
	If you could change something in the environment or ecosystem to make your job easier, what would that be?
	Whatrsquo;s your overall assessment of the Atlanta early stage market? Is it improving, and if so, how do you see that?
	If you were to give one piece of advice to entrepreneurs that...</itunes:summary>

Welcome to SL #32! In the first of a new series of short podcasts at StartupLounge.com that focus on profiling early-stage companies in the Southeast, we sat down with John Melonakos, co-founder and CEO of <a title="_blank" href="http://www.accelereyes.com" target="_blank">Accelereyes</a>.  These guys are a very cool new company here in Atlanta which provides some exciting technology that they believe will help usher in a new age of &#8220;personal supercomputing&#8221;.  Aside from the discussion about the company itself, we also spoke a bit about their experiences in participating and ultimately winning the Georgia Tech Business Plan Competition for 2008.</p>
<p>Of course, Scott does a great job in trying to completely derail the discussion, by trying to find some practical applications for this new technology, especially as it pertains to getting faster framerates while viewing porn online), as well as trying to convince Google to buy them.  Jeez!</p>

Join us for a very cool chat with Dr. Lawrence Kersten, the king of demotivation, and co-founder/COO of <a title="_blank" href="http://www.despair.com" target="_blank">Despair.com</a>.  He shares with us the fascinating (and hilarious) entrepreneurial story of Despair.com. Making lemonade from lemons is never easy, but these guys did it through viral marketing and persistence, and are rocking and rolling. We also talk a bit about Despair&#8217;s trademark of the &#8220;frownie&#8221; symbol.</p>
<p>The bus is back, and the finance guy brings the heat and rails about early-stage companies that get hung up on their valuation. Some great listener emails and a sprinkling of StartupLounge humor round out another great show. Enjoy!<br style="clear:left" /><br />

<p><strong>Shownotes and Interview Questions:</strong></p>
<p>As usual, we had lots of related follow-up questions and side discussions, but here is a good sampling of the questions we asked on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give us your elevator pitch for Despair.com</li>
<li>It has been reported that, Despair Inc. was “inspired” largely by the failed promises made to you and other employees by the Internet Startup for which you worked.  Can you tell us about that?</li>
<li>What was the response from Successories to the creation of Despair.com?</li>
<li>It’s our understanding that you and co-founders Justin Sewell, and Justin’s twin brother Jeff come up with most of the material.  How much is “fan generated”?</li>
<li>Has anyone ever bought the Chairman Edition of the Art of Demotivation?</li>
<li>Explain the Noble Employee Myth!</li>
<li>At what point did you determine there was a business in de-motivational products?</li>
<li>Did you require capital to get started?  If so, how much did you need and where did it come from?</li>
<li>Is Despair.com a durable business?  Do you ever have fear that your success is just a fad?</li>
<li>How has your business been impacted by the current economic instability?</li>
<li>Who is your typical customer?</li>
<li>Despair.com seems to be a viral phenomenon.  What allows a company to go viral?  Can it even be done on purpose?</li>
<li>How do Vodcasting and blogging fit into your marketing strategy and can you disclose how many viewers/readers you have?</li>
<li>Your “frowny” trademark sent ripples through the intellectual property world.  Is that trademark ever seriously challenged?</li>
<li>Have you ever thought about sending “Despair” packages to Fannie Mae or Lehman or Washington Mutual?</li>
<li>Do you still have only four employees (the three founders?).  How do you run so lean?  Or rather, what about your model is so scalable?</li>
<li>The Despair Inc. products have enjoyed popularity – enough to make you some money.   Does that say anything about our society or is that over-thinking the issue?</li>
<li>Do you ever get asked to speak and if so, to which events are you invited?</li>
<li>Which was the first de-motivator theme?</li>
<li>What’s the best selling de-motivator theme/topic?</li>
<li>What’s next for Despair, Inc?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Aby</strong>: I have an idea that came to me in Walmart yesterday. I spoke to a friend of mine last night, and he improved on the idea, to the point where we both believe it could be a viable product. I am not an engineer or a technician &#8211; I simply have an entrepreneurial mind. My question to you is simple, what do I do next??</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>John Kellogg:</strong> Just thought I would say how much I appreciate StartupLounge.  I just listened to the Noro podcast today and enjoy your ability as well as Mike&#8217;s, to interject humor into a very serious conversation.  Entrepreneurs are able to gain real insight from top professionals in your &#8220;most unusual&#8221; setting.  Thanks again and I look forward to meeting you tomorrow night at CapitalLounge.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Michael</strong>: We have never met. I live in Alpharetta. I have a friend who is retired and developed a unique outdoor storage facilty over 10 years ago. I have never seen anything like this product. It is 10-6 in dia. The floor does not move but the walls rotate 360 degrees. So there is no &#8220;back&#8221; of the building. He asked me to become the national distributor with this product recently. As mentioned he developed this building over 10 years ago and the individuals who attempted to sell and distribute this building did not do any market research. Consequently it failed. Mainly because there was no testing. So now he&#8217;s come to me to try to distribute this product. I work with facts, and risk. I want to test market it first as a greenhouse for consumers. My problem is I have a older gentleman who is very proud of his design, but is cash poor. He owns the patent rights. (but doesn&#8217;t have international patents&#8230;a big opportunity I believe) and he is impatient because he needs money now and looking elsewhere for investors. I believe in the product and that it could sell, but at the moment, not enough sales history. Your thoughts?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Roberto:</strong> Hi guys, love the podcast!  It has been a huge help as I get my new venture off the ground.  As a very early stage, pre-revenue company, I obviously don’t have lots of cash laying around to pay people for services.  In following one of Scott’s tips on his wonderful blog post about bootstrapping your company, I have been able to find a few services vendors to accept equity instead of cash for their services.  My question is this:  What % of equity makes sense when doing these types of deals.  Some of my partners are what I call “spot vendors”, as they provide very specific services work (legal, accounting, etc.)  Other vendors are more involved, especially on the technology side.  Any guidance you could give me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again and keep up the good fight!</p></blockquote>

<p>Our format is a little out of the norm as far as podcasts go. We treat our efforts as a true &#8220;show&#8221; rather than a super-concise (limited) vehicle for delivery of information. Therefore, the podcasts can run a bit long (actually, it is largely driven by the guests and their responses.) While we try to have very substantive discussions, we also try to have a lot of fun along the way (and that tends to elongate the programming a wee bit.) <img src='http://www.startuplounge.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Our theory is that if we are having fun during the show, hopefully, you will be having a little fun listening as well.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Welcome to SL #31! Join us for a very cool chat with Dr. Lawrence Kersten, the king of demotivation, and co-founder/COO of Despair.com.nbsp; He shares with us the fascinating (and hilarious) entrepreneurial story of Despair.com. Making lemonade from lemons is never easy, but these guys did it through viral marketing and persistence, and are rocking and rolling. We also talk a bit about Despair's trademark of the "frownie" symbol.

The bus is back, and the finance guy brings the heat and rails about early-stage companies that get hung up on their valuation. Some great listener emails and a sprinkling of StartupLounge humor round out another great show. Enjoy!

Shownotes and Interview Questions:

As usual, we had lots of related follow-up questions and side discussions, but here is a good sampling of the questions we asked on the show:

	Give us your elevator pitch for Despair.com
	It has been reported that, Despair Inc. was ldquo;inspiredrdquo; largely by the failed promises made to you and other employees by the Internet Startup for which you worked.nbsp; Can you tell us about that?
	What was the response from Successories to the creation of Despair.com?
	Itrsquo;s our understanding that you and co-founders Justin Sewell, and Justinrsquo;s twin brother Jeff come up with most of the material.nbsp; How much is ldquo;fan generatedrdquo;?
	Has anyone ever bought the Chairman Edition of the Art of Demotivation?
	Explain the Noble Employee Myth!
	At what point did you determine there was a business in de-motivational products?
	Did you require capital to get started?nbsp; If so, how much did you need and where did it come from?
	Is Despair.com a durable business?nbsp; Do you ever have fear that your success is just a fad?
	How has your business been impacted by the current economic instability?
	Who is your typical customer?
	Despair.com seems to be a viral phenomenon.nbsp; What allows a company to go viral?nbsp; Can it even be done on purpose?
	How do Vodcasting and blogging fit into your marketing strategy and can you disclose how many viewers/readers you have?
	Your ldquo;frownyrdquo; trademark sent ripples through the intellectual property world.nbsp; Is that trademark ever seriously challenged?
	Have you ever thought about sending ldquo;Despairrdquo; packages to Fannie Mae or Lehman or Washington Mutual?
	Do you still have only four employees (the three founders?).nbsp; How do you run so lean?nbsp; Or rather, what about your model is so scalable?
	The Despair Inc. products have enjoyed popularity ndash; enough to make you some money.nbsp;nbsp; Does that say anything about our society or is that over-thinking the issue?
	Do you ever get asked to speak and if so, to which events are you invited?
	Which was the first de-motivator theme?
	Whatrsquo;s the best selling de-motivator theme/topic?
	Whatrsquo;s next for Despair, Inc?

Listener Emails Read and Answered on the Show:
Aby: I have an idea that came to me in Walmart yesterday. I spoke to a friend of mine last night, and he improved on the idea, to the point where we both believe it could be a viable product. I am not an engineer or a technician - I simply have an entrepreneurial mind. My question to you is simple, what do I do next??
John Kellogg: Just thought I would say how much I appreciate StartupLounge.nbsp; I just listened to the Noro podcast today and enjoy your ability as well as Mike's, to interject humor into a very serious conversation.nbsp; Entrepreneurs are able to gain real insight from top professionals in your "most unusual" setting.nbsp; Thanks again and I look forward to meeting you tomorrow night at CapitalLounge.
Michael: We have never met. I live in Alpharetta. I have a friend who is retired and developed a unique outd...</itunes:summary>

<p>Welcome to SL #30! <a title="_blank" href="http://www.catalystmag.com" target="_blank">Catalyst Magazine</a> recently hosted a panel on &#8220;Raising Capital&#8221; at The Vinings Club here in Atlanta.  The panel featured Greg Foster (Noro-Moseley Partners), Brian Patrick Cork (Brian Cork Human Capital), and Braxton Jarratt (CEO, ClearLeap).   Catalyst asked StartupLounge to moderate the panel, which we were more than happy to do.  We were angling for a &#8220;dual moderator&#8221; format, where Scott and Mike could take pot shots at each other all night, but sadly, with only a 45 minute session, we decided that one moderator would be a better format (in the interest of time).  Sadly, the crowd got stuck with Scott moderating.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Panel Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction by Drew Ermenc, Associate Publisher and Editor, <a title="_blank" href="http://www.catalystmag.com" target="_blank">Catalyst Magazine</a></li>
<li>A lot has been written on the challenges of raising early-stage capital in the Atlanta market.  Can you give us your view on where we were say 5 years ago, where we are today, and what the future holds here?</li>
<li>What makes up the criteria for a good deal from the regional VC perspective?</li>
<li>What are some of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs make when looking for capital? Any particular big No-No&#8217;s?</li>
<li>ClearLeap is a rising star in the Atlanta technology sector having just raised a $9M outside round of capital.  Atlanta certainly has its challenges when it comes to early-stage capital. What were some of the biggest challenges you faced in raising capital for Clearleap?</li>
<li>Many entrepreneurs are great at building innovation, but not great at building relationships. Could you speak on the importance of relationships and networking within the investment community and how it might benefit those looking for investors?</li>
<li>Before you joined Noro-Moseley Partners you did “strategic venturing” at Turner Broadcasting.  Is this a viable path for early-stage companies, and what does that process look like from the entrepreneur’s perspective?</li>
<li>Braxton, your last round of funding was a $9M raise.  You had a mix of investors in on the deal – the deal was co-led by Noro-Moseley Partners here in Atlanta, and Trinity Ventures on the West coast.  You also had participation by Sig Mosley (Imlay Investments) and Jim Chiddix, the former CTO of Time Warner Cable.   Was there a difference in the process, expectations, etc, between angels, the West Coast venture capital and the East Coast venture capital? How did you bring all of these folks together to do the deal?</li>
<li>Mitch Free, founder of MFG.com and the Catalyst November speaker, recently told Drew (and StartupLounge.com podcast listeners) that his best advice would be to &#8220;keep your head down, build your business, grow your business and the money will come to you.&#8221; Would you agree or disagree to this?</li>
<li>It is my view that a lot of deals that get passed on could be better deals with some tweaking on the part of the entrepreneur. What should entrepreneurs do to make their companies attractive to A) Angels and B) Venture capitalists?  Are there some things they can do to make their deal a “cleaner” one for outside investors?</li>
<li>Investors have the luxury of seeing lots of deals through the course of their work, and they are very selective in their investments. In your view, what made Clearleap stand above the rest of the pack?</li>
<li>What parting wisdom do you have for entrepreneurs out there seeking to raise capital from investors in the Southeast?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions from the Audience:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q1</strong>: How does social media play into raising capital?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q2</strong>: I have a ten year old company.  What is the opportunity for an established company to raise capital in Atlanta?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q3</strong>: How do entrepreneurs get an opportunity at networking events to meet investors, and how much time should they expect to spend with such an investor?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong></strong></p></blockquote>
