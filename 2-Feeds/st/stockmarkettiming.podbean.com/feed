At the  same time, nothing is going on for Silver stocks. That has me concerned.  The trend would be bigger and last longer if investors were interested  in precious metals stocks, and not just Gold stocks. Don’t want to Buy  here? Understood, but you still need to cover your short positions. –  Gold and Silver Stock Trends is Stephen Whiteside’s weekly look at the  Gold and Silver stock sectors. Stocks covered include Barrick,   Agnico-Eagle, AngloGold Ashanti, Coeur d’Alene, Freeport-McMoRan,  Gold  Fields, Goldcorp, Randgold, Harmony, Kinross, Newmont, Pan American  Silver and Royal Gold. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LopLQ4vaxGU

<p class="MsoNormal">http://www.theuptrend.com Cha-Ching! We hit lots of new profit targets on Friday for our Bearish ETF trades. Coming up to some seasonal strength here with both the Memorial Day long weekend and the End of The Month bias coming into play. The USD and the Euro revered sharply on Friday, maybe telling us that a major change in market direction was coming. Looking for a close above Thursdays highs, as the first sign of new market strength. Gold futures are now back on daily buy signal, but not the stocks, just yet.  <span>http://youtu.be/Au_g027-cOc</span></p>
