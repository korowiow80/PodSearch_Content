            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 14px;">Jimmy sat down at lunch with comedian/comic book writer Frankie Boyle when he was in London for Kapow Con.

Frankie is known for his "controversial/in your face" comedy so there is some bad language throughout. However, he's a pleasant fellow who knows his comic books well! The guys chat about Frankie's comic in Clint Magazine called Rex Royd, growing up reading comic books, his last comedy tour, his books and overall career. Really great discussion!

Jimmy returns to his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida to visit his mom and see friends and invades his old buddy Ted's house again. Ted has a live orchestra in his house, thus the random musical interludes throughout. For the loyal listeners, you'll remember that Ted co-hosted last year as well when Jimmy visited. The boys discuss&nbsp;Green Lantern&nbsp;undies in Wal-Mart and Oscar nominations. Jimmy chats about his new found love (thanks to Lorraine Cink and Jon Hoche) forUncanny X-Force&nbsp;and briefly mentions the season premiere of&nbsp;Archer. Plus, he plays a bit of a song his co-worker sings who is ridiculously talented. News includes: DC and Warner Bros. start the&nbsp;We Can Be Heroes&nbsp;inititative, EPIX may pick up the Stan Lee documentary,&nbsp;Hellboy&nbsp;inspires a camp in Portland,&nbsp;Popeye&nbsp;comics debut from IDW and Lego/DC team up for the new&nbsp;Lego Hero Factory&nbsp;app.&nbsp;As always, listener feedback, the Top 3 and more!

Jimmy is joined by Aussie pal Matt Brick again to review tons of comics and chat about&nbsp;Speakeasy Dollhouse, Mekhi Phifer,&nbsp;Once Upon A Time,&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;anime on G4, Grace Helbig co-hosting&nbsp;Attack of the Show, CDC zombie comic, Marvel layoffs,&nbsp;Dry Seasons&nbsp;preview,&nbsp;The Loxley's and the War of 1812&nbsp;preview, and Matt Smith might be leaving&nbsp;Doctor Who.&nbsp;Speaking of...more NYCC interviews with G4TV'S Blair Butler and Blair Herter. Blair Butler swung by the Comic News Insider booth to hang with Jimmy and chat her first written comic book called&nbsp;Heart. They also chatted the comic industry and recent comics as well. Blair Herter came by after meeting Jimmy the night before and having many drinks. They had a blast talking comics, video games and how Jimmy is stealing his fiance', Jessica Chobot, from him. Kevin Mellon also came by to talk about&nbsp;Heart.&nbsp;You know, since&nbsp;he's the artist on the comic book. News includes: Ben McCool &amp; Nikki Cook's&nbsp;Memoir&nbsp;heads to TV, &nbsp;Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons announce their comic&nbsp;The Secret Service, Joss Whedon takes on&nbsp;Much Ado About Nothing, 2000AD fills gap in empty Barnes &amp; Noble shelves,&nbsp;The Punisher&nbsp;heads to TV, Spider-Kids dressed up needed for Spidey column, Ed Brubaker's&nbsp;Criminal&nbsp;heading to film,&nbsp;Red 2&nbsp;is coming and King Con III is postponed.

His voice is shot&nbsp;from shouting during the raffle all weekend and sleeping about 8 hours total in 4 days. He got tons of interviews at the show and in this episode you'll hear from James Asmus (<em>X-Men: Regenesis</em>), Marc Bernardin (<em>Alphas</em>), Nicki Clyne ("Callie" on&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica</em>), Greg Pak (<em>Incredible Hercules, Hulk</em>), and Veronica Taylor (voice of "Ash Ketchum" in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>). Jimmy gives his lengthy (sorry!) day by day/blow by blow recap of the 4 days of NYCC. While a blast was had by all, there were a few gripes as well. Thanks to EVERYONE who came by the Comic News Insider table and said "Hi", bought raffle tickets, dropped off stuff to review, did signings, interviews, donated for raffle or just wanted to chat.

<p>Jimmy is joined by frequent guest co-host Jon Hoche and long time listener/pal Matt Brick (who flew in from Australia just for it! Okay, not for CNI but it was a bonus for him!). Jon has been actively reviewing/following The New 52 from DC Comics so we decided to review a ton of them! No news since we had so many reviews. Plus, the boys chat about Molly Crabapple's Week In Hell, Garth Ennis pays homage to Jimmy in&nbsp;<em>Chronicles of Wormwood</em>, pal Grace Helbig has been blowing up on&nbsp;<em>Attack of the Show</em>, MTV is interested in the&nbsp;<em>Locke &amp; Key</em>&nbsp;series, Jimmy's nephew Max and friend's son both are big Spider-Man fans, and Jon talks about bring Vampire Cowboys Theater Company to New York Comic-Con.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Jimmy was part of a conference call with some of the stars of the upcoming Starz series,<em>Torchwood: Miracle Day</em>. &nbsp;On the call were cast members John Barrowman (Captain Jack Harkness), Eve Myles (Gwen Cooper) and Alexa Havins (Esther Drummond). They were joined by series creator/showrunner Russell T. Davies. So you know, conference call interviews work like this: A group of reporters are given a number to call in and are put in an automated queue. When your name pops up, the moderator (or sometimes electronic moderator) will introduce you like. "Next up we have Jimmy Aquino from Comic News Insider". While you are asking your question, the interviewees can hear you and so can every other person on the queue. But no one else can be heard until they are patched in. What you will hear is the entire call with questions from reporters from big outlets like E! and MTV to podcasters like me, bloggers. etc. Jimmy's questions come in around 30-40 minutes in.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WARNING!</strong>&nbsp;There will be some minor spoilers as everyone had already seen at least the first episode or like Jimmy, the first 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>Well, it's Jimmy's first show without God Joe doing the tech and as expected...it's a train wreck. Apologies in advance for the madness! It's strictly recorded on the digital recorder. Jimmy also randomly and mostly by accident took a bunch of calls from friends like Emmy award winning Michael Emerson (<em>Lost</em>), Kevin Maguire (<em>Tanga</em>), Jill Pantozzi (The Nerdy Bird), and Ben Templesmith&nbsp;<em>(Choker, 30 Days of Night</em>). He just held up the mic to the phone speaker so hopefully we got the sound. Some embarrassing reveleations to be sure! Genital pics, strip club visits, a possible baby mama, and much more.</p>
<p>The Asians talk the Oscars (even with a song), Fillion's reply to Browncoat crazies and how to go about contacting someone in the comic book field. News includes: Powers TV show gets greenlit (<strong>BREA GRANT FOR DEENA PILGRIM!!</strong>), Kaboom! to release Peanuts graphic novel, Eisner on display at MoCCA, Leigh Gallagher (<em>Defoe</em>) gets a royal stamp, Oni Press mix tape and CBLDF comic creator trading cards.&nbsp;Listener feedback and more!

            <description><![CDATA[Jimmy's back from his epic journey to San Diego Comic-Con. Joe stayed
back home with the kids. Over 5 hours of recording to release and we do
it all here! No, no. But, we do play interviews with Felicia Day (<i>Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog, The Guild</i>) and Olivia Munn (G4TV's <i>Attack of the Show</i>). We also get the tail end of a roundtable discussion with Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku for <i>Dollhouse</i>. We do some quick news headlines from the con including <i>Doctor Who</i> being recognized by Guinness Book of World Records, <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i> graphic novel, <i>Avengers</i> film line up, <i>Justice League</i> comic line up, Marvel gets rights to <i>Marvelman</i>, John Cassaday to direct <i>Dollhouse</i>
episode, Eisner highlights and more! Jimmy gives his epic recap of the
show babbling on and on about interviews and drinking or both. Of
course, tons of name dropping. Joe curses Jimmy for all of the editing
he will have to do now, but is glad he got some good coverage.]]></description>

It's our big Bicentennial and we're doing it all up! Recorded live in
front of an audience at Latitude Bar &amp; Grill here in NYC. Special
guests galore including Michael Emerson (&quot;Ben Linus&quot; from <em>Lost</em>),
John
Cassaday, Vito Del Sante, Kevin Colden, Miss Lasko-Gross and more!
We do the news and reviews and some hilarious sketches to boot. There's
a musical bit, some radio theater and you have to hear Michael Emerson
read movie quotes! Cassaday also gives an exclusive announcement about
the final issue of Planetary! Special
thanks to Heidi MacDonald from The Beat and Mike from Astro-Zombies
comic shop for their kind donations of door prizes. And hey...we also
did a video (probably the first and last time) of this so you can
finally see our antics for yourselves! ]]></description>

The guys give their opinions on awkward fans at the booth, how we get our guests and thank our booth helpers and guests. News from NYCC includes the new Hickman/Eaglesham <em>Fantastic Four</em>, a new Ultimate line from Marvel, more <em>Batman </em>titles,<em> Pet Avengers</em> and so much more. Also, a zombie <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Portland superhero and Harvey Comics at MoCCA!&nbsp;</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/cni/CNI150.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[It's our big SDCC recap in front of a live studio audience. There's BBQ and drinking and special studio guest Julio Soto. Remember him? (Go back to episode 1). Jimmy went to San Diego Comic-Con while Joe stayed home with the kids. As you can imagine, Jimmy drank most of the time but still somehow covered a lot of the convention. Marvel at his day by day coverage that always ended (and sometimes started) with drinking. The podcast panel, the parties, the panels, the prostitutes...it's all there!

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[It's our big SDCC recap in front of a live studio audience. There's BBQ and drinking and special studio guest Julio Soto. Remember him? (Go back to episode 1). Jimmy went to San Diego Comic-Con while Joe stayed home with the kids. As you can imagine, Jimmy drank most of the time but still somehow covered a lot of the convention. Marvel at his day by day coverage that always ended (and sometimes started) with drinking. The podcast panel, the parties, the panels, the prostitutes...it's all there! Interviews include Kevin Pereira (Attack of the Show), Howard Shum (Gun Fu), Josh Friedman (The Sarah Connor Chronicles) and Josh Schwartz (Chuck). More to be had in our special Pushing Daisies One-Shot this weekend! And even more next week with Tony Lee (Hope Falls, Doctor Who: The Forgotten), Kevin Conn (Unemployed Skeletor) and Jay Glatfelter (The Lost Podcast with Jay &amp; Jack). ]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>No reviews or feedback since we have so much New York Comic-Con to cover! It was a crazy and mad weekend full of fun! Marvel at our fun. MARVEL AT IT!! </p>
<p>Over 64,000 attended the show and we cover it all. Well, not all of it, but a good chunk. Great interviews, amazing raffle, PROJECT HAIRCUT!, The Great Podcasting Dinner of NYCC 08, and more! We talk about some of the big news to break at NYCC including Marvel Apes, Power Girl ongoing, Iron Man/Hulk movie crossover and Virgin Comics party policies. We have a lengthy discussion recapping each day of the con. </p>
<p>As mentioned, interviews galore! So many that we had to split them into 3 shows. That's right, folks! This episode, &quot;Alan Moore&quot; returns and sits with us at our booth to discuss some more projects he's working on. A special surprise visit by Mike Norton occurs during the interview and a possible future collaboration is made. Sunday was a bit tamer, so I sat with the lovely CNI girls and booth helpers, Carrie Tucker, Kristin Garay and Colleen McAllister, to get their thoughts on the show. Also, Jimmy has a dream interview with the amazingly beautiful and talented Molly Crabapple. </p>
<p>What about the other interviews you ask? Well, tune in this Saturday, April 26th, for a special CNI One-Shot: The Venture Bros. That's right! Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer, the creators of the acclaimed animated series <em>The Venture Bros.</em>, joined us to discuss the upcoming season 3. Also, James Urbaniak (voice of Dr. Venture and Phantom Limb) stops by to discuss his work on the show as well. </p>
<p>Tune in next week for more interviews from Greg Pak (<em>Incredible Herc</em>), Stephen Lindsay and Lauren Monardo (<em>Jesus Hates Zombies</em>) and The Vampire Cowboys Theater Company. <br/></p>

The hair will be donated to <span><strong><a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/"><font color="#dd3322">Locks of Love</font></a></strong></span> and we'll be collecting donations.

Half of the funds raised will go to Locks of Love and the other half will help cover costs here at CNI. </p>
<p>Oh, and next week's show is up in the air. We might record late. And...the contest we announced last week. Oops, forgot to mention it in the show this week. But, that's mostly because we realized how late it was and that most people probably already have their tickets. So, basically, unless we get a slew of entries in the next week, we'll just have to plan early for next year! </p>
<p>As always, we end with a great Top 3. And remind you to go leave your iTunes comments! 5 stars and nothing but love! </p>
