			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a fan of Jakob Neilsen and a skeptic of the &#8220;every design should be responsive&#8221; methodology, I have been frustrated with the <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/nielsen-wrong-mobile" target="_blank">criticism</a> of <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mobile-vs-full-sites.html" target="_blank">Neilsen&#8217;s stance on mobile websites</a>. Recently <a title="Clark is Wrong About Nielsen Being Wrong About Mobile" href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/2012/04/clark-is-wrong-about-nielsen-being-wrong-about-mobile/" target="_blank">I published my thoughts</a> on the two sides (mobile specific websites and responsive design) hoping to cultivate a discussion on mobile design and why Neilsen might be right. To my disappointment, few noticed or cared. I wrote it off, assuming I was overly fanboyish of Neilsen or too critical of responsive design.</p>
<p>Today I came across a beautifully written piece by <a href="http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/" target="_blank">James Young</a> titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/mobile-first-is-history-repeating/" target="_blank">Mobile First is History Repeating</a>.&#8221; James sentiments mirror my own, specifically that Neilsen does more research than anyone else in the industry and Responsive Design is not a silver bullet. I highly recommend you read it, as James is more eloquent than I and makes several points I missed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I respect navigation more than any other element on a website. Little else commands the responsibility of navigation. Poor navigation leaves people dumbfounded, confused and frustrated. Great navigation effortlessly directs users toward the content or actions they desire and can reroute lost users while <a title="Design, Copy and Mental Processing" href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/2012/05/design-copy-and-mental-processing/">minimizing mental processing</a>. Even the over glorified &#8220;call to action&#8221; is simply another form of navigation.</p>
<p>Designer Greg Raiz has posted a wonderfully detailed breakdown of <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/blog/736/designing-navigation-github" target="_blank">redesigning the GitHub navigation</a>. It&#8217;s a great read for anyone who makes UX/UI decisions. One quote in particular resonates with me above all else:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each page should have a key purpose. The UI should be optimized around that key purpose and extraneous things should be moved or removed when possible.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most discussions of speed and websites focus on response time, download footprint and rendering performance. While all aforementioned elements are important, there is another aspect of site performance to be aware of— the speed of the human mind. It&#8217;s safe to say the human brain processes information faster than any computer, browser and of the internet, so it may seem irrelevant to website performance. Truth be told, the design plays a significant role in how fast the brain can process information.</p>
<h2>Mental Processing and It&#8217;s Effect on Design</h2>
<p>Despite the power of the human mind, it still takes effort (and therefore time) to process information. Design, especially on the web, is primarily a vehicle for communicating information. Therefor <em>great</em> design not only communicates information, it also does so in a way that minimizes mental processing.</p>
<p>This ultimately ties into three key (out of — in my opinion — six) aspects of design. Specifically utility, usability and proficiency. Utility is the &#8220;functional&#8221; aspect of design. Every design is created with a result in mind, serving a specific function. For example, getting a user to contact you or purchase a product. Usability is how successful users are in achieving their tasks. Finally proficiency is how design impacts user performance. Can they complete tasks quicker? Are they able to do things they otherwise couldn&#8217;t feasibly do? etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Speed of processing effects each of these three aspects of design (and indirectly the other three as well.) In the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1846146100/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwww3poinc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1846146100" target="_blank">Willpower</a>, authors Baumeister and Tierney describe the behavioral result of spending mental energy. In short, the more energy spent the less willpower one has at a given moment. This means running into usability problems, reading through poorly formated text and hunting for information leaves users with little willpower to pursue their task. Users who are willpower deficient are unlikely to push forward and perform an action which fulfills a site objective.</p>
<p>By reducing the effort required to process the information on a page you keep the users willpower high, increasing the likelihood they will perform said action. I doubt anyone would argue the value of reducing mental strain, so the then question becomes &#8220;how can you do so?&#8221; To grasp the solution you must first understand the problem.</p>
<h2>Information Processing is Influenced by Presentation</h2>
<p>The human brain processes information in different ways, influenced by the method of delivery. When delivered in an optimal way, the brain observes, processes and absorbs information quickly and effortlessly. Not surprisingly there is a connection between speed of processing and work required, which is often referred to as mental load. Inversely, information in some forms is processed slowly, requiring additional effort for comprehension. In my opinion, the best way to understand the difference is by experiencing it.</p>
<p>First read the paragraph below and do your best to understand exactly what it describes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bright and sunny day. The scene is littered with bright-colored, metal and plastic playground equipment. Behind the playground lies and old, brooding brick wall. Three children are here, carelessly enjoying their youth in the spring sunlight. With smiles and giggles they bound across a some play toys which resemble something out of a space rodeo. The space toy has three large poles erupting from the ground, twice the height of the kids themselves. On each poll has a plastic seat, allowing them to stand, hop and sit as they rotate positions&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Think about how long it took to read the passage, visualize the description and absorb the information. Then, take a look at the image below.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kids-playing.jpg" rel="lightbox[935]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959" title="kids-playing" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kids-playing.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="510" /></a></p>
<p>Was it easier to process the text or the photo? Which method took more time? Which method lead to a greater understanding of the information?</p>
<h3>Visuals Are Processed Faster than Text</h3>
<p>This exercise demonstrates something important, we process visuals quicker than text. So why is the web overloaded with textual content? International design firm Information Architects have even claimed that <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/" target="_blank">Web Design is 95% Typography</a> (because there is so much textual content.) There is a problem here, if an overwhelming amount of content on the web is text, then most websites are not as effective as they could be.</p>
<div id="attachment_963" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 690px"><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-02-at-6.44.31-PM.png" rel="lightbox[935]"><img class="size-full wp-image-963" title="Screen Shot 2012-05-02 at 6.44.31 PM" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-02-at-6.44.31-PM.png" alt="" width="680" height="410" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Whitehouse.gov homepage is almost entirely comprised of textual content.</p></div>
<p>There are a host of causes for the heavy reliance on textual content. Visually representing complex ideas is difficult, sometimes impossible. Creating diagrams, flow charts and selecting (or taking) photos is time-consuming and can be cost prohibitive. I realize from a pragmatic standpoint it&#8217;s unrealistic to expect a major shift from text to visuals with web content. That&#8217;s OK, a purely visual web wouldn&#8217;t be very useful anyways. There is a middle ground, pairing visuals with text.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Visuals Combined with Text are Processed the Quickest</strong></span></p>
<p>While we process visuals faster than plain text, we actually process information the quickest when text and visuals are used in conjunction. This is why captions, infographics and comic books are so popular. Infographics in particular are great examples of how combining the two content types eases the comprehension of complex information.</p>
<div id="attachment_962" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 653px"><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/infographic-example.png" rel="lightbox[935]"><img class="size-full wp-image-962" title="infographic-example" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/infographic-example.png" alt="" width="643" height="722" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Which is easier to process? The all text version or the combination of visuals and text?</p></div>
<p>As designers we should be proactive about combining (appropriate) visuals with the textual content provided. In my experience, many designers (including myself) only include photos, diagrams and other visuals when requested. But in doing so we are doing our clients (or projects) a disservice. We should be looking for opportunities to translate text heavy sites into more visual experiences. In doing so we will be designing more effective websites.</p>
<h2>Summary: One Piece of Many</h2>
<p>The delivery of content is only one influencer of mental processing (all be it a big one.) Even with out visuals the speed which users absorb textual content can be improved through a host of design methods. Progressive disclosure, F Pattern content and line-length are a few quick examples. Which method is most appropriate depends on the context and type of content you are working with. More important is awareness of mental processing and how your work influences it.</p>
<p><em>Note: I do realize the irony of having a text heavy post on this subject.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier last week, I was pleasantly surprised when Jacob Nielsen posted a report on mobile web design which closely mirrored my own philosophy. The key takeaway of the article is that mobile specific sites are more effective than full content sites with mobile friendly presentation. After reading the article, I hoped the findings would put the &#8220;responsive design&#8221; craze in check. I was wrong.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with my stance on responsive design, it would be worth your while to see <a title="Responsive Web Design, is it the Answer? or Just Responsive?" href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/2011/12/responsive-web-design-is-it-the-answer-or-just-responsive/">my previous post on the subject</a>. If that sounds like too much work, I will summarize it for you. <strong>Responsive design is a great tool, but it has a time and place, neither of which are &#8220;always&#8221; or &#8220;everywhere.&#8221; </strong>In my experience mobile specifics site are more effective when dealing with a broad audience. Mobile optimized presentation is often better than nothing, but it rarely results in the best experience for all users. Nielsen&#8217;s research lead to a similar conclusion. Our thoughts are not shared by everyone however. Shortly after Neilsen&#8217;s post, designer Josh Clark posted a response entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/nielsen-wrong-mobile" target="_blank">Neilsen is Wrong on Mobile.</a>&#8221; After reading the article I felt Clark had some valid points and I began rethinking my approach to mobile as a results. During that process I decided to reread his article, and now I am no longer sure I agree with Clark&#8217;s conclusions.</p>
<h2>Josh Clark&#8217;s Issue with Nielsen&#8217;s Findings</h2>
<p>The bases of Josh&#8217;s response is largely fueled by two studies that report 25% of smart phone users access the web on the their cellphone more than any other device. I couldn&#8217;t find the On Device Research study referenced, but I was able to find the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Smartphones.aspx" target="_blank">PEW study</a>. According to this study, 35% of Adults in the United States own what they would consider a &#8220;smart phone.&#8221; 25% of those smart phone users report they access the internet from a mobile device majority of the time. When I do the math, that means 123.865 million adults in the US own a smart phone, and out of those people 30.9 million claim to primarily access the internet from their mobile device. This ends up being 11% of US Adults.</p>
<p>Ten percent is a significant portion of the population and seems to be a magic number in web design. We (web designers) have justified accessible websites because 10% of the population has some disability. We often choose which browsers, technologies and resolutions to support based on close proximity to a 10% adoption rate. With that in mind, I can&#8217;t deny that mobile designers should <strong><em>consider </em></strong>&#8220;mobile only users&#8221; (ie: users who only browse the web using mobile devices,) but to take this study and say the mobile experience should be designed specifically for them is extreme. Specifically I have two issues with this conclusion. Does this study really prove 11% of US Adults only browse the web on a mobile device? and if so, are full feature/content websites reorganized for smaller screens really the best experience for all mobile users? Let me explain further.</p>
<h2>What The Study Really Says</h2>
<p>While I am a web designer and not an anthropologist, my degree is in social science. For that reason I am often skeptical of survey results. In this case, I find the conclusions of the PEW study premature. If this study is going to be the guide determining how mobile websites should be designed, we need to be sure. Having looked through the study, I don&#8217;t see it addressing mobile websites specifically at all.</p>
<p>In Clark&#8217;s response, he states:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;&#8230;11 per cent of adults in the US, or about 25million people, [who] only see the web on small screens&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Josh uses this conclusion to argue that mobile web browsing isn&#8217;t about short, on the go and simple tasks. He claims mobile browsing is now on the couch, in the kitchen, airport layovers, etc&#8230; In short, he is saying this study proves mobile users are looking for a full featured and full content web experience.</p>
<p>Remember, we are talking about the design of <strong>mobile websites</strong>. So in order for this survey to have relevance to the topic at hand, it needs to cover <strong>mobile websites.</strong> However, if you look at the question this conclusion is based on it doesn&#8217;t reference mobile websites at all.<strong> The question the survey asked is says &#8220;internet usage,&#8221; not &#8220;web usage.&#8221; </strong>The exact question is detailed below:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;Overall, when you use the Internet, do you do that mostly using your cell phone or mostly using some other device like a desktop, laptop or tablet computer?&#8221; - </strong></em><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/Data-Tools/Explore-Survey-Questions/Roper-Center.aspx?item={F9D3926F-D4CA-47C9-96B0-E6AA2C743B0C}" target="_blank">PEW Internet Survey Questions</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Use the internet&#8221; is <strong><em>very</em></strong> different from &#8220;Browse the web.&#8221; There are hundreds of activities that constitute using the internet that don&#8217;t involve a mobile browser. E-mail, directions, music streaming, video streaming, app downloads, instant messaging, etc&#8230; etc&#8230; How can we use one study as a guide for mobile website best practices when it doesn&#8217;t even address websites specifically?</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if the study did prove 11% of US Adults only browse the web using their mobile device, how does that impact mobile web best practices? Does it really mean we should have one website for all devices with altered presentation? I think not.</p>
<h2>Prioritizing Mobile Design</h2>
<p>While 11% is a significant portion of the US population, it seems backwards to cater towards them over the other 88% who don&#8217;t use their cellphone as their primary internet device. Going back to <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mobile-vs-full-sites.html" target="_blank">Jackob Neilsen&#8217;s original test</a>, after testing hundreds of mobile websites they sites with reduced functionality and features offered a better mobile experience. Disputing Neilsen&#8217;s field research because a small percentage of the population only browses on cell phones or does so for extended periods of time is illogical. To further say we should design mobile sites focusing on fringe cases rather than the majority is also illogical.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean designers shouldn&#8217;t account for the fringe cases, by all means we should. Neilsen takes this into consideration by mentioning a &#8220;Full Site&#8221; link at the very beginning of his article. Doing so in an easy and obvious manner accounts for the fringe cases while catering to the most common use cases first. We can always make considerations for the anomalies where necessary. For example, you could provide a link to the full site which also employs responsive design. This is a more effective prioritization of users.</p>
<h2>The Future of Mobile</h2>
<p>Despite my disagreement with Josh, I admire his mobile education efforts. Mobile web design is very young, the way people use mobile is constantly changing. We may have strategies for mobile design but we have yet to find which strategies work best and why. This is why I also value Neilsen&#8217;s work. There is a lot of speculation and opinion surrounding mobile design, Neilsen does research. Facts and field research will ultimately uncover the best approach, not surveys and speculative conclusions. This is why Nielsen&#8217;s findings are ultimately right and should weigh in on the mobile design approach.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/project-status/" target="_blank"><strong>Don&#8217;t care why I created the plugin? Skip the explanation and download it here.</strong></a></p>
<p>The most valuable insight I have gained from running a design agency is an understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. Like most agency owners or freelancers, I got into the business because I love creativity. While business is exciting and I love aspects of it, running an agency often requires performing tasks that fall in my weakness category. Project management is one aspects of business I frequently struggle with.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, I would spend time creating amazing things rather than planning when to create them or talking about what was created. That being said, any design professional respects the role of project management. Having been on both sides of the fence (client and provider) I know exactly how it feels to be in the dark about your project. If your a designer you must excel at project management, even if it&#8217;s not second nature.</p>
<p>Over the past seven years I have learned addressed my deficiency by harnessing my core asset, creativity.  Rather than force myself to adopt the common methods of project management I have begun creating tools that spread the weight of PM tasks. My current tool — &#8220;Project Status&#8221;  — is my favorite tool thus far.</p>
<h2>A WordPress Plugin for Keeping Clients Updated</h2>
<p>Anytime you experience the same situation a several times there is an opportunity to improve on it. My inspiration was a common occurrence of clients inquiring about the status of their project. This often happened despite setting dates, outlining milestones and creating schedules. To me, this illustrated two issues. Most importantly, clients shouldn&#8217;t have to proactively <em><strong>contact me</strong></em> to get an update. Secondarily the materials I delivered were too cumbersome to sort through and reference.</p>
<p>There are plenty of project management tools available, my company uses Basecamp for project management. While I still use it today, it&#8217;s use is primarily for internal communication. The problem with these systems is they are designed for the agencies, not clients. Most clients dread the idea of logging into a foreign system and the information provided is not what they are looking for anyways. In my experience, those who try these systems inevitably give up and resorting to e-mail by the time the project is over.</p>
<p>Most clients don&#8217;t care about what tasks we are performing or what the key milestones are. They  just want a general idea of how far along their project is, what they are responsible for and an expected completion date. Everything else is noise or irrelevant. Being that I haven&#8217;t come across a system that easily does this I went ahead and created one.</p>
<p>This creation is called &#8220;Project Status.&#8221; It&#8217;s a simple WordPress plugin for service based businesses and freelancers. It&#8217;s primary function is to give clients a visual indicator of the project status. More specifically it lets you define four key phases of a project, currently activities and client responsibilities. Rather than requiring logins, clients can access their project status through a custom URL.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the beginning.</p>
<h2>Plugin Features</h2>
<p>This plugin is a simple way to give clients that information while providing you with a high level overview of open projects and their standpoint. It gives you the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and manage unlimited projects</li>
<li>Track levels of completion</li>
<li>Track current tasks</li>
<li>Identify client responsibilities and project holds</li>
<li>Identify four major milestones (20%/40%/60%/80%)</li>
<li>Send clients to a page containing the above information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Projects are displayed in a responsive template so clients can access and monitor their project from any device.</strong></p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>I have some big future plans, but first and foremost I want to know what the plugin is missing. In its current form this tool scratches my itch extremely well. That being said everyone&#8217;s business is run differently. I would love to hear what features and functionality would make this tool more useful to everyone.</p>
<p>For me, the only feature it doesn&#8217;t currently have is a method e-mail communication. My plan is to include some capability to e-mail project stakeholders letting them know their project has been updated (or even include the status in the e-mail.) I am debating if this should be automated, manual or an option. Time will tell.</p>
<p>Do you have an idea for an improvement? Let me know in the comments below. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/project-status/" target="_blank">Otherwise you can download the plugin from WordPress.org.</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past fifteen plus years of designing websites for other people, I have received countless requests to remove elements from a design because they are &#8220;redundant.&#8221; The perception is that if something is included on the page once, especially in an obvious fashion, there&#8217;s no reason to repeat it elsewhere. Further baffling, it&#8217;s my experience many not only believe it&#8217;s unnecessary to repeat elements they feel it&#8217;s harmful. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Repeating important elements is not only useful, it can have dramatic effects on site usability. The reason lies in human psychology.</p>
<h2>How People See (and Miss) What Happens Around Them</h2>
<p>We tend to give ourselves a lot of credit when it comes to our skills of perception. We <em>think</em> we see everything that&#8217;s happening around us, especially what&#8217;s right in front of our faces. The truth is, humans have an extreme case of tunnel vision. We hyper focus on what we feel is important and ignore anything that looks familiar or irrelevant. This is especially true when it comes to the web where proficient users have become hyper-custom to identifying what&#8217;s related to their task at hand and what isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>An interesting demonstration is the pass counting exercise. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGQmdoK_ZfY" target="_blank">Watch this video</a> and see if you can accurately count how many passes the players in the white shirt make, about 50% of people get it wrong.</p>
<p>What this video demonstrates is how easily we miss big obvious things even when we are practically staring right at them. Similarly, we can completely miss large changes directly in our field of view and not even realize it. This is a phenomenon called &#8220;Changed Blindness&#8221; and it&#8217;s more extreme than you might think.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0PHp-UbHdY&amp;feature=related" target="_blank"> I highly recommend watching this video as a demonstration</a>.</p>
<p>Both tunnel vision and change blindness have significant implications on web usability.</p>
<h2>How This Applies to The Web</h2>
<p>A certain percentage of users will miss key elements even if they are large, obvious and right in front of them. This is especially true of navigation. When someone visits a website they don&#8217;t calming focus on every aspect of the page, analyzing if it will help them accomplish their task or not. Eye tracking studies have shown their eyes dart around the page feverishly trying to catch a glimpse of anything that looks relevant. In this process much of the site gets ignored or missed. In fact, The Neilson-Normand Group reports <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/percent-text-read.html" target="_blank">only 28% of the words on a page actually get read</a>.</p>
<p>If you have key information, messaging or navigation and it only appears in one spot then chances are users will miss it part of the time. If these elements are critical to the success of the website you are doing a huge disservice to only include them once. It&#8217;s obvious to <strong>you</strong> that these elements exist because you are hyper aware of the design. You are aware and care about every detail, a trait users won&#8217;t share.</p>
<p>Repetition (and redundancy) has incredible value in many aspects of modern life. Branding and marketing is relies heavily on people hearing the exact same message multiple times. In teaching, one of the best ways to improve comprehension is repeating yourself. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic" target="_blank">availability heuristic</a> states that what you consider to be true and important is largely dependent on how often you hear about it.</p>
<p>Repetition doesn&#8217;t mean duplicate. You don&#8217;t need to <em>literally</em> repeat the exact same representation of an element (be in navigation, a call to action, etc&#8230;) to minimize user oversights. In fact, if the user missed it the first time it&#8217;s because they didn&#8217;t think it looked relevant. Alternate representations are actually <em>more</em> effective.</p>
<p>The most basic example of this is footer navigation. Scrolled to the bottom of the page and didn&#8217;t find what you were looking for? The footer navigation is usually visually different and gives the user a second chance to find their link. Let&#8217;s look at some examples to demonstrate.</p>
<h3>Zappos.com</h3>
<p>Zappos.com is a great example of effective repetition. If you are looking for Men&#8217;s clothes (because I am a man and I like clothes) you can find it through the primary navigation by clicking on &#8220;Mens,&#8221; or Clothing.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/zappos-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[907]"><img title="zappos-1" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/zappos-1.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>You could also click on the sidebar navigation under &#8220;Shop Men&#8217;s.&#8221; Finally the options are repeated a third time in the footer through a massive footer menu.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/zappos-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[907]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913" title="zappos-2" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/zappos-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>One could argue Zappos is being horribly redundant in their design, but they&#8217;re not. They have given users three pathways to the same information. That way if the miss one or think about their task using different terminology there are other options waiting for them.</p>
<h3>Freshbooks.com</h3>
<p>Freshbooks.com, an online invoicing solution has five free trial buttons and a sign-up button in the top navigation. Is having five calls to action repetitive? yes. Redundant? No. In this case not only does repetition improve usability, it increases the effectiveness of the site. One of the primary objectives of this site is getting trial sign-ups, more calls to action means more users noticing them and higher conversions as a result.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914" title="freshbooks-sml" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/freshbooks-sml.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="1292" /></p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>For reasons beyond me, some people have an aversion to repetition with in design. In most cases, this manifests as the desire to remove elements on the page because they are deemed &#8220;redundant.&#8221; Redundant by definition means being able to remove without loss of function. In many cases repeating elements doesn&#8217;t mean redundant, as function is lost if a user doesn&#8217;t locate what they are looking for.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by the change blindness studies mentioned above, we navigate the world with tunnel vision. While we see much of the world around us, our brain actively filters out anything perceived as unimportant. This process trades accuracy for speed. In some cases our subconscious filtering makes mistakes, missing important items. If those items are not repeated the design fails.</p>
<p>Next time you are designing a website think about what critical elements exist on the page and consider how they can be repeated in an effective way. Further, make sure to push back when a client or boss requests you remove something because it&#8217;s &#8220;redundant.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few websites are designed with bad intentions. If the designer or stakeholders care about the project you can be sure every element on the page has been analyzed, reviewed and tweaked. This sounds obvious, but it should be disconcerting. Let me explain further. If most websites have had thought and care put into them, why are there so many under performing websites?  To illustrate, one of the first tasks I have my students perform is analyzing the effectiveness of &#8220;big brand&#8221; websites. These websites have hundreds of thousands of dollars put into them and often years of planning by large groups of people. Despite the care, attention and effort put forth, half of the students will say any given website is a failure.</p>
<p>One could argue it&#8217;s the fault of uninformed stakeholders, design by comity, or simply bad designers&#8230; but I think there is a bigger problem. There is a fundamental misunderstanding of cognitive psychology. If you don&#8217;t understand how users interpret what they see you can&#8217;t be an effective designer. This is harder than it sounds however, because you can&#8217;t use logic and rational. Logic and rational only work if people behave based on logic and reason&#8230; but they don&#8217;t. The last five years of cognitive research has concluded most people don&#8217;t <strong><em>really</em></strong> know why they behave the way they do. Their mind justifies behavior using logic even though logic isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s used for decision making.</p>
<p>Many design failures are caused by this misunderstanding, the most damaging (in my opinion) is designing without consideration for selective disregard.</p>
<h2>What is Selective Disregard</h2>
<p>The web has historically been plagued with designs that attempt to cram too much information into too little space. The cause is often traced to misconceptions of &#8220;more is better&#8221; or &#8220;design by committee&#8221; where every department needs representation. Regardless, users have been forced to cope with overwhelming websites since their first experiences online.</p>
<p>Savvy users learn how to turn off images, eliminate ads, or simply avoid overwhelming websites. Average users have learned to instinctively ignore what they consider irrelevant. <strong>This behavior is known as selective disregard.</strong></p>
<p>Banners were the first prevalent example of selective disregard. As the web gained popularity in the late nineties, more websites supplemented income by displaying narrow horizontal advertisements across the top of their page. Online advertising was new, both in customer base and targeting methods, so the quality of the advertisements was mediocre at best. The banners often distracted users, slowing them down and disrupting productivity. Over time users adapted, ignoring anything banner-shaped (hence the term &#8220;banner blindness&#8221;).</p>
<p>Banners are easy to ignore because they have easily identifiable patterns including shape, location, and behavior. With experience, users expand their disregard from what is obviously irrelevant, to everything but the immediately relevant.</p>
<p>Selective disregard operates via peripheral vision, similar to how we navigate the world. If you were to walk down a busy street, you would probably see and forget a handful of street signs. Those signs enter your peripheral vision but are subconsciously ignored because they&#8217;re deemed unimportant or familiar. If something flagged important or unfamiliar enters your peripheral vision, you subconsciously shift your attention to it.</p>
<p>Websites are browsed in the same fashion. When something enters your peripheral vision and is identified as relevant, focus is shifted to it. Everything else is ignored completely; users are unaware they saw anything beyond what they subconsciously deemed relevant.</p>
<h2>Browsing Behavior</h2>
<p>People make quick, subconscious assessments as to the relevance of what&#8217;s in their field of vision. For a given task, most web pages have more unrelated content than related. To maximize productivity, users ignore everything not labeled &#8220;relevant&#8221; by the brain.The more on a page, the more users must ignore. Processing everything on a cluttered page is cumbersome and unnecessary to complete most tasks. A page with few elements takes little effort to analyze, so users typically do so with ease, which in turn allows them to complete the task at hand as it was intended by the designer.</p>
<p>A common, but ineffective technique used to battle selective disregard is the application of emphasis. Rather than remove unimportant elements, designers further emphasize important ones. In doing so, they actually make the page more cluttered. With more emphasis there is more demanding the users attention and more they must ignore. If a user deems an element unnecessary they will likely ignore it regardless of emphasis.</p>
<div id="attachment_899" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/apple_example1.jpg" rel="lightbox[875]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-899" title="apple_example" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/apple_example1-300x258.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="258" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">If you are looking for the iPod Shuffle, you will likely ignore the large iPod touch graphic in the center of the page.</p></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you were on the Apple website looking for information on the iPod shuffle. The iPod section of the website has 10+ separate elements about various different types of iPods available for purchase. The most emphasized is the iPod touch, with very little screen real estate is dedicated to the shuffle.</p>
<p>Since your task is to find information on the iPod shuffle, while you will technically see most of the elements on the page but you will only process a few of them. It would take too much time to focus on, analyze and interpret each of the ten separate elements. Instead you will notice them through your peripheral vision and filter out anything that doesn&#8217;t look like or say &#8220;iPod Shuffle.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t matter the iPod touch area is extremely large, users who are uninterested in that product will ignore it. Even those who  look directly at it will forget the details of the area moments later.</p>
<p>There is little that can be done to prevent selective disregard. It&#8217;s a behavioral byproduct of the information age. However, you can understand and manage it.</p>
<h2>Managing Selective Disregard</h2>
<p>If nothing else, refrain from including anything that resembles a banner, as you can be sure users will ignore it. More importantly, remove any unnecessary elements. With a minimal site, users can easily analyze and digest everything presented to them.</p>
<p>Further, resist the temptation to over emphasize elements to grab the users attention. While some amount of emphasis is key to good design, don&#8217;t force it. If you have a strong information hierarchy the user should be able to discover key elements relevant to them on their own. Instead, make sure key areas have adequate emphasis and are well-defined. For example, areas within a sidebar should have easily identifiable headings. That way a user can subconsciously ignore the section when irrelevant, or focus on it when relevant.</p>
<div id="attachment_898" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/zappos_example1.jpg" rel="lightbox[875]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-898" title="zappos_example" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/zappos_example1-300x260.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="260" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The use of easily identifiable headings and labels is a good way to manage selective disregard.</p></div>
<p>If you navigated to the Zappos website looking to purchase some mens shoes you would undoubtedly ignore the large image in the center of the page depicting a woman&#8217;s swimsuit. Your peripheral vision would likely spot several key areas relevant to your task, specifically the &#8220;Mens&#8221; navigation headings and anything related to &#8220;Shoes.&#8221; The over emphasized swimsuit pictures would just get ignored despite their size.</p>
<p>Zappos is a well designed site and their one large call out area is not damaging the experience of the site. The key takeaway is not to avoid emphasis, rather understand the limitations of emphasis. When over used as a way to combat selective disregard you actually make the phenomenon worse. Instead, first limit what ends up on the page to the bare essentials. Then use emphasis selectively and carefully while understanding the limitations of its effectiveness.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Design without consideration of selective disregard is one mistake out of many caused by a misunderstanding of human behavior. I have said it in the past and I will say it again, great designers are as much scientists as artists. If you are being hired to design something that hopes to get tangible results you need to understand how your decisions impact the way people interacting with your work behave.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I see more web professionals specializing these days. There was a time where web designers literally did everything. If you worked on the web it meant you did coding, design, photography and any backend work. Now many become so specialized they hyper focus, often on a specific platform. There are fewer Javascript experts and more jQuery consultants. You see plenty of Drupal experts but not many who just do PHP. There is a growing trend of specializing with-in a specialty.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to this. For one, by focusing on one specific aspect of your career you can become a master at it much quicker. Secondarily, people are often willing to pay more for expertise. Finally, it&#8217;s much easier to become known for something very specific than a broad range of skills.</p>
<p>I discuss specialization at great length with my students. The program I teach in exposes students to three aspects of the web, coding (front end and backend), user experience and design. Many of my students take classes in all three areas but are primarily interested in just one. As a design instructor I encounter plenty of aspiring coders who begrudgingly try to work their way through color selection, typography and layouts. Often times these students will vent their frustrations, confused as to why they are forced to learn skills that they &#8220;aren&#8217;t going to use.&#8221; In every case I correct their assumption, <strong>coders and developers are often responsible for design.</strong></p>
<h2>Users Interact With Code Through Visuals</h2>
<p>Author Donald Normand describes design as a way to translate what happens behind the scenes of an object (or website) into something a user can understand through their senses. In industrial design this most often occurs through site, sound and touch. On the web, it really only happens visually. This means all of the senses we use to understand the world around us can&#8217;t be used with the exception of one. Therefor how a user interacts with a website, web application, etc&#8230; is largely determined by what they see, ie. the visual layer.</p>
<p>These days you don&#8217;t see too many sites designed by coders with no design experience. That&#8217;s a situation of the past. I do consistently see however, sites where developers/front end coders were asked to turn designs into html/css templates. If the coder had an adequate understanding of design then the project ended up successful. If not, you can be sure the execution of the design was blunted.</p>
<h2>Great Design is All About the Details</h2>
<p>How well could you replicate a Monet painting if you didn&#8217;t understand the difference between paint types? Even if you could accurately recreate the image, if you used the wrong type of stroke, pressure, paint or brush size it wouldn&#8217;t carry the same impact the original did. This is not unlike coding a design without understanding design principles.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t understand design you don&#8217;t know what to pay attention to. Your eye isn&#8217;t trained to pick up the subtle details that make a design most effective. Dark gray text ends up looking &#8220;black,&#8221; elements end up approximately in the right spot and elements are close to the right size. With out design knowledge spatial zones are estimated. If you don&#8217;t understand the importance of exact measurements it doesn&#8217;t seem worth the effort to take them (which would be time-consuming). If you don&#8217;t understand the importance of whitespace elements in approximately the same spot as the original design they are assumed to be close enough. The problem is you don&#8217;t know there is a strict grid the design was created with. You don&#8217;t know the text was intentionally lightened a tad to ease eyestrain. You don&#8217;t know things were sized based on very specific proportions. You don&#8217;t know because you never learned those sorts of things matter.</p>
<p>But those details do matter, a great deal in fact. As you evolve as a designer you begin to become hyper aware of these details. It becomes immediately apparent when a design has lost it&#8217;s luster due to poor implementation. I don&#8217;t mean to berate coders, because there are some truly stellar ones out there&#8230; but the best coders are the ones who understand and respect design principles. You don&#8217;t have to be an amazing designer to code well, you just have to train yourself what to look for.</p>
<h2>What to Look For When Coding</h2>
<p>Combining experience with knowledge of the design principles is the best way to improve your coding abilities. That being said there are some key things coders should be conscious of when building a design, most importantly spacing, sizing and detail.</p>
<h3>Pay Attention Spacing</h3>
<p>The most obvious overlooked fundamental would have to be spacing. The space between and around elements is critical. Nine pixels are not the same as ten pixels. Great designers pay attention to every pixel of space and intentionally use spacing to communicate relationships, boundaries, develop balance and create resting areas for the eyes. Even being off by a few pixels can disrupt the design. Grids are held together by exact measurements. Failing to be exact breaks the grid.</p>
<p>Coders must pay attention to column widths, the height of elements, margins between columns, padding within areas and margins between text and images. Exact numbers mater so learning to measure is an invaluable skill.</p>
<h3>Be Exact with Sizing</h3>
<p>Like spacing, designs are held together by the relative sizing of everything on the page. If you make something larger or smaller than was intended the balance of the design is damaged. Sizing is not often a problem with images, where an exact portion of the design is transplanted into the website. More commonly it&#8217;s an issue with font size. I don&#8217;t deny it&#8217;s easier to guess a font size rather than use the type tool to see for sure, but it makes a difference on the overall design. Selecting a font size is not solely determined by legibility. The size of fonts relative to other type on the page plays a large role on the overall balance and information hierarchy.</p>
<p>Many designers are very intentional about how much larger headlines are compared to body type, some even use the golden ratio to select type sizes. If one size becomes off the golden ratio between type on the page is broken.</p>
<h3>Be Mindful of Subtle Details</h3>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much design experience to realize that details are more effective when subtle. A soft, subtle drop shadow adds depth to the design without being distracting. Sometimes a shadow can be so subtle it&#8217;s barely noticeable, but subconsciously the user picks registers it as part of the overall personality of the design. The problem is, if the coder doesn&#8217;t know to look closely for those details they will also miss them and the final design loses personality as a result.</p>
<p>There have been more than a handful of times where I knew details would be missed, for example adjacent dark and white lines which simulate a &#8220;groove&#8221; in a surface are often coded as a single black line. Subtle shadows or gradients get lost for solid colors. You don&#8217;t have to know how to create those details (or when to use them), but you do need to know how to spot them.</p>
<p>Ideally a design comes back from coding looking exactly like it did in photoshop (or your other tool of choice.) However I do realize this in some cases is asking a lot. In those cases, if the coder can handle the three items mentioned above making any final adjustments will require minimal investment.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>While this post has been focused on  front end coders, it applies to developers as well. I have seen plenty of teams where the developer ends up making design decisions because it&#8217;s too costly to involve a designer (in terms of time, hours, scheduling, etc&#8230;) Regardless of your official title, if you somehow alter the visual layer that users interact with you need to understand design well enough to preserve that layer. Again, that isn&#8217;t to say you need to know how to create usable and beautiful designs, rather you need to know what to look for.</p>
<p>The best coders not only know about semantic mark-up, efficient CSS, progressive enhancement and Javascript, they also know how to develop a page from a photoshop file design with out details getting lost in translation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me you probably have six books you are reading at any one time. My thirst for knowledge is unrelenting&#8230; and I bet your&#8217;s is too. While there are few investments more worthwhile than your own wisdom the constant purchasing of books can put a hurting on your wallet. In my case, I often find I have spent hundreds of dollars on books throughout the course of a year. Recently, completely by accident, I found a potential solution to this ongoing book addiction. While browsing through some design books on Amazon.com I came across more than a dozen great e-books available for less than $5. Take a look, I bet you will be surprised what you can get for the price of a cup of coffee.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t find what you were looking for here try searching through the Kindle section of Amazon and sort by lowest price. There were plenty of great looking books I didn&#8217;t include in this list. It will be worthwhile to check back throughout the year as well. I predict the affordable e-book trend will continue to grow as the publishing playing field is leveled and authors can make decent returns despite lower prices.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I try not to succumb to the lure of new design tricks but alas I am human. While I have been able to avoid several recent design trends, I must confuse the &#8220;wow&#8221; of parallax scrolling grabbed me by the brain and hypnotized me for some time. I was so stricken that several previous design concepts for my agency website were focused around the parallax technique. At that time there was little information published on how to reproduce the parallax effect. I stumbled across one, maybe two different home-brewed techniques that worked but were not exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>Eventually I gave up on the parallax idea and produced a website that stuck to typical javascript effects. In revisiting the technique for a new project I was pleasantly surprised with an abundance of tutorials and resources. In an effort to catalog them all, I developed the list below.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on Parallax</h2>
<p>There is no denying the &#8220;sexiness&#8221; of parallax effects but I question their usefulness. The primary purpose of the effect is an increase in engagement, ideally through an emotional response. If you have done any learning on emotion and design you know that all decisions are made based on emotion (with very little logic actually coming into play.) It would seem the parallax effect would be an ideal technique for any website&#8230; but it&#8217;s not. The approach is not without its shortcomings. The two major issues being performance related. Parallax websites tend to run slow even on fast machines and they also tend to slowdown the user. In the cases where users are just looking for information the &#8220;cool technique&#8221; becomes a hindrance, frustrating the user instead of exciting them.</p>
<p>Before using the parallax effect make sure it is the right approach for your situation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few words can describe the euphoria I felt upon learning of widespread @font-face support. The time and effort once required to make typographically pleasing websites would be reduced forever. The very notion of dropping tools like Cufon, sIFR and image replacement had me grinning ear for ear. And what of body copy? Designers could finally find an acceptable typeface for large paragraphs of text that wasn&#8217;t Arial, Verdana or Georgia&#8230; or so I thought.</p>
<p>To say I am disappointed in the selection of embed-able fonts would be extreme, but there is still a void left unfilled. As an avid tinkerer, I have made it a self-imposed duty to test out as many typefaces as possible. Having browsed Google&#8217;s selection, TypeKit and the free listings at Font Squirrel I couldn&#8217;t help but notice an abundance of typefaces perfect for headlines&#8230; but few well suited as an elegant solution for legible body copy. Many of the typefaces were limited to one style (meaning no italic or bold version), rendered poorly on Windows Machines or were illegible at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>Seeing few other options, I have replaced my use of Cufon and sIFR for headlines but continue to use the same boring default font stack for everything else. Not being satisfied with this compromise I decided to go out and find at least ten great typefaces for body copy that render well across all browsers. I found significantly more.</p>
<h2>My Criteria</h2>
<p>To meet my standards of being &#8220;acceptable&#8221; for body copy the fonts had to have at least a few different weights and ideally an italic and bold italic style. As almost any website with body copy will have common bold and italicized text this was my first priority. While browsers will simulate italic, bold and the combination of the two it&#8217;s never ideal.</p>
<p>Secondarily the fonts had to be pretty damn legible across multiple different browsers at 16px/24px. This really wasn&#8217;t an issue between modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc&#8230;) quite a few of the fonts looked illegible in Internet explorer.</p>
<h2>The Test Page and Collection</h2>
<p>If you are interested in looking at <a href="/blog/web-fonts-for-body-copy">the page I used for testing you can find it here</a>.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To my surprise, the selection of body copy fonts are plentiful&#8230; they are just buried amongst an avalanche of those suited for headlines only. I hope this proves to be a valuable resource in selecting alternative fonts for your body text with out having to wade through hundreds of ill suited ones.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early December 2008 was when I first held a prototype of what I would later call &#8220;<a href="http://webdesign-sketchbook.com/" target="_blank">The Web Design Sketchbook</a>&#8221; in my hands. It was pretty rough, had been printed using an old, slowly dying ink jet printer and was bound using a $100 Office Max binding machine. Despite its lackluster, I was ecstatic. Not because I expected (or wanted) to become right off it, because it was something I wanted to use and couldn&#8217;t find a suitable solution for. There is something indescribably fulfilling about creating a product that serves your needs all while knowing others surely have the same problem.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I held the third &#8220;production&#8221; version in my hand and experienced a similar feeling. This new version, hard bound and simplified, feels special. There is something about it that makes me want to take it to meetings and use it to brainstorm nightly. Granted, I am admittedly biased, but I know it can help others too. Sketching undeniably improves design.</p>
<h2>Sketching Improves Design</h2>
<div id="attachment_827" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMAG0778.jpg" rel="lightbox[825]"><img class="size-large wp-image-827" title="IMAG0778" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMAG0778-1024x612.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="268" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Some quick thumbnail sketches I did while brainstorming layouts.</p></div>
<p>For much of my career I dismissed designing on paper because I couldn&#8217;t get the sketches to look as &#8220;cool&#8221; as my interfaces in Photoshop. This mindset demonstrates my prior misunderstanding of design. I didn&#8217;t find sketching helpful because I couldn&#8217;t sketch cool textures, drop shadows and 3D buttons. I felt those were the elements that made design effective.</p>
<p>I will confess I began sketching because I saw some very detailed sketches that were practically works of art. The designer had even used drafting markers to add color and depth to the sketches! I wanted a book of sketches that I could use as a coffee table book at my office. In my mind clients would look through the book in awe as they waited for meetings. So I started sketching. While I never ended up putting my sketchbooks out for clients to look through I got something much better out of it.</p>
<p>Sketching lead to an epiphany. My focus and understanding of design shifted. Rather than thinking about what effects I was going to use, I began thinking about the best way to present content. This expanded into thinking about what content should be on the page in the first place. I realized what it looked like was not as important as what was on the page and how it was organized. Design isn&#8217;t adding a coat of paint of the walls, it&#8217;s deciding where the walls should go.</p>
<p>This new-found respect for designing on paper eventually led to the creation of The Web Design Sketchbook.</p>
<h2>Version Three</h2>
<div id="attachment_828" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMAG0770.jpg" rel="lightbox[825]"><img class="size-large wp-image-828" title="IMAG0770" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMAG0770-1024x612.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="268" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The new hardcover</p></div>
<p>My goal with the latest version was to arrive at something that felt special, less whiteboard-esk (my original approach.) I realized the sketchbook would house the users grand ideas, strategies and be the start to new websites, companies and ventures. It should feel like an &#8220;innovation diary&#8221; rather than a throw away item. This lead to simplification. We took out the 12 column grid and switched to an open boxed grid. The white soft cover was removed and a deep black hardcover used in its place. It was shrunk from a notebook size and made into a diary or Moleskin size.</p>
<p>I am very pleased with the latest version. I truly believe designing from paper will improve any designers work, regardless if you use my tool or printer paper. I urge you to try it, just a handful of times. See where it gets you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have shrugged off responsive web design for some time now despite it&#8217;s growing popularity. I first came across &#8220;the concept&#8221; four years ago; at the time, responsive design required Javascript and dynamically changed stylesheets based on viewport size.  Suffice to say I have long been aware of the capability to adapt design based on browser size but rarely found a reason to use it. Of course several years ago mobile browsing was limited and rarely supported Javascript anyways. These days mobile browsing is growing&#8230; and fast. Additionally most browsers support responsive design natively using CSS. These two factors result in an increased need of viewport specific design and a ubiquitous technology to execute it. That said, I have always struggled recommending responsive design because it feels&#8230; well&#8230; more fanboy than useful.</p>
<p>I will admit responsive design makes for a more enjoyable experience across different resolutions (and therefore devices) when compared to a single fixed design. When trying to cater to a multi-device audience responsive design is certainly an option, but is it the best one?</p>
<h2>Is Context Irrelevant?</h2>
<p>I question responsive design as a solution because it ignores the question of context. To assume that responsive design is the answer to the mobile web is to assume people browse on their phone under the same circumstances as a desktop computer. This isn&#8217;t the case, not in the slightest. Users browse using a mobile device because it is inconvenient or impossible to use a desktop or laptop.</p>
<p>Users are well aware that browsing on a computer is easier than a mobile device, they choose not to because it&#8217;s not practical at the time. This means the location and circumstances surrounding their usage is dramatically different. Rather than leisurely browsing from a quiet home office users are looking for information while standing online at the bank, on the bus, while walking, in the bathroom (ew?), etc&#8230;</p>
<p>The significance of this contextual difference is massive. When you have a fast connection, a large monitor, plenty of time and fewer distractions you welcome things like stimulating visuals, subtle effects and unessential content. You have the time and the resources to ignore the irrelevant and focus on what matters to you. In the mobile context almost the opposite is true. You have slow connections, limited screen real estate, little time and lots of distractions.</p>
<p>How can responsive web design be a solution to mobile browsing when it only addresses one (maybe two) of the aforementioned issues? Responsive design is best at addressing the reduced screen real estate of mobile devices. It does nothing to show the most contextually relevant content and reducing irrelevant content can only be done via hacks (display:none). Not to mention your device still downloads more data than necessary. Responsive design rearranges what&#8217;s on the screen for an improved presentation. The presentation is improved, but isn&#8217;t the web all about content? What does responsive design do about content?</p>
<h2>But It&#8217;s Not All Bad, Right?</h2>
<p>I am a firm believer in mobile specific sites. If mobile is important to you or your audience you need to invest in a site <strong>custom tailored for the mobile experience</strong>. Doing so is more expensive in both initial investment and ongoing maintenance but the payoff is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Despite the shortcomings of responsive design, it can be valuable. </strong>As a pragmatist, I accept it&#8217;s not practical to design a website to the highest of ideals. Mobile specific sites are resource intensive, the return is not always worth the investment. Alternatively, responsive design — with some practice — is not that difficult (ie: resource moderate.) If you want to improve the experience of the site across devices but can&#8217;t justify creating an entirely separate site then by all means use responsive design. When done well, it makes a significant difference.</p>
<h2>Where Does That Leave Us?</h2>
<p>I am a fan of responsive design, despite the tone of this post. The web design industry moves quickly, creating excitement. In my opinion, one of our industry shortcomings is &#8220;tactic-itous,&#8221; where new technologies are introduced and we are tempted to use them just because it&#8217;s new. Responsive design is both new and exciting, this has led to glorification. A year ago we experienced the same surge of excitement with web fonts (and the same occurred with jQuery before that.) Many designers used new, open licensed fonts simply because they could not because they were most appropriate.</p>
<p>If responsive design (or any web technology) will improve the experience for your users then by all means use it. However, make the decision based on strategy, don&#8217;t simply use the tactic which is newest and most exciting.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several years ago I wrote a post which became shockingly popular called &#8220;Free Project Management Tools.&#8221; Well a lot has changed since 2008, especially regarding free (or almost free) pm tools. When I first wrote the post, there were some good options but no great ones. Today, the opposite is true. There are so many good ones it can be hard to pick. I have taken a few months to test and try over a dozen, eliminating all but the top five. Of these top five I have recommended and installed several for clients (which should be a strong testimonial). My favorites, in order are:</p>
<h2>1. Collabtive (self hosted)</h2>
<p><a href="http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/" target="_new"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-806" title="collabtive-screenshot" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/collabtive-screenshot.png" alt="" width="680" height="578" /></a></p>
<p>If you are only going to try one project management solution, try Collabtive. It&#8217;s a free, open source project management tool that rivals (and in many ways exceeds) the popular alternatives like BaseCamp and ZoHo. Like the premium solutions available, Collabtive has individual projects, user management, tasks, files, time reporting, milestones, calenders, etc&#8230; it even has a Basecamp import if you are looking to migrate. The interface is beautifully designed and looks like paid software as well. You should have little fear of the project becoming unsupported as the parent company makes money by providing hosted solutions, customization and additional functionality. Really a winner.</p>
<p><a href="http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/" target="_new">Collabtive Website</a></p>
<h2>2. Freedcamp</h2>
<p><a href="http://freedcamp.com/" target="_new"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-807" title="freedcamp-screenshot" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/freedcamp-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="548" height="316" /></a></p>
<p>The other heavyweight contender in the free project management arena is Freedcamp. Designed and built as an alternative to basedcamp Freedcamp boasts a wide and established user base including 48 universities, 30,000+ professionals across 188 countries. Impressive. Not sure how to install a PHP app or configure a MySQL database? No problem, Freedcamp is a hosted solution. However hosted solutions are not without fault. Worried about security and privacy? Your information is on their servers. Should they decide to charge for the basic service, guess what? Your looking at migrating your data to a new platform. Need a lot of space? Freedcamp is only free for&nbsp; limited amount of space.</p>
<p>Hosting aside, Freecamp is full featured, easy to use and has a beautiful interface. If you don&#8217;t need unlimited space or prefer to have someone else host your project management tool, Freedcamp is a great fit.</p>
<p><a href="http://freedcamp.com/" target="_new">Freedcamp Website</a></p>
<h2>3. Project Pier</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.projectpier.org/" target="_new"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808" title="project-pier-screenshot" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/project-pier-screenshot.png" alt="" width="600" height="458" /></a></p>
<p>On first glance Project Pier looks pretty rough and I will be honest, I almost didn&#8217;t try it. Luckily I did, because it&#8217;s actually a pretty amazing piece of software. Despite the hideous skin used in the website screenshots, Project Pier has an assortment of beautiful and well designed themes which make the software pleasing on the eyes. Functionality wise PP boasts many of the same features as the two previous packages including messaging, client access, user groups (and rights management), scheduling, tasks, time management, files, etc&#8230; In addition, the software has some unique features such as form creation, easy theaming, tagging and version control. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Project Pier surpases the quality of&nbsp; Freedcamp and Collabtive in the near future.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.projectpier.org/" target="_new">Project Pier Website</a></p>
<h2>4. Achievo</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.achievo.nl/" target="_new"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809" title="achievo-screenshot" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/achievo-screenshot.png" alt="" width="680" height="470" /></a></p>
<p>Achievo is not as pretty as Freedcamp or Collabtive, but what it lacks in aesthetics it makes up in features. Where Collabtive and Freedcamp seem like close copies of Basecamp, Achievo takes a different approach to project management. This open source gem has unique features including reporting, customer relationship management, human resource management, time scheduling and activity monitoring. If you have tried Basecamp, Collabtive, Freedcamp or the other common project management systems but found they don&#8217;t fit your needs&#8230; try Achievo. It&#8217;s a refresh look at project management.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.achievo.nl/" target="_new">Achievo Website</a></p>
<h2>5. Redmine</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.redmine.org/" target="_new"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810" title="redmine-screenshot" src="http://3.7designs.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/redmine-screenshot.png" alt="" width="680" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>From what I gather, Redmine is a niche project management tool. Rather than being PHP based (like all the previous self-hosted examples) Redmine is programmed in Ruby on Rails. In many ways it feels like a project management tool by developers for developers. I mention it here because it actually has some very cool and unique features including gantt charts, project specific forums and wikis, SCM integration (SVN, Git, etc&#8230;), LDAP authentication and more. The average project manager might not be excited by these features but any software company certainly will.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redmine.org/" target="_new">Redmine Website</a></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The landscape of free project management tools is certainly different than it was a few years ago. In my previous post, many of the options were single features (like task management) or free versions of premium solutions. Now there dozens of completely free, open source and feature rich tools. There are so many, the top five are practically worth paying for (even though you don&#8217;t have to).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>With design, there is no universal &#8220;best approach&#8221; that will apply to all situations. Those using the site, how they got there, their goals and the objectives of the site owners will all influence the most effective design approach. The best advice I can give is to empathize with the users, understand that they know very little about the company and struggle to just navigate the web . Think about what are they trying to accomplish and figure out how can you best facilitate it. Great design is achieved through an understanding of cognitive psychology, not the reuse of design patterns.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I run across references of design as art on almost a daily basis. Somewhere down the road, design changed from a predictable approach of creating desired outcomes into an intangible magic trick. More specifically, design became categorized as an art form rather than a science. This isn&#8217;t the case however, in fact, web design is closer to engineering than it is artistic expression. Much like an engineer, your design must take into consideration the functionality and technical requirements of the project. For example, ever decision must be considered in the context of reliability, maintainability, page speed, accessibility, platform, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>The rebirth of user experience should be proof enough that the websites we create should be shaped by those that use them. Therefor the qualify of a design is directly related to the empathy and understanding the designer has for the user, which can only be achieved through proper research. In this context, design is actually a practice of anthropology, yet another science. I often ask myself, where did this misconception come from? and until recently it puzzled me how the aesthetics of design fit into the &#8220;designer scientist&#8221; concept. My theory is as follows&#8230;</p>
<h2>&#8220;Artist Designer Myth&#8221; Was Born&#8230;</h2>
<p>From what I gather, the print and advertising industry has primed the way for the &#8220;design is art&#8221; complex. Early day graphic designers created images using fine art methods, including ink, pencil and paint. You can hardly blame agencies for labeling the designers as &#8220;the art department.&#8221; Origins aside, the label not only stuck, it spread. Design concepts are classified as &#8220;artwork&#8221; and I am sure you have heard the title &#8220;art director.&#8221;</p>
<p>Describing design as art makes little sense for print work and even less for the web. Yet it seems to have transferred over to the new medium. I attribute this to the misconception that web design is an evolution of traditional graphic design. This is in no way the case. Print is a self-evident, one way medium. You interpret what is in front of you and that is about the extent of it. The web is an interactive medium. You use a website to get things done, for enjoyment and for communication. <strong>The world would never have become depend on the web if it was just a form of online paper</strong>.</p>
<h2>How It Affects Designers</h2>
<p>The more I read about the subconscious mind and what Malcom Gladwell calls &#8220;thin-slicing,&#8221; the more apparent it becomes that referring to your work as &#8220;art&#8221; will, over time, alter your perception of what you are doing. So if you thought of design as a predictable process originally, simply referring to your work and title using the term &#8220;art&#8221; will subconsciously shift your perceptions towards visual expression.</p>
<p>It sounds harmless, but you are really giving up control of your work. You are essentially attributing the quality of your work to an indescribable skill. That skill may lead you to a great design sometimes, but not others&#8230; and ultimately you are at &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; mercy. I hope this sounds ludicrous, but suspect many designers operate under this false idea.</p>
<h2>The Science of Design</h2>
<p>My theory is that design is equal parts anthropology and cognitive science, or the study of people&#8217;s behavior and thought. What do you think is going to be more effective, an interface based on an understanding of how people think or one that was based on what looked good to the designer? Obviously the former.</p>
<p>Usability experts have been long aware of cognitive science as a way to predict users thought processes in order to make using something as easy as possible. In this context, cognitive science is used to improve learnability, comprehension and memory. If you understand how people learn, process information and store / organize it then optimizing those qualities becomes a repeatable process (just with different variables).</p>
<p>Few people dispute the importance of psychology when it comes to usability and who would with a title such as &#8220;Human Computer Interaction (HCI)?&#8221; But aesthetic design is still seen as an art performed by artists. Sites like &#8220;<a href="http://contrastrebellion.com/" target="_blank">The Contrast Rebellion</a>&#8221; demonstrate that designers carry a stigma of thoughtless pixel pushers who focus on nothing by visual pleasure. Until recently, I wasn&#8217;t sure <em>why</em> aesthetic design was more than art&#8230; I just knew.</p>
<h2>The Science of Aesthetics</h2>
<p>With all the talk about art and subjectivity it is no surprise that design is thought of the way it is. Don&#8217;t be fooled, there are scientific reasons we like (or dislike) what we see. While not always easy to predict, much of beauty is a combination of ancient survival mechanisms and human reflection. Meaning, our species evolved into the sophisticated beings we are today because of our ability to avoid danger and gravitate towards opportunity. With out getting into too much detail, designs that include danger signals are considered undesirable. Inversely, designs that communicate safety signals (or opportunity, such as food or shelter) are attractive.</p>
<p>Sound crazy? Consider this example, a very cluttered design mimics an environment that is hard to navigate through and spot potential predators. Walking through a dense forest requires a lot more awareness for danger than an open meadow. Is it a surprise that people gravitate towards open, clean and well-organized designs and avoid cluttered and overwhelming ones?</p>
<p>Much of our behavior still happens on a subconscious level, which is one of the reasons it is so hard to describe why some designs are attractive and others are not. Author Don Normand sites that people will often justify their reactions consciously even when the reaction comes from a subconscious level.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that conscious thought doesn&#8217;t influence your design taste, just less than you may think. Life experiences, culture, gender, personal preferences do shape what design you are drawn too on a conscious level. While more difficult, if you know your users well you <strong>can</strong> predict their response to specific imagery. By studying the target users (anthropology) and understanding how they think (psychology) you can intentionally use visuals to create specific reactions. In what way does this description sound like art?</p>
<h2>Summary: Intention and Purpose</h2>
<p>One could argue that there is a science to art as well. You place objects on a page according to rules of visual balance, select colors based on sound principles and use shapes to create specific responses. The difference, in my opinion, lies in purpose and intention. When you design, you are really creating tools. What you make has utility to it, whether it be providing information about a company or the ability to interface with an online product.</p>
<p>Art on the other hand, is a form of emotional expression. The artist who creates the work does so out of self-expression and the purchaser (or appreciator) of the art does so for emotional reasons as well. While it is safe to say all behavior has an emotional component to it, design has a different purpose than art, one that lends itself to creating predictable outcomes for specific people. With artwork, it only matters that <em>some </em>people enjoy it rather than <em>specific </em>people.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I admire Andy Rutledge for saying what he thinks, even though I don&#8217;t always agree with what he says or how he says it. Earlier this week, his article on <a href="http://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php" target="_blank">how the news is broken</a> ignited a series of <a href="http://journal.drawar.com/d/redesigning-and-re-thinking-the-news/" target="_blank">posts</a> and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2806257" target="_blank">heated discussions</a> on the topic. Many of them disagreed with him, citing that his viewpoint was naive and narrow-minded. Interestingly enough, many dissenters of Andy&#8217;s post also suggested their own solutions. I can&#8217;t help but ask, &#8220;If Andy hasn&#8217;t found the solution, what makes you think that you have?&#8221;</p>
<h2>Battling Speculation with Speculation</h2>
<p>Discussion is always beneficial, especially when focused on improving the way people consume media. My issue here is that Andy does not experience in designing news sites, thus his solutions are based on speculation. Because his goal was to provoke discussion, this is OK. Those responding, however, seem to be suggesting serious solutions which are also based on speculation.</p>
<p>The result is a circular argument in which everyone <em>assumes</em> they know the right solution, despite the fact that no one has the knowledge that would be required to find it. Reading a few usability books or assessing a site based on your set of aesthetic values will not lead you to the right solution. Even haven worked on a media site before is irrelevant, as they are all dramatically different in content and users.</p>
<p>Digital news is still finding its way, the industry faces countless unique design challenges. The amount of content that even small news companies publish online, dwarfs almost any other industry. Even more complicating is the diversity of subjects covered. How do you engage a global group of users, all looking for different content on a site that publishes 1500+ articles a day? I will give you a hint, traditional design techniques like &#8220;more white space&#8221; is not the answer. In fact, we have yet to find the best answer.</p>
<h2>We Are Smarter Than Them? Really?</h2>
<p>What disturbs me most is that amount of respondents that presumed they were smarter than news designers. Does anyone <em>really think</em> they the designers never thought to remove article excerpts from topic pages? The sites coming under fire are multi-million dollar corporations. Their existence is directly tied to sites performance. If you don&#8217;t think they have designers smart enough to do usability tests or design based on site metrics you are crazy. I assure you that any major media site makes design decisions with evidence, not whim.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the most valuable outcome of these discussions have been some designs that would be great for a designer&#8217;s newspaper. The discussion has clearly been focused on designers personal preferences, even though designers are far from the average users. There is no empathy for the average person and their needs.</p>
<h2>What Needs to Happen</h2>
<p>The media industry could advance so quickly if even one organization stepped up and published their discoveries. Knowing what design decisions had what implications would not only silence the naysayers, but allow digital news to become truly enjoyable.  I think everyone accepts that right now digital media is a compromise. It is difficult to navigate through, hard to read and impossible to filter&#8230; but social behavior speaks loudly and apparently the convince is worth it. If the designers of the world could better understand user behavior innovative solutions would naturally result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the organization who is brave enough to expose their process would surely benefit as a result. Making the users a part of the process would not only help them better understand the balance of business and user needs, it would result in empathy for the organization. This is what social media was <em>supposed</em> to be about in the first place.</p>
<h2>Long Term Solutions</h2>
<p>Ultimately it is silly to believe that digital news will be &#8220;fixed&#8221; through design treatment. The challenge is bigger than that. A completely new approach is needed, one that no one has found yet. This is not the first form of traditional media that has had trouble adapting to a digital culture. The music industry was singing doomsday songs as people per-claimed their distaste for physical CDs and scoffed at paying for MP3 downloads. Yet while the horizon was bleak for record companies, Apple found a way to make buying music more convenient that stealing it.</p>
<p>While digital news doesn&#8217;t need its own &#8220;iTunes,&#8221; it does need a holistic solution. Some smart individuals will come up with a game changing approach to digital news and it won&#8217;t <em>just</em> be a matter of organizing content, multi-device compatibility and visual design.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Today, the vast majority of websites are still designed and built by talented generalists, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. It’s just that some of the larger and more complex sites do require composite teams of specialists with a singular focus. Experts in information categorisation, human computer interaction or interface design. They also need people who specialise in specific programming languages, databases, security, or application architecture. The history of all human progress can be counted by the increased specialisation of individuals amongst a group, and I see this as a good thing.</p>
<p>So we have this strange dichotomy that the term webdesign can be used to describe both a novice and an expert, a neophyte and a master. This is where the Dunning-Kruger effect comes in. If you’re not familiar with this concept it’s the observation that novices suffer from the illusion of superiority and tend to rate their skills much higher than experts because they don’t fully understand the breadth of the field they need to master. Or to use a much quoted aphorism, “they know what they know, but they don’t know what they don’t know”. By comparison, experts tend to know more, but are also more conscious about what they don’t know, hence making them less sure about their expertise.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been a web accessibility advocate since as early as 2005. Since then I have done presentations on its importance, written articles about it, co-hosted a <a href="http://webaxe.blogspot.com" target="_blank">podcast on the subject</a> and even included it in my upcoming book. Recently <a href="http://atrophiedmind.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/accessibility-lets-put-away-the-wrecking-ball/" target="_blank">discussion</a> has <a href="http://atrophiedmind.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/accessibility-lets-put-away-the-wrecking-ball/" target="_blank">arisen</a> around how the practice of accessibility should be better encouraged. One of the concerns, is how accessibility is described. The argument being that the term &#8220;accessibility&#8221; is technical, uninviting and non-descriptive. It has been suggested that instead we should use terms like &#8220;Universal Design&#8221; and &#8220;Design for All.&#8221; While initially I loved the concept, further reflection has me worried.</p>
<h2>Describing the Impossible</h2>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree that we could find a better way to describe accessibility. I also have no question as to the importance of accessibility. My problem is that both &#8220;universal design,&#8221; and &#8220;design for all&#8221; describe the impossible. The term universal design has always been focused on accessibility, Wikipedia defining it as a &#8220;&#8230;broad-spectrum [of] ideas meant to produce buildings, products and environments that are inherently accessible to both people without disabilities and people with disabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coined definition is no different from accessible design, it is just a fancier way of saying it. At face value this isn&#8217;t cause of great concern, until you consider the definition of &#8220;universal.&#8221; Webster&#8217;s defines universal as &#8220;Including or covering all or a whole collectively or distributively without limit or exception.&#8221; Thus Universal Design means creating something, quite literally, for everyone. This is absolutely impossible, there is no way to design a single thing that addresses everyone&#8217;s needs.</p>
<h2>Why You Can&#8217;t Design Universally</h2>
<p>The diverse nature of the human race means that everyone who accesses your site does so with different circumstances. Their goals, experiences, genetics and environment are all different. The more you can tailor a design to the person who uses it the more effective it becomes. If I were to design a website specifically to improve your life productivity with no intention of addressing anyone else&#8217;s needs, we would result in the most effective design for that need as possible. Specific design is the most effective design.</p>
<p>As you start addressing more people&#8217;s needs the design becomes less effective. Designing a site to fit teenagers needs is one thing, but designing that same site to also address baby-boomers is another. To be most effective, the design has to match the users in every way. All the way from visual presentation, through user experience, into content and finally how it is built. The design must address how the person perceives the world (ie: their mental model), the experiences they have and haven&#8217;t had and their personality. The closer the design matches the user the more the better it will serve them.</p>
<p>So designing to a specific group is difficult enough, designing for <em>everyone</em> is literally impossible. You will never design something that everyone likes. To do so would be to find the perfect design, which doesn&#8217;t exist&#8230; even when dealing with niche groups.</p>
<h2>Accessibility Still Works</h2>
<p>I realize that &#8220;Universal Design&#8221; isn&#8217;t supposed to mean design that appeases everyone, but it implies that. Accessibility, while technical is more semantically correct. Accessibility is equal <em>access</em> to a site, not equal priority in design. Everyone should be able to access a site, afterwards they can hate the site and that&#8217;s OK. The important element here is equal opportunity to access (and then hate) the content on a site. Universal design doesn&#8217;t describe access, it describes to purpose and appeal.</p>
<p>I am still open to a friendlier description of accessibility, just something that doesn&#8217;t imply the practice as something it is not. It really does a disservice to both design and accessibility and could hinder both. In my upcoming book, I describe accessibility as <strong>reliable design</strong>. Design that functions reliably regardless of platform or available technology. It isn&#8217;t perfect, but it is better. I am open to suggestions, what is yours?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to a few interesting posts on Forrst.com and some interesting client interactions, I have been contemplating the designers ideal role in website creation. It was not long ago that I found myself constantly frustrated because, as the designer I had made informed decisions that people chose to ignore. Much of my energy was being spent justifying why as the designer, I was correct.</p>
<p>When I was a novice designer, my primary motivation was to create something that appealed to the client and myself. My reasoning being that the client was paying the bill, choosing to recommend me to others and if we both liked what we saw then others would too. As a result my designs were very detailed, I took every opportunity to incorporate CSS or Javascript tricks as a way to show off my knowledge while also making the website look impressive. The approach in some ways, was successful. I often impressed clients, they happily paid my bills and I was proud of the work that I had done.</p>
<h2>The Maturing Designer</h2>
<p>As I matured as a designer I began to realize that I knew a lot more about what would look best than the client. Articles reenforced this concept by discussing the subjectivity of design and that you should target the audience not the stakeholders. At this point I became more invested in the critique process,  asked fewer questions about what the client liked and more about who the users were. Rather than deliver two different concepts for the client to pick from, I delivered them only one. The thinking being that I knew which concept was the strongest, why should the client be confused by an inferior design? This resulted in fewer revisions and reduced deviance from my initial vision. In many ways this approach was also successful, the end product was still visually pleasing, the client pretty happy and I got my way. It took significantly more energy however on both my part and the clients.</p>
<h2>The Evolved Designer</h2>
<p>In the past few years my design research has led me to the conclusion that design is hardly about aesthetics, to my dismay I was confused about the purpose of my profession for the first decade of my career. Making a website pretty is an aspect of design but only a portion of it. Design by definition is the intentional creation of something to serve a specific purpose. All along I was creating art, not design. This changed my entire process.</p>
<p>Rather than focus on how the website looked, I immediately shifted discussions towards what users wanted to do on the site. How was the site going to improve their lives? How will the site improve the client&#8217;s business? Is the site easy to use?</p>
<p>My designs reflected this new utilitarian approach. Nothing on the page was decoration, everything was intentional. I disliked the idea of any aesthetically driven change, after all I had planned out every element so that it would contributed to the success of the site. I continually reminded my students that any critique of a design concept that started off with &#8220;I like&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I dislike&#8230;&#8221; had no value. Design was a science and statistics prove that some designs outperform others&#8230; what <em>you</em> like has nothing to do with design, it&#8217;s how well the design performs that matters. I was the designer and I was correct.</p>
<p>This approach was endlessly frustrating. It seemed that no one understand the true purpose of design, even other designers. All my energy went into trying to persuade people into seeing design from my viewpoint with no avail.</p>
<h2>The Enlightened Designer</h2>
<p>At some point I realized that I was looking at design from the wrong lenses. I justified my thought process because I never questioned the collaborative process of design, and always welcomed suggestions based on logic and reason. However I was missing the point. Not all clients are hiring my company because they expect their website to revolutionize their business (although it can, and some do). Many clients use the website for an internal marketing tool as much as an external one. They derive a sense of pride from their website and so do their partners, employees and colleges. Many of these types of clients have just as much a vision for their site as I do and they are paying me to deliver it, not alter it.</p>
<p>While I continue to give my clients my best holistically focused advice, I now realize that their motivations for the site ultimately drive how the website is created. I am delighted when someone approaches us because they appreciate design in the same form that we do, but I also respect the other reasons that people care about design&#8230; including aesthetic reasons. My current approach is a hybrid of all three, depending on the situation and the client. It is the closest thing I have found to win/win/win.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trends come and go, people become excited about new concepts and old ones become old and boring. Much like fashion the trends of the web seem to resurface delighting some and aggravating others. I am often inclined to ignore the low-level trends as they are short-lived and don&#8217;t impact the web in a measurable way. So when I see out of context wooden backgrounds making a come back (they were the rage in 1998) I just nod and keep moving on. Superficial trends are not worth dwelling on, but some trends really do impact the way we design the web.</p>
<p>In the early 2000&#8242;s usability and user experience was on the upswing. The web was changing at a rapid pace and we had new ways to look at crafting websites. There was a focus on the holistic approach of using standards, being accessible and caring about the user. This trend left us with some valuable insights that have been adopted into common practice, but the widespread passion died down for &#8220;sexier&#8221; topics like jQuery and Social Media.</p>
<h2>User Experience Design is an Emerging Trend</h2>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t become &#8220;mainstream&#8221; yet but I have started to see evidence of user experience trends. As a community we are becoming greater experts in the topic allowing us to divide it into more specific categories such as content strategy and conversion optimization. While this is different from the first UX boom as we are now focusing on the outcomes of users experiences it is still UX none the less. Ultimately there are a growing number of blogs, articles, tweets and discussions around the topic of user experience. Just looking at Google Trends shows a huge upswing in the amount of news stories that discuss user experience in the last half of 2010.</p>
<p>In many ways this is a good thing as with any form of design the people who are using what we create are most important. The practice of design is creating something that people will use, as such the use of our creation is what is most important. I gladly encourage putting more focus on the user and less on business objectives. Putting more focus on what the user wants will ultimately lead to successful business objectives anyways. A happy user is much more likely to purchase a product or fill out a contact form. A user that feels manipulated or that the site is attempting to control their experience is just going to leave.</p>
<p>All of that said I do have some growing concerns about user experience becoming &#8220;popular.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Everyone is a User Experience Designer</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago I came across a blog post in which <a href="http://www.cennydd.co.uk/">Cennydd Bowles</a> has elegantly described how user experience has become such a broad term that almost <em>anyone</em> working on the web is a user experience designer on some level. From developers to visual designers, copywriters to the marketing department&#8230; everyone plays some part in the experience of the user.</p>
<h3>Segmentation is Ineffective</h3>
<p>Great design is not achieved through several groups of people with different specialized skill sets passing the work from one stage to the next. Yet this is the way so many agencies are setup. The UX team focuses on their deliverables and passes it off to the graphic designers, the graphic designers focus on their deliverables and pass it off to the developers and the developers create it. Decisions that the UX team impacts the effectiveness of the visual design and the developers need to understand UX and visual design well enough to effectively complete the vision. This almost never happens, so much is lost in this segmented process.</p>
<h3>We Need to Understand User Experience</h3>
<p>The broader awareness of user experience is great for this reason. Everyone from the visual designers to the developers should have a basic understand and respect for the user&#8217;s experience. Inevitably everyone will have to make design decisions that impact the experience, those decisions should be made with the user in mind. In this sense regardless of training this is how we have all become user experience designers.</p>
<h2>So What&#8217;s the Problem?</h2>
<p>Yet there is trouble brewing ahead for the user experience discipline. Because almost everyone involved in the web is now realizing they play a part in the user&#8217;s experience there has been a huge upswing of individuals claiming to be &#8220;user experience designers&#8221; in the classic sense. It seems that because literally everyone has an opinion on what they think would/wouldn&#8217;t be usable they are now qualified to be a full-fledged user experience designer. The problem is that awareness is not education. Being aware of the importance of usable design does not qualify anyone to be a UX practitioner. Cennydd explains this perfectly in his post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;even among the brightest newcomers I see a worrying trend. User  experience converts are typically drawn to the glamour of interaction  design on shiny technology, and the amateur psychology that helps them  sound authoritative about their approaches. Most lack knowledge of basic  information architecture, design theory and elementary programming  skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have encountered many that justify their self titled &#8220;UX&#8221; label based on the fact that they use the web and know what is or is not usable to them. The obvious problem is that you are not the user and everyone is different. With out sound education in how people interact with computers you are making generalized guesses based on your own preferences and experiences which are not shared with others. Using a guessing approach is just going to lead to bad user experiences in the name of good UX. Unchecked this trend could lead to a situation where user experience design is devalued.</p>
<h2>Where Does That Leave Things?</h2>
<p>We all need to be realistic about what our core skills are. I am advocate of learning as much about the entire web design process as possible from programming to visuals. By all means you should continue to broaden your understanding so that you can make better design decisions for the users, for the development of the site and for visual aesthetics. That being said understand your skills and don&#8217;t over promise. If you are interested in user experience, great! There are many venues of learning the practice including universities, to a handful of great books and internships / mentoring. It will become clear when you can give yourself a new title.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Frequently Asked Questions” is a phrase we all know and love. Or is it? Good question. Perhaps our familiarity with the format of FAQs blinds us to the fact we may not be getting what we need out of them.</p>
<p>The FAQ model has been used as early as the 13th century in Christian literature. Being that it&#8217;s 2011, 3.7 DESIGNS thinks you should revisit your FAQ section if you currently have one or were considering one.</p>
<p>Some FAQs for your FAQs:</p>
<ol>
<li>How frequently are  “FAQs” actually asked in your perception?</li>
<li>Who is asking these questions?</li>
<li>What if a user does not find what he/she is looking for? What options does he/she have?</li>
<li>And most importantly: WHY would a user find himself/herself in the FAQs?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some answers for the FAQs of your FAQs:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the same questions are consistently being asked by your user base, this should be a red flag to restructure some of your information. Important and relevant information should be easy to navigate to!</li>
<li>Questions are usually asked by your users, who may or may not know anything about your company, organization or product prior to arriving on your site. So when you&#8217;re considering which questions to address in your FAQ, remember it&#8217;s not actually YOU doing the asking.</li>
<li>If a user does not find what he/she is looking for, this is again a red flag to reorganize some of your content in a way that people actually find what it is they&#8217;re looking for. There must always be a “last ditch” option (ie. A well-designed footer or navigation with a phone number or other method of contacting a real person).</li>
<li>If a user is confused to the point he/she is resorting to an FAQ section which probably contains a hodge-podge of information, it is likely not the user&#8217;s own fault.</li>
</ol>
<p>The job of a user interface designer and information architect is to make sure visitors to your site stay there as long as possible and ultimately perform a desired action. An FAQ section is often thought of as a “catch all” for miscellaneous questions that might arise. If a user feels lost, he/she will most likely not feel motivated enough to reach out and make that call to action.</p>
<p>So what can you do to prevent or minimize these undesirable results?</p>
<ol>
<li>Organize your FAQ into categories instead of it becoming a dumping ground for afterthoughts.</li>
<li>Name the FAQ section something else. If all the FAQs relate to “shipping information” then simply call that section “About Shipping Information.”</li>
<li>File your FAQs into their proper “about” or informational sections and eliminate the “FAQ section” altogether.</li>
</ol>
<p>We here at 3.7 DESIGNS are proponents of number 3.  While it&#8217;s a considerate notion to have an FAQ section on your website, it is often misused and an excuse for a lack of information architecture. So, don&#8217;t be lazy! You owe it to your current and future user base to keep them  efficiently informed so when/if they decide to contact you, they are doing so with the utmost confidence.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may be limiting the effectiveness of your homepage through the design treatment of your news section. It might be hard to believe but many company websites have been designed in such a way that their latest news actually interferes with the success of the site (or alternatively this could be blog posts, announcements, etc&#8230;). Having worked with clients through this issue I have discovered many of the reasons why, how to avoid them as well as how they can be designed to improve website results. Let&#8217;s start by examining the history of company news on the web.</p>
<h2>Looking at News in Days Past</h2>
<p>The news section of a website has always been the source of design controversy. It used to be that websites were difficult to update. One had to know HTML if not other programing languages like PHP. As a result most news sections never stayed up to date after a of the site’s launch. These outdated news sections screamed “We don’t care about updating our website, this information is old.”</p>
<p>Now that we have cost-effective content management systems that are easy to use, keeping a site updated is less of an issue. This easy of posting has evolved into a completely opposite issue where there is too much focus put into the news section of a website.</p>
<h2>Identifying the Common News Problem</h2>
<p>Many companies need to communicate their important news to their target market and customer base. To communicate this information you could use a significant amount of homepage real estate to showcase the news. The idea here is that anyone coming to the site can’t help but see it. It means they will be aware of your important announcements right? This “hit the user on the head” approach is ineffective.</p>
<p>Very few people go to a website with the intention of checking the companies news. They actually have very specific tasks that they want to accomplish, typically focused around finding information. These are tasks that you could make effortless by using homepage real estate. Rather than finding a link that points users toward what they are looking for they are instead presented with giant news section that says “We care about us, not you.”</p>
<h2>Who Are The Engaged vs Disengaged Users?</h2>
<p>Having monitored the click-through rates of news items on over one hundred websites over the past few years the average click-through rate is less than 1%. This is data that shows that the average &#8220;disengaged&#8221; user doesn’t care about what your latest news, and why should they? They have very little idea of who you are.</p>
<p>While the average user doesn’t care about your news there are some users that do. These are the &#8220;engaged&#8221; users that are building a relationship with your company. They are more valuable as they will become customers if they are not already. If they want to hear your news, it means the news section is valuable right? Not so fast. These people want to hear about your news are you are going to make them randomly check your website to do so? Why would you make it so difficult?</p>
<p>These more valuable users want direct updates. You are already asking a lot in hoping people care enough to read your news, it is even more to make them go to your website to get it. They rather sign up for an e-mail newsletter or follow you on Twitter. Trying to communicate to them through your homepage is one of the least effective ways to do so, not to mention it ignores the needs of the other who come to your site.</p>
<p>There is a way to use news effectively, let&#8217;s explore further.</p>
<h2>Doing News The Right Way</h2>
<p>I will say that there is actual value in having news on your homepage. It shows that you are keeping the site updated and demonstrates activity,  both which are credibility indicators that users notice. It just shouldn’t take any more real estate than it absolutely needs to. At 3.7 DESIGNS we recommend limiting the section to 3 &#8211; 5 small news items (headlines only).</p>
<h2>Real Value, Just Not Much</h2>
<p>When planning your redesign there are plenty of good reasons to have a news section on the homepage. Keeping it to a minimum will ensure that users can find what they are looking for and end up wanting to know more about your company. Putting too much focus on the news leads to bad user experiences and doesn’t reach the people who want the information anyways. Instead give users who want a stronger relationship a better way to get the information such as e-mail or through social media.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up I had many hobbies that I was passionate about. From computer to cars, fine arts to film, I always thirsted for information and relished learning more. This of course was before the internet had gained popularity leaving me fewer options to find the knowledge I hunted. Having to &#8220;hunt&#8221; for knowledge feels like a bad dream in todays river of publications and publishers. There isn&#8217;t a day that goes by with out articles about design being published. In all honestly I do love this free flow of content that the internet mediates so well, but nothing is with out its trade offs.</p>
<p>It is easy to be excited and passionate by design. Our culture is motivated and stimulated by our senses and predominately our visual sense. Everyone in the world has preferences, tastes and passions when it comes to things that they see. Even the most curmudgeon of people would be delighted to see a sunset over the mountains or a natural waterfall.</p>
<p>Design, especially on the web often taps into this visual pleasure part of our brain. It is the pleasure that we get out of seeing something that fits our tastes that makes it easy to scan through design galleries daily, read the next article about typography and spend hours looking through color pallets for that right combination (not that I do any of those&#8230; really I don&#8217;t&#8230;) By and large this should be recognized and embraced. After all when designing a website you should strive to get that reaction by those that are looking at your work.</p>
<p>This is of course tricky because design is subjective. But I would stress that it is more than just being &#8220;subjective,&#8221; rather different for every group and every person living. Further the &#8220;visual excitement&#8221; one gets from looking at the design is only a fraction of what is really important. How the site functions and achieves goals and objectives is much more important than how it looks. While I won&#8217;t be so crass to say that the visuals are not a factor or that they are inconsequential, they are a piece of a much bigger puzzle.</p>
<p>A site that has a look and feel that resonates with target users will perform better in most cases. Additionally users perceive a good-looking site to be easier to use even if this is not the case. Aesthetics can build engagement, increase retention and encourage use&#8230; but I often ask &#8220;Do we put too much emphasis on them?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have long thought about this and I am fully aware I too can have clouded judgement based on my own personal preferences. It wasn&#8217;t until I came across the rash of &#8220;<a href="http://www.webdesignerwall.com/trends/best-of-design-2010/" target="_blank">Best of Design 2010</a>&#8221; style articles earlier this year that I really become frustrated with the &#8220;fast food&#8221; style design articles that have become so popular. Reviewing the sites and designs that these posts showcased I fully agree they are beautiful, from a web designers artistic perspective. But what qualifies them as the &#8220;Best Design of 2010&#8243; from a &#8220;performs the function and achieves the goals they were designed for&#8221; perspective? How do we know the target audience loved the visuals instead of just web designers as a group?</p>
<p>This illustrates a perpetual miscommunication about what &#8220;good design&#8221; really is. Our community rewards, showcases and promotes work based on <em>our groups</em> visual preferences and tastes. While not all designers fall prey to peer pressure and attempt to design for the styles that are showcased a lot of them do under the assumption that it constitutes as good design. In reality it would only constitute as good aesthetic design if you were designing for other web designers and even then one would be failing to consider the more important issue of  &#8221;Is it going to achieve the goals you have set?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than treating our work like art we should instead look to the advertising industry, who have a much greater sense of results and success as a measure of great campaigns. Ad agencies expect that they will be critiqued on results in addition to the craftsmanship of their work, why should we be any different?</p>
<p>I encourage you to reevaluate how you look at design and how you are influenced by it. If you are someone who does design on any level you are going to be effected by what you see and is around you. If your mindset is that of thinking about solutions to specific situations and problems rather than what creates a pleasurable reaction when you personally see it you are going to be much closer to producing design that does create results. Maybe you won&#8217;t get the fan fare that designing for the CSS Galleries would, but since when are they your clientele anyways?</p>

Having met countless agency owners and freelancers it is abundantly clear that while project management is essential to the success of any web project most people struggle with the &#8220;best way&#8221; to go about it. The complexity of managing multiple people working on the same project means that there will be instances where everyone needs access to the same files and information and most likely at unknown times.</p>
<p>This is compounded at 3.7 DESIGNS since we lean towards virtual teams and have part time interns. While we have always used <a href="http://basecamphq.com/?referrer=ROSSJOHNSON" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> to great success there are things it does extremely well and others it does not. Having read ReWork it is pretty clear this is by design&#8230; but where does that leave us in our needs?</p>
<h2>An Unlikely Hero&#8230;</h2>
<p>We have recently started adopting <a href="http://db.tt/vRS9TzC" target="_blank">DropBox</a> as a supplement to our project management approach. While DropBox was originally intended for easy cloud based storage of files it actually is an extremely powerful tool for managing projects. Not only is it a very fast method of organizing, modifying and changing files but it also uses a format that everyone who is used to a computer is extremely familiar with.</p>
<h2>How it All Works</h2>
<p>If you are regularly working with teams then you are probably familiar with the three primary methods of communication&#8230; <strong>voice</strong>, <strong>e-mail</strong> and <strong>document</strong>. We have meetings in person or via phone, communicate electronically in the form of quick messages (not always e-mail but primarily) and then we share documents. Documents may be reports, spreadsheets, design comps, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>While DropBox probably isn&#8217;t going to be a great method of handling voice / e-mail it does do a great job at the document management portion. When you look at the scope of a web design project in particular you end up with lots and lots of documents that people on your team will need to access, modify and update at random times. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Artwork</li>
<li>Strategy / scope / spec</li>
<li>DEV site access</li>
<li>Design concepts</li>
<li>Instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than try and upload those all into Basecamp and require logins, uploads, tagging, etc&#8230; it is much easier to drop them into a folder you share with the project team and be on your merry way. That way when someone updates a file you are instantly privy to the changes. This is especially useful if you have well documented processes / instructions where new team members can quickly jump in, learn what they need to know and get moving with out tying up another resource.</p>
<h2>Folder Structure</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.3point7designs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/GetDropBox.jpg" rel="lightbox[740]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-741" title="GetDropBox" src="http://www.3point7designs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/GetDropBox.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="272" /></a>You can really structure your folders for projects any way you would like. I have found that having consistency makes it much easier to move from project to project so I would recommend thinking out what folders you need and how to group them. While always tweaking we have settled on the following break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Information
<ul>
<li>Site Access</li>
<li>Spec &amp; Timeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instructions
<ul>
<li>Worksheets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Client Files
<ul>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Photography</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Designs
<ul>
<li>Artwork</li>
<li>Concepts</li>
<li>Deliverables</li>
<li>XHTML/CSS Templates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plus&#8230; it is Free</h2>
<p>If you are skeptical I recommend giving it a shot. Everyone on your team can sign up for a free DropBox account where you get 2GB for free. <a href="http://db.tt/vRS9TzC" target="_blank">I encourage you to sign up and give it a try</a>. Worst case it is a great tool to have for your own files with features such as version control, online file sharing and redundant backups.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have seen my <a href="http://www.webdesign-sketchbook.com" target="_blank">Web Design Sketchbook</a> project it should be no surprise that I am a huge advocate of sketching out ideas before firing up a program (regardless of it being Photoshop, Omnigraffle, etc&#8230;). I won&#8217;t bore anyone with too long of a rant, but sketching is a great way to quickly create ideas that are focused on the proper strategy and approach rather than visuals and decoration. Great design is the combination of both function and form and it is too easy to forget the function when you start in a high fidelity medium.</p>
<p>While I am always carrying around one of my sketchbooks I am also a huge fan of <a href="http://www.moleskineus.com/" target="_blank">Moleskine notebooks</a>. They are light, small, classy and great for taking notes on. Rather than switch back and forth between them I recently got the idea to combine them in some way. After stumbling across a blog post about <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/04/print_your_own_moleskine_pages.html" target="_blank">printing your own Moleskine pages</a> I decided to create a template that had browser chrome for easy page mock-ups.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.3point7designs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/browserchrome.jpg" rel="lightbox[734]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-735" title="browserchrome" src="http://www.3point7designs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/browserchrome.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Simply printing out a handful of pages and keeping a glue stick on hand I am now able to show more accurate sketches and mock-ups to clients on the fly. I bet one could also find some printable sticker paper to make it a step easier, which I plan on investigating later tonight.</p>
<p>Rather than keep them to myself I figured I would throw them onto this blog and let anyone who also shares my love for sketching concepts and Moleskine enjoy them as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently did a presentation at local <a href="http://la2m.org" target="_blank">marketing group LA2M</a> in which I explained how changing the way you look at your website could double if not triple its performance. The group primarily consists of professionals who handle all areas of a company&#8217;s marketing plan with the website being one portion, so as a whole they are not &#8220;web professionals&#8221; like the common reader of this blog.</p>
<p>I realized after that despite the fact that the presentation was geared towards a different audience it did speak greatly to the faults in the common approach to web design (or redesign.) Our industry has evolved out of print design, advertising and other forms of traditional media. At this point web design is no longer young enough where there is an excuse for antiquated processes. Really the typical approach to designing on the web is far from ideal. While this isn&#8217;t really anyone&#8217;s direct fault (meaning neither client nor agency, as both perpetuate the issues) there are great ways to produce better performing and more accountable websites.</p>
<p>Time and money is wasted on creating less than effective websites and no one questions it because actually performance gets a blind eye.</p>
<p>For that reason I modified and recorded the presentation for the readers of this blog and specifically to get your feedback. I encourage you to watch the video below, it isn&#8217;t too long and I assure you if nothing else it will make you think. (I apologize for the fuzzy slides in the video, seems I need to make a deck specifically for online videos).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Simplicity, so elegant yet so elusive.</strong></p>
<p>The web by and large does a terrible job of being simple.</p>
<p>In some part there isn&#8217;t much that can be done as the infrastructure of the web is inherently complicated. After all, the infrastructure required that allows a user to access a website consists of service providers, web hosts, routers, hops, server and client software, compatible protocols and countless other necessities. With this high level of complexity needed to simply request, serve and view a website is it even possible to reach true simplicity when it comes to the web? Maybe not in the purest form of the word but we should all strive for it.</p>
<p>I will state again that we should all strive for simplicity. The advantages of simplicity are countless and yet often forgotten. This isn&#8217;t to say that when asked &#8220;should this be simple?&#8221; the average person would respond with &#8220;no, make it complex.&#8221; Rather the idea of keeping something simple often is neglected in the excitement of new possibilities, functionality and features. This happens naturally during any stage of brainstorming or conceptual development. The whole idea behind brainstorming is to think big, large and outside normal expectations and conventions. There is nothing wrong with this and should be encouraged, however rarely do people follow a brainstorm with the reeling in of these big ideas to simplify them.</p>
<p>By keeping things simple the effectiveness of any project increases exponentially. This is why it is so important to take big complex ideas and make them simple. Consider the following reasons that simplicity benefits any website or application.</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>Complex is expensive. Not only to build but also maintain and improve as well. This cost can be incurred in time (which is a form of currency whether you are paying for it directly or not), service costs or software costs. Complex sites and applications take longer to plan, design, program and build. Additionally a complex system will take more time to upgrade and maintain.</p>
<p>Adding one piece of content to a website creates a ripple that many fail to realize. That one piece of content creates an extra navigational item, an extra search result and an extra area that needs management and thought (so it won&#8217;t become out of date or irrelevant).</p>
<h3>Focus</h3>
<p>This concept is best illustrated by the phrase &#8220;Jack of trades, master of none.&#8221; While the original intention of the phrase is intended for people and development of skills and knowledge it applies to the web as well. As a website or application tries to do more there is effort put into new features or functionality and not towards improving the elements of the site that are already its strong points.</p>
<p>Focus is a huge asset to marketing as well. You will find that it is much easier to become the best in a specific niche area than to become the best of a large market. By keeping your approach simple and focused you can completely cater to that niche and not trying to please anyone and everyone.</p>
<h3>Ease</h3>
<p>One of the greatest compliments any website, product or piece of software can receive is &#8220;It is simple to use.&#8221; This mindset and goal is what has led to the recent mass success that Google.com and Apple have seen. Both companies set out to make a task as easy as possible. In the case of Apple and music they have made it easier and more enjoyable to pay for music than to find it on pirated music sites.</p>
<p>Simplicity makes your site or application much easier to use. Every extra page on your site is one more item a user has to sort through to find what they are looking for. Every extra feature is another item about your application that your user needs to find and learn how to use. Any addition to your site or application makes it more difficult to use.</p>
<p>The human working memory is 7 items (plus or minus 2). This means if you have a 15 item navigation the user is likely to forget what one or two of the items are by the time they are done reading through your menu (this is often called Millers Law).</p>
<h3>Reliability</h3>
<p>It is easy to get wrapped up in the latest Javascript enhancement and forget that as a site or application increases in complexity it also acquires more points of failure. A static HTML/CSS site while simple and perhaps boring has very few points of failure. Beyond the server itself having issues you can be sure that on some level users will be able to access your site and content. Alternatively a dynamic site with a content management system requires an underlying programming language and often a database as well. The programming language opens up vulnerabilities to hacking and the database server is another element that could have issues or failures.</p>
<h3>Clarity</h3>
<p>Hick’s law states that with every additional choice the time it will take for one to make a selection increases. This not only affects what links a user clicks on from your app or website but also what they feel they should focus their eyes on. Every incremental item on your page is another choice of what to look at, make sense of, understand and remember. By removing everything that is unnecessary you create clarity for a user in terms of what they should look at, click on, understand and remember.</p>
<p>This also can be an asset to your marketing efforts. By focusing on core strengths and eliminating all other aspects of your business you will create clarity of your business, its strengths and what it stands for. Not only will you gain brand  retention and recognition, you are likely to have a stronger product as  all interactions will truly wow the users or potential customers. Anything that is not part of your core strengths is noise, detracting from full the potential of your business, application or website.</p>
<h2>The Web</h2>
<p>While simplicity should be weighed and balanced, the strive for simple is ultimately what is most important. It might be necessary to add complexity in one area to create simplicity in another. The example of a content management system is a perfect example of this. Provided you are making the site as simple as possible it is OK to add complexity where it needed.</p>
<p>I stress this because even the most simple of websites has such a high level of detail that is often ignored. If you consider all the detail that even a small website <em><strong>should</strong></em> be addressing you will realize that few if any actually do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>SEO</li>
<li>Print</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
<li>Redirects</li>
<li>Back up</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Syndication</li>
<li>Goals / Objectives</li>
<li>User tasks</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Valid code</li>
<li>Cross browser compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Each one of these areas has their own subset of tasks that <em><strong>should</strong> </em>be implemented. Page speed for example could include everything from using a content delivery network to creating CSS sprites of all possible images. Security covers everything from proper server configuration, software maintenance, .htaccess rules, password choice, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>It should be obvious that even a five-page site requires a high attention to detail if you&#8217;re to make it solid, well-built and effective. With every page you add, every feature you build and every enhancement you craft you are compounding the detail required to build that same solid, well-built and effective website.</p>
<p>It is this reason that you should strive to not only keep your own projects and sites simple, but educate clients on the risks and draw backs of complexity. This will make you both happier, as the website will free of errors and omissions, easier to use and ultimately more effective.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can remember reading an article in <a href="http://www.wired.com" target="_blank">Wired magazine</a> in 1998 that described the all to near <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.08/y2k.html" target="_blank">end of the earth that would be caused by the year turning 2000</a>. The article was close to ten pages and could convince even the biggest skeptic to start hoarding bottled water and canned beans. Of course the year 2000 came and went and there were no mobs, massive infrastructure failures or general mayhem.</p>
<p>Today I came across an article by the same publication with the name &#8220;<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/08/ff_webrip/all/1" target="_blank">The Web Is Dead. Long Live the Internet.</a>&#8221; While I can understand that a technology based publication will always be covering trends and making predictions I get the clear sense that Wired has a pattern for sensationalism. This is again the case with their latest article and predictions, which uses irrelevant examples and figures to prove this grand &#8220;The way we use the internet is changing&#8221; statement.</p>
<h2>Why Wired Things the Web is Dead</h2>
<p>Wired claims that recent technology and devices have shifted using services from web based interfaces to applications and APIs. They cite examples such as the Facebook, Twitter and Gmail applications, all of which are available for mobile devices and often desktop as well. The core argument is that through applications and web service APIs you can create a more enjoyable and easier experience than through a web browser.</p>
<p>They claim that what we do online has much more to do with the general internet and very little to do with web sites. As a result, why would we need a web browser?</p>
<h2>Why Wired is Wrong</h2>
<p>At first pass the article is actually quite compelling. With the excitement around mobile applications and popular desktop twitter clients it is easy to imagine a world where you have a handful of applications to do your online tasks instead of one browser that is suited for everything. The first few pages of the article actually instilled a bit of fear, after all my company primarily does website design and development&#8230; not applications. However this fear actually reminded me of the 2000 article I had read over ten years ago, in some ways it felt very similar.</p>
<p>Upon further though and a bit of research it became increasingly more clear that Wired could not be more wrong. The web isn&#8217;t becoming less popular, in fact it is still being used in favor of applications that have been traditionally desktop applications.</p>
<p>The most obvious example would be email. While e-mail was born out of terminal commands it quickly became a service that was primarily used through desktop software such as Microsoft Outlook. While web-based e-mail solutions have been around forever it did go through a period where people were using it less and less. However with creation of Gmail web-based e-mail is actually at an all time high. If the web really is dead and we are moving towards an application focused experience why are users gravitating away from an application in favor of a web browser?</p>
<p>This shift isn&#8217;t limited to email/gmail. The google apps tool set has many users migrating from desktop based office applications towards web-based ones. Some of the most common computer tasks are now being done through a web browser, including word processing, slideshows and spreadsheets. Even financial management is moving to a web interface through sites like Mint.com, Quickbooks, Freshbooks and Quicken online. Again despite the fact that there are &#8220;apps&#8221; for the iPad, iPhone, Android, Deskop, etc&#8230; users are preferring the browser-based experience.</p>
<p>Finally if you look at how time is spent online it is overwhelming done so through websites and not applications and APIs. Topping the lists are social networks, videos and search&#8230; all of which are primarily accessed through a browser.</p>
<h2>Why Apps Won&#8217;t Be The Future</h2>
<p>While apps are the rage now they will always be limited in their adoption. There will always be the fringe cases where an app fits perfectly with an internet related task, but it isn&#8217;t going to be the common place. The fact of the matter is that it takes the effort to find, download and install an application. Imagine having to do that for everything you do online, it would be obnoxious and difficult. Additionally having a separate app on your computer or mobile device would be annoying as well.</p>
<p>It is actually easier and a better experience to be able to handle a majority of your internet tasks through a common piece of software. For those who are less savvy it is a consistent interface that they know how to use and don&#8217;t have to be bothered with locating and downloading dozens of apps to take advantage of the internet.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be convinced by Wired, the web is strong and getting stronger. Software will continue to move away from the app and towards web interfaces. From photo editing to CAD you can expect to be using the web for a long time to come.</p>
