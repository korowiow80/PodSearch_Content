If you enjoyed Bryson Springs or Lover in the Ice, consider contributing to it.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: My recent <a href="http://slangdesign.com">trip to China </a>got me thinking about complexity. RPGs are often very reductive, very simple worlds, but adding a bit of complexity to a game can greatly enhance it. Of course too much complexity can be awful especially in the wrong areas, but tweaking a specific aspect like a setting detail or a single game mechanic can make an average game into a great one. I also reveal my idea for a new Iron Heroes campaign, plus a letter from Tom, shout outs and an anecdote:</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: The World of Darkness is a massive family of role playing games spanning from 1991 to today. We invite Jason and Aaron, both regulars from the RPPR AP podcast, to discuss the wide range of horror games. As we are more familiar with the old World of Darkness than the new, we spend more time discussing that the new World of Darkness but neither side is neglected. We also discuss how to jump in the World of Darkness, common pitfalls for running games in this universe and some of our favorite books or settings for it. Oh and of course, the metaplot. Tom also has a letter, and we have shout outs and a horror related anecdote from a listener email.</p>

<p>Synopsis: Call of Cthulhu is an institution of role playing, but few gamers truly appreciate it for what it is. Tom, Caleb and I break down the game mechanics, meta-game issues and themes of the Cthulhu Mythos in order to explain the good, bad and ugly of this venerable game. Many players dismiss Call of Cthulhu as a very rigid and narrowly focused game, but it offers a far richer gaming experience if you know how to play and more importantly run this game right!.  Tom also has a letter, shout outs and an anecdote!</p>

Synopsis: Call of Cthulhu is an institution of role playing, but few gamers truly appreciate it for what it is. Tom, Caleb and I break down the game mechanics, meta-game issues and themes of the Cthulhu Mythos in order to explain the good, bad and ugly of this venerable game. Many players dismiss Call of Cthulhu as a very rigid and narrowly focused game, but it offers a far richer gaming experience if you know how to play and more importantly run this game right!.  Tom also has a letter, shout outs and an anecdote!

<p>Synopsis: We usually focus on advice for GMs creating or running games. This time, we want to focus on providing advice for players. So we&#8217;ve come up with a Be A Better Play Challenge. We want you to determine one thing you can do in your game to make yourself a better player. To help you along, Tom and I discuss some ways in which you can improve your game such as writing a better PC back story, table etiquette and playing against type. Tom also has a new letter and of course anecdotes and shouts.</p>

		<itunes:summary>News: The Killsplosion Kickstarter is a success! I&#039;ve acquired a HD camcorder (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HW7DY8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rolplapubrad-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004HW7DY8) so we&#039;ll start recording videos soon. The Artemis Spaceship Simulator will take some planning to figure out but we will do it. I&#039;ve also set up a RPPR Minecraft server (http://slangdesign.com/forums/index.php?topic=1376.0)! Check this thread for the address.

Synopsis: We usually focus on advice for GMs creating or running games. This time, we want to focus on providing advice for players. So we&#039;ve come up with a Be A Better Play Challenge. We want you to determine one thing you can do in your game to make yourself a better player. To help you along, Tom and I discuss some ways in which you can improve your game such as writing a better PC back story, table etiquette and playing against type. Tom also has a new letter and of course anecdotes and shouts.

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: We&#8217;ve been talking about adventure and campaign design lately, so we thought it would be appropriate for an episode on horror campaigns and how to run them. The pacing for a horror campaign is different because characters in these games tend to wear down through attrition. Thus, you have to take into account their reduced capabilities when designing adventures or plan for a new way to insert new player characters when the existing ones die or go mad. Furthermore, less is more when it comes to horror. A slight aberration from the mundane is often more terrifying than random tentacle monsters. Tom did not write a letter but we do have shout outs and anecdotes.</p>

Furthermore, less is more when it comes to horror. A slight aberration from the mundane is often more terrifying than random tentacle monsters. Tom did not write a letter but we do have shout outs and anecdotes.

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: Adventure design for long term campaigns is different than designing for a one shot scenario. Keeping up with the entirety of a complex ruleset is impossible for a campaign so you must determine what rules to keep track of and what to ignore. Adventures have to be geared to specific player characters. You can&#8217;t keep adding on new elements into the campaign. Instead, you must provide closure for the plot elements you do introduce. We discuss all of these topics and more. Furthermore, Tom has a new letter, shout outs and more.</p>

<p>Synopsis: Adventure design is a complex topic so we&#8217;d thought we would delve into it once again. In this episode, Tom and I discuss the difference between good design choices and style choices. While good design is applicable to any genre of RPG scenario, it is possible to make choices in creating an adventure that only work under certain circumstances. The choice to emphasize one aspect of a game over another isn&#8217;t necessarily right or wrong. It&#8217;s a style choice. Hack and slash versus political intrigue? Style. Dungeon crawling versus mass battles? Style. Tom also has a new letter entailing the virtues of various cinematic firearms.</p>

David cosplayed as an anime character, so he had a different experience. We also go over our purchases at Gencon and share more anecdotes from con games.</p>

<p>Synopsis: <strong>THIS IS A NSFW EPISODE.</strong> Tom remembered a horribly boring dungeon crawl campaign he suffered from in his youth. He wanted to take the cliches he saw in that game and make them actually fun. So, we discuss how to take cliches like traps, prisoners and treasure in dungeons and make them new and exciting. Also, because we are horrible, horrible monsters we read another excerpt from the rpg.net FATAL review. Also, Tom was too busy to write a letter. Be sure to let him know that you like his letters. Maybe he&#8217;ll grace us with a letter again. Maybe.</p>

Synopsis: THIS IS A NSFW EPISODE. Tom remembered a horribly boring dungeon crawl campaign he suffered from in his youth. He wanted to take the cliches he saw in that game and make them actually fun. So, we discuss how to take cliches like traps, prisoners and treasure in dungeons and make them new and exciting. Also, because we are horrible, horrible monsters we read another excerpt from the rpg.net FATAL review. Also, Tom was too busy to write a letter. Be sure to let him know that you like his letters. Maybe he&#039;ll grace us with a letter again. Maybe.

The barbaric tribes that live in the New World now walk upon its bones, the ruins of temples and palaces, ignorant of the wisdom and power buried beneath their feet. When a colony from the kingdom of a distant continent settles on the shores of the New World, whispers of Lemuria flutter through the winds. Adventurers from the colony find the ruins and marvel at their beauty. Scholars listen to the legends told by tribal elders and connect them to ancient stories of a lost empire. Native warriors and mystics commune with spirits awoken by the colony’s arrival. The Ruins of Lemuria stir the blood of the ambitious and curious. Soon expeditions will be mounted to crack open the dusty tombs leading into the Stygian depths to learn their secrets and plunder their treasures. Little do these adventurers know that the doom that befall mighty Lemuria waits to greet them.<br />
The Ruins of Lemuria describes a massive network of ruins that spread across the entire continent of the New World, the remnants of a powerful civilization more advanced in science and magic than any other in the history of the world. Fragments of their knowledge lie deep within the ruins, along with powerful magical items and vast amounts of treasure. Needless to say, if the knowledge or magic items are found and brought back to civilization, it could change the course of history. Lemurian magic and technology is still more advanced than anything else the world has ever known. A few adventurers armed with this power can end wars, curse diseases or doom their own civilization. This supplement provides a framework to incorporate the Ruins into most high fantasy RPG campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman </a>is a fancy way of describing the &#8216;youth to adulthood&#8217; genre &#8211; stories like &#8220;to Kill a Mockingbird&#8221; where the character grows from a child to become an adult or closer to an adult.

However, many game systems do not encourage character growth &#8211; advancement is slow, ponderous and mechanically difficult. Furthermore, most campaigns are relatively short &#8211; interrupted or abandoned for myriad reasons. If you want players to grow at a faster pace, what should you do? How is mechanical growth different from role playing growth? Tom and I discuss these issues and more.

<p><strong>Synopsis: </strong>Science fiction is an under appreciated genre in role playing games. Fantasy (Dungeons and Dragons) and horror (World of Darkness) dominate RPGs and most of the popular sci-fi games out there aren&#8217;t really science fiction or are horribly anachronistic. Tom and I discuss the state of science fiction and how it is different than fantasy or horror. As the literature of ideas, sci-fi should play differently than other genres. Everything from thematic content to the design of the game should be affected. We also have a letter from Tom, shout outs, an anecdote and reader letters.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Synopsis: Science fiction is an under appreciated genre in role playing games. Fantasy (Dungeons and Dragons) and horror (World of Darkness) dominate RPGs and most of the popular sci-fi games out there aren&#039;t really science fiction or are horribly anachronistic. Tom and I discuss the state of science fiction and how it is different than fantasy or horror. As the literature of ideas, sci-fi should play differently than other genres. Everything from thematic content to the design of the game should be affected. We also have a letter from Tom, shout outs, an anecdote and reader letters.

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: Game balance is a tricky thing. While in some cases, it&#8217;s easy to spot an unbalanced system like Palladium or Synnibarr but other times, a game&#8217;s imbalances won&#8217;t be revealed until you&#8217;ve played it for a while. So what do you when you find out that the game you&#8217;re playing is unbalanced? We discuss how to deal with these situations. It&#8217;s possible to change systems, house rule it so that it&#8217;s balanced or use the social contract to keep things fair. Also instead of a letter, Tom talks about having a cyst cut out of him.

		<itunes:summary>(http://slangdesign.com/rppr/wp-content/uploads/MPost11923-motivator3665036-300x240.jpg) RPPR News: We have a mirror of all of our episodes on archive.org (http://www.archive.org/details/RolePlayingPublicRadioPodcast). Catch up with our older episodes or send the link to a friend to introduce them to us.  I&#039;ve also updated the Zombies of the World blog going behind the scenes on how I created it.  (http://www.zombiesoftheworld.com/blog/behind-the-scenes/how-zombies-of-the-world-began/)

Synopsis: Running a game in a timely manner is a daunting task. Many convention games fail to finish in 4 hours and a lot of players think that 6-12 hours for a single session is normal. We here at RPPR get shit done and want to help you also get shit done. How can you keep a game running without wasting a lot of time? Tom has a letter, shout outs and an anecdote from Tom&#039;s latest Call of Cthulhu game.

Shout outs:

	* The blog of Ab3: The writer behind the Ab3 rants has his own blog with new material. Check it out!
	* Marble Hornets DVD: One of the freakiest things I&#039;ve seen in a long time now on DVD. Get it or Slender Man will take you.
	* Jane&#039;s Flighter Anthology: old flight sim. Blow up or fly Air Force One.
	* Tenebre: Masterpiece giallo from Argento. A serial killer stalks a writer in Rome. Great soundtrack as well.

	* Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness: (http://www.amazon.com/Fantasy-Flight-Games-MAD01-Mansions/dp/1616610158/) Must play board games for dedicated Lovecraft fans.

<p>Synopsis: Rhetoric is a divisive issue in tabletop games. Where do you draw the line between a player&#8217;s skill in speech and the PC&#8217;s ability? Tom and I discuss how rhetoric touches on game design, running a game and player vs. player conflicts. I&#8217;ve also started a superheroes campaign, using Wild Talents for the rules, and this time around we have seven players. A large group presents quite a few interesting challenges so we discuss how to run a game with a huge number of players.</p>

		<itunes:summary>(http://slangdesign.com/rppr/wp-content/uploads/awesome_face_bigger_1886-300x300.png)Thank you RPPR listeners! The Ruins of Lemuria PDF Ransom was a success! We are hard at work behind the scenes creating many cool things for you (http://www.zombiesoftheworld.com) and running games over Skype for the ransom contributors.

Synopsis: Rhetoric is a divisive issue in tabletop games. Where do you draw the line between a player&#039;s skill in speech and the PC&#039;s ability? Tom and I discuss how rhetoric touches on game design, running a game and player vs. player conflicts. I&#039;ve also started a superheroes campaign, using Wild Talents for the rules, and this time around we have seven players. A large group presents quite a few interesting challenges so we discuss how to run a game with a huge number of players.

		<itunes:summary>Halloween is right around the corner so we are once again talking about running terrifying games. RPGs can&#039;t really provide shocks like film or TV, but it&#039;s still possible to run a truly scary game by keeping a few principles in mind. Specifically, a GM should focus on presenting ambigious information, giving players some but not total control and characterizing NPCs and monsters well. Tom finally has a letter and some shout outs and a reader letter.

Shout outs:

	* Night of the Hunter: (http://www.amazon.com/Night-Hunter-Criterion-Collection/dp/B003ZYU3U0/) A brilliant and terrifying film blending film noir and fairy tales. Robert Mitchum&#039;s preacher is legendary as the villain.
	* Virus (http://www.amazon.com/Virus-George-Kennedy/dp/B001NFNUG2): A 1980 Japanese post apocalyptic sci-fi film. Sonny Chiba&#039;s in it! Hard to find though.
	* Four Dragons (http://dianabotsford.com/?page_id=349): A new Stargate novel written by Diana Botsford.
	* Smother Brothers&#039; Comedy Hour: C (http://www.amazon.com/Smothers-Brothers-Comedy-Hour-Season/dp/B001BGRWRG)omedy in an era of censorship. Funny stuff.
	* Salvage (http://www.amazon.com/Salvage-Neve-McIntosh/dp/B003B2UK18): A British horror film with great acting and very gameable material.
	* Ghost Stories: (http://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Stories-Artist-Not-Provided/dp/B000Y7WGT2/) a horror-comedy anime series.

<p>The real world holds just as much adventure as any fantasy or sci-fi setting. In this episode, Tom and I discuss various types of games you could run based in the real world with normal PCs (with no extraordinary abilities or cinematic fighting skills). There are more possibilities than you might realize.</p>

The real world holds just as much adventure as any fantasy or sci-fi setting. In this episode, Tom and I discuss various types of games you could run based in the real world with normal PCs (with no extraordinary abilities or cinematic fighting skills). There are more possibilities than you might realize.

The Codex of War is still underway but we have made significant  progress.

Have Ross run a game of YOUR CHOICE over Skype! </strong></a></p>
<p>In this episode we discuss how to add a sense of wonder to your game. Tabletop RPGs are only limited by your imagination yet too many games are dull dungeon crawl affairs of 10 foot wide corridors and orcs guarding pies, forever.  So how do you get that overwhelming awe in your game? We both talk about a few ways to introduce it using examples from earlier games. As Tom was too busy playing video games to write a letter (again), I read a story from Ichor Falls called <a href="http://www.ichorfalls.com/2009/03/15/candle-cove/">Candle Cove. </a></p>

		<itunes:summary>(http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rosspayton/codex-of-war-a-new-world-4e-dandd-campaign-setting/widget/card.jpg)New Rewards for the Codex of War Ransom! Have Ross run a game of YOUR CHOICE over Skype! 

In this episode we discuss how to add a sense of wonder to your game. Tabletop RPGs are only limited by your imagination yet too many games are dull dungeon crawl affairs of 10 foot wide corridors and orcs guarding pies, forever.  So how do you get that overwhelming awe in your game? We both talk about a few ways to introduce it using examples from earlier games. As Tom was too busy playing video games to write a letter (again), I read a story from Ichor Falls called Candle Cove.  (http://www.ichorfalls.com/2009/03/15/candle-cove/)

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the holidays, we got together to record some classic fanfiction for your enjoyment. First off is Tom reciting <strong>Doom: Repercussions of Evil </strong>a classic story of horror and rocket missiles. Read the entire story below the fold.</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-279"></span><br />
</strong><br />
John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base. He didn&#8217;t see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.<br />
John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad &#8220;I want to be on the ships daddy.&#8221;<br />
Dad said &#8220;No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS&#8221;<br />
There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.<br />
&#8220;This is Joson&#8221; the radio crackered. &#8220;You must fight the demons!&#8221;<br />
So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.<br />
&#8220;HE GOING TO KILL US&#8221; said the demons<br />
&#8220;I will shoot at him&#8221; said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.<br />
&#8220;No! I must kill the demons&#8221; he shouted<br />
The radio said &#8220;No, John. You are the demons&#8221;<br />
And then John was a zombie.</p>
