      <itunes:subtitle>Legendary CIA spook E. Howard Hunt passed away on January 23, 2007.

We discuss Hunt's involvement in everything from the 1954 coup in Guatemala, to the Bay of Pigs invasion, to Watergate, and bid farewell, or rather good riddance, to this Cold War relic.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Episode 36: Good Riddance E. Howard Hunt</title>
      <link>http://www.wuog.org/OutThere</link>
      <description>Legendary CIA spook E. Howard Hunt passed away on January 23, 2007.  This episode, in contrast to our previous tribute to a recently deceased icon, is a scathing expose of an American bad guy.  We discuss Hunt's involvement in everything from the 1954 coup in Guatemala, to the Bay of Pigs invasion, to Watergate, and bid farewell, or rather good riddance, to this Cold War relic.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Out There presents an interview with Adam Parfrey, author and founder of Feral House Press.  We discuss Adam's experiences in the world of underground publishing, as well as the relationship of conspiracy literature to the mass media.  We also discuss the idea of America as an "Apocalypse Culture."  We wrap up by talking about the book "Lords of Chaos."  This bestselling history of Norwegian Black Metal has recently been optioned for release as a feature film, and Adam is co-writing the screenplay.</itunes:summary>
