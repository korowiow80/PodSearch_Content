      <title>Toastmasters CTM Speech #2 (Tats)</title>
      <description>Speech title: Do you have a terrible idea?

How many of you have watched Dragons Den or American Inventor? These shows feature entrepreneurs and inventors all pitching their ideas to get financing from these business experts.

Like these experts on these shows, we see a lot of ideas too. It's funny because we actually have talked to many of the same people.

People regularly ask me, &#8220;What do you think of our product or idea?&#8221; 

I tried all sorts of tactful ways to answer this question (and believe me I tried many) 

I finally found the perfect answer.... (Click Play if you are interested)

      <title>Rethinking your R&amp;amp;D activity: Lessons from Thomas Edison</title>
      <description>[Recommended for Innovators and Manufacturers]

There are many stories of inventors who ended up broke, even if their inventions were first class world-beaters. 

Perhaps the best known one is Nikola Tesla who invented AC (Alternating Current) electrical systems and technology which is widely used throughout the world today. He was in direct competition with Thomas Edison's DC (Direct Current) technology. Tesla had the apparently superior technology for most electrical power applications but Edison's technology held the market for some time even after George Westinghouse, inventor of the railway air brake system still in use today, backed Tesla. Edison actively resisted changing from his established DC to the superior AC technology but eventually did make the wholesale change as the market dictated. Unlike Edison, Tesla died in relative obscurity as a broke, lonely and unhappy man. When Edison died, the President asked everyone in the country to dim their lights for a minute of remembrance, a practice that was widely observed.

What led to these two prominent individuals to such vastly different outcomes? Tesla is the poster boy for inventoritis, arguably being a greater inventor and scientist than Edison while self-educated Edison was free of it and still has the reputation as being the World's Greatest Inventor.
