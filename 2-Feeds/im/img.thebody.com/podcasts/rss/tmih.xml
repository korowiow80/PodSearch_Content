Whether you're 15 or 55, the emotions that accompany an HIV diagnosis can be overwhelming -- as can be the millions of questions, small and large, that start shooting through your mind. Questions such as: How could this have happened to me? How will my life change? Who should I tell? Will anyone still love me? Will I have to take treatment for the rest of my life? In This Month in HIV, we've brought together four individuals to offer concrete tips for coping with HIV, whether you've just been diagnosed or you've been living with it for years. Our guests are: Dr. Robert Remien, a prominent HIV researcher and clinical psychologist based in New York City. His research focuses on mental health and support for people with HIV, including mixed-status couples and gay men. Larry Bryant, a semi-pro football player turned HIV-positive political activist. A 20-year survivor of HIV, Larry is now the national field organizer for the HIV advocacy group Housing Works in Washington, D.C. Sherri Lewis, who lives in Los Angeles and speaks out about HIV in her podcast series "Straight Girl in a Queer World," hosted by Here! TV, a gay television network. She's also a performer and writer who was diagnosed with HIV in 1987. Michael McColly, a Chicago-based author, writing instructor and yoga teacher. He recently published his memoir, The After-Death Room: Journey into Spiritual Activism. Michael tested positive for HIV in 1996. </itunes:summary><description>Being diagnosed with HIV can be a traumatic experience.

People with HIV have gone to prison for having protected sex without disclosing, or even just for spitting on an HIV-negative person. And they've been fired from their jobs for even less. So as an HIV-positive person, what can you do to protect yourself -- in life, in love, at work and elsewhere?

However, meth use isn't just a problem because it's an HIV risk factor. Meth has also become a major issue among people who already have HIV. Research suggests a growing number of HIV-positive people in the United States are using or addicted to meth, particularly in the gay community.In terms of meth's effect on HIV and HIV medications, there are far more questions than answers at this point. However, meth use -- just like any other drug addiction -- can cause people to neglect their HIV medications and their general health, which could help drug resistance develop and accelerate HIV progression.So how do we, in the HIV community, begin to address the meth epidemic? What do we need to know?

Women are less likely than men to see a doctor for HIV, and are also less likely than men to continue in care. All of this makes HIV-positive women more at risk of dying of an HIV-related illness than HIV-positive men. This situation can be dramatically changed if women were able to take better charge of their care.What do you need to know in order to live a long and healthy life if you're a woman living with HIV? We asked this question of two women: one an HIV specialist, the other an HIV-positive treatment educator. They put together a checklist of 16 essential things HIV-positive women can do to ensure they get the care they deserve from their health care providers.

Women are less likely than men to see a doctor for HIV, and are also less likely than men to continue in care. All of this makes HIV-positive women more at risk of dying of an HIV-related illness than HIV-positive men. This situation can be dramatically changed if women were able to take better charge of their care.What do you need to know in order to live a long and healthy life if you're a woman living with HIV? We asked this question of two women: one an HIV specialist, the other an HIV-positive treatment educator. They put together a checklist of 16 essential things HIV-positive women can do to ensure they get the care they deserve from their health care providers.

If you have drug resistance, what are your options? In the bad old days, if your HIV developed drug resistance, it was often a challenge for physicians to cobble together a powerful second regimen. As more and more people with HIV developed drug resistance, "salvage" therapy -- or, as we prefer calling it, "rescue" therapy -- became one of the hottest topics in HIV treatment.But the times are changing. If you are someone whose HIV has developed resistance to lots of HIV drugs, there are nowmore HIV medications than ever before that can help you -- and there are even more drugs in development. The key is making sure that you and your HIV doctor have the knowledge you need to come up with a treatment regimen that works for you.That's why, for our April edition of "This Month in HIV," we've interviewed two experts who can break down this issue for people who aren't experts: physician and researcher Eric Daar, M.D., and Jeff Berry, an 18-year HIV survivor and editor of Test Positive Aware Network's Positively Aware.</itunes:summary>	<description>What does it mean when your HIV develops resistance to many HIV medications?
