			<description><![CDATA[Beware for the ranting used in Chapter 40. Daniel rips into frustrations due to the likes of Norton, all-in-one's and the new Apple Air. You are guided down each category and shown an industry that favors their advertisers products but will not admit to it. The new Air is keyed on the reasons why a Firewire port is not included on the world "thinnest laptop" along with how Apple cheated consumers by having only one USB port. The lack of ethernet ports to bloatware are chewed up and spat out. Listen in to hear the shocking truth.]]></description>

In this example we use a piggy bank as an analogy to our life investments. Dropping loose change into the bank is similar to investing in a future that can not be seen. Unless I peak, I can not precisely predict when my piggy bank will be full. As we start with an empty bank the change we add will not seem to be adding much. However, over time if we are consistent, it will pay off.]]></description>

			<title>17-Simple Not Stupid</title>
			<itunes:author>Daniel Sellers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[The TechCrunch podcast was interviewing James Hong, Co-Founder of Hot Or Not. Through this interview Mr. Hong could communicate in such a way that allowed me insight into the power of simplicity. They evolved from offering a service as a hobby and adapted to immediate growth by offering a paid subscription "dating" service. Recently, the company has since dropped the subscription in favor of offering it for free receiving its revenues through advertisement. Hong also brought the concept of replacing text with pictures or logos that we are familiar with. He wisely perceived that people generally, do not want to read. They would rather click a picture or watch a simple animation rather than having to read text. Also about podcasting I listened to the latest Technorati. The discussion focused on the current state of podcasting in the current multimedia industry. As the show progressed I identified with "those who pursue a quality show without the backing of a magazine or network television can still receive benefits by the experience. This is true because since I have been producing it has allowed me to learn so much about the industry. By producing content and learning how to present my message I concluded that I can use podcasting as a promotional tool for the services I offer.]]></description>

During this Chapter Daniel Sellers covers TuneCore and IODA that serve as a music delivery and distribution service that get the artist' original music, including cover versions, up for sale on all major online download services. Then we cover CDBaby and the important services they offer which include generating a barcode for you. Please review Imaginate's podcast on iTunes.

During this Chapter Daniel Sellers covers TuneCore and IODA that serve as a music delivery and distribution service that get the artist&apos; original music, including cover versions, up for sale on all major online download services. Then we cover CDBaby and the important services they offer which include generating a barcode for you. Please review Imaginate&apos;s podcast on iTunes. Also in the blog will be an option for you to Digg this article.</itunes:summary>

			<title>13 Freedom Is Not Free</title>
			<itunes:author>Daniel Sellers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[We did not want the shows that are displayed on podcast directories to be numbered than the chapter we were calling each show after episode 9.5. Officially we are now on Chapter 13. With the change we are challenging superstition with the number 13. The podcasting industry is changing with mainstream media pushing out many ametuer podcasters for the spotlight.
Imaginate will focus on using podcasting as a promotional tool making sure the push to advertise does not compromise the mission Imaginate Productions has set. From the production and feedback from the Imaginate shows, I have a clearer picture of what services I want to build and add on to. Pursuing your dream will cost you. This not only applies to finances. You must be willing to ask yourself, "What am I willing to give up for the pursuit of this dream." Everything in life costs. Freedom is not free. Direction is mandatory if you will get a destination. If you do not have at least a piece of your vision, you risk being toppled by the harsh waves of life. In the review and comments portion of the show I cover Justin.tv and Justine.tv. Are these pioneers of the next step in evolution of personalizing the web?]]></description>

			<title>11 Growth of Art</title>
			<itunes:author>Daniel Sellers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Longfellow once said, "Art is the gift of God, and must be used unto his glory." However at Imaginate Productions we are challenging the definition of an artist and seek to find what individual art is and then collaborate with others. Glenn Gould stated, "The purpose of art is not the release of a momentary ejection of adrenaline but rather the gradual, lifelong construction of a state of wonder and serenity." In Chapter of 11 of the Imaginate chronicle, we discuss these enduring questions with Anthony Novak. Novak is an artist in numerous ways such as a musician, painter and now fatherhood. Daniel Sellers interviews Mr. Novak about topics including how to balance internal and external art and how one remains true to the art that expands into adulthood.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[
How is the art coming from you coming? In this episode Daniel Sellers recommends a tool that helps you relax and inspire your creativity. FoxyTunes. It is a Firefox plug-in that allows you to control your music playlists, volume settings and the newest version gives easy access to YouTube. An audio clip from Veronica Bellmount of CNet's "Inside Secrets" reviews this plug-in in a more descriptive way. Thank you Veronica! Daniel Sellers gets more personal about the art of teaching. This art form requires creativity and skills of presenting a topic that will engage an audience and inspire them to explore further. Daniel explains how his specialty in audio and media inspired not only himself but also a class he is teaching to start a podcast. In the first week of February "The Friday Cast" was born. In this podcast each student uses their specialty (art) within their preferred subject. They discuss the latest in the technology world giving their opinions and recommendations. Enjoying the collaboration from the Friday team, Daniel wanted to give his talents beyond the classroom to a broader and more eclectic audience. The ending audio "Gates vs. Jobs" is a humorous outlook of how two giants of the technology are perceived and how their unique styles would clash.]]></description>

However there are important questions you must first ask. What is unique about your business? Unique about the services you provide or the product you produce? You need to make a short list of your services that are the bare essentials to your business. Then define your competition by location and prices. Do not under price yourself because that may keep clients from taking you seriously. Tweak the way you present your services. It is as if you are presenting your master painting, portfolio of photos and your feature film. The talents you have can be an expression of art. Guard your art but also be willing to share and collaborate with others that may stretch your artistic ability (your services).

			<title>The Starting Line</title>
			<itunes:author>Daniel Sellers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Imaginate Productions describe how a person who may be an artist can be an effective business manager. Daniel covers his own experience of how he consolidated his dreams with a business plan. Daniel gives credit to his grandmother for the encouragement he needed to begin simply telling stories. She would sit for hours allowing him to create characters, develop imaginary places and attempt to express the combination into a relatable story. His grandmother was very kind. Daniel was only four years old and loved to tell his grandmamma tales he had invented. Nearly twenty-five years later Imaginate Productions was created. Many valuable lessons have been learned as Daniel worked starting out as offering home technical support for personal and business users while taking classes for certification.  Experience is more important in the industry than certification. As Imaginate Productions now operates under its revised mission and business plan Daniel offers answers for those who are just getting into the industry. Use the experiences of Daniel Sellers and learn how these lessons may apply to you. We encourage you to participate in the forums and to send in comments and questions for the show.]]></description>
