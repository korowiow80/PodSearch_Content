<p>Technical issues plagued my first episode with new cohost Shea, and personal issues plagued the reschedule. Shea will be on next week to discuss the Apple TV jailbreak and the benefits it provides, but until then I touch on the new jailbreak and the new native apps that can be run on the Apple TV. I also discuss the mysterious GameStore app released to the App Store by Apple and what that could mean for Apple. I touch on Apple&#8217;s rumored January event, Windows Phone&#8217;s Siri competitor, the iPhone rollout across many additional countries, a neat iPhone accessory that includes a Pico Projector, and the ever-present Angry Birds. Up next week we&#8217;ll have an attorney on the show to discuss the Samsung and HTC lawsuits, but until then I cover how Samsung used an iPhone 4S actress in the new Galaxy Tablet commercial. A new Steve Jobs action figure, iPad 3 rumors and a ridiculously premature iPad 4 rumor. Quad-core iPhones, mini-Apple stores in Target, and a data-hungry Siri. Phew! Big show!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a short show this week, and a particularly relaxed episode. I talk about the iPhone untethered iOS5 jailbreak, some patent and lawsuit issues, and touch briefly on rumors surrounding Apple with their iPad 3 and often rumored iTV device. You got questions regarding Apple&#8217;s patents, trademarks and lawsuits? Send &#8216;em in, as I&#8217;ll have a real-live attorney on the show to discuss the issues in an upcoming epiosde. I also touch on upcoming segments, including ways in which the Android is better than the iPhone (don&#8217;t hate, you know SOME features of Android are better), and web development/app development as it pertains to mobile devices. As always, your feedback is very important. Contact the show using contact@twiiphone.com, or call the voicemail at (512) 348-8637, or find me on Twitter @twiiphone.</p>

<p>I know, I&#8217;m a dirty slacker who didn&#8217;t do a show as promised last week, but here we are with user feedback that has backed up, as well as a ton of Apple news to talk about. I discuss the Motorola lawsuit, the Anobit acquisition, the auction of Apple&#8217;s founding papers, Skydrive, Google&#8217;s Siri competitor, a Notifcation Center rehash, Louie CK&#8217;s video, a new Roku iPhone app, iTunes Match, iPad mini, Bluetooth 4, HTC bans, and the failed T-Mobile/AT&amp;T deal.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we approach the holidays at a fast and furious rate, news and updates slow down to a crawl. Oh well. Yet another solo show, touching on the very little amount of iPhone news that came across this week, including the release of Grand Theft Auto III as an iOS app, iTV rumors, iFaith and H1Siri (I try to sound like an informed jailbreaker), and… well, that&#8217;s about it. This show was recorded live, but you&#8217;d never know it since no one listened in. So listen in next week! Follow me on Twitter so you can know what time.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know most people prefer shows where I get some guests to discuss the latest with, but unfortunately the upcoming holiday and busy schedules didn&#8217;t allow for a guest this week. But never fear, I dish out the news solo rather than let another week go by with no show. Of course I start out the show discussing beer, and how Sam Adams makes what is probably the best winter seasonal beer you&#8217;ll ever taste. I go over listener feedback, Ian helps out with some app reviews, and I touch on the big news stories of the week. Unfortunately there were very few big stories, so the is a short episode. As always, your feedback is very important. Contact the show using contact@twiiphone.com, or call the voicemail at (512) 348-8637, or find me on Twitter @twiiphone.</p>

As always, your interaction is important to the show. Please review me on iTunes, email me (contact@twiiphone.com), tweet me (@twiiphone), and call me (512-348-8637). I&#8217;ll get to all the missing feedback next week, I promise!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been following <a href="http://twiiphone.com">our Twitter account</a>, you&#8217;d know that on Monday, we announced that Apple has removed us from their iTunes podcast directory. They didn&#8217;t explain why, and there&#8217;s nothing that anyone could do to get it back (maybe unless Steve Jobs would grow some balls and stop being so protective over everything). We think that it has to do with all of our talk about jailbreaking. But, oh well.</p>
<p>Because of this, we&#8217;re not going to be making anymore episodes (for the time being). If we can happen to get this stuff sorted out, then we&#8217;ll consider it. But, we might be making  a new show. Some of the feedback (that was ACTUALLY get) that we&#8217;ve gotten tells us that listeners really enjoy our jailbreak corner. So, we might make a jailbreak-related podcast.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has ever listened to one of our episodes. We&#8217;ve had a number of great guests on the show, such as <a href="http://twiiphone.com/2010/06/05/episode-013-steve-wozniak-interview-wwdc-2010-att-data-plans-more/">Steve Wozniak</a>, and a <a href="http://twiiphone.com/2010/07/30/episode-021-planetbeing-comex-ih8sn0w-chpwn-plus-more/">number of jailbreak developers</a>. We&#8217;ve had over 161,000 downloads ever since our first episode back on March 7, 2010.</p>
<p>Thanks, and we&#8217;ll see you on the other side.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>(Logan Voss) Have you started working on Android for iPhone 4? Id love to check it out. Also, will there be an easier way to install it at some point? Such as Cydia installation, or something? Thanks!</li>
<li>(Trey Driver) I have been a jailbreak user since the iPhone 3G, and have learned the hardware very well. What advice can you give to someone that wants to get into the scene? What should someone need to do to get familiar with the programming/coding of iOS?</li>
<li>(Daniel Meese) Are you planning on picking up on LogoMe again? If not, will you make it open source? It was awesome while it worked.</li>
<li>(Zitbak) What has been the biggest headache/roadblock for the latest jailbreak so far?</li>
<li>(Jared Hererra) What made you want to unlock the iPhone?</li>
<li>(Cody Kurtz) Two-parts: (1) In your opinion, why do you believe Apple has not completely closed the exploits you can use to gain root access to jailbreak the iPhone? (2) Do you believe that because of this, Apple (deep down) wants some sort of jailbreaker community to continue to follow their prized phone in an ever-growing, ever-competitive, community of open smartphones?</li>
<li>(Sahid) I always wanted to create apps for my own personal use. I would first think that you would need to know how to create an app before jailbreaking the iPhone. I opened a dev account on Apple, looked at some videos, but Im still confused as to where I should start. So my questions is, exactly where or how should one start who wants to create apps and work on iPhone hacks, and where did you get started?</li>
<li>(Zuaro Donnes) How long does it take to find a vulnerability in the iOS, write an exploit, and get a smooth working jailbreak?</li>
<li>(Lashawn Jarrett) Is there a way to get FaceTime working on a cellular network?</li>
<li>(Brian) Do you ever get annoyed by people who are constantly bug you about a jailbreak? To me, it would be neat at first, because you have a massive amount of people who are relying on you (and other, of course) for the jailbreak, but maybe it would get annoying after a while.</li>
<li>(Brian) What do you think about iPhone app piracy?</li>
<li>(Anthony) Will Frash be coming to anything other than the iPad?</li>
<li>(Everyone) When will the iPhone 4/iOS 4.x jailbreak be released?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you were with us for the live stream, I do apologize for how things went. We never anticipated having over 2,000 people on the stream at one time (we usually have 10). Should something this big happen again, we will be prepared.</p>

Questions

(Logan Voss) Have you started working on Android for iPhone 4? Id love to check it out. Also, will there be an easier way to install it at some point? Such as Cydia installation, or something? Thanks!
(Trey Driver) I have been a jailbreak user since the iPhone 3G, and have learned the hardware very well. What advice can you give to someone that wants to get into the scene? What should someone need to do to get familiar with the programming/coding of iOS?
(Daniel Meese) Are you planning on picking up on LogoMe again? If not, will you make it open source? It was awesome while it worked.
(Zitbak) What has been the biggest headache/roadblock for the latest jailbreak so far?
(Jared Hererra) What made you want to unlock the iPhone?

<li>Over 1,000,000 iPad&#8217;s sold since launch day &#8211; According to <a href="http://labs.chitika.com/ipad/">Chitika Labs</a>, Apple has sold over 1,000,000 iPad&#8217;s, and sell at least one every few seconds. Accurate? Maybe not.</li>
<li>iPad Camera Kit supports USB headsets &amp; keyboards &#8211; Customers have figured out that the iPad&#8217;s camera connection kit supports USB headsets and USB keyboards.</li>
<li>iPad (WiFi+3G) released &#8211; Apple has released the iPad (WiFi+3G). Its no-contract data plans (through AT&amp;T) can give you 250MB for $14.99/mo, or unlimited for $29.99/mo.</li>

<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/follow-friday-generator/id342693650?mt=8">Follow Friday Generator</a>, $0.99 (iTunes) &#8211; Follow Friday is a tradition that a lot of people take part in every single Friday. It&#8217;s basically where you make a tweet with people&#8217;s usernames who you think are interesting and that others should follow. This can become quite annoying when you don&#8217;t exactly know who to choose. This is where Follow Friday Generator comes in. It&#8217;s a very simple and affordable iPhone application which automatically generates this tweet for you. Just run it, login, and let it generate the tweet. If there&#8217;s usernames whom you don&#8217;t like, you can easily delete them, and add other people. You can also save these tweets for future use.</li>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/siri-assistant/id351778157?mt=8">Siri</a>, FREE (iTunes) &#8211; &#8220;There&#8217;s a new way to get things done&#8230; Just ask Siri to book restaurants, movies, taxis, and more (built for 3GS phones and works only in the US). Siri gathers answers and actions from your favorite brands. So go ahead. Just ask!&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qik-video-camera-pro-for-any/id366276301?mt=8">Qik Video Camera Pro</a>, $0.99 (iTunes) &#8211; &#8220;The Video Camera for any iPhone, now with amazing touch effects, zoom, pause and other controls.

<li>Android on iPhone 3G is &#8220;Coming Along&#8221; &#8211; Android for the iPhone 3G is getting closer and closer to its public release. Planetbeing has completed multitouch support. It&#8217;s only a matter of time until we can all enjoy Android on our iPhone&#8217;s or iPod Touch&#8217;s!</li>
<li>&#8220;Spirit&#8221; Untethered Jailbreak for All &#8211; A jailbreak called &#8220;Spirit&#8221; was said to be released on Friday, but that wasn&#8217;t the case. The release date isn&#8217;t know. Spirit is basically a userland jailbreak which can jailbreak any iDevices running 3.1.3 (untethered!). It can even jailbreak both models of the iPad.</li>

News


Over 1,000,000 iPad&#8217;s sold since launch day &#8211; According to Chitika Labs, Apple has sold over 1,000,000 iPad&#8217;s, and sell at least one every few seconds. Accurate? Maybe not.
iPad Camera Kit supports USB headsets &#38; keyboards &#8211; Customers have figured out that the iPad&#8217;s camera connection kit supports USB headsets and USB keyboards.
iPad (WiFi+3G) released &#8211; Apple has released the iPad (WiFi+3G). Its no-contract data plans (through AT&#38;T) can give you 250MB for $14.99/mo, or unlimited for $29.99/mo.


Apps of the Week

Follow Friday Generator, $0.99 (iTunes) &#8211; Follow Friday is a tradition that a lot of people take part in every single Friday. It&#8217;s basically where you make a tweet with people&#8217;s usernames who you think are interesting and that others should follow. This can become quite annoying when you don&#8217;t exactly know who to choose. This is where Follow Friday Generator comes in. It&#8217;s a very simple and affordable iPhone application which automatically generates this tweet for you. Just run it, login, and let it generate the tweet. If there&#8217;s usernames whom you don&#8217;t like, you can easily delete them, and add other people. You can also save these tweets for future use.
Siri, FREE (iTunes) &#8211; &#8220;There&#8217;s a new way to get things done&#8230; Just ask Siri to book restaurants, movies, taxis, and more (built for 3GS phones and works only in the US). Siri gathers answers and actions from your favorite brands. So go ahead. Just ask!&#8221;
Qik Video Camera Pro, $0.99 (iTunes) &#8211; &#8220;The Video Camera for any iPhone, now with amazing touch effects, zoom, pause and other controls. Also, it is the simplest and fastest way to share and post videos to social networks.&#8221;

Jailbreak Corner

Android on iPhone 3G is &#8220;Coming Along&#8221; &#8211; Android for the iPhone 3G is getting closer and closer to its public release. Planetbeing has completed multitouch support. It&#8217;s only a matter of time until we can all enjoy Android on our iPhone&#8217;s or iPod Touch&#8217;s!
&#8220;Spirit&#8221; Untethered Jailbreak for All &#8211; A jailbreak called &#8220;Spirit&#8221; was said to be released on Friday, but that wasn&#8217;t the case. The release date isn&#8217;t know. Spirit is basically a userland jailbreak which can jailbreak any iDevices running 3.1.3 (untethered!). It can even jailbreak both models of the iPad.

<li>iPhone OS 4.0 Beta 2 Released &#8211; As expected, Apple released iPhone OS 4.0 beta 2 on Tuesday. It fixed a lot of things, and it also broke a lot of things (you can&#8217;t take pictures or save anything to your camera roll). One noticeable new feature is that, when switching in between apps (ie. getting a push notification and viewing it in its native app), the animation is completely different.</li>
<li>iPad with 3G Coming April 30th &#8211; Apple has announced that the iPad with 3G support will be available April 30th in their retail stores at 5PM in the evening.</li>
<li>Possible Future iPhone 4G/HD? &#8211; Gizmodo purchased what could be the next iPhone (for $5,000). It features flash on the back, a camera on the front, dedicated volume up and down buttons, and a completely flat back. Apple may press charges against Gizmodo.</li>
<li>Android Running on iPhone &#8211; The Linux on iPhone team has been able to get Android running fairly nicely on the iPhone 2G. Nearly everything works. They&#8217;re working on making it easy to install as well as work on the rest of the iDevices (iPod Touch 1G/2G, iPhone 3G). Support for said devices should be out within a month.</li>

So you never have to worry about leaving anything behind.

<li>RockApp Beta for 4.0 &#8211; The guys over at RockYouriPhone has sent out a private beta of RockApp with 4.0 support. It&#8217;s basically ready for when 4.0 is officially released.</li>

<li>HP Slate: &#8220;Meh&#8221; &#8211; Conecti.ca was able to do a little review of the HP Slate. Their verdict: &#8220;Meh&#8221;. While featuring a full operating system and Flash support, neither run very well on its 1.6GHz Atom CPU with 1GB of RAM. Nobody will really know whether or not the HP Slate will be the iPad killer until it is actually released. [<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/19/hp-slate-leaks-its-way-into-the-wild-meh/">via Engadget</a>]</li>
<li>Office 2011 for Mac (Beta 2) &#8211; Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 beta 2 was leaked all around the web. In short, it&#8217;s amazing. It&#8217;s a mix of Office 2007, Office 2010, and Office 2008 (where&#8217;s 2009? <img src='http://twiiphone.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> ). The new ribbon bar makes accessing formatting tools simple and fast. I personally LOVE Microsoft Office. Apple&#8217;s iWork is, to say the least, crappy.</li>
<li>Steam for Mac Beta &#8211; The Steam for Mac beta was leaked all around the web. What&#8217;s so good about it? Absolutely freaking nothing. Everyone was making a big deal about Steam officially coming to the Mac. But guess what? It&#8217;s just the Windows version running semi-natively on Mac OS X. For example, when adding non-steam games to your game&#8217;s library, one of the file types is a .exe file. This is telling me that this is nothing more than the Windows version of Steam. And unless you&#8217;re an approved beta tester, this leaked beta is useless. You&#8217;re better off running Steam through CrossOver or Wine.</li>
<li>Dell Smartphones &#8211; Dell&#8217;s line of smartphones for Q4 2010 were leaked earlier this week. There are a lot of new handsets. Their &#8220;Lightning&#8221; features Windows Phone 7 as its operating system, has a 1GHz Snapdragon processor, and 512MB RAM/ROM. Their &#8220;Thunder&#8221; features a 4.1&#8243; OLED screen, a 1GHz Snapdragon processor, 512MB RAM/ROM, Android 2.1 with Dell&#8217;s &#8220;Stage&#8221; UI, and a 8MP camera. All of them are rumored to be available for AT&amp;T later this year (HECK YES!).

<li>Opera Mini Approved &amp; Released &#8211; Earlier in the week, Apple has finally approved Opera Mini for the iPhone. It was waiting to be approved for over 20 days.

<li>Opera this week has been submitted to Apple for approval. What&#8217;s the big deal? Well, this app makes browsing the web fast &#8211; BLAZING fast, even on EDGE. In the time it takes Safari to load just one web page, Opera can load nearly 6. While it most likely not be accepted into the App Store, hope can still be had for jailbreakers, since Opera can submit it to Cydia, and is guaranteed to be approved.</li>
<li>Geohot has posted a teaser video, showing off his untethered jailbreak running on his iPod Touch 3G. He claims that it will work on the iPod Touch 2G (&#8220;MC&#8221;-model), iPod Touch 3G, iPhone 3GS (new bootrom), and possibly the iPad. The release date is unknown, but what is known is that it will work similarly to blackra1n. It should be released within 2 weeks, or after the next iPhone OS update is released.</li>
<li>Hackers have cracked open an exploit in MobileSafari that allows users to access a malicious website, and their SMS (even deleted ones) can be transferred to a remote server. Apple will most likely fix this in their next major iPhone OS.</li>

<li>Circuitous, FREE in Cydia &#8211; &#8220;Circuitous is a custom app switcher. It shows your open applications in a nice dock on the right side of the screen where you can launch and exit apps from there. Also, you can cycle through your open apps. With this I mean the apps you have open, in the order you opened them, are cycled. They open the next app in line. There is forward and backward cycling in this version! All three of these features, the dock, cycling forward, and cycling backward are all managed by Activator methods within the settings app.&#8221;</li>

News

Opera this week has been submitted to Apple for approval. What&#8217;s the big deal? Well, this app makes browsing the web fast &#8211; BLAZING fast, even on EDGE. In the time it takes Safari to load just one web page, Opera can load nearly 6. While it most likely not be accepted into the App Store, hope can still be had for jailbreakers, since Opera can submit it to Cydia, and is guaranteed to be approved.
Geohot has posted a teaser video, showing off his untethered jailbreak running on his iPod Touch 3G. He claims that it will work on the iPod Touch 2G (&#8220;MC&#8221;-model), iPod Touch 3G, iPhone 3GS (new bootrom), and possibly the iPad. The release date is unknown, but what is known is that it will work similarly to blackra1n. It should be released within 2 weeks, or after the next iPhone OS update is released.
Hackers have cracked open an exploit in MobileSafari that allows users to access a malicious website, and their SMS (even deleted ones) can be transferred to a remote server. Apple will most likely fix this in their next major iPhone OS.

Apps of the Week

Wunder Radio, $6.99 &#8211; WR is an amazing application that lets you stream thousands upon thousands of live audio streams directly to your iPhone or iPod Touch, via Wifi, 3G, or EDGE.
Sleep Cycle alarm clock, $0.99 &#8211; &#8220;An alarm clock that analyzes your sleep patterns and wakes you in the lightest sleep phase &#8211; a natural way to wake up where you feel rested and relaxed.&#8221;
Tumblr, FREE &#8211; &#8220;Use Tumblr&#8217;s iPhone app to easily post quotes, photos, audio, video and more to your tumblelog.&#8221;
Fluttr for Twitter, $2.99 &#8211; &#8220;Fluttr is a brand new Twitter client for the iPhone with a unique new interface. With its beautiful interface and plethora of features, Fluttr allows you to immerse yourself in the phenomenon that is Twitter.&#8221;

Jailbreak Corner

Shrink, $0.99 in Cydia &#8211; Shrink lets you easily shrink the size of the icons on your SpringBoard, so that you can do cool things like in the screenshot to the right(Shrink, Iconoclasm, Infinidock).
Circuitous, FREE in Cydia &#8211; &#8220;Circuitous is a custom app switcher. It shows your open applications in a nice dock on the right side of the screen where you can launch and exit apps from there. Also, you can cycle through your open apps. With this I mean the apps you have open, in the order you opened them, are cycled. They open the next app in line. There is forward and backward cycling in this version! All three of these features, the dock, cycling forward, and cycling backward are all managed by Activator methods within the settings app.&#8221;

Nothing this week! Be sure to tune in next week.

Weighing in at a little over a pound, this dual-screen &#8220;digital journal&#8221; features Nvidia&#8217;s Tegra 2 chipset, which means you&#8217;ll get very fast processing speeds and excellent 3D graphics. Since it does use a pen for writing and navigation, the Courier will have built-in handwriting recognition. Also, don&#8217;t forget the built-in camera and headphone jack!

Of course, there will be plenty more to learn in the coming months, and we&#8217;re going to be beating down Redmond&#8217;s door for more details on this thing, but for now, let&#8217;s dive into what Microsoft has revealed as far about it&#8217;s latest and (potentially) greatest phone operating system.&#8221;</li>
