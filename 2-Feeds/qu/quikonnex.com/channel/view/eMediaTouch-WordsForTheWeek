  <p>In today's <a href="http://www.wordsfortheweek.com">Words for the Week</a> <a href="http://www.christian-podcast.com">Christian Podcast</a>, we will look at a modern day example of Habakkuk 3:17-18.</p><p />The original scripture reads this way:<br /><br /><div id="dbv-content">Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no
grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce
no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the
stalls, yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my
Savior.</div>

<title>The Princess and the Pauper - A Parable About Your Identity In Christ, by Penny Haynes</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=11188</link>
<description><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.quikonnex.com/search/displayenc_pop.php?itemid=11188"><h2>Click here to listen to the Podcast about Learning Your New Identity</h2></A>
<BR><br>
WHO WE ARE DETERMINES WHAT WE DO
<BR><br>
Let me tell you a story.  Once upon a time, there was a homeless young woman who lived on the streets.  She had no parents, no clothes except those upon her back, no belongings to speak of.  She ate whatever she could find, even someone else's left-overs in a garbage can.
<BR><br>
One day, the prince of the city came through the streets with his royal carriage and saw the young woman rummaging through the garbage bins.  His heart was filled with compassion, and he had his servants invite the young woman to enter the carriage to come to the royal palace.  The woman was confused; why would the Prince want her to come to the palace?
<BR><br>
But she accepted the invitation, though she remained somewhat in a daze.  When she came to the palace, she was shown to a huge bedroom with a large canopied bed, closets full of women's clothing, and which was adjacent to a large bathroom, with a huge jaccuzzi tub.  She was instructed to remove her clothing, take a long bath, and put on any of the clothing she found in the closet.  
<BR><br>
She was suspicious, and very uncomfortable, to say the least, but her curiosity, mixed with her fatigue and her hunger drove her to try it.  She enjoyed the luxurious bath and the delicious feeling of being clean; she felt almost decadent when she put on the long flowing gown that she had picked out of all of the splendid garments.  She went down the long staircase and was escorted into the main banqueting hall, where she sat down to a huge feast with every food imaginable.  The Prince had requested that a special feast be held in honor of the young woman, who probably had not sampled such fare before.
<BR><br>
The evening was wonderful.  She enjoyed the food, the drink, the fine clothing and the wonderfully important way she was treated by the Prince and the servants.  It was like living in a dream.  And she expected the dream to soon come to an end.  
<BR><br>
But the Prince requested that the young woman become his Ward, his permanent guest, whose welfare would now be his concern.  All of her needs would be taken care of by the Prince.  She was welcome to stay with the Prince as a Princess of the kingdom for as long as she desired.
<BR><br>
Amazed at such a prospect, she followed the servant back to the huge bedroom, where she was given a silken dressing gown for sleeping.  The bed was soft, the sheets cool, the covers warm.  It was perfect.
<BR><br>
Yet in the morning, she found herself hungry again.  And out of habit, she reached for her old rags instead of the fine clothing hanging in her closet.  She went downstairs, through the huge banqueting room and kitchen, and went outside, behind the palace to the garbage dump, where she began rummaging for scraps from last night's feast, as she had learned to do throughout her life in order to keep from starving.
<BR><br>
One of the servants noticed a beggar eating out of the trash cans and informed the Prince.  His Highness looked out the window and recognized the beggar as his new Ward.  He rushed down the stairway and out behind the house and turned the young woman toward himself.
<BR><br>
Why are you wearing these rags?  You have new royal clothing in your new bedroom.  And why are you eating out of the dumpster?  There is an abundance of food in the royal refrigerator, all at your disposal.  You are dressed like a pauper, and acting like one who has no food or clothing, when in actuality, you are now a princess, with all the goods, rights and privileges of royalty.  Don't you know who you are?
<BR><br>
I am an orphaned pauper, said the young woman, living in your palace.  I don't deserve to be in such a fancy place; I am nothing, and I have nothing.  I have never done anything to even merit my visiting here, much less my living here.
<BR><br>
That's not the point, said the Prince.  I invited you here, and adopted you as one of the royal family solely out of my compassion for you.  You didn't earn it; I freely gave it to you.  And you no longer are an orphaned pauper; you are a royal Ward, with all of the benefits and privileges that come with being my Ward.  
<BR><br>
Whether or not you wear the fine clothing or eat the sumptuous food is up to you, but it is yours nonetheless. However until you accept the fact that you are no longer a pauper, and embrace the truth that you are now a Princess, you will never be able to enjoy all that now belongs to you.
<BR><br>
The young woman stood there baffled.  How could this be?  Who was she?  A pauper or a Princess?  She didn't know who she was anymore.  She had been a pauper so long, she continually felt like a pauper.  But the Prince has decreed that she is a Princess, and whatever the Prince decrees is the truth.
<BR><br>
Dear Prince, I have been a Pauper so long, I do not know how to be a Princess.  I don't feel like a Princess inside.  And yet I know that what you decree becomes law.  So I need you to help me remember who I now am, so that I will act like a Princess instead of a Pauper.  I do so want to be a Princess.
<BR><br>
The Prince called one of the royal servants, a handmaiden named Paraklete.  Youù, the Prince said, are to remain at the side of the Princess at all times, reminding her that she is now a royal Princess.  You are to remind her of the benefits and privileges that come with her rank, and remind her of the behavior befitting someone in her position.  You are not to force her to do anything, but to always speak the truth in love to her.
<BR><br>
And the newly found Princess slowly learned to eat from the royal refrigerator rather than the royal dump, and reach for her new fine clothing rather than her rags.  And she made good use of the royal bathroom and routinely tried to keep herself clean from the filth she used to walk and wallow in.  
<BR><br>
But this slow transformation of her outward actions only followed on the heels of the renewal of her mindset.   With Paraklete by her side, reminding her that she was not a pauper, but a royal Princess, she slowly learned what her new identity truly was, and learned to act according to who she now was.

<title>Words for the Week Christian Podcast: From One Pumpkin to Another, by Penny Haynes of 1st Podcast Publishing</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=28803</link>
<description><![CDATA[<h3><a href="http://quikonnex.com/search/displayenc_pop.php?itemid=28803" target="blank">Click here to listen to the podcast.</a></h3>In today's <a href="http://www.Christian-podcast.com" target="_blank">Christian podcast</a>, <a href="http://www.WordsOfTheWeek.com" target="_blank">Words of the Week</a> will share a short comparison about Christians and pumpkins, and how much we are alike.
<BR><BR>
<img src="http://www.digitalbusinessbooks.com/Podcasts/Pumpkins.jpg" align="center">
<BR><BR>
Being a Christian is like being a pumpkin.  God lifts you up, takes you in, and washes all the dirt off of you.   He opens you up, touches you deep inside and scoops out all the yucky stuff-- including the seeds of doubt, hate, greed, etc. Then He carves you a new smiling face and puts His light inside you to shine for all the world to see.  This was passed on to me from another pumpkin.  I'm  sending this to all the pumpkins in my patch. Happy Fall!

<p class="MsoNormal">With the school year already here and as a Christian parent
who home schools a certain scripture verse always comes to mind but more so
during this time of year that I wanted to share with you.<br />
<br />
<i>Deuteronomy 6:5-9 - Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all
your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today
are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when
you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when
you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
I pray this is my heart always and yours as well so we may train our children
up in the Lord, making a difference in their lives and societies as well.</p>

This weeks Words for the Week I bring you Christian Women‚Äôs Resources featured Kingdom Builder for the month of August.  The theme for this month is on ‚ÄúPraise and Worship‚Äù and Pam Mendelson of <a href="http://www.northwoodsgiftemporium.com">www.northwoodsgiftemporium.com </a> has many great reasons to praise and worship God but two main reasons are her son and daughter whom her and her husband were foster parents for but have since adopted them into their family.
Hear how God has done many miracles in their lives and how they continue to bless single mothers and children out there by continuing to meet a need out there for foster parents.</p>
