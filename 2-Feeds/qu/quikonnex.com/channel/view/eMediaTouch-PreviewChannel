<title>Brain Storm Business Podcast: Lessons Learned from Steve Martin, sponsored by Commercial Creation Center</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=33055</link>
<description><![CDATA[  <p><strong>In today's </strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.brainstormpodcast.com" title="Brain Storm! Podcast"><strong>Brain Storm! 
Business Podcast</strong></a><strong>, we will look at lessons learned from the 
autobiography of Steve Martin.</strong></p>
<p>I have a love for biographies, either business or celebrity.  I don't go 
after current pop-icons, but older entertainers who have been around the block.  
Their lives offer lessons anyone can learn from, and I realized last night, that 
they offer great business lessons as well.  </p>
<p><strong>Entertainers are Entrepreneurs too.</strong></p>
<p>If you think about it, they are in the business of promoting themselves.  
That is what an entrepreneur does as well.  We promote our product, service and 
ourself (if we're smart).  Well, Steve Martin's autobiography has some great 
lessons in patience, persistence and innovation - the same things that make a 
great business person. </p>
<p><strong>These are 5 lessons you can learn, and in the podcast, I go into 
details of Martin's life and how we can apply these lessons to our own 
businesses:</strong></p>
<ol><li>There are NO overnight successes.
</li><li>Timing is everything.
</li><li>We start by borrowing, but become successful by innovating.
</li><li>Sometimes the best ideas arise out of problems.
</li><li>Sometimes the best ideas need to be dropped.</li></ol>
<p><strong>I'd love to hear feedback from you.</strong>  I've added the podcast 
to FriendFeed because it allows commenting, and have posted a place for you to 
comment on episodes at <a href="http://www.brainstormbusinesspodcast.com/">http://www.BrainStormBusinessPodcast.com</a>. 
Let's see how it works! </p>

<title>Brain Storm Business Podcast, Obama Marketing and ZipCar Strategies, sponsored by Commercial Creation Center</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=32935</link>
<description><![CDATA[
  <div style="display: block; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 2px; text-align: left;" id="Content_0">
<p>In today's <a href="http://www.brainstormbusinesspodcast.com" target="_blank">Brain Storm! Business Podcast</a>, we will discuss (in passing) 
Obama's flawless marketing campaign, as well as ZipCar's 7 point strategy to 
break out of the old mold and move from $2 million to $100 million in revenues. 
</p>
<p>As I said, I only mention Obama's campaign in passing, but thought it 
deserved mention.  A vague but energizing word (Change), celebrity endorsements, 
the use of social media, and the targeting of an untapped generation of 
typically unmotivated (and uninformed) voters worked wonders. </p>
<p>As for ZipCar, this podcast is based on an article from one of my 2 favorite 
magazines (Fast Company and Inc).  You can find it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080301/how-fast-can-this-thing-go-anyway.html"><font color="#3b5998"><span>http://www.inc.com/magazin</span></font><span>e/20080301/how-fast-can-th</span>is-thing-go-anyway.html</a> to 
read the details for yourself.  I love stories that detail the exact steps 
people have taken to build or improve a business (or to ruin it, so we can learn 
our lessons through them). </p>
<p>The ideas that I took away with me included focusing on a small target area 
and perfecting your business there before expanding.  Get it right, then 
duplicate it in other areas.  Don't go for funding until you've got something 
solid. I also love the tweeks they applied to better market to different areas, 
and how they kept their clientele (and the client's desired result from using 
their service) in mind, and made changes accordingly.  Best of all, they went 
after a target market NO car rental company in their right mind wanted, and got 
someone else to cover the risk factor for them! </p>
<p>I'd love to hear from you regarding which of these 7 strategic steps could 
you apply first?  How could you apply it?  (And WILL you apply it???)  Let me 
know by sending me an email at <a href="mailto:penny@1stpod.com">penny@1stpod.com</a>.  Until then, have a great 
week! </p>

<p>In today's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brainstormbusinesspodcast.com" title="Brain Storm! Business Podcast">Brain Storm! 
Business Podcast</a>, we will talk about the cover story of Inc. magazine - 
Kevin Rose of Digg, Pownce &amp; Revision3.  He is the media mogul of the 
future, or so they say.  But what impresses people the most about him is his 
persona.  </p>
<p>He's accessible.  He drinks beer and parties with geeks.  He tells dirty 
jokes on internet tv. Or does he? </p>
<p>He admits that he has one persona for doing business, and another one for 
promoting business. In today's business podcast, we talk about YOUR business 
persona and mine.  The people who know me - long term clients - have one persona 
about me.  But I'm afraid I'm putting off another persona (one that may not be 
helping me) to everyone else. </p>
<p>I'd love to know what you think your persona is, what your customers say it 
is, and what you think it SHOULD be in order to best promote and build your 
business.  Email me at <a href="mailto:penny@1stpod.com">penny@1stpod.com</a>,

<description><![CDATA[  <p><strong>In today's </strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.BrainStormBusinessPodcast.com" title="Brain Storm Business Podcast: Lessons Learned from a Sprint Commercial, sponsored by Commercial Creation Center"><strong>Brain 
Storm! Business Podcast</strong></a><strong>, we will review the new Sprint 
Commercial and what they are doing DIFFERENT from all of the other mobile phone 
companies, and how we can apply it to our businesses.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Have you seen the black and white, simple commercial from 
Sprint</strong>, telling existing and potential customers that they can come in 
and have their phone explained to them?  Brilliant - they are actually 
acknowledging that the majority of their cell phone service users have NO CLUE 
what their phone does, and therefore wouldn't pay to use those services!  Nobody 
wants to buy what he doesn't know exists - so tell them what they are missing in 
hopes that they will buy it! </p>
<p><strong>The big things I focus on today are the different ways they are 
marketing.</strong>  Their choice of going black and white, their simplistic 
setting and message all reveal their recognition of their most neglected target 
market - the non-techies.  These people are probably like my mom, who only turns 
on her cell phone when she's out and it's an emergency.  That's it.  But what if 
she found out there were cool things to do on her phone?  She already spends 
hours using games on her computer - cause that's the ONLY thing that she can do 
easily. </p>
<p><strong>What are you doing differently to promote yourself, color and content 
wise.</strong>   Are you tailoring your message to your target market, or just 
trying to look like everyone else? Are you offering the human touch, as Sprint is 
doing, to make the difference in the sale and in customer satisfaction?  Are you 
reaching out to a new segment of the market who may be a little slower to 
respond, but whose sheer mass could make the investment of your time very 
worthwhile? </p>
<p><strong>Just some things to brainstorm about today.</strong>  If you'd like 
to <font style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">brainstorm with me about your own 
podcasts, the </font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.commercialcreationcenter.com" title="Commercial Creation Center - download it for free"><font style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Commercial Creation Center</font></a><font style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);"> is now offering weekly sessions about what to 
put in your podcast and how exactly to do it in audio and video.</font> We are 
also offering monthly how to sessions - all for members only, however. But if 
you need that accountability and creative brainstorming, as well as simple 
software to create your audio and video, that's what we're here for! </p>

<title>BrainStorm Business Podcast: Lessons Learned Amid Business Crises, sponsored by Commercial Creation Center</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=32640</link>
<description><![CDATA[  <p><strong>Hello <a target="_blank" href="http://www.BrainStormBusinessPodcast.com" title="Brain Storm Business Podcast, sponsored by Commercial Creation Center">Brain Storm 
Business Podcast</a> followers - if you are still out there.</strong>  No, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.PennyHaynes.com" title="Penny Haynes">Penny 
Haynes</a> is not dead - she has just had to switch hats from entrepreneur to 
geeky programmer for the last several months.  Today she has been liberated as 
the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.CommercialCreationCenter.com" title="Commercial Creation Center">Commercial Creation 
Center</a> multimedia production software went public.  So now I'm back to doing 
the thing I love to do - like podcasting and learning about business ideas and 
successes! </p>
<p><strong>Brief review of what has happened over the past 4 months</strong>:  
my programmers abandoned me mid-project, leaving me with promises I had made to 
others regarding availability. My immediate reaction was to have a panic attack 
and breathe into a paper bag.  My other strategy was not getting out of bed out 
of sheer terror of what other bad news the day would bring. </p>
<p><strong>But eventually, I had to push myself beyond my fears and pick up the 
project</strong>, re-learn VB6, learn php and mySQL, learn about Active X 
programs, and learn more about xml.  It has been horribly challenging, but in 
the end, I have to say it was worth it.  Now, I have more valuable skills and 
basically the ability to program whatever the heck I dream of - without hiring 
someone else.  Of course, I do have a &quot;Technical Advisor&quot; whom I refer to as 
Yoda, without whom I never could have learned as fast, nor could have dealt with 
the technical support issues.  YODA rules! </p>
<p><strong>So today's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesspodcasting.info" title="Business Podcast">business podcast </a>is 
just a quick re-introduction of myself to you</strong>, sharing a few lessons 
learned, and the public intention to return to podcasting now that I have the 
time to do so.  Also, I want you to know that we'll be permanently moving the 
Brain Storm podcast RSS feed.  It will all go through FeedBurner at <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brainstormbusinesspodcast">http://feeds.feedburner.com/brainstormbusinesspodcast</a>.  
I've had that feed for a while and put the quikonnex feed through it.  Now, my 
new feed is coming off of one of my Online Community Magazines (<a href="http://www.allbusinessmagazine.com/">http://www.AllBusinessMagazine.com</a>) 
- so I'll assign it to Feedburner. </p>
<p>Well, that's all for today.  I'm looking forward to reviewing my stack of 
business magazines and sharing with you the cool stuff that we can all learn 
from. </p>

<title>Brain Storm! Business Podcast:  Getting Real - Simplify Your Business, Sponsored by Online Community Magazines</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=30943</link>
<description><![CDATA[<b>In today's <a href="http://www.brainstormbusinesspodcast.com" target="_blank">Brain Storm! Business Podcast</a>, we will discuss an online book by <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php" target="_blank">37Signals called Getting Real</a> and how to apply some of their concepts to our own businesses.</b>
<BR><BR>
My Argentinian programmer who is working on the Commercial Creation Center suggested that I read this book.  I think he was trying to tell me something.  I am always tempted to add more things to my software. This book tells me less is more - as long as it meets the customers' needs.
<BR><BR>
<b>Simplify and Focus is the first order of business.</b>
<BR><BR>
Don't plan on doing everything - plan on doing one thing very well. "Underdo your competition" is a unique statement, but they make a very good case for it, as we will discuss. 
<BR><BR>
<b>What exactly IS your problem?</b>
<BR><BR>
Once upon a time, most of us started our business because there was a need - either we had a need, or someone else around us had a need. I don't mean just a need for money.  We found something that met a need, became passionate about it, and built a business around it.  It might be programming, nutritional supplements, multimedia, online marketing, but whatever it was, it convinced you that it was a viable the answer to some problem.
<BR><BR>
<b>Are you still focused on solving that problem?</b>
<BR><BR>
There is a saying among Christians: If you feel far away from God, you're the one that moved. If you feel displaced or far away from where you started in your business, maybe you have moved.  Maybe you need to revisit the original problem and restructure your business products and services so they are back in alignment with the problem.
<BR><BR>
<b>I love this one: Have An Enemy.</b>
<BR><BR>
37 Signals designed a project management software. The software everyone else connected with PM was MS Project.  So they decided that Basecamp, their software, would be the ANTI-Project.  It would not be anything like it in its complexity or it methodology. Building upon that nemesis, they created a Writeboard that had 100,000 installations in 3 months.  I don't mind those numbers.
<BR><BR>
<b>So, where can you simplify your products and services so that they can once again solve that initial problem? And what competitor in your industry can you find as an example of what you are NOT trying to do?</b>
<BR><BR>
My Commercial Creation Center's screen recorder is an ANTI-Camtasia (a tool I dearly love, but is way too complicated for every day people).  The same with our audio recorder and mixer.  It is an ANTI-SoundForge or Audacity, or even my beloved WavePad.  Less options (and things to confuse the user), simpler and easier interface, and an end product that can be used just as well for most of their purposes.
<BR><BR>
Let me know what you think about today's brainstorming session, and if you realized some areas where you could improve.  Until next week...

<description><![CDATA[
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">In today's <a href="http://www.brainstormbusinesspodcast.com">Brain Storm! Business Podcast</a>, we will discuss different strategies to determine and implement pricing for your products and services.</p>I first explain the problems I have been (and am continuing to) endure with my USB microphone.  Ear pieces move, and despite packing tape, still cause clicking and clacking.  Just shoot me now.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">We discuss the different options in pricing and how pricing is a part of your marketing strategy.  </span><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><br />Determining your target market and competition (or lack thereof) figure in, as well as segmenting your target markets regarding what they need from you and what they are willing to pay. Thanks to Joel Spolsky and a December 2004 article, we learn a lot about economics and why businesses price the same product different ways. Link to Joel's article is here: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html</a><br /><br /><p style="font-weight: bold;">We also discuss real life business examples, including lessons learned on my trip to Six Flags (I learned so much, I should have considered that a business trip).</p><p>From coupons and rebates to discounts and membership sites, we touch on it all, and if you want to learn more, you'll have to listen to the <a href="http://www.businesspodcasting.info">business podcast</a>! :)</p><a href="http://www.PennyHaynes.com">Penny Haynes</a>, <a href="http://www.OnlineCommunityMagazines.com">Online Community Magazines</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.1stPodcastPublishing.com">1st Podcast Publishing</a><br /><a href="http://quikonnex.com/channel/item/30745"> [COMMENT]</a>]]></description>

<h3>Click here to listen to the podcast.</h3></a> <span style="font-weight: bold;">In today's <a href="http://www.brainstormbusinesspodcast.com">Brain Storm! Business Podcast</a>, we will discuss SalesConX with its CEO, Evan Sohn, and how you can, in a very straight-forward manner, buy and sell introductions to the people you need to contact.</span><br /><p>I was introduced to SalesConX by the owner of a business opportunity directory.  She had signed up for the affiliate program and we were all offered a $25 credit.  I figured &quot;Why not try it.&quot;  So far, I'm glad I did.</p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ever want to find your perfect target market, but have no clue how to do that?</span>  <br /><br />With SalesConX, you write out a detailed description of who you want an introduction to, put a price on that introduction, and also possibly a bonus price if the introduction leads to a closed sale.  Or, if you know of someone who needs particular services or products, you can post their need and offer to sell someone an introduction to that person.  Of course, you are not to blindside people you know by sending strangers to them - you discuss the connection with your contact and see if they are interested.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">You get to be the &quot;Go To&quot; guy for all of your clients.</span><br /><br />As we've talked about before, being the person your clients turn to for any of their needs can be a huge differentiating factor between you and your competitors.  SalesConX lets you find other people who can help your clients in non-competitive ways.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hitting Singles, Aim-Fire, and Shouting Out the Window</span><br /><br />Evan Sohn discusses the challenges he is facing with <a href="http://www.SalesConX.com">SalesConX</a>, and also what he has learned during his 5 start-up career.  We talk about endurance, commitment, risk taking, changing your goals and paying the right person for the right warm introduction.  I think you'll learn a lot, be encouraged and challenged, and possibly find a great place to find leads for your business as well.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.PennyHaynes.com">Penny Haynes</a>, <a href="http://www.OnlineCommunityMagazines.com">Online Community Magazines</a><br /><a href="http://quikonnex.com/channel/item/30609"> [COMMENT]</a>]]></description>

The ability to see flash based video on our cell phones.  What will you do to apply that knowledge to your own business?  How about putting flash based audio and video on your website.<br /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">YouTube is making it easier to add video to your website. </span> You can now have a YouTube page on your website if you can have programmers use their API to create it.
