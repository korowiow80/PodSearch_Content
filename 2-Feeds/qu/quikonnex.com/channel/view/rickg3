<title>Where are APR on Credit Cards</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=35589</link>
<description><![CDATA[So you thought that the hight APR on a credit card is capped at 29.9%. Even at 29.9 that's no joke...ouch!<br />
<p><A HREF="http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/28/pf/credit_cards_interest_rates/index.htm">NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Interest rates are now hovering near record highs, at an average rate of 14.72%..</A> And if your credit is bad enough, you could even end up with a rate as high as 59.9% APR. If that is not startling enough ...In fact, First Premier Bank offers a Gold MasterCard with a whopping 59.9% rate for those people with "less than perfect credit", according to its website. And that rate is actually down from the 79.9% rate it originally charged.<a href="http://quikonnex.com/channel/item/35589">[READ MORE]</a> <a href="http://quikonnex.com/channel/item/35589"> [COMMENT]</a>]]></description>

<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=35572</link>
<description><![CDATA[There is more that a 79.9% A.P.R. to be informed about. The goal is to get what ever pennies you have left in your wallet with goodies you really don't need or might not even be able to access..read the fine print. There is little difference between the best or the worst credit card.<br />
<A HREF="http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeting/article/111836/the-worst-and-best-credit-cards-of-2010"><B>The Worst and Best Credit Cards of 2010</B></A><BR>by Jennifer Saranow Schultz<br />
<BR>Friday, January 14, 2011<br />
<P>The editors of credit card comparison site CardRatings.com recently announced their take on the worst and best credit cards of 2010.<br />
<P>The cards rated the worst included those with high rates, high fees and little disclosure while those rated the best "bucked a trend toward fewer rewards and higher fees" while offering " value, service, and convenience."<br />
<P>So which cards made the cut?<a href="http://quikonnex.com/channel/item/35572">[READ MORE]</a> <a href="http://quikonnex.com/channel/item/35572"> [COMMENT]</a>]]></description>

<title>Fair Debt litigation growing into big business</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=35433</link>
<description><![CDATA[Toward the end of this article titled <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/aug/05/fair-debt-litigation-growing-big-business/">Fair Debt litigation growing into big business</a> there is this statement....<br />
<br>“I wish I could tell you a great story about how my mother was driven to madness by a debt collector,” Krohn said with a laugh. “But I can’t. I love what I do, and I don’t mind calling it a business.” <br />
<p>I don't mind any one making a buck and I am glad to hear that a small part of the legal profession (attorneys) are coming to the defense of folk harassed by 3rd Part Debt Collectors. <br />
<p>The problem as I see it is the the entire economic system is bankrupt and corrupt. If you even listen to the major media they have called it a giant ponsi scheme. <a href="http://quikonnex.com/channel/item/35433">[READ MORE]</a> <a href="http://quikonnex.com/channel/item/35433"> [COMMENT]</a>]]></description>

<title>Get Out Of Debt Whether You Think the U.S. A. Is In Recession Or Depression.</title>
<link>http://quikonnex.com/channel/link.php?id=35416</link>
<description><![CDATA[Economists date the Depression somewhat differently. They usually make a distinction between recession and depression. They use the concept of recession much more than they use the concept of depression. A recession is a period in which economic activity is receding or falling, while a depression is a period in which it is depressed below some level. Ha interesting ....some Level!<br />
<P>At the worst point of the Great Depression, in 1933, one in four Americans who wanted to work was unable to find a job. During the Depression unemployment rates skyrocketed, leading to massive homelessness and increased poverty rates. Some figures put the height of unemployment at nearly 25 percent during the 1930s Further, it was not until 1941, when World War II was underway, that the official unemployment rate finally fell below 10%. <br />
