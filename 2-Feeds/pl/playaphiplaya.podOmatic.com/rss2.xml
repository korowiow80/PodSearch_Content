                                Chilltadis before you step out for a nightcap. That's wassup [sic]. This podcast features a spotlighted jam by The L.I.U. Khalfani and Mack-a-Damion. A must listen. Also some Sleepy Brown and J*Davey. Oh, and the pic? &quot;Maria La Dominicana&quot; (she made sure I said it like that, lol), a good friend of the show, chillaxin before our nightcap with Candy (who is microphone shy). Oh, and you win, I do like Silver Oak wine. How can I not? Always on point when she steps out, too. Indeed. She wants the Playa Phi Playamate of the year award. You be the judge. Maria, I'm feelin' that Playa Phi Playa Purple. Playa Phi Playa is the best at what we do. Subscribe!!! Stay playa, Playa Phi Playa

A gift from us to you. Here's a fresh new podcast right out of the box. See, smells new and everything! Louis jams a few old and new tracks. Don't forget to support your favorite podcast by copping these tunes below (it's a compilation of some of our favorite songs from previous podcasts)! Big things are on the horizon, please bear with us as there will be changes in the site over the next few weeks and months... Late. &lt;/font&gt;

      <title>New Al Green! Lay It Down Album!!</title>

                                You have to subscribe. If you don't subscribe, we don't survive. Chillaxtadis with Playa Phi Playa as we jam a few from the new Al Green album (with some other tunes too). Al's album was worked on by ?uestlove (of The Roots), James Poyser, Anthony Hamilton, and on and on. It's definitely worth picking up on May 27th. Louis chillax's with his friend (actually old school ex-girlfriend) &quot;Lyric&quot;. They chit-chat about this and that, and jam to some &quot;Al&quot; in the back. You can't miss this one.  Playa Phi Playa y'all! Is Frankie Beverly Feat. Maze next!?!?!

      <title>Plumskinzz  with a Winebuzz</title>

                &lt;p&gt;Playa Phi Playa is a secret society, all we ask is trust! LOL. We play two of Louis' faves off of the new Mint Condition album. Seems that the label dropped the ball on picking a decent lead single. Ah, well, what's new with that? Louis questions his guest about whether she knows what plumskinzz are, and many other interesting etceteras...Louis promises that the next podcast is about an hour long to make up for this 30 minute joint. Further, all web graphic designers and advertisers seeking to work with us send inquiries/examples/kits to Playaphiplayaradio@gmail.com, don't send anything to the podomatic email... Also, everyone trying to send donations to the podomatic address will hit a dead end. Send those to the gmail address now as well, via paypal. Be easier! Happy 4/20 to the Mary Jane lovers across the globe! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Playa Phi Playamate Series: My Thai's for Lunch</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/16584/600x600_835474.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first installment in what will be the Playa Phi Playamate Series. The lovely and sexy Thai joins Louis for an interesting evening that involves: new music, a kitchen table, alcohol, and little to no inhibition! No one can do it like Playa Phi Playa. There are other podcasts, but they just can't do it like this. We're the #1 MP3 Playas in the podcast game. Special thanks goes out to RapReviews.com for showing love with their audio ad, be sure to check them out. I've been up on them for years. Trust. Is Thai the &quot;Playa Phi Playamate of the Year&quot;?  
&lt;p&gt;I know it's been a long time. But it sounds like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You. Have. Been. Cured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing further.&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry it took so long. Playa Phi Playa is cleaning house to bring you something different this year. Hold tight! Here is the continuation of the Cheaters Podcast. Giselle and Alix continue with their take on things, while we play the role. Playtadis.  We'll see you in March. BTW, I think this picture is from Louis' personal archives. Louis, we have alot of questions for you, so get ready to explain this one! Expect some big changes soon, (like a female co-host?) maybe some musical chairs... Who knows... We just have to keep things Playa Phi Playa.

Please don't handcuff Louis (again) if it's not to your standards. Er, on second thought, I don't think Louis would mind that at all.

Spending more on gadgets and jewelry than you anticipated, huh? Well, here is some digital love and computer game for all you Mp3 Playas out there. Merry Xmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa, or whatever it is that you celebrate (or even if it's just another couple days to you). Here, take this, a shiny new podcast fresh out of the box. Just for you. Don't ever say we never gave you anything! It's been a great year. So, we'll toast to 2008 being even better (this we can assure you). Drink of the month: Crown Royal &amp; Eggnog (or your favorite cognac, whiskey, brandy &amp; eggnog)...  See you on the first day of 2008. Stay tuned, we do upgrade this one. Also, right before our annual Valentine's Day show we drop the Cheaters Series! You won't want to sleep on the next month of Playa Phi!!! 

&lt;p&gt;P.S. All I want for Xmas is the new Nokia N810... Hint, mutha-effin' hint! LOL, sike! I'm buying that ish for myself! Get creative and think of something else...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear My Dear: Chillaxtadis!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But Playaphiplaya.net got it's hands on it just for you. We will play all of the best of's from the album (which is basically the whole damn album, but time won't permit it). Louis is also going solo on this podcast, with a special guest this evening, by the name of Lesly. Expect sparks to fly, or things to pop off, or a Crown Royal on ice ending at least? You never know. Listen and find out. You can download the full Jill Scott album at the following link as well. 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediafire.com/?4mddlsx48qv&quot;&gt;Jill Scott's The Real Thing: Words and Sounds Vol. 3&lt;/a&gt;... Much respect to Jill, make sure you buy her album on the 25th as well. Plenty of people will be pissed off if I post this and you don't go and cop it. Playaphiplaya forever. Also, expect the &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; compilation to be posted on Nov. 15 as well. It will be in mpFREE format!!!! Just for you. Yours truly, and most especially. --Louis

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color= &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;Edit (Sept. 25)-- ** Album Link is now unavailable. For future reference, get it while it's hot and fresh. Or, you might not get it at all! Sorry, ONLY SUBSCRIBERS GET IT FIRST. Everyone else just gets the luck of the draw. So HURRY AND SUBSCRIBE! Take your pick how in the menu to the right! Trust we have more exclusives coming, don't be left out again!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <itunes:summary>This album doesn't even come out for another 10 days (Sept. 25th). But Playaphiplaya.net got it's hands on it just for you. We will play all of the best of's from the album (which is basically the whole damn album, but time won't permit it). Louis is also going solo on this podcast, with a special guest this evening, by the name of Lesly. Expect sparks to fly, or things to pop off, or a Crown Royal on ice ending at least? You never know. Listen and find out. You can download the full Jill Scott album at the following link as well. 
Jill Scott's The Real Thing: Words and Sounds Vol. 3... Much respect to Jill, make sure you buy her album on the 25th as well. Plenty of people will be pissed off if I post this and you don't go and cop it. Playaphiplaya forever. Also, expect the &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; compilation to be posted on Nov. 15 as well. It will be in mpFREE format!!!! Just for you. Yours truly, and most especially. --Louis

Edit (Sept. 25)-- ** Album Link is now unavailable. For future reference, get it while it's hot and fresh. Or, you might not get it at all! Sorry, ONLY SUBSCRIBERS GET IT FIRST. Everyone else just gets the luck of the draw. So HURRY AND SUBSCRIBE! Take your pick how in the menu to the right! Trust we have more exclusives coming, don't be left out again!</itunes:summary>

Keep telling a friend to tell a friend, and we can start doing this every week. This show 
was inspired by Bianca Degroat. Google that... Something about her had LiuS dedicating a 
song to her on the podcast! So, Bianca if (or when) you see this hit us up. We'd (or more 
specifically, LiuS) would love to hear from you, lol!  Also, thanks to everyone 
for showing love in the comments and emails. There is no Playa Phi Playa without you. 
Maybe we might get LiuS to show his face in a few pics. Oh and to SmoochezfromFarRockaway, LiuS is 
indeed a bachelor (a very eligible one). To Allison, You(Genious) hopes you're enjoying &quot;Sex on a Spoon&quot;.
Anyone else have a special request or shouts? Send it to: playaphiplaya@podomatic.com. 
Next podcast, we're stepping out. Stay tuned ta dis to find out what that means. In the meantime, 
if you are out there just listening to this podcast and you haven't subscribed, &quot;Shame on you&quot;... 
Subscribe through a podcatcher (itunes, etc.)... Let us know you're out there. Then tell a friend, and tell 
them to tell one too. See you in the next one.  WWW.PLAYAPHIPLAYA.NET
