        <title>Planet of the Grapes Radio: Comedy Radio in Hyper-Reality</title>
        <description>Don&apos;t you wish the world were a little stranger?  Then tune in to Planet of the Grapes Radio, where the border between reality and the surreal disappears.  Join the hosts of POTG Radio as they speak to their ludicrous, opinionated, and sexually ambiguous line of callers.  Discover the grueling occupation of The Afterbirth Fairy, why harlequins and motorcycle gangs hate each other, and who owns real estate in the Sphinx&apos;s nostrils.  Through their exclusive callers, POTG Radio makes the universe a much bigger and livelier place. It&apos;s absurd, sick, random humor at its finest.  Haven&apos;t you heard? www.planetofthegrapes.com<br />Also check out the vidcast slideshow that wraps up each months Planet of the Grapes NYC bathroom reviews, narrated by POTG Radio callers! Find it on iTunes at "Planet of the Grapes Bathroom Review"</description>
