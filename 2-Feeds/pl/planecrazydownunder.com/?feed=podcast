Each segment visits multiple countries, allowing airlines &#038; invited guests to get up close to the advanced new airliner. Perhaps saving the best for last, the DreamTour came to the Dreamtime during it's 7th segment. Team PCDU were invited by Qantas &#038; Jetstar to join the DreamTour in Melbourne. This "quick cast" episode features our interview recorded in Melbourne with Captain Todd Abraham, a Boeing technical pilot flying the 787 on segment #7. <span style="color:#777"> . . . &#8594; Read More: <a href="http://www.planecrazydownunder.com/2012/05/30/pcdu-episode-88-dreamtime/">PCDU Episode 88: Dreamtime</a></span>]]></description>

		<itunes:summary>There&#039;s been a few delays in getting our first episode for 2012 out but what can you expect with the Summer heat to enjoy and games of Cricket to watch (or avoid :). It is with Cricket in mind that our very own Infrequent Flyer, Anthony Simmons, took some time out of his European adventures to visit the Imperial War Museum at Duxford (home of the Duxford Aviation Society) at the time of their last flying display for 2011, a day that saw some 16,000 people come to watch the show!

The focus of this flying display was the Korean War and Anthony was able to find out that the &quot;Forgotten War&quot; was about so much more than episodes of M*A*S*H:
Anthony chats with Lt Don Reed (ret), a 90 year old veteran of the conflict who flew with the Fleet Air Arm as an observer on Fireflies and as a Seafire pilot 
He then meets Esther Blaine, the PR Manager, for a discussion on:
The history of the Duxford site
The educational programmes the IWM provides
The new &quot;Airspace&quot; display
The IWM&#039;s plans for the future 
Anthony is also able to further one-up Steve &amp; Grant by noting that he&#039;s been through a Vickers Viscount, DeHavilland Comet and Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde as well as getting up close with a Lancaster and Tigermoth. What, us, jealous??? :) 
Anthony wraps it up by interviewing Mark Linney from the Golden Apple Trust about their flying F86A, the only one of its kind still flying. They chat about:
The history of this particular aircraft
Mark&#039;s career as a pilot in the RAF flying the Tornado GR1, instructing on the Hawk and then winding up on the Harrier. After the RAF he&#039;s now flying 747s, A340-600s and, of course, the F86
They then chat about the F86&#039;s development, handling and history

The episode wraps up with Steve &amp; Anthony having a quick review of the content &amp; Anthony&#039;s experience at Duxford.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>All good things must come to an end and so too must the year 2011. It has been an amazing year of growth for PCDU as we&#039;ve covered Avalon 2011, NatFly 2011 and Oshkosh 2011 along with a number of major events (eg: Qantas grounding) and added some new voices to the team.

		<itunes:summary>Steve&#039;s finally picked up his instructor&#039;s rating although it&#039;s in trains, not aircraft, but don&#039;t worry, we&#039;re not switching the show over to Train Crazy Down Under :)

Once again we&#039;re joined by Kathy Mexted and this time we&#039;re discussing what&#039;s involved in being an Ag Pilot and how the industry has developed here in Australia. We then switch to Kathy&#039;s interview with Georgia Maxwell in Gunnedah. Georgia is the first female ag pilot in Australia qualified to fly the Air Tractor 802 with Pay&#039;s Air Service. Georgia discusses what it&#039;s like working in the Aerial Application world (aka being an Ag Pilot).

After the interview we talk about the Aerial Agricultural Association of Australia and how the season is booming following the breaking of the drought. Anthony Crichton-Browne joins us to continue talking about Ag pilots &amp; the nature of their work. 

Anthony has recently been at Red Baron Australia&#039;s open day chatting with Joel Haski and the guys from Combat Dragon who are now basing their A37 at Red Baron&#039;s hangar. We get to sit in on a Combat Dragon briefing, then listen to the sound of the A37 starting its engines before discussing the A37&#039;s typical departure from Bankstown (YSBK).

We then play Anthony&#039;s chat with Joel Haski about the latest developments at Red Baron and their new hangar facility. Anthony talks briefly with Jeff from Combat Dragon about their missions and working with Red Baron. You can hear more about Combat Dragon from an interview Anthony had with them in episode 2 of his podcast, Flying Ant. 

Next up, Pieter Johnson from XTP Media in the UK takes time out from his &quot;Across the Pond&quot; segment in the Airplane Geeks to bring us his first &quot;From Up Here to Down There&quot; report. In today&#039;s report, he provides an interview with Matt Falcus about his Far East and Australasia airport spotting guide. If you&#039;re spotting in the Asia/Pacific area, you should check out Matt&#039;s book.

Having listened to Pieter&#039;s chat with Matt, Anthony chats with us about a pilot&#039;s view of the &#039;plane spotters&#039; he sees at most of the major Australian airports. 

After the break, we return to Grant&#039;s chat with Geoff Morrison from GT Gyroplanes at Echuca. We talk about Geoff&#039;s background in aviation in New Zealand hunting deer &amp; working on warbirds before he came over to Australia to work on gyroplanes with his brother Alistair. After that we get into a discussion about gyroplanes in general, the Australian Sports Rotorcraft Association (ASRA) and their Kruza gyroplane in particular. 

We then have a discussion about gyrocopters before bringing Pieter Johnson back onto the show to chat with us about his background in aviation, his goals for linking Australian/NZ flying with the UK and his interview with his father. 

Moving onto Listener Mail, we have:
Andrew Brown from the UK talking about our Qantas Grounding episode
Voice mail from Ian Kershaw in Canada
Chris Howard-Bath who likes the C130 &amp; works with ATC Ben
Peter Anderson talks about our website


If you want us to send you a CD copy of our content, please send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to:

Don&#039;t forget about our Aus Air Services + PCDU BBQ &amp; Fly In on December 17th at Tooradin Airport (YTDN). Come on down and say HI, folks :)

		<itunes:summary>Many people in Australia know of Tim Smith, a Melbourne comedian who&#039;s worked on television and in radio for years. What many people don&#039;t know is that Tim is a pilot who is working towards his goal of running charter operations taking people around Australia, visiting places many folks have never heard of let alone visited.

We were fortunate enough to get some time chatting with Tim in one of the briefing rooms at Moorabbin Flying Services where we had a great time talking about a variety of topics, including:
The number of people in radio who have their pilots license
The difficulties of juggling radio work with learning to fly &amp; the challenge of time management
What influenced him to become a pilot
How flying saved his life
Amusing flying stories about instructors, examiners and experiences
Aircraft he&#039;s flown and ratings he has, including a great look at glass cockpits vs steam gauge
His interest in flying people around Australia on charter work, going to places like Fraser Island, Daly Waters, Alice Springs, Darwin, Birdsville, etc
How he&#039;s often doing lots of exploring from the air &amp; going to out of the way places &amp; experiencing the outback scenery &amp; friendliness
Aviation TV shows in Australia
The impact of government legislation and ideas to get more people flying
Flying in New Zealand


It&#039;s a great chat and we&#039;re very happy that Tim was able to give us so much of his time on the AFL Grand Final day (when almost the whole of Victoria and most of the rest of Australia stop to watch football).

You can find Tim online at:
His home page: TimSmith.com.au
The Discover Downunder TV show
At the agents EntertainOZ and Profile Talent

		<itunes:summary>Almost one year after the QF32 incident, Qantas is again in the news around the world and for a short time again appeared to be on the brink of a major disaster. At 5pm on Saturday the 29th of October, Alan Joyce (CEO of Qantas) announced that he &amp; the board of directors had decided to ground all of Qantas&#039; domestic &amp; international flights (about 108 aircraft). This unprecedented step disrupted the travel plans of almost 70,000 passengers in order to avoid a &quot;death by a thousand paper cuts&quot; due to ongoing damage from industrial disputes with three unions. 

The three unions represented the pilots, engineers and baggage handlers working for Qantas&#039; &quot;mainline&quot; operations. The Jetstar, QantasLink and JetConnect operations were not involved in the grounding.

We have assembled a collection of discussions with a number of people involved in the disputes or monitoring it from the outside. It is our intention that we provide you with an overview of what has happened, why it happened and where things might go from here. Unlike the commercial broadcast media, our time is not rigidly controlled so our guests are able to take their time to explain their views &amp; concerns without being restricted to sound bites.

While we also express our own views during this episode, we have tried to present enough information for you to get a better understanding of the situation &amp; form your own decisions.

The discussions in this episode include:
Captain Richard Woodward, Vice President of the Australian &amp; International Pilots Association (AIPA)
Warren Truss, leader of the National Party and Shadow Minister for Infrastructure and Transport
Steve Purvinas, Federal Secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA)
Independent Senator Nick Xenophon from South Australia
Dick Smith, an entrepreneur, pilot and past chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Civil Aviation &amp; Safety Authority (CASA) 
Shashank Nigam from Simpliflying, a consultancy specialising in aviation branding &amp; social media
Ben Sandilands from the Plane Talking blog &amp; Will Horton from the Centre for Aviation, both aviation journalists focusing on the Australasian market


We&#039;d also like to thank Colin Lipiatt, the Manager of Coporate Communications at Virgin Australia, for taking the time to chat with us about their ability to quickly respond with extra capacity to help affected travellers. While we couldn&#039;t include him in the show, he provided plenty of useful information for us.

While putting this episode together we did attempt to contact Qantas&#039; media department to arrange a representative who could talk to us about the items raised during the discussions listed above. Unfortunately we did not hear back from them and can only assume that, like Anthony Albanese (Minister for Infrastructure &amp; Transport), they were too busy dealing with the big issues and the mainstream media to spare any time for us.

We trust that you&#039;ll enjoy this special episode of content specifically covering the Qantas Grounding situation. It&#039;s been a marathon effort to arrange &amp; record the interviews then put it all together for you. It has certainly been educational &amp; eye opening for us as we discussed the issues with our guests, and that&#039;s got to be a good thing :)

	<itunes:subtitle>A few episodes ago we introduced Kathy Mexted as a new member our group of occasional PCDU contributors and this episode she&#039;s back with some great content. She recently took a few friends in a Bonanza out to Wilpena Pound in South Australia,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>A few episodes ago we introduced Kathy Mexted as a new member our group of occasional PCDU contributors and this episode she&#039;s back with some great content. She recently took a few friends in a Bonanza out to Wilpena Pound in South Australia, a trip that would usually take many days to achieve by road but, thanks to general aviation, only required two 90 minute flights to get there. Originally intended to be a trip to Ayers Rock, this adventure was trimmed down to something more manageable and a journey to just south of Lake Eyre was planned.

We spend a bit of time discussing the flight, the scenery, air sickness, some geology and what it was like loading four ladies into a high performance single then blasting off to out back of beyond. Kathy also discusses staying at Mungo Lodge, the Wilpena Pound Resort and Trevor Hancock, their tour guide while they were there.

While staying in outback South Australia, Kathy and her friends caught up with some of the pilots from Air Wilpena and recorded a discussion with them about their backgrounds, the flying they&#039;re doing and what it&#039;s like to be flying in outback Australia.

After this we play a few interviews from our recent visit to Coldstream Airport including:
A chat with Judy &amp; Andrew Doak, the owners of Coldstream Airport (YCEM)
Dr Bruce Searle, CEO of ACMA
Andrew Temby, aerobatic display pilot flying his Yak-52TW


We then move into reading some listener emails and discussing some future events on the calendar, including:
Keane Bourke is 12 years old &amp; wants to be an airline pilot
Ed Stubbs recently attended the SAAA fly-in at Langley Park in Perth
AusAirServices are having a Wings Night dinner on the 22nd October
Bas sent us information about the Port Augusta Open Day that&#039;s coming up
Moorabbin Flight Services are having their Wings Night dinner on November 19th
ErrolWi in NZ points us to a list of Kiwi aviation events at the ProBoards Calendar
We then cut to a discussion about the upcoming Holbrook Ultra Light Club&#039;s fly-in.

		<itunes:summary>Today we&#039;re joined by Anthony Crichton-Browne, a commercial airline pilot who also likes to take his Pitts Special out for a spin (and a few other fun manoeuvres :) In addition to chatting with Anthony, we also run a chat with Grant Piper (President of the Australian Aerobatic Club) about Australia&#039;s recent involvement in the World Aerobatic Championship, discuss aerobatics in general and also have a chat about the recent horrific tragedy at Reno Air Races where the highly modified P51 &quot;Galloping Ghost&quot; lost control and plowed into specators.

We start off by hanging out with Anthony and talking about his career in aviation and more, including:
He has an older brother who&#039;s also a pilot
He&#039;s from Western Australia, learning to fly at Jandakot in Perth
He did the usual hour building &amp; quickly found himself in a Cessna 310 then on to First Officer on a Brasillia before stepping up to Second Officer on 747-400, after which he proceeded to his current gig as First Officer on a 767
Anthony started flying aerobatics with friends and also scored a flight with Matt Hall
His aerobatic training really kicked in with a Pitts and he now has his own Pitts
We talk about G-Tolerance, G-LOC and beating the effects of high-G manoeuvres
We discuss the recent tragic accident at the Reno Air Races, including the NTSB&#039;s preliminary report &amp; talk further the effects of pulling-G&#039;s
A discussion about stalls that leads into how advanced training really helps dispel some of the many myths, how the stall stick position works and standard GFPT training vs advanced training by groups like Red Baron in Sydney (Hi Joel! :)


You can find Anthony on his Flying Ant Online website as well as following him on Twitter where he&#039;s known as AntCB. 


We then move into the interview that Steve &amp; Anthony recorded with Grant Piper, the President of the Australian Aerobatics Club, featuring:
An overview of aerobatic manoeuvre&#039;s
How aerobatic competitions are managed &amp; scored
Australia&#039;s return to the World Aerobatic Championship
How to improve the standard in Australia with coaching by current champs
Grant&#039;s career in aviation including his start in the RAAF
The benefits of including aeros in primary training


We then return to a chat with Anthony about:

The challenges of flying competition aerobatics
Standard aerobatic figures (loop, cuban-8, etc)
How scoring each manoeuvre starts at 10 points then deducts points for any errors
How it all has to look right from the ground
The issues in dealing with wind &amp; power
What is the aerobatic box
Types of propeller blades and their benefits (blade numbers, sizes, etc)


Finally we start to wrap it up with some listener mail:
Ian Allen from New Zealand sent us some great ideas for more Kiwi Content
Errol Cavit points us at a possible Kiwi aviation podcast
Don&#039;t forget to check out our Facebook page and our forums on Downwind

We then wind up with some shout outs:
Phil Unicomb from Action Aerobatics and Combat Dragon
Steve Tupper at the Airspeed Podcast who has a great new episode out on air show safety
The NSW Aerobatic Champs will be held at Temora on Friday 28th Oct to Monday 31st October with more information available at the Australian Aerobatic Club&#039;s web page</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We&#039;re joined by our mate Dan Morris from New Zealand to discuss some news from the Land of the Long White Cloud. Topics include:
Air Traffic Control in the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake, especially the problems they encountered due to centralising all area controllers in one location
How user fees in New Zealand have lead funding being removed for weather briefing service: pilots must now pay an annual fee to access the weather service
What the Air NZ Aviation Academy and student loan funding by the New Zealand government (which remains interest free if you stay in NZ) mean for flight training in NZ
Air New Zealand&#039;s latest earnings report
The rapidly approaching Flair 2011 industry innovation showcase &amp; airshow
The Will it Fly project that is working to produce a replica of the Pearse Flyer from 1903 with updates on the Will It Fly Facebook page


Next up, Steve travels back to his old high school to discover that it&#039;s a lot better than when he was there (and NOT just because his class photo has been hidden :) Thanks to Chris Barry at Brentwood Secondary College and our friends at Aus Air Services, kids at the school have the opportunity to learn to fly as part of their studies. Steve chats with Chris, Angelina from Aus Air Services and some of the kids about this fantastic project. 

Our final interview in this episode is a quick chat with Mark Pracy Sr from JetRide Australia and Pracy Racing as he gets ready to head to the 2011 Reno Air Races to fly his L39 low, fast &amp; turning left. We discuss what it&#039;s like to fly the course and how he&#039;s going about keeping himself ready for it.

We wrap up the episode with a quick chat about Dale Watson&#039;s Tiger Airways song on YouTube (thanks to Chris Fenlon for pointing us at it) and the fact that Tiger Airways are back flying, albeit at a reduced level. We also discuss how Crawford Rix was replaced by Tony Davis who is, in turn, leaving the airline shortly after working hard to bring it back from the brink.

Finally, we have some shoutouts, including:
Charlie Willwerth from the FlightTime Radio show is currently in the Mayo clinic under going chemotherapy to fight Leukemia - good luck &amp; get well quick, mate!
Zyola T Mix from the Mile High Flyers has spun off her own project, a podcast about women pilots called The BoXXoffice
The Uncontrolled Airspace podcast has just celebrated its five year anniversary on August 23rd! Woo hoo! Go guys! Congrats to Jack, Jeb &amp; Dave!
There&#039;s a new aviation podcast with us from Canada called Cleared Enroute with hosts Danny Vacar &amp; Chris Johnson (on Twitter as clearedenroute)
Jamie Dodson who writes the Nick Grant Adventures novels and sent us a couple of copies

From here Bas &amp; Grant got to join the Bonanzas to Oshkosh group and fly from Rockford up to Oshkosh on the Saturday, landing on RWY 36 where even two days before the official opening, the aircraft parking spaces were filling up and the airport was a hive of activity. On the Sunday Rob, David Vanderhoof, Dan Web, Steve and his friend Mike all arrived having driven up from Chicago. Joining our friends at Firebase MyTransponder / Camp Bacon we set up the tent and settled into life in Camp Scholler, which is definitely something to be experienced at least once (&amp; perhaps only once :)

Until we left on the Sunday at the end of the show, we were flat out experiencing the amazing sights, sounds &amp; people that make up Oshkosh. We discuss the highlights and talk about trying to take it all in before winding up by reviewing our departure, our returns to Australia (including Steve&#039;s flight with Milford from the FlightTime Radio show) and then our post-Oshkosh thoughts.

Following this we have a recording Steve &amp; Grant made with Rob Mark (also from CommAvia as well as JetWhine and the Airplane Geeks) before Steve presents an interview he recorded with Bill &amp; Earlene Hankins about Bill&#039;s time in Strategic Air Command. Towards the end of Bill&#039;s time with SAC he was a commander of a Titan Missile complex. While some of the chat can be like watching the movies Strategic Air Command or Gathering of Eagles, his descriptions of the Titan&#039;s launch environment are very much like those shown at the start of the movie WarGames.

It also turns out that Bill and Earlene hosted Steve when he was an exchange student and then again when he returned to the USA to complete his US pilot&#039;s licenses and instrument ratings. The interview includes some discussion about N4223Q, a C172L Bill used to own and Steve got to fly a lot.

After all this we have a chat with Bas about the OzRunways app then mention Ryan Hothersall&#039;s photos of the 787 and Rob Noonan&#039;s heads up about the Australian aerobatic pilots who are getting ready for the World Aerobatic Championships in Italy later this year.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>As all good things must come to an end, so too must our time at Oshkosh 2011. It&#039;s been an incredible event for us and an eye-opener to just how large this Mecca of all things aviation truly is. With our final day at the show, we&#039;ve produced a chunky episode packed full of *some* of the content we picked up here. There&#039;s still more to come in subsequent episodes including a focus on the teams on site from New Zealand, the Bonanzas to Oshkosh group and GippsAero.

For now, here&#039;s a list of what you&#039;ll find in episode 72: Oshcast #3 (Hugging your Roo): 
Steve chats with Amy Laboda from Women in Aviation International
Boyd Dellwo is an Australian listener who is now working with The Spaceship Company on White Knight 2 and Spaceship 2
David talks to Steve Sorenson who flew a Rutan Defiant from the USA to Australia &amp; back
David also provides us with &quot;A view from the tent&quot; segment
Bas Scheffers air tests the Remos Light Sport Aircraft
Steve chats with Shelly Ventura of the Ninety Nines
David talks with James Weeby about the Belite ultralight aircraft
Steve chats with Butch Bajner about the Young Eagles Program
Steve catches up with a South African tour group who are attending the show

After all this, we wrap up the show with a discussion between Steve, Grant, Bas, David &amp; Mike, closing off our on-show coverage of Oshkosh 2011.</itunes:summary>

Grant &amp; Bas have been here since Saturday while Steve &amp; David arrived on Sunday. We&#039;ve recorded with the Airplane Geeks, producing an episode with Peter Moll (director of Wittman Regional Airport - @wittmanairport on Twitter) recorded in his office. 

Today was the first full day we were all here and also the first official day of the show. We&#039;ve started gathering content and have assembled some items together to create our first show episode:
Steve reconnects with Kent Pietsch who we last spoke to back at Avalon earlier this year (in Episode 6 of our show daily coverage)
David interviews Brandon with his Super Cub
Bas records some chats with folks in the light-sport (Recreational) area:
Sportair USA
Snap Aero with their &quot;Snap&quot; aircraft
Mike Hanson from Hanson Air Group regarding the FK Lightplanes Fk12 biplane 
Steve talks with Pablo Alvarez about international pilot admissions at Embry Riddle University

We then wrap up the episode with a group discussion featuring Dave Allen, Bill Williams, Kent Shook, Pilot Damon, Stu Stevenson &amp; David Vanderhoof.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Ben Morgan from Aviation Advertiser returns to join us in a discussion of current events in the Australian aviation scene. Following a quick intro, the first topic we discuss is the Carbon Tax our government is proposing to implement. We do try to keep the discussion coming back to the impacts this tax is likely to have on aviation but it&#039;s a very hot topic and is certainly bringing out concerns for a number of people.

Once we get through the Carbon Tax and calm down a little, we move onto the sad state of affairs with Tiger Airways, currently grounded for failure to meet the requirements of their Air Operators Certificate (AOC) and a number of safety related issues. This is the first time CASA have grounded an all-jet airline and its timing was certainly drastic (right on the eve of the school holidays). We discuss the implications, some potential results and whether the Australian public will ever trust the airline again (very likely if there are cheap fares to be had).

Finally we discuss Aviation Advertiser&#039;s sponsoring the PCDU Team in their &quot;Up &amp; Over to Oshkosh 2011&quot; tour and the updates we&#039;ll be providing on their website while we&#039;re at Oshkosh.

After wrapping up our chat with Ben, we present another View From the Lounge segment, this time comparing public transport access to airports at Melbourne and various cities around the world. We then point listeners at Steve Price from Melbourne Talk Radio (MTR) having a great chat with astronaut Andy Thomas as well as similar coverage from the ABC StarStuff podcast.

Finally, we&#039;d like to thank all the listeners who have donated to our &quot;Up &amp; Over to Oshkosh 2011&quot; tour. We&#039;ve had lots of suggestions for coverage and lots of donations that all help round out the support of our sponsors. Thanks to you we&#039;ll be able to provide a more comprehensive coverage of Oshkosh 2011 than we could have if it were just Steve &amp; Grant on site. Once again, we are amazed at the level of support we&#039;ve received from our audience. You folks definitely make it all the hard work &amp; late nights worthwhile :)</itunes:summary>

We then transition to a chat with Monika Petrillo and Elliott Schiffman who came to Australia in the late 90&#039;s to fly around the country as part of a one month air safari with Mal Shipton&#039;s GOANA (Great Outback Air Navigation Adventure) Australian Air Safaris. After returning to the USA, Monika spent a number of years producing the movie FlyAbout, a documentary film based on her adventures during the air safari.

You may also have heard Monika on other podcasts such as The Pilot&#039;s Flight Podlog, The New Pilot Podblog and the Mile High Flyers. Each of these podcasts have chatted with Monika and presented their own unique approach to her movie &amp; her story.

Who are we to be different, then? :)

In chatting with Monika &amp; Elliot we touch on the following aspects of their adventure:
What it was like for Monika to edit &amp; produce the movie
Why did they come to Australia for this adventure?
Monika&#039;s learning to fly &amp; then flying on the safari with her father, an even more inexperienced pilot
Elliott&#039;s background in flying
Getting to know each other while on safari
What it was it like flying in the Australian outback without needing radios, having the freedom to deviate from track and so on
The scenery they encountered and experiences with the locals as they travelled around
How have the others from the safari gone since their big adventure?
Comparing Australia&#039;s aviation culture with that of the USA
Dealing with certification, maintenance, paperwork
A side track into ballooning (gee, thanks Grant :)
The non flying activities they got up to during the safari
What flying they&#039;re currently doing
Elliott&#039;s involvement with Bonanzas to Oshkosh, the mass arrival of 100+ Bonanzas at Oshkosh


Following our chat with Monika and Elliott, we introduce Don McLean, an air traffic controller from New Zealand who also happens to be Grant&#039;s 2nd cousin. Like Grant&#039;s father, Don went through the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) flying P3 Orions then went on to Bristol Freighters before winding up in a desk job at which point he decided to leave. From there he started working as an Air Traffic Controller at Ardmore near Auckland before moving to Auckland International Airport and then on to Hong Kong. After many years working in Hong Kong he returned to New Zealand where he worked at Palmerston North airport before moving to Hamilton where he&#039;s currently working in the tower.

In addition to a discussion of Don&#039;s career, our chat includes:
Oceanic Control
ADSB in New Zealand
Working the old school radar equipment
What it was like working in Hong Kong - especially Kai Tak
How airspace is structured in New Zealand
The GAAP to Class D transition here in Australia
Radar coverage of New Zealand airspace
The process of centralisation in Christchurch and whether Auckland could provide a good fall back position


We then wrap up the episode with a chat about Grant &amp; Bas joining the Bonanzas to Oshkosh group for a rather stylish arrival while they&#039;re over there. We then get some great listener mail from Mark Fraser in Canada who has a great story about an early flying experience in his life. Finally, Steve gives Grant a Shout Out for editing the interviews then another to Glen Philp from Steve&#039;s CFA past who recently contacted us via the podcast.

		<itunes:summary>We&#039;re joined by Mark Pracy Sr and Mark Pracy Jr to talk about the many aviation endeavours they&#039;re involved in, including JetRide Australia, Pracy Racing and Aircraft Imports. We also have Bas Scheffers sitting in from Adelaide for the interview as well as a fantastic announcement to make towards the end of the show :)

We start by talking with Mark Sr about his background in aviation including how he grew up in Scone seeing warbirds all the time, was taught aerobatics by Col Pay and then eventually became an aerobatics instructor. He&#039;s also got a low-level aerobatics waiver and is an airshow pilot displaying a number of warbirds at events around the country.

Eventually progressing to jets, the Pracys purchased a Czechoslovakian Aero L-39 Albatros two seat aircraft. We discuss with them it&#039;s handling, speeds and the typical manoeuvres they&#039;ll perform when taking passengers up as part of their JetRide Australia flights. We also discuss some of the more interesting folks they&#039;ve had on board before moving into their other main operation: Aircraft Imports.

Mark Jr is a certified LAME &amp; pilot who runs the Aircraft Imports business, working with his father to scout aircraft, flight test &amp; inspect them and arrange their purchase for clients. With the AUS$ being so high compared to the US$, they&#039;re being kept very busy arranging purchases for Australians at the moment (although we&#039;re not sure using a container to bring a Cirrus into Australia is the best way of doing it :). Mark Jr is able to run the entire operation from the inspections to dismantling &amp; packing then on to reassembly, test flights &amp; certification back here in Australia.

The work Team Pracy do in JetRide Australia and Aircraft Imports all helps support their latest endeavour which is racing their L39 at the Reno Air Races. They&#039;ve recently completed their qualifications and are now certified to race this year in September. We talk to them about the qualification &amp; selection process, dealing with emergencies and the mechanics of reducing weight to help compete. Fascinating stuff.

Team Pracy also note that they&#039;re happy to take on sponsors of their L39 in Reno so if you or an organisation you represent are interested in getting space on a very sexy aircraft, contact Mark Sr via mark@jetride.com.au.

Finally, we have our big announcement for the show:

Thanks to the generous support of Team Pracy, we&#039;re being sent to Oshkosh 2011. That&#039;s right, after 2 years of having to miss Oshkosh because of insufficient funds and looking like we were going to miss this one as well, Mark Sr &amp; Mark Jr have offered to get us over there (mostly, we think, so they can see our heads explode as we&#039;re surrounded by aviation :)

We&#039;d like to thank Team Pracy for their most wonderful offer as it&#039;s thanks to them that we&#039;re going to finally be able to meet up with our online friends and experience the wonder that is AirVenture Oshkosh. We&#039;re also receiving additional sponsorship funding from other groups including the fine folks at Aviation Advertiser who are helping to chip in some additional funds to cover our camping gear while we&#039;re on site.

Watch this space as we&#039;ll have more news &amp; updates about how our trip to Oshkosh is progressing over the next few weeks :)


As if all this wasn&#039;t enough, we wrap up the episode with a quick chat with Bas about the latest news on the OzRunways application and he points us at a cool video of OzRunways being demonstrated.

		<itunes:summary>It&#039;s been a while since we got down &amp; dirty with the Australian commercial airline scene so with that in mind, we called up Ben Sandlilands from the PlaneTalking blog on Crikey.com.au for a chat. There&#039;s some amazing developments going on in the &quot;big iron&quot; side of people moving here in Australia and we went through the following subjects:
The joys of ash clouds (Thanks Chile!)
Virgin Australia taking on Qantas &amp; Jetstar with their new pricing structures &amp; business class, including just what kind of passenger they were targeting at the front of the cabin
Qantas &amp; JetStar&#039;s industrial issues with their unions
Tiger regrouping &amp; focusing on routes where it can do the most damage to the others (watch out Melbourne  Sydney and maybe even the Golden Triangle of Melbourne, Sydney &amp; Brisbane)
Strategic&#039;s foray into the Pacific

In this episode we also include an interview with Kathy Mexted, a freelance writer who we met *way* back at the Centenary of Flight airshow in 2010. Flying is in Kathy&#039;s blood by birth &amp; by marriage and she&#039;s been writing articles for a variety of aviation magazines as well as working on a book about being the spouse of an airline pilot. We&#039;re very happy to announce that Kathy&#039;s also going to be producing some content for us in the near future mostly covering Recreational &amp; General Aviation areas.
 
Finally, we&#039;re including some new music in our show as Steve&#039;s found out about the royalty free production music by JewelBeat. Watch out for whole new background tracks &amp; cross-over music in this &amp; future episodes :)</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>There&#039;s no denying that aviation has been the home of many innovative ideas when it comes to aerodynamics, systems and so on. Sometimes we even get to hear about innovation in many of the business &amp; training aspects of aviation and this episode is bringing us a few of them, from new ways to bring aviation education to kids through to recognising the need to store aircraft in the Asia/Pacific area. We also have a number of other content items including a few more of our Avalon interviews.

This episode contains:
Tom Vincent from Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage (APAS) talking about the new &quot;boneyard&quot; facility they are creating at Alice Springs in the middle of Australia
Angelina Morino from Aus Air Services joins us again to review their past year of operation and discuss their involvement with Brentwood College (Steve&#039;s old high school) to provide aviation study to students. They&#039;re also planning to extend this out to other high schools in the area. NOTE: As with Peter Dow at TVSA, it&#039;s great to see local flying schools thinking outside the box to make it easier and/or cheaper to learn to fly)
Some more content from Avalon, including:
The crew of a KC135 tanker
Flying Officer Johnno Pearson on flying the F/A-18 Hornet
Flight Lt Liam Webler, a techo who helps to keep the F/A-18 Hornet in the air
Steve &amp; Lisa Ruffles talk about their Eagle School of Microlighting at Porepunkah


We wrap up with the following Listener Mail and Shout Outs:
Miles Rados wrote in about gliding at Tocumwal
Toby Robb wrote in about Steve&#039;s recent microphone levels and had some comments on our recent chat with Dick Smith
The Airplane Geeks podcast reaches episode 150 - well done, guys!
Kudos to the RAAF social media team for helping to promote our work via the &quot;I love jet noise&quot; Facebook page
There&#039;s a new aviation podcast - The Stuck Mic AvCast - from the folks at The Pilot Report. They&#039;re two episodes in and have been producing great content so far
PCDU can now be found on Stitcher &amp; SlapDash Radio
Thanks to all those who&#039;ve left feedback at the iTunes store - much appreciated and keep it up!
Don&#039;t forget to check out our website where we&#039;ve made some recent layout changes plus we&#039;ve also been loading more videos on our YouTube channel.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We are fortunate to have Dick Smith return to PCDU, joining us to discuss his views on Australia&#039;s aviation environment. We talk about his time as chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority and then his return as chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. He mentions some of the initiatives he started that worked as well as some that didn&#039;t quite work as planned. Dick also gives us a rather candid look at his views on user fees, ministers and what&#039;s going wrong with aviation today.

Once again this discussion with Dick is sure to generate divided commentary from those in aviation, both old &amp; new. If you&#039;ve not already listened to our previous chat with Dick about his early flying adventures, you really should check it out now.

Following our chat with Dick we have a dramatic change of scene as the Infrequent Flyer (aka Anthony Simmons) returns to give us his View From the Lounge angle on the Avalon Airshow. Then, to answer Anthony&#039;s question of &quot;How it all flows together&quot; we have ATC_Ben return to present his latest Controller&#039;s Corner where he explains just what went on at Mercat Manor.

Following that we have a few interviews recorded at Avalon:
FLT LT Pete Komar, an F-18F Super Hornet pilot with the RAAF
BAe Hawk Mk127 techo LAC Brian Dick
Pilot Officer Emmanuel &quot;Muz&quot; Murray talks about flying the BAe Hawk Mk127
SGT Kerry Dimar who works in logistics with the BAe Hawk Mk127

To keep with the Fast Jets angle, we&#039;ve thrown in some cockpit audio from Steve&#039;s flight with Mark Pracy in JetRide&#039;s L39 Albatros.

For this episode, we&#039;ve dived into the mailbag to bring out:
Calum Tsang from Toronto lists some of his favourite episodes
Carl Rossi says PCDU is going to cost him $13,000 ... and he doesn&#039;t mind!

		<itunes:summary>Every year at Easter, Recreational Aviation Australia holds its National Fly In (NatFly). This is an event where RA-Aus members, vendors &amp; interested folks come to meet, attend workshops, review vendor offerings, undertake test flights and show off their aircraft. Aircraft range from powered parachutes &amp; ultralights through to home builds and the latest sport &amp; recreational aircraft. Importers and manufacturers are present to showcase their equipment, the circuit is filled with aircraft undertaking demo flights and the local hotels &amp; bars are filled at night with tall tales and recollections.

We were fortunate to be invited to attend along with the team from Aviation Advertiser, setting up our mobile recording studio in one of the Temora Aviation Museum&#039;s hangars (along with their Mk VIII Spitfire and Cessna A37). We arrived on the Friday morning and departed on the Saturday evening, experiencing two very busy days packed with interviews, discussions, aircraft &amp; equipment inspections and a couple of demo flights.

Suffice to say there was plenty of material captured and we&#039;ve managed to squeeze the best of it into yet another very large episode. We considered splitting it over two but there&#039;s more great content on the way on other topics so we felt it best to pack it all into one large package.

The content we present in this episode is:
An introduction with Steve, Grant, Ben &amp; Bas
Brumby Aircraft with Paul Goward
Laurie Hines and his Revolution Mini-500 helicopter
John Garton from Leisure Sport Aircraft talks about the Paradise P1 aircraft from Brazil
Gyrocopter pilot Sam Polyak talks about the EVA Aviacion ELA 08
Gary Flood from Bert Flood Imports discusses the latest Rotax engines
Owen Zupp joins us to chat about how he undertakes an air test
Paul Chernikeef talks with us about Rotec Engineering&#039;s latest radial engines
Nick Sharples talks about the AVOCET aircraft his father Mike has created from a Jabiru 230
Tony Blair talks to us about flying aerobatics and RAAF ab initio training
Jon Johansen from Flymore steps us through the TruTrak EFIS, EMS &amp; autopilot systems on offer
John Lindner gives us a visitor&#039;s view of the show
Bryce Hughes joins us from Cub Crafters
Matthew Maude from Performance Metals Australia gets detailed on metal
Some of the cockpit audio from Steve&#039;s test flight of a Brumby R600
John Conte from Aerochute talks to us about their powered parachutes
Gary Sargeant discusses the amazing EQ1 Wireless Headset he&#039;s invented

We then wrap up the episode with a review of the show between Steve, Grant, Ben &amp; Bas along with a quick chat about the OzRunways application that Bas has been developing.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Aviation in Australia is experiencing a difficult time and General Aviation is especially being hit hard. User fees are continuing to increase, rules are being changed and airports are being shutdown or reduced in size due to encroachment by non-aviation construction. We&#039;re joined in this episode by Ben Morgan from Aviation Advertiser to discuss these issues, highlight the need for people to take action and discuss what those actions might be. Ben&#039;s certainly not holding back as the stakes are too high to be diplomatic.

We also have some other great chats in this show, including:
Steve Ahrens talking about the upcoming Barossa Airshow (May 1st, 2011)
A chat with the crew of an RAAF Wedgetail AEW&amp;C aircraft that we recorded back at Avalon Airshow
A collection of quick chats with some RA-Aus pilots at Avalon, including:
Peter Harlow from Foxbat Australia
John Callahan with his Typhoon Glider
Peter Kane with his Kitfox
Ben Morgan then rejoins us to discuss the state of the second hand aircraft market in Australia and a couple of the aircraft available for sale on Aviation Advertiser</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Most people interested or involved in aviation have a special love  for warbirds and antique aircraft and we at PCDU are certainly no exception. This episode features a number of interviews with pilots of Warbirds &amp; antique aircraft that were recorded at Avalon Airshow and at Point Cook when the RAAF Pilgrimage arrived.

The RAAF Pilgrimage was held to celebrate the 90th birthday of the RAAF &amp; comprised a collection of more than 50 aircraft that flew from Temora to Tocumwal to Ballarat and finally to Point Cook. The Pilgrimage aicraft arrived at Point Cook (the birth place of the RAAF) and we were there to greet them.

This episode contains the following interviews from the RAAF Pilgrimage:
Air Commodore Rodney Luke
Steve Death
Doug Hamilton
Egon Mahr from the Russian Roolettes
Col Griffin &amp; Warren Canning

We also have some other warbird related discussions, including:
Kenny Love, CEO of the Temora Aviation Museum
Ben Morgan from Aviation Advertiser and the Macchi 326H restoration project he is a member of
Darren &quot;Buster&quot; Crabb
Gus Lerrard

We then round out the episode with:
Listener Mail:
Ed Stubbs 
Shout Outs:
Ken &amp; Tim get recognition for their Millions Against Malaria flight
Matt from New St Films for the help with our photo shoots
Listener Andrew Tsousis for putting us in touch with Ben Merkenhof
Iat-Fai Leong for his support of the show
Erk for his support &amp; his new book


We also have some additional content that can be found in our Extras section. This time we have a recording of the post-flight debrief by the Yak Attack formation pilots.

Finally, we would like to offer our condolences to our friend Milford Shirley from the Flight Time Radio Show in Florida, USA, who&#039;s wife Barbara passed away recently.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>The Australian International Airshow (aka Avalon 2011) is over but the show must go on. We have mountains of content from Avalon 2011 in addition to the interviews we released in each of our daily episodes.

Yes, that&#039;s right: If you haven&#039;t downloaded &amp; listened to each of the daily episodes then you should stop right now and go do it. There is some amazing content in those episodes that will NOT be in the post-show Avalon episodes, including F22 Raptor pilots, B1B crew, Dr Brendan Nelson, remote tower systems, Simmo &amp; the CA27 Sabre plus much much more.

This episode we focus on the Trade Show aspect of Avalon 2011, gathering together the interviews we recorded with various corporations during the first few days of the show:
Dan Schroter, head of strategy &amp; business development at BAe Systems, talks to us about BAe Systems&#039; work in Australia
Paul Cooke, director of business development in defense avionics at BAe Systems, talks to us about their amazing Q-Sight system
Walter Kreitler, direct of BAMS UAS business development at Northrop Grumman talks to us about the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance system
Mike Fuqua, director of tactical unmanned systems at Northrop Grumman, talks to us about the MQ-8B Fire Scout helicopter UAS
Paul Levett, CEO of Levett Engineering, talks to us about landing more work with Pratt &amp; Whitney on the F35 JSF&#039;s 135 engine

After some intense trade show coverage, we also step back a bit with the latest &#039;View from the Lounge&#039; update from Anthony Simmons before winding up the episode with some Listener Mail:
David Thornton says &quot;Hi&quot; from the UK and thinks our Avalon Quick Cast episodes were just like being there.
Mac Coble from Florida
Bruce Dickerson from Georgia
We also have a few important shout outs:
Gary Towart who helped escort us at the KC135 and warbirds tarmac, preventing us from getting hassled :)
MozzMan from SRS Photography who escorted us during our interviews with Nikolay, Bob, Kent &amp; Chris plus took a few photos of us in action
Ian Kershaw who&#039;s put together our new audience survey
We now have a PCDU Flickr stream where our Avalon 2011 photos are being loaded along with others from past events

Thanks once again for downloading &amp; listening to our show. Be sure to catch up with our Avalon Daily episodes as there is lots of great content in those too.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We&#039;ve made it to the end of day 6 of the Australian International Airshow and Aerospace &amp; Defence Exposition (aka Avalon 2011). It&#039;s the final day of the airshow and once again Team PCDU have been flat out interviewing, editing and generally having fun. We&#039;ve spent some time chatting with the crew of a KC-135 inside their aircraft, interviewed a number of acts, caught up with the Temora Aviation Museum crew and generally had a great time. 

We&#039;re also acknowledging that these daily episodes should have been called &quot;Daily Avalon Updates&quot; or anything other than &quot;Quick Casts.&quot; To really confirm that, we&#039;ve put quite a lot of content in this episode, including:

Grant&#039;s chat with Paul Simmons recorded while sitting on the wing of the CA27 Sabre
Nikolay Timofeev talks about flying aerobatics in his Sukhoi 26
Anthony Simmons presents a short View from the B52&#039;s Lounge
Kent Pietsch talks to us about flying the &quot;Jelly Belly&quot; Cadet &amp; his various routines while Chris Williams from the same team talks about driving the mobile landing-platform vehicle
Being  updated by Colonel Seth Bretscher on the amount of work involved in getting so many USAF &amp; USN aircraft &amp; airmen down to Avalon (and why there was no B2 &amp; the F22s didn&#039;t fly)
An update from Ian Honnery on how the airshow is going so far
A quick chat with Ed Stubbs, a listener from Perth who came over to Avalon for the show
The final tarmac updates from Timbo with the warbirds &amp; Papa Smurf at the Keyhole

		<itunes:summary>It&#039;s day 5 of the Australian International Airshow and Aerospace &amp; Defence Exposition (aka Avalon 2011) and it&#039;s the first whole day open to the general public. The PCDU team have had one of the most amazing days of their lives with time in the venerable B52, getting up close &amp; personal with the Wedgetail, checking out the GA8 Airvan and relaxing on the wing of the CA27 Sabre. The content we selected for this Quick Cast includes:

Our chat with Squadron Leader Matt Harper, an RAAF pilot on exchange with the USAF who&#039;s flying the F22 Raptor
Steve&#039;s in-cockpit discussion with David Wheatland, the chief pilot for the GippsAero GA-8 Airvan
Talking with Flight Lieutenant Skye Smith about RAAF Public Affairs, her career to date &amp; where it may lead in the future
Today&#039;s tarmac updates from Timbo with the warbirds &amp; Taffy reluctantly agrees to cover for Papa Smurf at the Keyhole

An interview with a USAF F22 Raptor pilot and maintainer while standing on the tarmac as close as we were allowed to get to their aircraft
Today&#039;s updates from Timbo &amp; Papa Smurf on movements at the Warbird and Keyhole tarmacs

		<itunes:summary>It&#039;s time once again for the Australian International Airshow and Aerospace &amp; Defence Exposition (aka Avalon 2011) and Team PCDU are there to arrange interviews with people &amp; organisations that catch our eye. Today was our first day at the airshow and while much of it was spent meeting people &amp; setting up our schedule for the week, we still managed to:

Interview Dr Brendan Nelson who was Australia&#039;s Defence Minister during 2006-2007 and, in addition to scoring a couple of rides in F18 Super Hornets, also signed off the purchase of Super Hornets &amp; C17s for the RAAF, the MRH-90 helicopters and many more new projects that are now reality
Talk to Mark Robinson &amp; Martin Hoffensetz from SAAB about the &quot;Virtual Control Tower&quot; systems they&#039;re presenting to AirServices here in Australia. These systems will allow people to manage control towers from remote locations and could potentially be on trial here in Australia in the near future
Discuss flight training options with Peter Dow from TVSA Pilot Training including the incredible effort he has put into establishing TVSA as Australia&#039;s first ever VET FEE-HELP endorsed aviation school, allowing students to defer payment of part or all of their tuition fees until they obtain paying work
Introduce our first &quot;Timbo&#039;s Tarmac&quot; and &quot;Through the Keyhole with Papa Smurf&quot; segments. These will feature daily chats with tarmac operations staff covering newly arrived aircraft and issues that cropped up during the day

Not bad for a first day&#039;s effort. There were a few more chats we recorded but they&#039;ll be carried over to tomorrow&#039;s Quick Cast or a post-Avalon episode we release after the dust has settled. Despite that, it&#039;s still a 50 minute episode so we&#039;re going to attempt a bit of trimming on tomorrow&#039;s episode as our goal is to be about 30 minutes :)

These Avalon Quick Cast episodes are being sponsored by Aviation Advertiser and supported by Red Baron and Temby Automotive.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Steve &amp; Grant are joined once again by Bas Scheffers from Adelaide to discuss a few items, including:
A follow up to the ADSB discussion we had with Bill Hamilton back in episode 48
A discussion of the iPhone/iPad application Bas &amp; a partner have been developing called OzRunways covering what it does &amp; how it came to be
The revelation that Grant actually doesn&#039;t like the TV show &quot;Ice Pilots&quot; (oh, the shame! :)
Parafield airshow is changing dates to March 25th, 2012 due to weather concerns and to help ensure more Australian Defence Force assets will be available 
Avalon is coming up soon
Bas is going to Oshkosh and as we may not be able to make it, he may have to be the PCDU correspondent for us (not sure how we&#039;ll get him a more Australian accent though!)
Hassling Bas to provide a bio for the PCDU &quot;About Us&quot; page


We also have another great chat with our man &quot;Across the Ditch,&quot; Dan Morris from New Zealand, including:
A review of the amazing Walsh Memorial Scout Flying School, an event that should definitely be set up here in Australia if it&#039;s not already being done
Some information about Palmerston North where Dan&#039;s based (check it out on the map)
Mention is made of the Ministry of Transport &amp; Technology museum in Auckland
We talk briefly about Air New Zealand and Air Nelson as Air Nelson will be flying new services into Paraparaumu (also called Paraparam :) - check out the map


As if all this wasn&#039;t enough, we also have a chat with James Williams from the Podcaster&#039;s Emporium about his recent Business Class trip with Emirates across the ditch to New Zealand &amp; back.

Finally, we wrap up the show with some Listener Mail &amp; Shout Outs, including:
Bill Morelli from the USA who flies a Zenith Zodiac (nice plane!)
Paul Bridges who supplied the photo of the Qantas DC3 that graces this episode&#039;s notes
Colin Sweetman from the UK who has started getting back into his flying and wants to do aerobatics (YES!!!! says Grant :) and also offered to be our tour guide to a number of aviation museums if we can get there (we&#039;ll hold you to that, Colin! :)
And finally, a big shout out to the people who decided to take part in the &quot;$50 for Episode 50&quot; concept - thanks folks!</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Every two years Avalon Airport is the home to one of the biggest airshows &amp; aviation expositions in the Southern Hemisphere (the biggest, according to many). One of Australia&#039;s premier aviation events, Avalon Airshow (also known as the Australian International Airshow) draws aircraft from around the world and attracts scores of people from the general public through to aviation enthusiasts &amp; professionals, especially for the Friday night airshow.  

From the early days of the airshows produced by the Schofields Flying Club through to today, a consistent presence throughout it all has been Ian Honnery. CEO of Airshows Downunder. We were fortunate to spend some time with Ian to discuss the history of the Avalon Airshow and it makes for fascinating listening.

Sadly, our sound gear wasn&#039;t configured correctly for the space we were in and so the audio quality is not up to our show&#039;s (and especially Steve&#039;s :) usual standards. The content itself is incredible so after doing as much work as could be done to correct the sound issues, we&#039;re finally able to release this interview. Our thanks go to Domenic at Audio Visual Media for his help in massaging the raw audio.

We&#039;re looking forward to attending the airshow in March this year as it will be the 90th anniversary of the RAAF. Look out for more content about Avalon, how it&#039;s managed and what to expect this year as we get closer to March 1st.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>In November 2010 the PCDU team were invited to attend the Media Day at RAAF Amberley where members of 6 Squadron were gathered to give us one final look at the F111 before it was retired from service. We have gathered the interviews we recorded during the Media Day and combined them with a couple of discussions to present our tribute to the F111 and all those who helped to keep them in the air.

This is our longest episode to date so you may want to make use of the PAUSE button to get through it all. Like the PIG, it&#039;s big, but we think the content is just too good to leave any of it out. The F111 has been a major part of our lives over the last 30 years in Australia and New Zealand and anyone who has experienced the RAAF&#039;s trademark &quot;Dump &amp; Burn&quot; display will have some idea why we&#039;re so sad to see them go.

From seeing an F111 doing 4-point hesitation rolls, aileron rolls and a loop at Avalon to watching them racing past while sitting on the beach on a summer&#039;s day, the F111 became an icon of Australia&#039;s military as they provided us with a long range projection of power. They leave a large gap in our force structure now that they have been retired and a hole in the hearts of many who kept them flying.

So long, pig and remember: That&#039;ll do, Pig. That&#039;ll do!

The contents of this episode include:
The Media Day&#039;s opening press conference (starts at 06:08) 
A discussion with David Vanderhoof about the history of the F111 including its inception and service with the USAF &amp; RAAF (starts at 32:06) 
We talk to Wing Commander Terry Deeth about his time as a bombadier/navigator (or Weapons Systems Officer) with the F111 while on rotation to the USAF (starts at 51:33) 
We visited the F111 simulator on the base and got to meet:
Steve Clark, an ex-RAAF F111 pilot who has more hours in an F111 than almost anyone else in the world (starts at 1:05:40)
Brett Denton, a computer technician who helps to keep the simulator operating (starts at 1:11:29) 
While everyone likes to focus on the guys in the cockpit, an F111 needs a lot of maintenance between flights so we managed to catch up with a few of the techos:
Flight Lieutenant Adam Firth &amp; Sergeant Chris Walker (starts at 1:15:32)
Corporal James Morton (starts at 1:30:19)
Corporal David Bash, an American now living in Australia (starts at 1:35:50) 
We talk with Flight Lieutenant Vlad Bismark about flying the F111 (starts at 1:47:25) 
We have a chat with Brendan Cowan from ADF Serials about the history of the RAAF&#039;s F111s and with Chris Daley from the Save the F111 page on Facebook about how the page developed and where it&#039;s going now (starts at 1:55:28) 
We interview Wing Commander Al Curr who ejected from an F111 on take off from RNZAF Ohakea in New Zealand (starts at 2:14:12) 
Our final chat is with Wing Commander Michael (Micka) Gray, officer commanding 6 Squadron and the world&#039;s last F111 unit commander (starts at 2:20:42)


We also have a couple of &quot;Shout Outs&quot; in this episode:
Flight Lieutenant Skye Smith for her tireless efforts in making the Media Day run smoothly, not to mention herding us about the base and ensuring we didn&#039;t wind up where we shouldn&#039;t be (wonder if there&#039;s a &quot;Keeping media on track&quot; medal in the ADF??? :)
Listener Chris Whyte who we met at RAAF Amberley has produced an F111 tribute video called &quot;RAAF F-111 tribute feat. TV Rock - &#039;In the Air&#039;&quot; - you can find it on YouTube and it&#039;s well worth watching a few times</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>As the final hours of 2010 pass by and the year draws to a close, we release our 50th episode with a mix of annual review, Christmas greetings and a new experiment. In conjunction with a live video stream of the proceedings, we gathered Steve, Grant, Anthony and Ben in the recording studio to attempt the unthinkable: capturing a whole show in a single take.

We start with a look back at a few of the big stories from 2010 and an additional discussion on ADSB driven by Ben&#039;s perspective from behind the controller&#039;s console. Mixed in with the discussion are:
A discussion we recorded with Matt Wardell from AirServices Australia about their Santa NOTAM, the Santa Tracker and various other efforts they make at Christmas 
An interview with Michael &amp; Roselyn from Downwind.com.au about the site and aviation in general 
Various Christmas greetings from other aviation podcasters around the world

We then start to wrap it all up with some feedback from listeners:
Ian Kershaw from Canada sent in recorded message
Ahmet Hussein emailed us looking for information to help him track down episodes of the TV series &quot;Big Sky&quot; (which Ben recalled watching)
Jay Swanepoel left us some positive feedback on our Facebook page

Finally we worked through some shout outs, including:
The many guests we&#039;ve had on PCDU during 2010
Andrea Sammut from Scripts &amp; Voicers for her great support this year
Dane Golden for his support &amp; promotion of our show on Hey.com
James Williams &amp; Dave Gray from the Podcasters Emporium on the Lifestyle Podnetwork for helping to promote our show (they&#039;ve also been promoted recently on iTunes as a premium provider - awesome news!)
To all the organisations that have advertised with us, providing both in-kind help and some actual funds
Milford &amp; Charlie from the FlightTime Radio Show for their faith in our product
David Hook from PlaneHook Aviation Services for his sponsorship of our Flying Down Under segment
Max, Dan, Rob &amp; David at the Airplane Geeks Podcast for all the help &amp; encouragement they&#039;ve given us over the year


We&#039;d also like to especially thank all of you, our audience who have given us your precious time to listen to our show. Your numbers are growing along with your feedback and it&#039;s your support that helps us put in the effort to produce the show.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Rosemary Arnold learned to fly fixed wing in the early 60s then converted helicopters in the mid-60&#039;s, becoming the first woman in Australia to receive a helicopter pilot&#039;s license. From operating her own helicopter business in Australia to flying in locations around the world, Rosemary has had an extensive career in aviation. She has also written a number of books, lectures on aviation history and join the public speaking circuit. As a registered celebrant, she also runs &quot;Chapel in the Sky&quot; performing weddings in a helicopter above Sydney harbour. We chat with Rosemary about her career and her new book, First Females Above Australia, a presentation of the pioneering women involved in aviation in Australia.

We also chat with Dan Morris, a flight instructor in New Zealand who&#039;s joined us previously in a few of our Australia Desk adventures. Dan joins us to discuss his aviation career to date and the flying scene in New Zealand. He also anticipates providing more New Zealand related content in the new year.

This episode is rounded out with another Controller&#039;s Corner segment where ATC_Ben answers some of the many questions that have been raised in our forums and via email. We then move on to listener mail:
Braham Sacks asks about careers in aviation
Ian Kershaw from Canada has a blog &amp; podcast page that&#039;s worth checking out
Luke Murphy writes in from China where he&#039;s working as a pilot
Ed Stubbs sent in a link to an interview with one of the pilots from QF32 (the Qantas A380 that had a massive uncontained engine failure)
We mention that Anthony Simmons is looking for more feedback on his View from the Lounge segment
We also have some shout-outs:
Damian Rose has completed his MECIR and is now working on his Caravan endorsement - congratulations (and yes we are jealous! :) You can follow his details on his blog.
Robert E Coli from Thromby airlines has done another great cartoon showing Steve &amp; Grant hard at work in the PCDU studio. You can see it in all it&#039;s glory on our Facebook page.
Thanks to Michael &amp; Roselyn from Downwind and the team at Moorabbin Flying Services (MFS) for a great BBQ the other weekend and for making discount TIFs/Check flights available</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>While the technology behind ADS-B is nothing new, it is becoming the centerpiece of modern Air Traffic Management systems around the world. Unfortunately, CASA is once again taking a global concept and creating an entirely unique Australian implementation of it.

According to CASA&#039;s Discussion Paper (DP) 1006AS
Proposed Strategy and Regulatory Plan in support of the Australian Government&#039;s Aviation White Paper, any aircraft added to the Australian register after 2013 must have an ADS-B out compliant Mode-S Transponder on board. This means large added costs for no real benefit beyond that already provided by Mode-C and Mode-S transponders.

This is creating no small level of concern in the aviation communities, including RA-Aus, ballooning and others, as can be seen from a recent discussion about DP 1006AS on the Recreational Flying site. Even the airlines who were pushing for ADS-B to improve safety at regional airports are now realising that the costs are huge (it&#039;s not a simple upgrade of their avionics) and the benefits are minor.

With all this in mind, Bas &amp; Grant chat with Bill Hamilton, past president &amp; technical director of the Australian Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Association (AOPA). While Bill can appreciate ADS-B&#039;s history and benefits, he doesn&#039;t hold back when it comes to CASA&#039;s attempt at creating yet another uniquely Australian implementation. We discuss the differences between the US, European and Australian implementation plans, the costs associated with our version and the lack of real benefit CASA&#039;s proposal will provide.

As the title of CASA&#039;s Discussion Paper shows, the proposal is implementing an aspect of the Australian Government&#039;s Aviation White Paper. If, like many, you are concerned about the costs being applied to the aviation industry for little real benefit, it is important to respond to the DP by November 30th. It is also vital that Australian aviators write to their elected representatives, members of the opposition and their aviation organisations (eg: AOPA, RA-Aus, ABF, etc) to ensure politicians are aware that the proposed solution will cause more harm than good.

You can easily find who is representing you at the Australian Government&#039;s &quot;Who&#039;s Who&quot; page. You can also find a great guide to writing effective letters to politicians over on the Crikey website.

Don&#039;t assume others will sort this one out for you. Don&#039;t take the classic Australian &quot;She&#039;ll be right&quot; approach. Get out there and tell CASA, the politicians and your aviation group what you think, otherwise the safe skies will be achieved thanks to the removal of any non-airline aircraft.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>The 2010 RedBull AirRace season was exciting, eventful and disappointing all at once. From Adilson Kindleman&#039;s crash in Perth to Hannes Arch&#039;s pylon hit and Matt Hall&#039;s &quot;walk on water&quot; incident, G-Stalls were everywhere. Then came the news that the last two races were cancelled and, finally, that the whole 2011 season was cancelled. As if the end of the season wasn&#039;t bad enough, we were all stunned by the news that Alejandro Maclean had died in an aerobatic training accident.

We have already presented our &quot;End of Season&quot; chats with Hannes Arch and Matt Hall in previous episodes so in this one, we present our chats with Nigel Lamb and Pete McLeod.

We also officially announce the winners of our Flight City Simulator Centre B777 sim session prize (Graham Neal) and two runners up (Greg Spencer &amp; David Mitchell), both of whom win PCDU T-Shirts. 

We talk briefly about Qantas&#039; recent 90th Birthday event at Melbourne airport and play the quick chat we recorded with Juan Serrano, John Travolta&#039;s chief pilot.

After another View from the Lounge segment, this time paying tribute to those serving in the military, we dive into our mailbag:
Steve Horton form Perth is worried that the RedBull AirRace will never return to Perth and lets us know about his great photo site
Peter Baxter wrote in asking about jet engine technology and again to share a great story about an Air New Zealand DC10 that helped a ferry flight in trouble over the Pacific
&quot;brettkp&quot; has some great feedback about episode 46 in our forums on Downwind

We give a shout-out to Pieter Johnson (@NascotHornet) in the UK who has just become a very proud father: welcome Beatrice :)</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>On November 4th, 2010 Qantas A380 VH-OQA (&quot;Nancy Bird Walton&quot;) was operating flight QF32 from Singapore to Sydney. During the climb out from Singapore, the number 2 Rolls Royce Trent 900 engine&#039;s Intermediate Pressure Turbine appears to have failed and flown apart, sending bits through the aircraft&#039;s wing in multiple locations and raining debris down on Batam island, Indonesia. After assessing the problem, determining their options and burning off fuel, the crew were able to return the aircraft to Singapore for a safe landing.

This incident, in conjunction with some other recent engine failures on Qantas 747s, has overshadowed Qantas&#039; 90th birthday celebrations. While the story is still unfolding and it will be some weeks before the ATSB&#039;s preliminary investigations are completed, we have decided to quickly produce an episode dedicated to the incident.

To begin with, we talk to Captain Richard Woodward, Vice President of the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA). He discusses what the crew would have experienced on board as the incident unfolded, including the systems alerts &amp; alarms, the processes to be followed and the roles over the various people on board. He also discusses the A380&#039;s systems &amp; redundancies and the options available to the crew when flying &amp; landing a crippled aircraft.

We then chat with Steve Purvinas of the Australian Licenced Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA) about the changes that have occurred in Qantas as they have moved from an exclusively in-house engineering operation to one that relies more on outsourced maintenance performed overseas. We discuss the implications of the changes and other paths Qantas could have followed.

This episode was conceived, implemented and released within the week of the incident occurring as we felt it important to present our listeners with good background information about the aircraft, the crew&#039;s likely experience and some of the changes at Qantas that have seen their engineering force reduced significantly compared to their heyday of the 70&#039;s &amp; 80&#039;s.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>It&#039;s been a while since our last episode but at last we&#039;re able to present our latest update with some more great content. First up, Matt Hall joins us once again to look back on his 2010 RedBull AirRace season, discuss the lessons he&#039;s learned and give us his thoughts about 2011 &amp; beyond.

Next up we are proud to introduce our latest advertiser, Flight City Simulator Centre at Jandakot in Perth, with their Boeing 777 simulator. We chat with Richard Zandvliet, the CEO at Flight City, about their various simulators, the courses they can offer for the professional pilot and the packages they have for the general public. Richard also makes a generous offer of a one-hour flight package in the 777 simulator that we can give away on the show (see below).

While Grant&#039;s been able to go flying in some full sized aircraft (check out the photos on our Facebook page), Steve&#039;s been catching up with some slightly smaller aircraft. He&#039;s been out to the Victorian Scale Aircraft Association&#039;s state championships and interviewed John Lamont, Noel Whitehead &amp; David Law from the Packenham &amp; District Aircraft Radio Control Society.

Finally, we wind up the episode some mailbag &amp; shout-outs:
Peter Baxter wrote in and suggested the brilliant idea of following up some engineers about jet engine issues 
Alex James wrote in from China with some comments 
Camper English from the Alcademics blog is producing a catalog of Aircraft Drinks Menus and, as mentioned in our PCDU Commentaries, we think you should give him a hand 
David Vanderhoof has started his own podcast called the Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to Military Aviation - well worth checking out!


NOTE: We had some additional content from our Matt Hall interview that was no longer current so we&#039;ve moved it from the episode to our Extras collection. You can find it at our &quot;Extras&quot; page.

Competition: Win a one hour flight package with Flight City Simulator Center&#039;s Boeing 777 simulator

Just listen to this episode to hear a jingle from the past. If you know who owned that jingle, send us an email at planecrazydownunder@gmail.com telling us who you think it was. We&#039;ll draw the winner live on uStream in the near future.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>In an effort to reassure you that we&#039;re not trying to cut any corners as we build towards our 50th episode, this episode comes in at over 2 hours in length (our longest ever, in fact). It&#039;s jam packed with great content, including:
A chat with Bas Scheffers about:
The impact of the Class D changes at Parafield
The flying he&#039;s been doing lately in his Evektor Sportstar
The Parafield Airshow
How the Aeroscene Flying Group is going
A review of some of the latest RA-Aus developments (Recreational Aviation Australia) 
A chat with Hannes Arch (Red Bull Air Race pilot) where we discuss his 2010 season and his plans for 2011/2012 
An interview with an F18F pilot that David Vanderhoof recorded at the Oceana Air Show 
A discussion between Steve &amp; David about the history of the F18, its current status with the Super Hornet (aka Rhino) and the implications of the F35 JSF 
Controllers Corner #2 
The View from the Lounge: &quot;Monkey in Business&quot; 
We read some mail &amp; forum items:
Cameron Liberts enjoyed episode 42
Turb Coriolis comments on episode 43 in our forum
Anthony Crichton-Browne enjoys our content even if he does disagree with some of what we say :) - he also points us to video of the recently deceased Renaud Ecalle performing an aerobatics at the World Aerobatic Championships in 2009 
We give a set of Shout Outs to:
The Flying Ant podcast by Anthony Crichton-Browne (a 767 pilot) who also has a blog
The Flaps Podcast from the UK is an awesome new show - we highly recommend it
Andrew Offen from Brisbane took Grant &amp; Nykolai for a flight in his Cirrus SR22 with the new Avidyne Release 9 package - an amazing aircraft &amp; systems and a lot of fun catching up with Andrew for a flight
Brendan Viti is getting his IFR rating - wow!



Please note that our sound effects come from SoundSnap.com and our theme music track is âYouNameIt5â³ by Brian Simpson (aka t3cat5).</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Back in March we attended the Centenary Air Show at Melton airport near Diggers Rest (a short drive from Melbourne). In addition to being a great air show that celebrated 100 years of powered flight in Australia, this was also the first event where we had media passes. We recorded lots of great interviews, caught up with Owen Zupp and bumped into a few old friends.

It&#039;s now 6 months on and we&#039;re finally getting an episode out with these interviews plus a wrap-up chat we had with Owen Zupp after he finished his &quot;There and Back&quot; fund raising flight around Australia. We&#039;ve been meaning to get this content out for a while but have had so many other things to do, it just kept getting put on the back burner.

Finally we&#039;re able to present these interviews along with a more recent chat we had with Glyn Butchard, the organiser of the Centenary Air Show. We caught up with him this month and discussed how everything went once the dust settled and the people went home.

Here&#039;s a list of the interviews &amp; chats we present in this episode:
Chris Sperou and Warren Stewart are the &quot;Skyblazers&quot; formation team
Bernie Ferrie flew in a Citabria and we chatted with him while sitting under its wing 
Clin Ashton-Martin flies a gorgeous Avro Cadet biplane
Grant&#039;s friend Andrew Temby flew an aerobatics routine with his Yak-52TW so we had a quick chat while sitting on its wing
Phil, Mark &amp; Shane who were providing unicom &amp; air show coordination services
Grant had a quick chat with Glyn Butchard at the end of the day as everyone was leaving
Steve &amp; Grant have a recent chat with Glyn Butchard and we look back at how it went in the months after the show 
We chat with Owen Zupp about how things are going after his &quot;There and Back&quot; fundraising flight around Australia
We give a quick shout-out to Peter Johnson from the UK who is now producing the &quot;Across the Pond&quot; segment for the Airplane Geeks show

NOTE: Additional music in this show was from Glenne Petersen&#039;s &quot;Empty Cars&quot;</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>This episode we&#039;re joined by Will Horton from the Wings Down Under blog to chat about recent aviation news items. We also have Anthony Simmons returning for another View from the Lounge segment and a chat with Damien Rose about his flight training up in Toowoomba. The episode wraps up with some listener mail and a shout out so it&#039;s a little long but that should make up for the three Election QuickCast episodes we released recently :)

The list of topics we discussed with Will Horton include:
A review of the recent Asia/Pacific Aviation Outlook Summit in Sydney
The Asia/Pacific outlook for airlines includes a prediction for strong growth
&quot;Buy local&quot; for Russia (Sukhoi) &amp; China (Comac) plus India building up its local aeronautics capabilities along with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra buying into Australian aviation companies such as Gippsland Aeronautics
Cathay Pacific&#039;s Boeing 777-300 and Airbus A350-900 order
V Australia&#039;s 777 useage in Fiji &amp; Bali plus the use of wide bodies (eg: 767/A330) on domestic routes due to slot restrictions
Qantas wanting to fly 787s into China &amp; on to Europe
Jetstar being boosted over Qantas (if it&#039;s new it&#039;s JQ) and using Singapore as a hub into Europe
Qantas&#039;s new smart card system for check-in that relies on elite frequent flyers who are with Qantas, not Jetstar
AirAsia setting up a Frequent Flyer program
Crawford Rix @ Tiger Airways is against frequent flyer programs as they&#039;re anticompetitive and is hinting that Tiger could go down the RyanAir path (standing seats, pay loos, etc) - at least for the publicity :)
Customers in Australia and Asia/Pacific wanting a higher level of standards
Tiger setting up a franchise in Thailand (51% Thai owned but still Tiger Thailand)
China more likely to have standing seats as the Chinese can lay down the law for their own operations - no need to align with FAA/EASA standards  although they&#039;re investing in highspeed trains)
AirAsia wants to enter the Australian domestic &amp; trans-tasman market
The high quality of the AirAsia experience (a discount carrier that doesn&#039;t nickle &amp; dime their passengers) will hit Jetstar hard
Pacific Blue is pulling out of the New Zealand domestic market
Repurposing of V Australia&#039;s 777s off the Fiji route
United is not worried about Delta-V
Qantas&#039; financial results


Steve &amp; Grant also talk afterwards about Virgin Blue&#039;s financial results which came out after we spoke with Will, along with their news about adding A330s, dropping the E170s (while keeping the E190s) and linking up with Etihad.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>In our third &amp; final Election QuickCast, we take a look at the published transportation policies from the The Greens and the Labor Party&#039;s &quot;Aviation White Paper.&quot; Sadly, Christine Milne from the Greens and Anthony Albanese from Labor were unable to accommodate us in their busy schedules. Both groups have indicated that they&#039;ll be happy to talk to us once the dust has settled from the election so we look forward to bringing them on for future episodes.

Meanwhile, Steve &amp; I didn&#039;t have much time for a full analysis &amp; discussion but we did record our thoughts on the information we could gather. As you&#039;d expect, the Greens are very much into public transport and eco-friendly fuels while the Labor party are standing very firmly behind their Aviation White Paper. 

As previously noted, we&#039;re not trying to tell you how to vote, just doing our bit to raise awareness of the importance of aviation within the political community and hopefully give you some information that might help you make an informed decision.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Australians are about to go to the election booths on Saturday 21st August so we&#039;re working to bring our listeners information about the aviation policies of the various political parties. We&#039;re not trying to tell you how to vote, just doing our bit to raise awareness of the importance of aviation within the political community and hopefully give you some information that might help you make an informed decision.

In our second Election QuickCast, we&#039;re taking to two representatives from one of Australia&#039;s more &quot;interesting&quot; parties. This party approaches politics from the small business and civil liberties environment and has a rather distinctive, catchy and memorable name: The Australian Sex Party.

We were fortunate enough to speak with Ken Hill and Tim Sheen about their views on the current election, Australian politics and aviation. Ken is a private pilot in Melbourne who is working on the party&#039;s aviation &amp; transportation policies while Tim Sheen is a candidate for the Sex Party in Queensland and also a commercial pilot flying in the New Guinea area.

The discussion covers a lot of issues that are of importance to pilots within Australia and raises a number of the problems currently facing people who are trying to make a living in this industry.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Australians are about to go to the election booths on Saturday 21st August so we&#039;re working to bring our listeners information about the aviation policies of the various political parties. We&#039;re not trying to tell you how to vote, just doing our bit to raise awareness of the importance of aviation within the political community and hopefully give you some information that might help you make an informed decision.

In our first Election QuickCast, we&#039;re interviewing Warren Truss, the leader of the National Party and shadow minister for trade, transport and local government. Warren was gracious enough to give us some time to talk about his interest in aviation as well as his party&#039;s views on the importance of aviation to Australia, the cost of flying, airspace safety, airport encroachment and ways to get more people flying. We even touch on high speed rail and how it stands compared to airlines. We also discover that Warren&#039;s a bit of an aircraft lover and has a good collection of models in his office.

We&#039;re working with the other parties to see if we can get time with their representatives before the election. Everyone is, of course, extremely busy in the final days of meeting constituents, appearing at events and being in the media. Watch the space to see who else we can get for you :)</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Dick Smith is an entrepreneur well known to most Australians, ranging from the country wide chain of Dick Smith Electronics stores he created to Dick Smith Foods and Australian Geographic. 

Another very important aspect of Dick&#039;s life has revolved around aviation. In addition to owning &amp; flying his own aeroplanes &amp; helicopters, he has also flown around the world multiple times, made the first helicopter landing at the North Pole, and flown balloons across Australia as well as from New Zealand back to Australia (against the prevailing winds). He was on the board of (and then director of) both the Civil Aviation Authority and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). Dick is also a very vocal champion of air space reform in Australia and aviation safety in general.

We were very fortunate to have been given some of Dick&#039;s valuable time to discuss his early days learning to fly, his adventuring around the world and his thoughts on a number of different aircraft he&#039;s owned &amp; flown. We also touch briefly on his time with the CAA/CASA and his thoughts on aviation safety &amp; airspace reform, all of which will be covered in more detail in future interviews we hope to bring you as soon as Dick&#039;s schedule permits.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Air Venture: Oshkosh is the place to be if you&#039;re into aviation. There&#039;s something for everyone from home builts to military to warbirds to commercial to seaplanes to antiques to balloons and everything else imaginable. If you love aviation, you have to get to Oshkosh.

For the past four years a group of aviation podcasters have been gathering to produce the &quot;Podapalooza&quot; session. Imagine a room full of people and a table at one end packed with many of the people behind the voices in your head. All hanging out, talking about flying, aviation topics and social media. Pure podcasting fun :)

Since we started Plane Crazy Down Under, we&#039;ve tried twice but never been able to make it to Oshkosh.  Back in 2009, Stephen Force of the Airspeed podcast took a quick &quot;Hello Oshkosh&quot; piece we produced and had it played at the Podapalooza and on the EAA radio show during the event.

This year we couldn&#039;t make it again (DOH!) so we put another promo together. It&#039;s longer but encapsulates what we&#039;ve been up to for the past year. They played part of it at the Podapalooza so we&#039;re adding the original piece to our feed so you can hear how we tried to get there but couldn&#039;t quite make it.

Maybe 2011 will be &quot;third time&#039;s the charm&quot; and we&#039;ll get there at last? :)</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>It seems that Grant has always had troubles with the label &quot;Flight Attendant&quot; ever since his sister joined Australian Airlines and mistakenly told him she would be a &quot;Trolley Dolly.&quot; Ooops :)

In this episode we&#039;re joined by Janene Murdoch, Tania Tracey and Amelia Kelly. Janene used to be a flight attendant with Ansett in the 70&#039;s &amp; 80&#039;s, Tania was with Australian Airlines &amp; Qantas in the 90&#039;s and Amelia is currently working in the industry. We have a great chat with them comparing &quot;then &amp; now&quot; in recruitment, work environments, passenger expectations and challenges.

It was a great chat and we hope to have the ladies back with us again in the future to continue exploring the &quot;then &amp; now&quot; of being a flight attendant.

For those of you who want to keep up with Amelia&#039;s latest news, you can follow her on Twitter (traytablestrvls) or through her blog (Tray Tables Travels).</itunes:summary>

This episode we have a good chat with Matt Hall about exactly what happened during his splash in Windsor (including what was going through his mind at the time), the physics of a G-Stall, where the Red Bull Air Race folks dredged up the &quot;two prior incidents&quot; they mentioned, how the other pilots reacted to the news and what Matt&#039;s learned from all of this.

Great listening and very educational, especially on the subject of how even a top-notch pilot like  Matt can help make the holes in the swiss cheese align.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>These days it&#039;s quite common to find ladies in command of commercial airliners, bizjets and combat aircraft. Thirty years ago, however, this was certainly not the case here in Australia and a female required a stubborn streak &amp; thick skin to push through and gain acceptance in a very male dominated world.

While the situation for ladies in aviation is still not completely balanced it is significantly improved over the scene in the mid-70s. One reason for that improvement was thanks to the efforts of Deborah Lawrie (aka Deborah Wardley) who was the first female pilot with Ansett Airlines, one of Australia&#039;s biggest airlines until it&#039;s demise in 2001.

Deborah&#039;s story is one of determination and a drive to achieve her goals, no matter what obstacles society and some organisations put in her path. We are fortunate enough in this episode to have had Deborah join us for a great chat about her interest in aviation, learning to fly, her early commercial days, getting into Ansett, the Australian Pilots&#039; Dispute of 1989 and her subsequent career working with KLM before returning to Australia where she is currently working with Jetstar as their manager of Safety Investigations (while still also flying their A320s).

It&#039;s an incredible chat and we think that in addition to learning about Deborah&#039;s life, you&#039;ll also learn a lot about the Australian airline environment of the past &amp; present.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>This episode we feature an interview with Hannes Arch, the Austrian Red Bull champion in 2008 who came second in 2009 and is currently second on points for 2010. We have a great chat with Hannes about his involvement in extreme sports, his love of flying and his approach to the Red Bull racing world.

We were also fortunate to get some time with Gary Clark, the creator of the Swamp cartoon strip. Gary&#039;s experiences in learning to fly and his on going adventures in the air have provided a solid source of inspiration for many of the characters &amp; moments depicted in the Swamp series. It is not uncommon to find his cartoons on the walls in flying clubs &amp; schools, hangars and aviation organisations. 

This episode also includes the following:
A discussion with Angie Morino from Aus Air Services about the changes they&#039;ve made at the Tooradin Flying School (YTDN). 
Grant&#039;s quick chat with Richard Turnbull, a hot air balloon pilot from the UK 
Anthony Simmons&#039; latest View from the Lounge segment 
Our listener mail, including:
Stephen Silk points us at Ask the Pilot 
Steven Pam provides still more checklist examples 
Trent Donnovan from WA shows that Jandakot (YPJT) is only just behind Bankstown (YSBK) for total movements in February
We give a few shout outs:
The Airplane Geeks podcast reaches 100 episodes - well done guys! 
We&#039;ve launched our PCDU Commentaries blog 
Kathy Mexted mentioned us in her article about the Melton Centenary Air Show that appeared in AOPA&#039;s Australian Pilot magazine 
Milford &amp; Charlie from the Flight Time Radio Show over in Florida 
Don&#039;t forget to give PCDU a good comment (or two :) ) over at the iTunes store</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>In this episode we join noted aviation journalist Ben Sandilands from Plane Talking to review the latest news &amp; information. When we called Ben, he was experiencing a heat wave of 11 degrees Celsius at his home in the mountains near Canberra. Meanwhile, here in Melbourne we were thinking winter was upon us as the temperature dipped to 15 degrees Celsius. Four degrees of separation but a very different pair of perspectives on cold vs hot. 

Fortunately, we were all spot on with our news analysis, including such topics as:

Use of composites in airliners and the indications that it won&#039;t really be effective for another 10 to 20 years
QANTAS still claiming that they&#039;re going to get their 787-9s on a date that would be before Air New Zealand (the launch customer) despite Boeing making a statement contradicting this
The changes that are afoot with the Virgin Blue group being under new leadership:
Brett Godfrey&#039;s farewell bash
John Borghetti not getting the top job at QANTAS but, perhaps, getting something better with running Virgin Blue
Fleet choices and the possibility that they&#039;ll get A330s or B767s, especially on high density routes like Sydney to Melbourne 
The likelihood that they&#039;ll rebrand the group (Virgin Blue, V Australia, Pacific Blue, Polynesian Blue) under a single name
Singapore Airlines having veto rights over the name Virgin for any new international airline
Tiger Airways recording a profit and becoming more of a stable, solid threat in the market
Australia&#039;s transport minister Anthony Albanese wanting to restrict cockpit access to only the two pilots flying and any check pilots or safety reviewers
The F35 and how Australia seems to be one of the few countries NOT getting upset about all the delays and problems


After chatting with Ben, we have an interview with James Baldwin &amp; Glen Somerville from EmptyJets, an organisation that gives you the chance to get rides in charter aircraft that would otherwise be flying empty on positioning flights. From helicopters to Gulfstream Vs, they&#039;re all on the list and  well worth checking out.

After that we dive into the mail bag where:
Matt McCabe compares the cost of learning to fly here in Australia against the USA
Errol Cavit enjoyed the Red Bull show and will be catching up with us when he comes over from New Zealand (for a Sci Fi convention, no less)
Vince Bezzina who volunteers at the RAAF Museum at Point Cook was checking if we knew about the DC6 coming to Australia from South Africa. Oh yes, do we ever!

We also have a couple of shout outs to:
Damien Rose who is now a private pilot and on his way to a commercial license (and speaking of the cost of learning - Damien sold his house to fund all this! He must have a VERY understanding wife, that&#039;s for sure :)
Steve Cooke from the Flying Podcast in the UK has released his latest episode on a topic that&#039;s very important for Grant: ballooning</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>This episode features a discussion with Peter Gibson, the manager of corporate communications at CASA. He&#039;s joined us to explain the airspace changes that will come into effect on June 3rd, changes which will impact Class D, see the transition of GAAP to Class D and introduce the mandatory carriage of radios at all certified, registered or military non-towered aerodromes (plus any others as designated in the ERSA).

We also talk to Owen Zupp just before he departed on his There and Back trip around Australia as well as Tim Pryse and Ken Evers a few days prior to the start of their Millions Against Malaria trip around the world. We feature another &quot;View from the Lounge&quot; and introduce ATC_Ben&#039;s new &quot;Controllers Corner&quot; segment.

As we wind up the show, we discuss the Australian Capital Territory funding yet another feasibility study for a much needed secondary airport near Canberra. You can read more about it in an news entry from Australian Aviation and also follow up progress through the Canberra Region Aviators Association web site.

If you want to see a 737-200 land at Jandakot (Perth&#039;s secondary airport),  check out the video of the landing that Ed Stubbs pointed us at. Not bad.

Just in time to make our cut off for this episode, we had a quick chat with Owen as he was half way around his trip. A great update on his progress and how things have been going.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>The Red Bull Air Race came back to Perth this year and Steve was there, flexing his newly minted press credentials and discovering the amazing world of the Red Bull media centre. Sadly, Grant was working in Indonesia and so couldn&#039;t be there to help hang out, rub shoulders with the stars and quaff a few cans of Red Bull.

Fortunately Steve was well &amp; truly up to the task and managed to capture a few interviews while he was there. First up in this episode we have Steve&#039;s summary of the race, including his interview with Hannes Arch, the press conference at the end of the race and a collection of content from the Red Bull Media Pool.

After the break we get to hear a great chat with Nigel Lamb recorded while he was in Rio getting ready for the third race. We learn about how he flies the race and just what benefit he is getting from those amazing winglets. Grant drops a clanger during the interview but fortunately Steve cut that bit out, putting it at the very end of the episode in the bloopers &#039;cos hey, no one ever listens to them, right? Right? (&quot;Please don&#039;t!&quot; says Grant) :)

The final pair of interviews are with Lenny Raulson, Matt Hall&#039;s mechanic at the time of the Perth race. He finished up with Matt&#039;s team just after the race and they&#039;ve now transitioned to an Australian mechanic, Jack Moshovis. After Steve&#039;s chat with Lenny, we have a chat with David Lyall, Matt&#039;s team coordinator. He tells us what it&#039;s like to work with Matt, why they changed from Lenny to Jack and much more.

We hope you enjoy the episode. Feel free to leave us feedback via email, comments on the site or on our forum on Downwind.com.au.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>The first aircraft to be used in Antarctica was Henry Mawson&#039;s Vickers REP monoplane. Sadly, it had been damaged in Australia before arriving in Antarctica and was used as an &quot;air tractor&quot; to pull sleds. Even that didn&#039;t work out and it was dumped,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>The first aircraft to be used in Antarctica was Henry Mawson&#039;s Vickers REP monoplane. Sadly, it had been damaged in Australia before arriving in Antarctica and was used as an &quot;air tractor&quot; to pull sleds. Even that didn&#039;t work out and it was dumped, eventually being found again only recently. 

Given that inauspicious start, it&#039;s hard to believe that there are multiple ice &amp; snow runways in Antarctica receiving visits from C130s, C17s and now an Australian A319 carries scientists on regular flights to the ice. It is also possible to go on one of the QANTAS sight seeing flights that are proving to be very popular with their great views of the ice &amp; mountains.

With all this in mind, we decided to put together a special episode focusing on the land that&#039;s even more &quot;down under&quot; than we are. To kick things off we have an interview with Captain Dan Colborne of Skytraders. Dan flies the Airbus A319/ACJ from Australia to the Wilkins Blue Ice runway in Australian Antarctic territory. He also flies the CASA 212-400 aircraft that are based in Antarctica for the summer, including the long ferry flights at the start &amp; end of the season.

We chat with David Vanderhoof about Air New Zealand Flight 901, the DC-10 that tragically crashed on Mount Erebus during a sight seeing tour over Antarctica in the 70&#039;s. We also discuss some of the other runways on Antarctica and the aircraft that visit them.

The final section in this episode has a discussion with Phil Asker from The Captain&#039;s Choice Tours and Croydon Travel who has been arranging Antarctic sight seeing flights for many years. Working with QANTAS, the flights are in Boeing 747 or Airbus A380 aircraft and are very much in demand, especially the New Years Eve flight.

We talk with Phil about what&#039;s involved in preparing the flights and what passengers can expect to encounter. We also talk with David Halls about what it was like as a passenger on the New Years Eve flight on Dec 31st, 2009. Finally, we prove that nepotism is alive &amp; well in podcasting by bringing Grant&#039;s sister Tania on the show to talk about her time working as a Trolley Dolly (sorry, Flight Attendant) on an Antarctic flight. She also gives Steve LOTS of material to use against Grant, much of it unfit for public consumption (even in the outtakes).

So, put your survival suit on and prepare to meet some penguins as we talk about Antarctica.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Some in-cockpit audio provided by a listener triggered a discussion on the differences in pre-landing checklists (GUMPS vs BUMFTH vs BUMFOH vs whatever). All of Grant&#039;s aviation books &amp; manuals are still in boxes after moving house so he had to rely on his memory with predictable results. Talk about incentive to go out and get current again...

Given we couldn&#039;t do a whole episode around the concept of &quot;gas&quot; in different countries, we also discuss recent aviation news items (so many to chose from lately) and have a collection of interviews we recorded at the RAAF&#039;s Air Pageant at Point Cook.

Here&#039;s how the episode hangs together this time:
We have yet another opinionated discussion on recent news items:
QANTAS are very much in the news due to an engineering dispute and maintenance woes
Qantas jumbo with damaged engine lands safely at Sydney airport (Steve Creedy @ The Australian)
Tyres burst on Qantas A380 (Australian Aviation)

CASA are converting our GAAP airports to Class D in June. Have you booked in to attend one of their workshop seminars on the transition? You&#039;d better. Check out the CASA web page about the transition. 
We shamelessly rip off UCAP&#039;s &quot;Off field landing of the week&quot; segment
Plane lands on Hobart highway (Yahoo! 7 News)
Pilot praised over highway crash landing (ABC News)

We recorded a few interviews with pilots at the RAAF&#039;s Air Pageant at Point Cook airbase
Jim &amp; Jenny Wickham (Yak9 &amp; Robinson R22)
Jim Whalley (CA-13 Boomerang)
Murray Colquhoun (chief experimental test pilot with Pilatus &amp; the PC21)
Anthony Simmons returns with his &quot;View from the Lounge&quot; segment
What&#039;s in our mailbag for this episode?
Luke Harris raises the issue of laser pointers being used to tag aircraft
Bob Livingstone makes some comments about the B24
Damien Rose provides some in-cockpit audio (we play his intro but the cockpit audio is at the end of the episode)
We definitely have some shout outs this episode
Marty at Flight.org has been of great assistance to us, helping to promote the podcast &amp; much more
Thanks to those folks mentioning @pcdu in their Follow Friday tweets
Check out errolwi on Twitter for his tweets while at the Warbirds over Wanaka air show in New Zealand (and yes, you&#039;re welcome for the F18s :)
Good luck to Zyola from the Mile High Flyers podcast as she&#039;s going through the &quot;joys&quot; of losing her job recently. We also want to know if our photos on our About us page scared off her friends who thought our accents were cool/hot/sexy :)
Thanks to Stuart Stevenson of the Pilots Journey podcast for setting up the Aviation Podcasts Network aggregator site

		<itunes:summary>The B24 Liberator was the most produced heavy bomber of World War 2 and saw service in all theaters of the war. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew B24s along side those of the USAAF, based in northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. These aircraft flew long range missions of many hours duration, typically without fighter escort. Providing bombing, maritime patrol and transport services, the advanced &amp; complicated B24 was, perhaps, the unsung hero of heavy bomber operations.  

Very few of these aircraft still exist (see the list of remaining B24s) and in Australia, only a single example remains. It is currently being restored by a group of dedicated and passionate individuals, many of whom flew B24s during or immediately after the war.

Based in Werribee, just outside Melbourne, the Australian B24 Restoration project is definitely worth visiting and supporting. We were fortunate to visit the team, admire the aircraft and interview John Temby (President of the association) and Ed Crabtree (ex B24 pilot). Another trip down is currently being planned and we expect to have more great content from the restoration team in a later episode.</itunes:summary>

We then chat with Ken Evers &amp; Tim Pryse, a couple of local lads who are going to fly a Gippsland Aeronautics GA-8 Airvan around the world to raise funds to help fight against malaria. You can read more about their epic journey at Millions Against Malaria.

We also give a few shout outs &amp; read some mail:
Tom for listening to all 25 episodes in less than a week - now *that&#039;s* masochism :)
Steve Cooke in the UK and his Flying Podcast that gives a great perspective on flying in the UK and Europe.
Christie Walker who we&#039;ll be chatting to soon and is interested in learning more about Australian airline cadet pilot programs
Grant&#039;s sorry for being behind on all the emails that have come in

We&#039;ve also got another great discussion with Owen Zupp as his trip around Australia draws closer, a quick chat we recorded with David Optimal (one of our listeners) and Bas Scheffers returns (at last) with his friend John Squires to tell us about a fly-away trip they did not too long ago.

Here&#039;s how this episode unfolds:
Here&#039;s a &quot;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot&quot; for you: man attacks plane with machete to prevent his bride-to-be from leaving him.
Fleeing bride&#039;s plane attacked with machete
Man hit plane with machete 
 We have a discussion with Owen Zupp about
His trip around Australia (There &amp; Back)
Flying the DA20 &amp; DA40
ADSB in Australia and flying RNP approaches
What it was like to fly with Matt Hall 
We introduce Anthony Simmons and his amusing view on commercial flying in the new segment: &quot;View from the Lounge&quot; 
we recorded a quick chat with listener David Optimal in Steve&#039;s PCDU-Mobile when he came down to visit us and the airports around Melbourne 
David Vanderhoof presents another great Aviation History segment 
Bas Scheffers returns with his friend John Squires to tell us about how the Aeroscene Flying Group arranged a fly-in at the Asses Ears Lodge at the Grampians Airfield in Victoria. They also chat briefly about the Parafield Airshow they&#039;re organising for April 2010.

		<itunes:summary>Yes, Steve &amp; Grant are Fan Boys (big Fan Boys, in fact :) and this episode we demonstrate it once again by interviewing Matt Hall and hanging out with some more fans at the Flight Experience Melbourne Facebook fan page open night in their 737 flight simulator.

Shout outs
Congratulations to Jack Seymour in Wangaratta for doing his trial introductory flight in a Eurofox. You can read about his adventures in flight at his blog: StudentFlight.
Thanks to Brendan from Essendon (YMEN) for letting Grant tag along when he went flying out to Tooradin (YTDN). While he didn&#039;t get atthe controls, being in the backseat of a C172 is still flying :)
We have a discussion on our forum about where to find the best coffee at airports.

		<itunes:summary>Despite the annoying habit of our &quot;day jobs&quot; and  families encroaching into our PCDU time, we&#039;ve finally managed to get some time to record an episode. Steve even managed a marathon effort of post production to edit a coherent episode from our opinionated news discussion and an interview with Saj Ahmad. Go Steve! :)

Despite my best efforts to drone on endlessly, Steve&#039;s also managed to keep the episode under 2 hours, but not by much. Hopefully this will give you heaps of fun listening as you travel to &amp; from work, mow the lawns or do your household chores :)

		<itunes:summary>For the majority of our listeners it&#039;s warm and getting warmer down here in the Southern Summer with Christmas just around the corner. Not so in London where it&#039;s bleak and somewhat miserable (and that&#039;s the economy, let alone the weather). Saj Ahmad from FleetBuzz Editorial is based in London and recently returned from the scorching skies of Dubai where he&#039;d been attending the Dubai Airshow 2009. Saj generously took some time away from his family to record with us last Sunday (morning his time, evening our time), trying not to look out the window at the winter weather while we discussed the warmth Melbourne was experiencing. The discussion covers the Dubai Airshow,  Middle East airlines and their flights to Australia, aircraft orders and the (then) pending first flight of the 787. It&#039;s an enlightening chat and we&#039;ll be sure to have Saj on again early in the new year.

In addition to our chat with Saj, we also recorded some news items to round out the episode. We actually recorded these on the same day the 787 flew and, thanks to the miracle of modern technology, have spliced it all together into a single show. Neat, hey! :)

Topics in this episode include:
The 787 finally flew - you can check out Boeing&#039;s &#039;first flight&#039; site for all the videos
Jet star&#039;s check-in system goes down and then a few days later, so does Virgin Blue&#039;s:
Check-in system problem delays Jetstar flights (Steve Creedy @ The Australian)
Airport chaos as system goes down (ABC News)
Stranded airline passengers booked into hotels (ABC News)
Expect major delays, Virgin tells passengers (ABC News)
Airline struggles to clear backlog of flights (ABC News)
Former doctor Geoffrey Edelsten crashes his helicopter on his first solo
Lucky escape as Edelsten&#039;s chopper crashes (ABC News)
Geoffrey Edelsten in helicopter crash landing at Moorabbin Airport  (Wayne Flower @ The Herald Sun)
Delta &amp; V Australia tighten their alliance in steps towards the full Delta-V marriage

		<itunes:summary>As part of the recent Show us ya Wheels event in Numurkah the PCDU team attended  a memorial tribute dinner for Pip Borman, a famous Australian aerobatics pilot from Shepparton who died in a crash during a photo shoot flight. The presentations at the dinner included speaches from David Fertel at Castrol and Julian Frazier from QBE Insurance along with a keynote presentation from Matt Hall, Australia&#039;s only Red Bull Air Race pilot.

There is a video clip of Pip Borman flying the Pitts Samson on YouTube that is well worth watching. The Samson is a radial powered aerobatic biplane (truely a &quot;muscle plane&quot;) and the video gives you an idea of what it is capable of. It was shot at Shepparton airport (YSHT) only a week before Pip crashed in it.
 
We were fortunate to be allowed to record the speaches and have been given permission to include them in the episode. It was a great night and we&#039;re glad that we are able to bring you along for part of it.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>If you&#039;ve ever looked skyward in Sydney, there&#039;s a high chance you&#039;ve seen a bright red aircraft with old-style German crosses on the wings. Originally flying an old Tiger Moth, the Red Baron flew out of Bankstown and gave joy flights to members of the public, flying over Sydney&#039;s beaches and occasionally doing aerobatics.

Roll forward to today and Red Baron scenic &amp; aerobatic flights is now owned by Joel Haski (RedBaronSydney on Twitter) with a number of aircraft, including Pitts Specials, Robins/Alphas, an Extra and a new Airvan. Some are painted in Red Baron colours while others fly under the Red Bull logos.



We were fortunate enough to get some of Joel&#039;s time for a chat about his flying history, running the Red Baron operation, being involved with Red Bull and the recent New South Wales Aerobatic competition.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>How many of you folks have wanted to be Air Traffic Controllers? Do you dream of Pushing Tin around the skies? Think you can keep The Flick in your head? Want to tell pilots in aircraft of all sizes where to go? (ahem! :) Steve &amp; Grant both applied for ATC and were both knocked back for a number of reasons. Fortunately, we know a couple of guys who weren&#039;t.

Join us as we chat with Ben Ippolito (the Ipanator) and Jeremy Peck, discussing being selected for ATC, the long hard slog of learning &amp; practicing in the simulator and the terrors (ummm, joys) of taking their first few steps in the real world outside of the academy. 

We also discuss GAAP changes, oceanic control, airspace classes, working with the RAAF and much more. 

You can find out more about becoming an Air Traffic Controller on the Air Services ATC page. Recruitment for the 2010 class closes by January 3rd.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>A recent event at Oshkosh has been the Podapalooza &quot;gathering of aviation podcasters&quot; where attendees get to meet some of the voices in their heads. Much as we would have loved to go to Oshkosh this year and attend Podapalooza, it&#039;s a long long way to swim from down here so all we could do was listen to the other podcasters talking about how they were going and gnash our teeth while trying not to stomp on our iPods.

Fortunately for us, Stephen Force of the Airspeed podcast told us he was willing to smuggle in a short &quot;Hey there&quot; piece for us and get it played at the event. Well, not only was he able to smuggle it in, he even got it played on EAA radio. Wow! Thanks Steve - yet more beers we owe you when we meet!

For those of you who, like us, couldn&#039;t be there and couldn&#039;t listen to the live feed, here&#039;s the little greeting we recorded for everyone at Podapalooza 2009.</itunes:summary>
