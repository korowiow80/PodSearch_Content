			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in a fast-paced world and we are often asked to play many different roles in our life.  And with each role comes responsibilities and tasks.  You might be a husband, wife, father, mother, boss, football coach, yoga instructor, brother, son, dog&#8217;s best friend, etc.  The list goes on and on and with each of these roles comes the correlated responsibilities.  Often, you probably feel like you are running just to stand still.  Life is busy, and if you are anything like me, by the end of the day, you are exhausted.  The fact is we only have so much energy, motivation, and will power.  At the beginning of the day, you might have every intention to work on &#8220;your dream&#8221; (perhaps writing a book, figuring out how to get enrolled in college, building a website, designing a business plan, creating a savings plan, etc.) for a few hours, or even one hour, each night before you go to bed, but perhaps by the time you get to that final hour of the day, you might not have the energy to work on it, so&#8230;.you don&#8217;t.  As a result, days go by, even years, and you are stuck in the daily whirlwind of life.  Here is the secret to the difficult task of managing the daily whirlwind and building a new dream: you must step out of the daily whirlwind and make time for your goals and dreams and if you want to do yourself a favor, schedule that time in the morning or during the day while you have the energy to work on it.  If you save it for the last thing to do on your daily to-do list, I am going to put my money on the fact that 8 out of 10 times you won&#8217;t end up working on it.  Remember, you only have so much energy, so it is important to be realistic, understand your physical limits, and adjust accordingly.  It is very easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life.  During this segment, Rebekah talks about the importance of stepping out of the daily whirlwind to make time for your goals and dreams.   Make your dreams a priority in your daily life.  If you don’t, you won’t ever achieve them.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many the &#8220;how&#8221; of being successful is the most elusive aspect of success.  Success is easy to define, it is easy to recognize, and it is easy to have it as a goal, but knowing how to be successful is often the missing piece for a lot of folks.  As a teenager, I just wanted someone to tell me how to be successful.  I was willing to do whatever it took, but getting answers to the how wasn&#8217;t easy.  I didn&#8217;t know where to start and I didn&#8217;t know what differentiated someone who was successful compared to someone who wasn&#8217;t.  Often times, on the surface these two people were doing similar things, but come to find out, underneath it all, there were huge differences.  During this podcast, Rebekah talks about the importance of understanding and attaining more information related to &#8220;how&#8221; to be successful.  She talks about her personal journey of better understanding how to be successful, and she introduces her 145 page &#8221;how-to&#8221; manual to success.  She offers her podcast listeners a huge discounted price by going to this webpage <a href="http://www.playerplaza.com/podcastpromo.html">http://www.playerplaza.com/podcastpromo.html</a> . Take a listen and check out her &#8220;how-to&#8221; manual for success.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I found myself staring at this one particular tree as it swayed flexibly in the wind.  It was amazing to notice how flexible this tree actually was and how the trunk and its branches worked together to literally &#8220;go with the flow&#8221;.  As I sat and watched this, I realized that its flexibility was its strength to survival and played a huge part in maintaining its existence in this strong wind.  Of course, my mind quickly correlated this observation to our human experience.  It made sense to me that it was necessary for this tree to be flexible in order to survive, and it makes sense for us to do the same.  If this tree were rigid and used every ounce of its energy to hold itself against the wind and not move, it would eventually give way and break.  I correlate this idea to the principle of persistence.  Persistence is a great quality, but if you find yourself being rigid and doing the same thing and not getting the results you want, I correlate that to a rigid tree not being flexible in crappy weather.  Albert Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.  During this segment, Rebekah talks about the fact that persistence isn’t enough to get you on the road to success.  You need much more than that.  Rebekah talks about the importance of making adjustments and coupling your persistence with experimentation and thinking outside the box.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On your road of success, it is important to understand the power of your mindset.  The reality is that you first create your own mindset, then your mindset takes over the power and begins to create who you are.  It can be a very beneficial and positive dance between you and your mindset or it can be a very unhappy, destructive, and unproductive dance that leaves you on the road of broken dreams.  During this podcast session, Rebekah talks about the power behind your mindset and how it drives the &#8220;effects&#8221; in your life.  You learned about cause and effect relationships in elementary school, but you might not fully understand how simple cause and effect relationships are playing out in your life.  Ultimately your mindset is the &#8220;cause&#8221; behind every &#8220;effect&#8221; you experience in your life.  She explains that until you address the underlying causes behind the visual &#8220;effects&#8221;, you won&#8217;t be able to create longlasting change in your life.  As a result, you will continue to get the results that you have always got.  Listen to this podcast to better understand how to effectively change your life.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every single one of us “talks to our self”, and how we talk to our self greatly impacts our potential, level of success, and happiness attained in this life.  That voice in your head is simply the sum of everyone, every thing, and every experience that you have absorbed throughout your life.  It is conditioned.  In reality, it is the smallest part of you, and in essence, is far from the real you, but a lot of us allow it to be the biggest part of ourselves.  On your road to success, it is important you have a clear understanding of what the voice is, where it originated from, where it gets its commands, and gain the ability to create some space between the real you and the voice in your head.  During this podcast, Rebekah sheds some light into what the voice is and how to alter it so that it doesn’t hold you back from your goals and dreams.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meditation is an excellent tool to learn how to focus your mind and control your thoughts.  Meditation is the art of not thinking.  Huh, who woulda thunk it? I know, it sounds a bit fishy, but trust me, once you add this practice into your daily life on a consistent basis, you will realize how better you feel and your improved results.  Unfortunately, too many of us walk around lost in thought, worry, or anxiety.  The more clouded your mind is the less success you will experience in your life.  In order for you to fully reach your potential and tap into your unlimited supply of creativity, abundance, and health, you have to be able to turn off the static and listen to the silence.  The secret is in the silence.  Turn off the world and see if you can sit there and spend just 15 minutes with yourself&#8230;.just breathing.  If I had to make a bet, I would bet that on your first try you can&#8217;t do it.  Don&#8217;t worry, it is expected, so keep working on it.  During this segment, Rebekah talks about the power of meditation, explains the benefits, and explains how to do it.
