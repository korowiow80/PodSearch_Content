    <title>Racism in America is Alive and Well (YBM Focus #42)</title>
    <description>Things are changing a little in light of Barack Obama being the president of the United States . However, racism, for the average black man in America, is still a reality and she ain't going nowhere. You need to hear that in the raw because it is very true, and because there are many who will not impart to you that truth.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
While I was growing up, no one, straight out, told me that racism still existed. It wasn't until I was a grown man did I fully realize that racism and prejudice were still around and deeply rooted in American society. Do not believe the lie that race relations are getting better. They are not! In fact, they are getting worse and more subtle, and will continue to get worse. Get it in your head: RACISM IS ALIVE AND WELL AND SHE AIN'T GOING NOWHERE! Why is racism here to stay? Here are some things you need to understand.

    <title>On Your Relationship With Your Children Still (YBM Focus #41)</title>
    <description>Today's broadcast is titled &quot;On Your Relationship With Your Children Still&quot;. This is the tenth and final letter in our current series titled &quot;On Your Life and Vital Relationsips&quot;. In this letter, my father writes:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want to talk with you about something that many people do not like to discuss with young black men, but something that needs to be addressed—that is the subject of children before marriage. If you are not married, do not engage in the activity that causes children to come before marriage. If however, you already have children outside of marriage, allow me to say a word to you regarding that.

    <title>On Your Relationship With Your Grandparents (YBM Focus #40)</title>
    <description>I would like to mention to you the great value of your grandparents. If your grandparents are living, you have a tremendous treasure in your life. If you have great grandparents you have a greater treasure. Sit down and talk with your grandparents. Some of the most intriguing conversations that I have ever had have been with my grandfather and my two grandmothers. They are my link to the past as to how it really was “back when”, and also they are a great help to my knowing who I am and where I came from. Here are some things you can do to reap jewels from your ancestors:

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to say some things to you regarding your son or son to be. The greatest gift that you will ever receive in this life will be the gift of children. Even though you will love all of your children just the same, your daughters will hold a very special place in your heart, and although in a different way, your son or sons will hold a very special place in your heart as well.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Do not take having a son lightly.This is a very special gift in your life. Here are some of the benefits of having a son: (a) He will carry on your name; (b) He will carry on the, hopefully, positive things that you instill in him; (c) He will more than likely carry on your resemblance so that when people see him, they see you; (d) He will teach what you have taught him.

    <title>On Your Relationship with Your Daughter (YBM Focus #35)</title>
    <description>I do not think there is a sweeter relationship on God’s earth than the relationship of a father and his daughter. When I think of my daughters, I think of sunshine, joy, smiles, blessings, and happiness. My daughters can lift my spirits more than anything or anyone on earth can. If I allow myself to do so, I could very easily become the proverbial father that is wrapped around his little girls’ fingers. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Notice with me the great value of a daughter. Besides your wife, no one can comfort you and cheer you like your daughter. Throughout your life you will find that: (1) She will be there for her father even when no one else will be there; and that (2) There is a special love in her heart for her father that, often times, cannot be shaken by anyone or anything. As her father, you have the opportunity to help shape her and mold her into being a great woman of God, as well as a great wife and mother, because you can give her some advice on these things from a perspective that her mother cannot. In you, she can see what a husband and father should be.

    <title>On Your Relationship With Your Mother (YBM Focus #34)</title>
    <description>Today's broadcast is titled &quot;On Your Relationship With Your Mother&quot;. This is the third letter in our current series titled &quot;On Your Life and Vital Relationsips&quot;. In this letter, my father starts out with Ephesians 6:2-3 which says, &quot;Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout Black American history, the mother has played a critical leadership role in most black homes. There are many reasons for that and I don't have time or space to get into those reasons now. Suffice it to say, our dear black mothers have had to take on that strong leadership role. It was thrust upon them. Thank God somebody did take that role, otherwise Black America would be in worse shape than what it is in now. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me throw in, however, that it is a new day now, and it is time for black men to rise up, to take responsibility, and to take their God-given role as the head of their households. It is time, also, for our women to let them. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Be that as it may, what kind of relationship ought you to have with your mother? What are your responsibilities and obligations to her? No matter your family situation, here are some things God commands you to do and that you ought to do out of love.

Let me throw in, however, that it is a new day now, and it is time for black men to rise up, to take responsibility, and to take their God-given role as the head of their households. It is time, also, for our women to let them. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Be that as it may, what kind of relationship ought you to have with your mother? What are your responsibilities and obligations to her? No matter your family situation, here are some things God commands you to do and that you ought to do out of love.

    <title>On Your Relationship With Your Father (YBM Focus #33)</title>
    <description>Today's broadcast is titled &quot;On Your Relationship With Your Father&quot;. This is the second letter in our current series titled &quot;On Your Life and Vital Relationsips&quot;. In this letter, my father starts out with two verses from the Holy Bible: 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proverbs 17:6 says &quot;Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.&quot;  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ephesians 6:2 says &quot;Honor thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will probably be tempted in your adolescent years to rebel against your father and to disrespect him. May I encourage you not to yield to that temptation because all it will bring you is trouble. Whatever the situation with your dad, whether he does right or not, still honour him as your father, and you will be blessed for doing so. Here are some ways in which you can honour your father:

    <title>On Your Relationship With Your Wife or Wife to Be (YBM Focus #32)</title>
    <description>May I encourage you to get married. Contrary to what many think, marriage can and should be a joy and a pleasure, not a pain and a burden. Do not judge marriage based on what you have seen of other people's marriages--even your parents or grandparents. Marriage can be and should be fun, and if you do it the right way, that is, God's way, it will be fun. Before I mention to you some points on how to have a happy and prosperous marriage, let me share some things with you on why you ought to get married.

    <title>Oh, the Joys I've Had (YBM Focus #30)</title>
    <description>In today's letter, which is titles &quot;Oh, the Joys I've Had&quot;, my father not only shares some of the blessings he has experienced in his life, he also share how you can be delivered from temporary happiness and have permanent joy in your life. In this letter, he writes:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Happiness depends on the happenings, but having joy does not depend on the circumstances. Joy comes from God and you better get some.”
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In my previous letter, I shared some of my mistakes, failures and troubles in hopes that you will not make them. Now, I want to share with you how God delivered me from fleeting happiness to permanent joy.Then, I want to share with you the three greatest joys of my life.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Up until December 19, 1979, at the age of nineteen, my happiness was dependent on what was happening. You know what I am talking about. You have been there. When I was a little boy, if the sun was shining and the sky was blue, I was happy; but if the clouds covered the sun and the day was overcast, I was sad. When I was playing football, I was happy; when I was made to go to choir rehearsal, I was sad. When I could stay at home and watch the Dallas Cowboys play, I was happy; when I had to go to church, I was sad. As I grew a little older, when I was drinking and partying, I was happy; the next day, I was sad. That was how I lived my life up until December 19, 1979, because on that memorable day I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Saviour.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, remember that I told you earlier how I used to hate preachers and churches. Well, on that night, December 19, 1979, a young man, by the name of Michael Lewis, came to my dorm room on Kessler Air Force Base around 8:00 p.m., and showed me from the Bible how to truly be saved from hell. Even though I had been in church all of my life, this was the first time anyone took the time to show me from the Bible how to be saved from hell. I accepted Jesus Christ that night and God completely filled my life with joy—“A joy the world can’t take away.” I am telling you the truth. That joy has never left me since I accepted Christ as my Saviour. Every day has been and is a sunshiny day, as far as I am concerned. It is truly a “joy unspeakable.” The Lord will do the same thing for you as well. There is nothing like having God’s joy. It will beat happiness every time.

    <title>Oh, the Troubles I've Seen, Part 3 (YBM Focus #29)</title>
    <description>In today's letter, my father continues to share some of the troubles he has experienced in his own life as a way to help us make the right decisions in our lives and not make some of the same mistakes. Our letter today is titled &quot;Oh, the Troubles I've Seen&quot; Part 3. It goes like this.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“One trouble with trouble is that it usually starts out like fun.”
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am sure I surprised and broke my mother’s heart many times as a teenager, but there were two instances, in particular, when I really broke her heart. I have already told you about one situation and that was when the young woman and I made the awful mistake of aborting that baby. What I didn’t tell you was that, for some strange reason, my mother went into my little gray safe that I kept under my bed in my bedroom, and she found the receipt from the doctor’s office. She was livid. She was speechless. She was so hurt she could not even bring herself to punish me for what I had done. I knew then I had hurt her deeply.

    <title>Oh, the Troubles I've Seen, Part 1 (YBM Focus #27)</title>
    <description>In today's letter, my father shares some of the troubles he has experienced in his own life as a way to help us make the right decisions in our own lives and not make some of the same mistakes. In fact, our letter today is titled &quot;Oh, the Troubles I've Seen&quot; Part 1, and here is what he wrote:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Job 14:1 says “Man that is born of woman is of few days, and full of trouble.” And Jesus said: “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some years ago, I preached a sermon entitled: Songs in the Night. In that sermon, I brought up the idea of God-ordained troubles and self-imposed troubles. Well, I have had some of both, but I am going to mainly deal with self-imposed troubles. In other words, I am going to deal with the troubles I brought upon myself. YBM, remember this:
“Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” —Galatians 6:7
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main trouble I brought upon myself stemmed from my bad attitude as a teenager.When I got into my early teens, I developed a very bad attitude—particularly toward my dad. I knew how to play the hate dad/love mom game very well. I don’t really know why I despised my dad so much during those days, other than the fact that he was a preacher. (But I will say this: if a father does not lead the family in the way he should, and if he does not spend quality time with his children, those children will probably grow up bitter toward him.)

“Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” —Galatians 6:7
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main trouble I brought upon myself stemmed from my bad attitude as a teenager.When I got into my early teens, I developed a very bad attitude—particularly toward my dad. I knew how to play the hate dad/love mom game very well. I don’t really know why I despised my dad so much during those days, other than the fact that he was a preacher. (But I will say this: if a father does not lead the family in the way he should, and if he does not spend quality time with his children, those children will probably grow up bitter toward him.)

    <title>Oh, the Mistakes I've Made (YBM Focus #26)</title>
    <description>Last week, we completed the series of letters from the book Letters to Young Black Men. And this week, we will begin the series of letters from Mo' Letters to Young Black Men. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this first letter, and in the next four, my father shares some of his own personal experiences in life as a way to help us make the right decisions in our own lives and not make some of the same mistakes. In fact, the first letter is titled &quot;Oh, the Mistakes I've Made&quot;, and in it he writes:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No one likes to admit to making mistakes. It is amazing what lengths we go to to try and cover up our mistakes and failures. Here are three reasons why it is a waste of time to try to cover up our mistakes and failures:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Covering up our sins and failures never causes us to prosper. Proverbs 28:13 says: “He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.”
2. People who are not transparent rarely help other people.
3. Many already have your number—you just don’t know that they do.

    <title>Think for Yourself! (YBM Focus #25)</title>
    <description>Today we are going to discuss briefly the importance of thinking for yourself! One of the saddest things that I see today is so many people who do not think for themselves, especially young black men. It is painful to watch so many gullible people be led astray. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Think for yourself! Be a leader instead of a follower. We have enough followers. These people let others think for them, speak for them and even do for them. Don’t allow yourself to get into that rut. Think for yourself. Be the leader that God wants you to be.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Simply because a person is older and in a position of authority and is considered a leader by many, does not mean he has to be your leader. His perceived high position by many does not mean his ideas, statements and direction are correct. Think for yourself!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, in order to learn how to think for yourself, you need to do at least three things:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. You need to size up every “leader” and his statements with the rule book: the Bible. You must see if what the person is saying is jiving with God’s eternal Word.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. You need to have a set of convictions about the issues of life based upon a biblical foundation. This way you are not swayed by every new wind of ideas that blow your way.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3. You need to examine what people say before you accept it “hook, line and sinker,” so to speak.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to keep from going down the wrong path, in order to protect your family, in order to be the leader that God wants you to be, you must think for yourself and take responsibility for your statements, decisions and actions.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My friend, trust me: it is much easier to be a follower than it is to be a leader. But it is much better to think for yourself and be the leader that God wants you to be — the leader who is going right and who is leading others right.

    <title>Women Folk! (YBM Focus #24)</title>
    <description>Today, I want to talk to you about one of the most important issues in life for the young black man or any man for that matter, and that is his relationship with the women folk. The older you get, the more you will realize how important it is to understand how to deal with women. A good woman can help you become a great success in life; a bad woman can not only make your life miserable, but she can ruin your life as well. It is as simple as that. Notice what the wisest man who ever lived said about women:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.” —Proverbs 12:4
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.” —Proverbs 23:27
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My dear brother, there are some things that you need to know about dealing with women folk that will help you avoid much trouble and sorrow, and that will help you find the right woman as your life’s mate. The following are some things that you will want to keep in mind as you deal with the women folk:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Understand that women are designed by God to be a help and a blessing to man, not a hinderance.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. Think with your big head; not with your little head. In other words, don’t let your life be driven by sex, but rather by God’s Word, and what is right. Too many young and old men today love sex more than they love God. My old school fellows and I used to call men like this “sex-whipped.” Well, it was a little bit more graphic than that, but I can’t go there here.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3. Everything that glitters ain’t gold. It is a tragedy, but true, that most pretty and fine women are not good for you. You had better learn and learn quickly to get past the exterior and find out about the interior. Beautiful women are a dime-a-dozen, seriously. God made them beautiful. But what you want, and what you had better get in a woman is a woman of virtue, integrity, trustworthiness and honor, if you want to have peace of mind in this life. Because if you fool around and get yourself a woman who is beautiful on the outside, yet on the inside she is full of lies, cheating, rebellion, stubbornness, disrespect, manipulation, etc., etc., you will have hell to pay! Mark my words. Notice what Solomon says on this subject from the Book of Proverbs in the Holy Bible:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.” —Proverbs 31: 30
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies.”  —Proverbs 31:10
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4. As you are in the process of looking for that special someone, please put God first and the search for the right lady second. Jesus said, “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.” (Matthew 6:33).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5. Don’t be afraid of women nor be intimidated by women. They are just women. Love them, talk to them, lead them, have fun with them, but don’t be afraid of them and don’t be intimidated by them, because as soon as a woman detects that you are afraid of her or intimidated by her, you are doomed.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6. I want to say to you also something that may be a shock to you, and that is: YOU ARE THE PRIZE TOO. Yes, to find a good woman is a prize indeed, but contrary to what one might think, it is also a prize for a woman to find a good man in this day and time. And considering the male/female ratio in the black community, a woman finding a good man is more of a prize. So don’t sell yourself short.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
7. Another secret item that will help you understand the women folk is the simple, untold, truth that women desire men just as much as men desire women I am not only talking about in emotional, financial and romantic ways, but physically as well. This is just a normal thing that our Creator put in both the male and the female. So do not buy the myth that you have to bow to women and beg her to get interested in</description>

    <title>How to be Really Cool (YBM Focus #23)</title>
    <description>Today, I would like to mention some things on this matter of “being cool.” Now you may think it strange that we are discussing the subject of being cool. But, in my opinion, being cool is important. In fact, being cool is a cool thing to do.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What coolness is not…
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now being cool is not necessarily wearing your cap on backwards, or having your pants hanging off your tail. Coolness is not necessarily having an N.B.A. jacket on twice your size. Coolness is not having three or four girlfriends and having babies by each of them. Being cool is not smoking, drinking and doing drugs. Coolness is not carrying a gun or being a part of a gang. It is not skipping school to hang with the boys. Friend of mine, I am not merely suggesting that these things are not cool. I know these things are not cool. Get away from foolishness and learn how to be really cool.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So what is real coolness?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Real coolness in my book is being prepared so that you will never look un-cool. Real coolness is being un-ruffled at the various vicissitudes of life. Brother-Friend, real coolness is that quiet confidence in knowing that God is in control and knowing that everything will be alright. Coolness is having inexplicable peace, joy and calmness even in the midst of the storms of life. God calls this peace and joy “Peace that passeth all understanding” (Philippians 4:7), and “joy unspeakable” (I Peter 1:8). To me, being cool is also being able to express yourself clearly even when you are under fire. Being cool is being able to keep your tongue under control even from defending yourself from the accusations of fools. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In closing, let me say that coolness is knowing what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Are you really “cool,” friend? Or do you just look cool?

This is what he said about those things: &quot;Sadly, some of the things that I am going to mention, I learned at H.K.C. — Hard Knocks College. And that is not the college to go to. Indeed, it is the college from hell. I hope that you will allow me to now be that sign post of wisdom I wish I had when I was your age. If you take heed of what I am going to say here, it will save you many heartaches and troubles...&quot;

    <title>The Value of Working Hard and Smart (YBW Focus #21)</title>
    <description>If you desire a college education, then you will have to work for it. If you desire to start a business, then you will have to work for it. If you desire to write a book, you will have to work. If you desire the “finer things in life,” you will have to work for them. Hard work pays great dividends. As Saint Paul said: “For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.”  (II Thessalonians 3:10)

    <description>Today, I just want to encourage you to learn more about your heritage and where you came from. This is more important than you may think. It is crucial to your self-esteem, confidence and vision for the future. You see, having knowledge of your history will help make you a wiser person today, and give you a better idea as to where to go in the future.

    <description>In today's broadcast, we are going to discuss the value of talking to and listening to every older black man past 50 years of age that you possibly can. I realize that you may feel more comfortable with those who are of the same age as you. However, may I suggest to you that it is very important that you spend some quality time talking to and listening to every older black man past fifty that you possibly can? These men will not claim perfection, nor will they claim to have it all together. Many of them will not have the educational background that you may have.
