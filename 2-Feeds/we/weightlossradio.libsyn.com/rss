        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Losing Weight is as easy as 1,2,3,4 

In order to lose weight you have to do four things. Most people focus only on one or two things, that's why they fail. Most people focus on either 1) eating right or 2) exercising more.

While those two things are the nuts and bolts to losing weight. There are two other elements that are just as important and without implementing them you are destined to fail. In order to successfully lose weight and keep it off you also must have 3) a support sytem and 4) an accountability system in place.

We discovered the importance of support and accountability during the time we owned a personal training studio. Our clients were able to stay compliant with their eating and exercise programs as long as a trainer was there to support them and keep them accountable. If a client ever left, they inevitably had a difficult time staying compliant and eventually gained the weight they had struggled so desperately to lose right back.

In order to make personal training (which is typically very expensive) more accessible to everyone we developed the Partner Power Weight Loss Program. Partner Power teaches you some of the pyschological dynamics that help trainers support their clients and keep them accountable. Obviously a partner is not a fitness trainer, but they can serve some if not most of the roles a trainer serves in the areas of support and accountability.

Through our live weekly radio show Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy which airs every Thursday in Atlanta, Georgia USA at 7PM EST (this podcast is an on-demand replay of our weekly weight loss radio show in its entirety) as well as our blog and our website we will be teaching our Partner Power weight loss philosophy in order to educate, motivate and support anyone who is interested in losing weight.]]></itunes:summary>

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                               are interested in what he  does      each      day.     Who       would      have            thought?&nbsp;              Anyone        can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's       exploits    on                Twitter.&nbsp;   Food        journals         are      great      ways        to   lose  weight    and    the           Fat  Guy  is     always          trying             anything  in     order    to     lose      those          last   20      pounds.  So   take a           peek  into          his   food       diary.     You            never    know    what     he'll       write.        Somehow he     can    stay             compliant     to       writing        on         Twitter  but    he  can't       fit   in       exercise     each          day.         That's         right,      moments    after  he      eats            something    the   Fat Guy   used              to     Twitter       about    it    and you     can        follow     him    so   that     one       day     if   you         try    real   hard    you   too      can look         like        the   Fat     Guy.

<div class="postBody">Our guest today was Jon Basso, founder of the Heart Attack Grill, a burger joint in Arizona that lets 350 pound people eat for free and give candy cigarettes to kids. They pride themselves on being politically incorrect at every turn. This former Jenny Craig owner and perosnal trainer has turned his back on healthy living and has built a burger empire on catering to the overweight and the people who just don't care about eating healthy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                              are interested in what he does      each      day.     Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;              Anyone        can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits    on                Twitter.&nbsp;   Food        journals        are      great      ways        to   lose  weight    and    the          Fat  Guy  is     always          trying             anything  in    order    to     lose      those          last   20      pounds.  So  take a           peek  into          his   food       diary.     You           never    know    what     he'll       write.        Somehow he    can    stay             compliant     to       writing        on        Twitter  but    he  can't       fit   in       exercise     each         day.         That's         right,      moments    after  he      eats           something    the   Fat Guy   used              to     Twitter      about    it    and you     can        follow     him    so   that    one       day     if   you         try    real   hard    you   too     can look         like        the   Fat     Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                             are interested in what he does     each      day.     Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;             Anyone        can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits   on                Twitter.&nbsp;   Food        journals        are     great      ways        to   lose  weight    and    the          Fat  Guy is     always          trying             anything  in    order    to    lose      those          last   20      pounds.  So  take a          peek  into          his   food       diary.     You           never   know    what     he'll       write.        Somehow he    can    stay            compliant     to       writing        on        Twitter  but   he  can't       fit   in       exercise     each         day.        That's         right,      moments    after  he      eats          something    the   Fat Guy   used              to     Twitter      about   it    and you     can        follow     him    so   that    one      day     if   you         try    real   hard    you   too     can look        like        the   Fat     Guy.

On Christmas day 2008 he weighed 360 pounds and he made a promise to his grandmother to lose weight and get his life together. In two years he has lost 120 pounds and has run marathons and finsihed an Ironman Triathlon. You have to read about his inspirational story on his blog <a href="http://www.bendoeslife.com">www.bendoeslife.com</a><a href="http://www.hungry-girl.com/"></a></p>

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                            are interested in what he does    each      day.     Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;            Anyone        can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits  on                Twitter.&nbsp;   Food        journals        are     great     ways        to   lose  weight    and    the          Fat  Guy is    always          trying             anything  in    order    to    lose     those          last   20      pounds.  So  take a          peek  into         his   food       diary.     You           never   know    what    he'll       write.        Somehow he    can    stay           compliant     to       writing        on        Twitter  but   he  can't      fit   in       exercise     each         day.        That's        right,      moments    after  he      eats          something    the  Fat Guy   used              to     Twitter      about   it    and you    can        follow     him    so   that    one      day     if   you        try    real   hard    you   too     can look        like        the  Fat     Guy.          Please   go to&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy&nbsp;</a> Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station                                            WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr        Fitness      and     the     Fat    Guy            "Wellness                 Minute."  So   now   a  new     Wellness     Minute   runs    on      that            station   each         morning         at     around    7:40.      Each     Wellness      Minute           features   the      doctor          and I     going       over 5     of  his   best      tips   on a             given      wellness   subject        like:      losing         weight,          getting    in      shape,         living a    healthy         lifestyle,       etc.       Now  these           Wellness         Minutes     are          available     online.&nbsp;  If    you       have  a          favorite   radio         station           that    you    think      would     benefit   from     our            Wellness      Minutes    send         them  an       email          telling   them     about   it   and  who             knows   maybe  you   can      hear         us        everyday   too.

<p>On today's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy had on&nbsp; our good friend Lisa Lillien. I did some research the other day and discovered that she made her first appearance on our show at the end of 2005. Since then Lisa has added over 1 million readers to her daily newsletter, has written a bunch of Ny Times best selling books and has now launched her own Hungry Girl TV show on the new Cooking Channel. You can check out that show every Saturday at 4pm or throughout the week - becuase the replay the show all the time. Today Lisa gave us some tips, shared her favorite music, her favorite kitchen appliance and her go to knife for chopping things up on her show. To learn more about what is happening in the wonderful world of the Hungry Girl please go to her website <a href="http://www.hungry-girl.com">www.hungry-girl.com</a><a href="http://www.joybauer.com/"></a></p>
<p>Remember, you can find a tip a day at our new website&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">www.wellnessminutes.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=275691579">on                                           iTunes here</a>. Or our blog <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.drfitnessblog.com/">www.drfitnessblog.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                           are interested in what he does   each      day.     Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;           Anyone        can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits  on               Twitter.&nbsp;   Food        journals        are     great    ways        to   lose  weight    and    the          Fat  Guy is   always          trying             anything  in    order    to    lose    those          last   20      pounds.  So  take a          peek  into        his   food       diary.     You           never   know    what   he'll       write.        Somehow he    can    stay           compliant    to       writing        on        Twitter  but   he  can't      fit  in       exercise     each         day.        That's        right,     moments    after  he      eats          something    the  Fat Guy   used             to     Twitter      about   it    and you    can       follow     him    so   that    one      day     if   you        try   real   hard    you   too     can look        like        the  Fat    Guy.          Please   go to&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy&nbsp;</a> Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station                                           WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr       Fitness      and     the     Fat    Guy            "Wellness                Minute."  So   now   a  new     Wellness     Minute   runs   on      that            station   each         morning         at    around    7:40.      Each     Wellness      Minute           features  the      doctor          and I     going       over 5     of  his   best     tips   on a             given      wellness   subject        like:     losing         weight,          getting    in      shape,        living a    healthy         lifestyle,       etc.       Now  these          Wellness         Minutes     are          available     online.&nbsp;  If   you       have  a          favorite   radio         station          that    you    think      would     benefit   from     our           Wellness      Minutes    send         them  an       email         telling   them     about   it   and  who             knows   maybe  you  can      hear         us        everyday   too.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                          are interested in what he does  each      day.     Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;          Anyone        can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits  on              Twitter.&nbsp;   Food        journals        are     great    ways       to   lose  weight    and    the          Fat  Guy is   always         trying             anything  in    order    to    lose    those         last   20      pounds.  So  take a          peek  into        his  food       diary.     You           never   know    what   he'll      write.        Somehow he    can    stay           compliant    to      writing        on        Twitter  but   he  can't      fit  in      exercise     each         day.        That's        right,     moments   after  he      eats          something    the  Fat Guy   used            to     Twitter      about   it    and you    can       follow     him   so   that    one      day     if   you        try   real   hard    you  too     can look        like        the  Fat    Guy.          Please  go to&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy&nbsp;</a> Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                       are interested in what he does each    day.     Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone       can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits  on           Twitter.&nbsp;   Food        journals        are     great    ways     to  lose  weight    and    the          Fat  Guy is   always       trying            anything  in    order    to    lose    those       last   20     pounds.  So  take a          peek  into        his  food     diary.    You           never   know    what   he'll      write.      Somehow he   can    stay           compliant    to      writing      on       Twitter  but   he  can't      fit  in      exercise    each        day.       That's        right,     moments   after  he     eats        something    the  Fat Guy   used            to    Twitter     about   it   and you    can       follow     him   so  that    one     day     if  you        try   real   hard    you  too    can look       like       the  Fat    Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                      are interested in what he does each   day.     Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone      can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits  on          Twitter.&nbsp;   Food        journals        are     great    ways     to lose  weight    and    the          Fat  Guy is   always       trying           anything  in    order    to    lose    those       last   20    pounds.  So  take a          peek  into        his  food     diary.   You           never   know    what   he'll      write.      Somehow he  can    stay           compliant    to      writing      on       Twitter but   he  can't      fit  in      exercise    each        day.      That's        right,     moments   after  he     eats        something   the  Fat Guy   used            to    Twitter     about   it   and you   can       follow     him   so  that    one     day     if  you       try   real   hard    you  too    can look       like       the  Fat   Guy.          Please  go to&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy&nbsp;</a> Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station                                      WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr  Fitness      and     the     Fat    Guy            "Wellness           Minute."

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                     are interested in what he does each  day.     Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone     can     follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits  on          Twitter.&nbsp;  Food        journals        are     great    ways     to lose  weight   and    the          Fat  Guy is   always       trying          anything  in    order    to    lose    those       last   20    pounds. So  take a          peek  into        his  food     diary.   You          never   know    what   he'll      write.      Somehow he  can    stay          compliant    to      writing      on       Twitter but   he can't      fit  in      exercise    each        day.      That's       right,     moments   after  he     eats        something   the  Fat Guy  used            to    Twitter     about   it   and you   can      follow     him   so  that    one     day     if  you       try   real  hard    you  too    can look       like       the  Fat   Guy.

That's       right,    moments   after  he     eats        something   the  Fat Guy  used           to    Twitter     about   it   and you   can      follow     him  so  that    one     day     if  you       try   real  hard    you  too   can look       like       the  Fat   Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                                  are interested in what he does each day.   Who       would      have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone    can   follow  the   Fat    Guy's      exploits  on          Twitter.&nbsp; Food      journals        are     great    ways     to lose  weight  and   the         Fat  Guy is   always       trying          anything in   order   to    lose    those       last   20    pounds. So  take a        peek into        his  food     diary.   You          never  know   what  he'll      write.      Somehow he  can    stay         compliant   to     writing      on       Twitter but   he can't     fit  in     exercise   each        day.      That's       right,    moments   after he    eats        something   the  Fat    Guy  used           to   Twitter    about   it   and you   can      follow     him  so  that   one     day    if  you       try   real  hard    you  too   can look      like      the  Fat   Guy.         Please  go to&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy&nbsp;</a> Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station                                  WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness   and     the     Fat    Guy            "Wellness          Minute." So now   a  new     Wellness     Minute   runs   on    that       station each         morning         at    around  7:40.   Each   Wellness    Minute           features  the    doctor       and I   going       over 5   of  his   best     tips on a          given    wellness   subject      like:     losing       weight,       getting  in      shape,      living a  healthy        lifestyle,     etc.     Now  these        Wellness       Minutes    are        available   online.&nbsp;  If   you   have  a         favorite   radio       station        that    you  think    would    benefit   from   our         Wellness    Minutes    send      them  an       email       telling them   about   it   and  who          knows   maybe you can      hear     us        everyday   too.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                               are interested in what he does each day. Who      would      have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone    can follow the   Fat    Guy's      exploits  on          Twitter.&nbsp; Food    journals       are     great    ways     to lose  weight  and   the       Fat Guy is   always       trying          anything in   order   to  lose   those       last   20    pounds. So  take a        peek into      his food     diary.   You          never  know   what  he'll    write.     Somehow he  can    stay         compliant   to     writing    on      Twitter but   he can't     fit  in     exercise   each      day.     That's       right,    moments   after he    eats      something   the Fat    Guy  used           to   Twitter    about   it and you   can     follow     him  so  that   one     day    if  you     try   real  hard   you  too   can look      like      the  Fat   Guy.       Please  go to&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy&nbsp;</a> Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station                               WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and    the     Fat    Guy            "Wellness          Minute." So now a new     Wellness     Minute   runs   on    that       station each      morning         at    around  7:40.   Each   Wellness    Minute        features  the    doctor       and I   going       over 5   of his  best    tips on a          given    wellness   subject      like:   losing      weight,       getting  in      shape,      living a healthy      lifestyle,     etc.     Now  these        Wellness      Minutes   are       available   online.&nbsp;  If   you   have  a        favorite  radio      station        that    you  think    would   benefit   from  our        Wellness    Minutes    send      them  an      email      telling them  about   it   and  who          knows  maybe you can     hear     us       everyday   too.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                              are interested in what he does each day. Who     would      have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone    can follow the  Fat    Guy's      exploits  on          Twitter.&nbsp; Food    journals      are     great    ways     to lose  weight  and   the       Fat Guy is  always       trying          anything in   order   to  lose   those      last   20    pounds. So  take a        peek into      his food    diary.   You          never  know   what  he'll    write.     Somehow he can    stay         compliant   to     writing    on      Twitter but  he can't     fit  in     exercise   each      day.     That's      right,    moments   after he    eats      something   the Fat    Guy used           to   Twitter    about   it and you   can     follow    him  so  that   one     day    if  you     try   real  hard   you  too  can look      like      the  Fat   Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                            are interested in what he does each day. Who   would      have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone    can follow the Fat   Guy's      exploits  on          Twitter.&nbsp; Food    journals     are    great    ways     to lose  weight  and   the       Fat Guy is always      trying          anything in   order   to  lose   those     last   20   pounds. So  take a        peek into      his food    diary.  You         never  know   what  he'll    write.     Somehow he can   stay        compliant   to     writing    on      Twitter but  he can't    fit  in    exercise   each      day.     That's      right,   moments   after he   eats      something   the Fat    Guy used          to   Twitter   about   it and you   can     follow    him  so  that  one     day    if you     try   real  hard   you  too  can look     like      the  Fat  Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                           are interested in what he does each day. Who  would      have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone    can follow the Fat  Guy's      exploits  on          Twitter.&nbsp; Food    journals     are   great    ways     to lose  weight  and   the       Fat Guy is always     trying          anything in   order   to  lose   those     last   20  pounds. So  take a        peek into      his food    diary.  You        never  know   what  he'll    write.     Somehow he can   stay       compliant   to     writing    on      Twitter but  he can't    fit  in   exercise   each      day.     That's      right,   moments   after he  eats      something   the Fat    Guy used          to   Twitter   about  it and you   can     follow    him  so  that  one     day    if you    try   real  hard   you  too  can look     like      the  Fat  Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                         are interested in what he does each day. Who would     have           thought?&nbsp;        Anyone    can follow the Fat Guy's     exploits  on          Twitter.&nbsp; Food    journals     are  great   ways     to lose  weight  and   the       Fat Guy is always    trying         anything in   order   to  lose   those     last   20 pounds. So take a        peek into      his food    diary.  You       never  know  what  he'll    write.     Somehow he can   stay      compliant   to    writing    on      Twitter but  he can't    fit  in  exercise   each     day.     That's      right,   moments   after he eats      something  the Fat    Guy used          to   Twitter   about it and you   can    follow    him  so  that  one     day    if you   try   real  hard   you too  can look     like      the  Fat  Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                       are interested in what he does each day.

So take a      peek into      his food    diary.  You       never  know  what he'll   write.     Somehow he can   stay      compliant   to    writing   on     Twitter but  he can't    fit  in  exercise   each     day.    That's     right,   moments   after he eats      something  the Fat   Guy used         to   Twitter   about it and you   can    follow    him so  that one     day    if you   try   real  hard   you too  can look    like     the  Fat  Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                  are interested in what he does each day. Who would have        thought?&nbsp;        Anyone    can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on        Twitter.&nbsp; Food    journals     are  great   ways to lose weight and  the       Fat Guy is always    trying     anything in  order   to lose  those     last   20 pounds. So take a    peek into     his food  diary.  You       never  know  what he'll write.    Somehow he can  stay     compliant   to    writing   on   Twitter but he can't    fit in exercise   each     day.    That's   right,  moments   after he eats    something  the Fat   Guy used       to  Twitter   about it and you  can   follow    him so  that one   day   if you   try   real  hard  you too can look    like     the Fat Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who                are interested in what he does each day. Who would have      thought?&nbsp;        Anyone    can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on      Twitter.&nbsp; Food    journals     are  great   ways to lose weight and the      Fat Guy is always    trying     anything in  order   to lose those    last   20 pounds. So take a    peek into     his food  diary. You      never  know  what he'll write.    Somehow he can  stay    compliant  to    writing   on   Twitter but he can't    fit in exercise  each    day.    That's   right,  moments   after he eats    something the Fat  Guy used       to  Twitter   about it and you  can   follow   him so that one   day   if you   try   real  hard  you too can look   like    the Fat Guy.    Please  go to&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy&nbsp;</a> Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.

So take a peek into   his food  diary. You   never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay   compliant  to writing  on  Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each   day. That's  right, moments   after he eats something the Fat Guy used   to Twitter  about it and you  can  follow him so that one day if you try   real hard  you too can look  like  the Fat Guy.

So take a peek into his food  diary. You   never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay compliant  to writing  on  Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.

Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4182b8;" href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy&nbsp;</a> Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.

always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.
On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station
each morning at around 7:40. Each
Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a
given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy
lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If
you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our
Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe
you can hear us everyday too.<br/>
<br/>
Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly
radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a
little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV,
at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews.
Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show
recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's
Adult
Swim, someone from Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and
even Miranda Cosgrove star of Nickelodeon's Hit TV Show iCarly. And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.
The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a>
and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com. He has gotten emails from
kids from England, Australia, China
and even the US.
Your encouragement is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks to you his show is
rocketing up the charts!<br/>

a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should

show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a
little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV,
at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews.

recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's
Adult
Swim, someone from Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and
even Miranda Cosgrove star of Nickelodeon's Hit TV Show iCarly. And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.

We haven't updated our SobeFit magazine Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
Weight Loss Challenge in awhile because I think it's over - we did not
lose 50 pounds combined - we lost over 30 pounds combined which isn't
too shabby. Marta
Montenegro, the founder
of SobeFit, is our coach and she comes on periodically to help us get back on track.
We are still trying to lose more weight but the Fat Guy is gaining back his weight at a rapid pace, so please send
your tips and words of encouragement or sabotage to
adam @ drfitnessandthefatguy.com or to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">@FatGuy on Twitter</a>. And remember to check out SobeFit magazine at 
<a href="http://www.sobefitmagazine.com/">www.sobefitmagazine.com</a><br/><br/>Before we started the show we talked about our new <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dr-Fitness-and-the-Fat-Guy/6605392858">Facebook Fan Page</a> that blogger, web genius and <a href="http://www.healthfulbitesblog.com/">Fitness Journalist Karla Walsh</a>
is helping us with. She is running contests and all kinds of fun stuff
for us. We really appreciate all that she is doing and want to make
sure she gets the recognition she deserves. Also, on that page you can
meet one of our listeners, Hollie who had lost about 15 pounds. Hollie
is going through a bit of a rough time now and she is gaining back some
of the weight she lost - so please Friend her from our page and give
her the support she needs to get back on track. Thanks!&nbsp; Hollie we know
that you can do it - and we will help you any way we can. <br/><br/>On

Dr
Fitness
and
the
Fat
Guy

On the show she shared some great nutrition tips for athletes and their trainers. To learn more about Leslie and her book please go to <a href="http://www.sportsmedicine.upmc.com">www.sportsmedicine.upmc.com</a><br/><br/>Next up we had on our good friend the legendary fitness trainer Denise Austin.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.
On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station
each morning at around 7:40. Each
Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a
given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy
lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If
you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our
Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe
you can hear us everyday too.<br/>
<br/>
Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly
radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a
little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV,
at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews.
Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show
recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's
Adult
Swim, someone from Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and
even Miranda Cosgrove star of Nickelodeon's Hit TV Show iCarly. And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.
The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a>
and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com. He has gotten emails from
kids from England, Australia, China
and even the US.
Your encouragement is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks to you his show is
rocketing up the charts!<br/>

We haven't updated our SobeFit magazine Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy Weight Loss Challenge in awhile because I think it's over - we did not lose 50 pounds combined - we lost over 30 pounds combined which isn't too shabby. Marta
Monetenegro, the founder
of SobeFit, is our coach will be coming on soon to recap.
We are still trying to lose more weight so please send
your tips and words of encouragement or sabotage to
adam @ drfitnessandthefatguy.com or to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">@FatGuy on Twitter</a>. And remember to check out SobeFit magazine at 
<a href="http://www.sobefitmagazine.com/">www.sobefitmagazine.com</a><br/><br/>On
today's
show
Dr
Fitness
and
the
Fat
Guy
opened
the
show
with
a guy who wrote into our website complaining that we should go to jail for telling people about Holey Donuts - he also we were mean to Gary Taubes. This guy has a major man crush on Gary and said we spent too much of the interview  goofing on him rather than letting him share his low carb wisdom. He also says our show is a sham and we are the reason everyone is overweight. So you don't want to miss his part.<br/><br/>The real show began with Rory Freedman, author of the NY Times Bestseller Skinny Bitch who came on to talk about Skinny Bastard. which is that kick in the butt men need to lose wight and get buff. Rory has a bunch of great advice for men who need to drop a few pounds. to learn more about this book please go to <a href="http://www.skinnybastard.net">www.skinnybastard.net</a><br/><br/>Next up we had on Robert Davis, author of the Healthy Skeptic. Robert is an award winning health journalist. He shared some tips on how to understand who to believe when it comes to health and science claims. It's like they said in All The President's Men - follow the money - who is paying for the study. To learn more about Robert and his book please go to his website <a href="http://www.everwell.com">www.everwell.com</a><br/><br/>Next up we had on Thomas Madden, inventor of the Knife and Fork Lift. While all our listeners know Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy have been talking about weighted silverware since we started the show, Thomas actually went out and invented it. He is a doer and we are just dreamers. His mini barbell like fork and knife set will definitely slow down your eating, just like we have been saying for years. To learn more please go to his website <a href="http://www.knifeandforklift.com">www.knifeandforklift.com</a><br/><br/>We closed the show with Rob Luka, author of the book How to Help Children Overcome Fear in a Medical Setting. Rob is a nurse with lots of first hand experience helping kids feel comfortable at the doctor's office. He has worked with lots of kids who have juvenile diabetes and has helped their families manage the regular injections and blood testing they have to deal with. To learn more please go to his website <a href="http://www.robluka.com  ">www.robluka.com&nbsp;</a> <br/><br/>Remember,
you can find a tip a day at our new website <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">www.wellnessminutes.com</a> or <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=275691579">on iTunes here</a>. Or our blog <a href="http://www.drfitnessblog.com/">www.drfitnessblog.com</a> <br/>







<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy
</a><br/>
<br/>
Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.
On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station
each morning at around 7:40. Each

each morning at around 7:40. Each
Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a
given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy
lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If
you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our
Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe
you can hear us everyday too.<br/>
<br/>
Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly
radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a
little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV,
at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews.
Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show
recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's
Adult
Swim, someone from Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and
even Miranda Cosgrove star of Nickelodeon's Hit TV Show iCarly. And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.
The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a>
and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com. He has gotten emails from

Before we got too far into the show we gave our listeners an update on
the SobeFit magazine Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy Weight Loss Challenge.
Week eleven has ended and Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy have lost a combined
27 pounds. We are now over halfway away from our goal of a 50 pound
weight loss. Marta Monetenegro, the founder
of SobeFit, is our coach and she came on today's show to help.
 Please send
your tips and words of encouragement or sabotage to
adam @ drfitnessandthefatguy.com or to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">@FatGuy on Twitter</a>. And remember to check out SobeFit magazine at

Dr
Fitness
and
the
Fat
Guy
opened
the
show
with
our
guest co-host Susie Shina (the Fat Guy had better things to do). You can find out more about Susie at <a href="http://www.befitenough.com">www.befitenough.com</a><br/><br/>First up we had on Dr Eric Plasker, a well known innovative wellness expert and author of The 100 Year Lifestyle. To learn more please go the <a href="http://www.thefamilypractice.net">www.thefamilypractice.net</a><br/><br/>Next up we had on Wendy Beckers with Yell At Your Fat.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Before we got too far into the show we gave our listeners an update on
the SobeFit magazine Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy Weight Loss Challenge.
Week eight has ended and Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy have lost a combined
22 pounds. We are now 28 pounds away from our goal of a 50 pound
weight loss in 3 months. Marta Monetenegro, the founder
of SobeFit, is our coach and she will be coming on the show to help.
 Please send
your tips and words of encouragement or sabotage to
adam @ drfitnessandthefatguy.com or to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">@FatGuy on Twitter</a>. And remember to check out SobeFit magazine at 
<a href="http://www.acacialifestyle.com/">www.sobefitmagazine.com</a><br/><br/>On
today's
show
Dr
Fitness
and
the
Fat
Guy
opened
the
show with Marta Montenegro with SobeFit magazine. She shared some great information about what is in the new How to Be Healthier issue of SobeFit magazine.  Subscribe to the best fitness
magazine in America at <a href="http://www.sobefitmagazine/">www.sobefitmagazine</a>.<br/><br/>Next
up Dr Tim Harlan aka Dr Gourmet came on his regular segment to explain the role of carbohydrates in your diet. He talked Glycemic Index and told us about how his website and program helps. To learn more please go to <a href="http://www.drgourmet.com">www.drgourmet.com</a><br/><br/>Next LA Justice author of more books on more subjects than just about anyone we have ever met came on to talk about her new book A Slimmer You.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.
On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station

Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a

lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If

a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly
radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a
little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV,

movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews.

Before we got too far into the show we gave our listeners an update on
the SobeFit magazine Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy Weight Loss Challenge.

18 pounds. We are now 32 pounds away from our goal of a 50 pound
weight loss in 3 months. Marta Monetenegro, the founder
of SobeFit, is our coach and she will be coming on the show  to help - starting today. Please send

today's
show
Dr

Fat
Guy opened the show with Andrea Leigh Rogers, pilates expert and Dance Your Body Thin dvd star.

To learn more please go to her website <a href="http://www.xtendworkout.com">www.xtendworkout.com</a><br/><br/>Next up we had on Jim Karas, author of the Number 1 New York Times BestSeller Business Plkan for the Body and Cardio-Free Diet.

people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Before we got too far into the show we gave our listeners an update on
the SobeFit magazine Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy Weight Loss Challenge.
Week two has ended and Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy have lost a combined
9 pounds. They are now 41 pounds away from their goal of a 50 pound
weight loss in 3 months. Thanks to SobeFit for the fruit basket - that was so kind. I ate the cookie and the candy and Dr Fitness ate the fruit during the show. Marta Monetenegro-Auvert, founder
of SobeFit, will be coming on the show next week to help. Please send
your tips and words of encouragement or sabotage to
adam @ drfitnessandthefatguy.com or to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">@FatGuy on Twitter</a>. And remember to check out SobeFit magazine at 
<a href="http://www.sobefitmagazine.com/">www.sobefitmagazine.com</a><br/><br/>On

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the

He has a new book out titled: Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills where he explains the reason why these excitotoxins are used and why he thinks you should avoid them. He also shared some great healthy living tips.

give him a crown made of bacon if he wins. This is an invitation only
event that benefits the Atlanta Community Food Bank. All participants
get a cool designer t-shirt and your choice of either a tiara or a

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by thousands of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

On
today's
show
Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy opened the show with journalist and author Sam MacDonald who talked about his book The Urban Hermit. In it he chronicles his journey from being an underemployed Yale party guy who was in debt and obese to being a happily married debt free semi-success like the rest of his Yale buddies. And he did this all by eating lentils, hard boiled eggs and tuna fish sandwiches.&nbsp; It is a hilarious piece of non-fiction that shows that you can lose weight and keep it off by spending $8 a week on food. While even Sam doesn't recommend you follow his weight loss plan - it did work for him. Please go to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUrban-Hermit-Memoir-Sam-Macdonald%2Fdp%2F0312376995&ei=Ji4ySuPbL52wmQfgkYjsCg&usg=AFQjCNGKp6rUkYLkUjLovuf1zAsyLt48rA&sig2=SdKl9I5m9UTrQJvZyqmsHA">Amazon</a> and check this book out.<br/><br/>Next up we had on our good friend The Nutrition Twins Tammy and Lyssie Lakatos. They talked about their new book coming out in September called The Secret To Skinny and it's all about how salt makes you fat. Their old book Fire Up Your Metabolism: 9 Proven Principles For Burning Fat and Losing Weight Forever is available at their website <a href="http://www.nutritiontwins.com">www.nutritiontwins.com</a><br/><br/>And we closed the show with Dr Fitness' favorite Exercise Science Guy direct form Princeton Matt Byzycki shared his thoughts about the 200 pound guy who is suing because he thought it was a good idea to bench press 150 pounds while lying on an inflatable exercise ball. Well that ball exploded, he hit the floor and hurt himself pretty bad. Matt has a couple of books you should check out - one is on dumbell training and the other is on <a href="http://youthfitnessactionplan.com/">Youth Fitness</a>.<br/><br/>Don't forget to sign up for the Roswell-tree a great fun run and race held each year on July

Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.
On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station
each morning at around 7:40. Each
Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a
given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy
lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If
you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our
Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe
you can hear us everyday too.<br/>
<br/>
Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly
radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a
little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV,
at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews.
Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show
recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's
Adult
Swim, someone from Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and
even Miranda Cosgrove star of Nickelodeon's Hit TV Show iCarly. And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.
The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a>
and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com. He has gotten emails from

On
today's
show
Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy opened the show with our good friend Fitz Koehler the kick boxing AOL blogger from Gainesville Florida.Fitz has a great new cookbook out because she is determined to help everyone get rock hard abs like she has. The book is called Everything Flat Belly Cookbook and you can get it at Amazon or at her website <a href="http://www.fitzness.com">www.fitzness.com</a> <br/><br/>Next up we had on the Marta Montenegro-Auvert from SobeFit Magazine. You willnot find anyone more passionate about fitness and living a healthy lifestyle than Marta. And you will not find a better magazine than SobeFit. This is hands down, the finest fitness magazine out there today. It is without question a must have for anyone interested in living healthier. Today Marta shared some tips about the importance of managing stress and the health consequences of not dealing with stress. You can find articles in the latest issue of SobeFit on that and lots of other things as well. Please go to <a href="http://www.sobefitmagazine.com">www.sobefitmagazine.com</a> to subscribe.<br/><br/>We close the show with Frank Hodal from Vidazorb. Frank explained the importance of adding probiotics to your diet. He also explained some of the challenges we have in adding them naturally to our diet, especially if we don't like yogurt. He also said that his firms supplements are the only ones that have pharmacy grade probiotcs that don't need refrigeration and taste great. Dr Fitness loves them and you can check them out at <a href="http://www.vidazorb.com">www.vidazorb.com</a> <br/><br/>Remember,
you can find a tip a day at our new website <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">www.wellnessminutes.com</a> or <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=275691579">on iTunes here</a>.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by hundreds of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the

today's
show
Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy opened the show with Dr Wayne Wescott, Author of Get Stronger, Feel Younger. The Cardio and Diet- Free Plan to Frim up and Lose Weight. Dr Wescott is one of the legends of strength training. He has written fitness and strength training textbooks that are used in universities and even the armed services. Read his book and you'll understand why proper strength training essentially guarantees fat loss. You can get Dr Wescott's book everywhere but go to his website <a href="http://www.ssymca.org">www.ssymca.org</a> to learn more about him and his work.<br/><br/>Next up we had on John Jacobs, one of the founders of Life is Good. The happy go lucky apparel and lifestyle brand that celebrates optimism and gratitude. When you see Jake's smiling mug on a t shirt you can't help to smile back. John shared his inspiring story about how he and his brother sold shirts from the back of their van until they stumbled upon the right message that resonated with just about everyone. And they keep spreading the gospel of optimism through their charity vneutes like their book &quot;Life is Good&quot; and their festivals all fo which give back to their Life is Good Kids Foundation. John also mentioned that Kenny and Shannon are the owners of Jake's House in the metro Atlanta area that is one of the Genuine Neighboroohd Shoppes that sell Life is Good gear. You can check out Jake's House in the South at <a href="http://www.jakeshouse.net">www.jakeshouse.net</a> or all things Life is Good at <a href="http://www.lifeisgood.com">www.lifeisgood.com</a><br/><br/>We closed the show with our good friend Dr Jonny Bowden who talked about his new book The 150 Most Effective Ways To Boost Your Energy. He shared some great tips about energy as well as how to live longer and more actively. Dr Fitness also got him riled up about Cholesterol and what Dr Jonny calles the Cholesterol Myth. You've got to hear that. To learn more about Dr Jonny andf his books, dvds, speaking and more please go to his website <a href="http://www.jonnybowden.com">www.jonnybowden.com</a>&nbsp; <br/><br/>Remember,

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by hundreds of
people who are interested in what he does each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy used to Twitter about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should

radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a
little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV,

at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews.
Please

On
today's
show
Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy opened the show with our good friend Kristin Harrison, editor of Women's Running Magazine. She shared some of the highlights of the latest issue of this great magazine. We talked about some new sports bras that aren't too bouncy and aren't too tight - these sports bra fit you just right. She also said that their were some new training plans for runners of all skill levels who want to run a 5k. To subscribe to this magazine please go to their website <a href="http://www.womensrunningmag.com">www.womensrunningmag.com</a><br/><br/>Next up we had on a new friend Marta Montenegro-Auvert founder of South Florida's hottest, best looking and information filled fitness magazine SoBe Fit. Marta explained the mission of the magazine - to create a resource for people who want to live an active lifestyle. Her readers are men women and children who want to look and feel great on the inside and on the outside. You will not find a better looking or better researched fitness magazine. Both Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy absolutely love this magazine and can't wait to see the next issue. Check them out online at <a href="http://www.sobefitmagazine.com">www.sobefitmagazine.com<br/></a><br/>We closed the show with Dr Fitness' good friend Dr Judith Beck. Dr Beck explained how she uses her extensive background in cognitive therapy to help her clients lose weight and to actually think like a thin person. Cognitive therapy works so well because changing your thinking has been shown to make permanent behavioral changes. Dr Beck's new book is titled The Complete Beck Diet For life and includes her cognitive therapy weight loss program combined with an eating and diet plan complete with recipes and food choices. To learn more please go to her websites <a href="http://www.beckdietforlife.com">www.beckdietforlife.com</a> or <a href="http://www.beckinstitute.org ">www.beckinstitute.org</a> <br/><br/>Remember,
you can find a tip a day at our new website <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">www.wellnessminutes.com</a> or <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=275691579">on iTunes here</a>.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by dozens of
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews. Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show recently

On
today's
show
Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy&nbsp; we
opened with the return of LA Councilwoman Jan Perry who continued to impress us with her political moves to socially engineer Los Angeles to her liking. As expected she has done an arguably less than stellar job removing the businesses that have harmed her constituents but is now apparently grandstanding on an issue just to get publicity for herself and help her as she moves forward in her quest for higher public offices. Nothing is as inspiring as someone who is using the media to move up the government food chain. If only politicians would use their ambition and connections in order to take the personal risk themselves which is necessary to build thriving businesses in their own communities rather than game the system to make it harder for legitimate businesses who have figured out a way to prosper in challenging environemts. To learn more about her go to her website <a href="http://www.lacity.org/council/cd9/index.htm">here</a><br/><br/>Next
up we had on Tracy Effinger who talked about her new exercise dvd titled Squeeze: Lower Body Challenge. tracy is an innovative trainer who has worked with several high profile celebrity clients like Will Ferrill, Sela Ward and Eve. She works in Richards Simmons gym and has learned from him how to build a great workout and a large following of dedicated clients. This dvd and all the other Squeeze dvds focus on isometric movements to give you a challenging and effective workout. To learn more please go to her website <a href="http://www.squeezebytracy.com">www.squeezebytracy.com</a><br/><br/>We
closed
the show with our good friend Tiffany Davis, Atlanta Editor of the Daily Candy. She came on and shared some the best Valentine's Day gift ideas that have been or are going to be featured in the various Daily Candy editions from around the country. She mentioned healthy do it yourself valentine's day gift ideas like creating an edible herb and fruit basket to to offbeat ideas like scheduling a joint blood donation appointment for you and your valentine. To learn more please go to <a href="http://www.DailyCandy.com">www.DailyCandy.com</a> and subscribe to one of the most popular and useful web magazines out there.<br/><br/>Remember,
you can find a tip a day at our new website <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">www.wellnessminutes.com</a> or <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=275691579">on iTunes here</a>.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by dozens of
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.
On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station
each morning at around 7:40. Each
Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a
given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy
lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If
you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our
Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe
you can hear us everyday too.<br/>
<br/>
Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews. Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult
Swim. And if your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.
The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a>
and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com. He has gotten emails from
kids from England, Australia, China

She says that she thinks there are too many fast food restaurants and her constituents want more sit down dining establishments and some nicer grocery stores as well. The Fat Guy, who isn't a big fan of government intervention in business matters, and Jan really didn't hit it off so things got a little heated.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by dozens of
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews. Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult
Swim. And if your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.
The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a>

Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about Deadline Fitness from celebrity fitness trainer Gina Lombardi. As Napoleon Hill says A goal is a dream with a deadline. And in her new book Gina explains how you can lose weight and achieve your fitness goal even if you have a deadline that is 2 months or even 2 weeks away. To learn more go to her website <a href="http://www.ginalombardi.com">www.ginalombardi.com</a><br/><br/>We also had on Joan Denizot, founder of Super Sized Cycles and Zize Bikes- she makes bikes for the extra large people, like The Fat Guy, of the world. Joan has been riding bikes her whole life and when she got to heavy to ride conventional bikes she thought that there had to be bikes that fit people that were her size - guess what there weren't. So that spurred her to build bikes for people who weigh up to 550 pounds. To learn more please go to <a href="http://www.supersizedcycles.com">www.supersizedcycles.com</a> or <a href="http://www.zizebikes.com">www.zizebikes.com</a><br/><br/>We
closed the show with our good friend Matt Brzycki author of Youth Fitness: An Action Plan for Shaping America's Kids. Matt thinks kids are in real bad shape - they are getting health problems that only overweight adults used to get. Not anymore. He calls the problem Globesity because it is affecting kids all over the globe. He shared great tips parents can do to help their kids. Dr Fitness gives this book a thumbs up - check it out on Amazon.<br/><br/>Dr

Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about how to protect your children from the temptations they face each day. You see wiring your kids with the internet, cell phones and social networking sites may be hazardous to their future. Family Therapist Karen Child Ogden and children's author Danielle Tiano have created a series of books called The Temptation Series to give parents and children the tools to tackle the tough topic of technology and today's tweens. Temptation of a Generation was their first book and that speaks on internet safety and internet pornography.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by dozens of
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about tea from the Tea Sommelier from Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy's 2007 Product of the Year Tavalon Tea Chris Cason. Chris has been studying tea for a long long time and he is a big part of why Tavalon is known throughout the world as a cutting edge tea compnay. Whether it is creating signature tea drinks for Bloomingdales or mixing tea infused adult beverages, Chris is a crewative dude who loves his tea. To learn more about how and why a Tavalon Tea gift Set is the ultimate gift please check out his website <a href="http://www.tavalon.com">www.tavalon.com</a><br/><br/>Next John Biggs from CrunchGear was too busy gadget hunting in Paris so he sent Doug Aamoth up to the plate to pinch hit. Doug told us about all kinds of cool gadgets and even explained the pros and cons of some fitness apps for the new G1 Google phone. To get your gadget fix from our favorite fitness gadget blog please check out Doug at <a href="http://">www.crunchgear.com</a><br/><br/>We closed the show with Mercury Morris, former All Pro running back and kick returner from the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins. this segment had very little to do with fitness but since the Fat Guy is a huuuge Miami Dolphin fan and we had the chance to interview one of his childhood heroes we couldn't pass it up. Mercury talked about the New England Cheatriots attempt to go undefeated and he shared his feelings about this year's last unbeaten team the Tennessee Titans. He also said that every Dolphin fan should go to his website <a href="http://">www.mercurymorris22.com</a> and check out all the cool t-shirts, caps and other great stuff commemorating the Unbeaten 1972 Miami Dolphins. Go Phins!<br/><br/>Dr

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by dozens of
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station
each morning at around 7:40. Each
Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a
given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy
lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If
you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our
Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe
you can hear us everyday too.<br/>
<br/>
Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews. Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult
Swim. And if your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.

Now on with the show...<br/>
 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about an innovative copyrighted series of movements that will help you
lose inches without weights, equipment or jumping called T-Tapp. T-Tapp
was developed by the off the charts with energy Teresa Tapp. She told
us how she developed her amazing techniques while working with top
models in Europe. I'm talking Claudia Schiffer and others. Remember
models really don't care what they weigh as much as how they fit into
their clothes. So Teresa's T-Tapp is very comprehensive in delivering
fat loss, weight loss and inch loss as well as increasing your overall
heath, energy and fitness. You don't have to be superfit to do her
technique in fact she had Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy doing some of the
exercises on the air. She was talking us through it and the Fat Guy
almost did it. I wish we had a webcam so you could have seen it. Teresa
has a book called &quot;Fit and Fabulous in 15 Minutes as well as dvds and
an information packed website. Please go to her website <a href="http://www.t-tapp.com/">www.t-tapp.com</a>
and you will find all her stuff plus: contests, a ton of testimonials,
amazing before and after pictures and a directory of certified T-Tapp
trainers and a whole bunch more.</p>



<p>And you listeners were lucky enough to hear the brilliant Dr Judith
Beck , author of &quot;The Beck Diet Solution&quot; which is rocketing up the
bestseller lists. Dr Beck has been appearing everywhere in fact when I
got home from the show I opened my Health magazine and there she was in
there . Well Dr Beck is an authority in cognitive therapy and she uses
those techniques to help people lose weight. She doesn't care as much
about which diet you are using as long as you eat less calories she
cares more about how you are going about the weight loss process. It is
here where she is very helpful. Some of the weight loss tips she gave
our listeners were: pre-plan your eating each day; only eat sitting
down, remind yourself that hunger is never an emergency. She had many
more tips but you'll have to listen to the show with a pencil and paper
to get them all. Go to her website <a href="http://www.beckdietsolution.com/">www.beckdietsolution.com</a>
for great downloads you can use today, information on her book &quot;The
Beck Diet Solution&quot; and her new workbook that is coming out soon as
well as info on Dr Judith Beck herself, there's also a blog. It's worth
your time. Dr Fitness was blown away by how smart she was and how good
and helpful her info was...so check it out.<br/></p>





And what would Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy show be without some
candy...we love our Daily Candy and we were lucky enough to have
Tiffany Davis from The Daily Candy in our studio with us this evening.
Tiffany leads a life that everyone should be jealous of...I know I am.
It is her job to discover the hippest places, the finest restaurants
and the coolest clubs. It's not easy being her. Tonight Tiffany shared
some places you could go in Atlanta o get an unconventional workout. We
talked about kickball leagues, we talked about rock climbing centers we
even talked about pole dancing and stiletto heel workouts. There were a
lot of laughs and a lot of great info. If you are one of few remaining
women who don't subscribe to Daily Candy then hop to it ... go to <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com/">www.DailyCandy.com</a> and sign yourself up. They have city centered issues in a lot of big cities, they have special kid issues and more. <br/>

Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Remember we are now on every morning in Michigan.
On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station
each morning at around 7:40. Each
Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a
given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy
lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If
you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our
Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe
you can hear us everyday too.<br/>
<br/>
Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews. Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult
Swim. And if your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.
The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a>

On
tonight's

Dr
Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about The Holistic Option from founder Kelly Campbell. Kelly explained that The Holistic option strives to be the WebMD for alternative medicine. For more information please go to <a href="http://www.theholisticoption.com">www.theholisticoption.com</a><br/><br/>We also heard from our friend Kathy and Fletcher from Your Spa Report. They shared their experiences from the finest luxury spas in Dubai. For more please go to their website <a href="http://www.yourspareport.com">www.yourspareport.com<br/></a><br/>We introduced Laela our new intern to the show and she shared some great tips to find exercise workouts on YouTube. <br/><br/>Dr Fitness had some tips about riding your bike to work to save money, save the environment and to get your exercise in for the day. Remember, you can find a tip a day at our new website <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">www.wellnessminutes.com</a> or <a href="http://http//phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=275691579">on iTunes here</a>.

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by over 3 dozen
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a

lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If

<br/>
Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has been doing
a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of TMZ or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews. Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show recently
he interviewed Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult
Swim. And if your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week.
The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a>

On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
&quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station
each morning at around 7:40. Each
Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a
given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy
lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If
you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our
Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe
you can hear us everyday too.<br/>

a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should
check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio
show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of David Spade's &quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central
or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the
movies, video games, in books and in music and even restaurant reviews. Please
go to his site and download the show for your kid. He had a big show recently

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by over 3 dozen
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy

lifestyle, etc. Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If

show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of
like a kids version of David Spade's &quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central
or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the

tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about Lisa Lillien, the Hungry-Girl's book tour. Lisa is finishing up the promotional book tour of her New York Times Bestselling book Hungry-Girl: Recipes and Survival Strategies for Guilt-Free Eating in the Real World.<br/> </p>


Lisa started Hungry-Girl in 2004. She said people look to her as a friend, nit some preachy professional dietitian. She offers up great advice in a friendly, fun informative way each and every day with her newsletter. <br/><br/>She said one thing that has surprised her on the book tour was when a man approached her at a book signing in New York and told her he lost 100 pounds and had some amazing before pictures to prove it. Lisa is working on the sequel to the book and it should be out next year. <br/><br/>Lisa also gave our listeners her top 3 ingredients that should be in your cupboard if you want to cut some serious calories. We also talked about the recent theft of her favorite pants from her dry cleaner. The theft was caught on video and you can check it out on You Tube. To learn all things Hungry-Girl please go to her website and subscribe to her daily newsletter at <a href="http://www.hungry-girl.com">www.hungry-girl.com</a><br/><br/>We kicked off the show with our good friend Tiffany Davis, Atlanta Editor of the Daily Candy. She had some great tips on how to stay at home and have your own Foodie Vacation. She called it a Vacay, but she is much hipper than me and can pull that off. She also told us how she's dating a chef and now all her tips seem to be about food. Please go to <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com">www.dailycandy.com</a> and subscribe to Daily Candy Atlanta edition to get Tiffany's great tips.<br/><br/>Next up we had on Dr Pete Scire with Brain Balance Center. The Brain Balance Program is a comprehensive program which
incorporates a unique multi-faceted approach to the assessment and the
development of individualized intervention plans for children affected by the Neurobehavioral/Developmental
Disorders such as ADD/ADHD, Asperger’s Syndrome, Tourrette’s Syndrome, PDD, Autism,
Processing Disorders, and Learning Disabilities (i.e. Dyslexia).



<p class="MsoNormal">Based upon the most current research their program works from
a brain based model which recognizes that many of the children that are
diagnosed with these disorders suffer a foundational imbalance or
under-connectivity of electrical (brain) activity. This imbalance or
under-connectivity occurs within and between the two halves (hemispheres)
and/or large networks of the brain. <br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">They believe that it is this imbalance
of function, within and between the two halves of the brain
which is often responsible for many if not all of the physical, cognitive or
mental, and/or behavioral difficulties related to these disorders.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Based upon their comprehensive assessment the Brain Balance
Program develops and implements a unique individualized program for each and
every child. Each child’s program addresses their specific areas of
difficulties related to the physical (sensory/motor) needs, bio-nutritional
(digestive difficulties, nutritional deficiencies) needs, as well as neuro-cognitive
(academics and behavioral) needs. For more information please go to their website <a href="http://www.brainbalancecenters.com">www.brainbalancecenters.com</a><br/></p>

Next we had on Sarah Brown with Planet Smoothie. Planet Smoothie is Kathie's favorite Smoothie joint. She loves the Wheat Grass. Dr Fitness and her kept obsessing about how much they liked the smell. Sarah told us all about 99 cent Smoothie Days at Planet Smoothie and you can get inexpensive smoothies and not little ones you get 22 ounces of smoothie goodness. I called her a Smoothie Sommelier and you can bet you can be seeing that show up in their ads soon. The nice thing about Planet Smoothie is that they have so many low cal and healthy choices their. And they don't give you a hard time if you want to mix and match ingredients. Like substituting blackberries for strawberries to save a few calories. For more information please go to their website <a href="http://www.planetsmoothie.com">www.planetsmoothie.com</a>. They also have all the nutritional information on their as well.<br/><br/>No Dr Fitness' Fitness

<p class="MsoNormal">Don't forget about The
Roswell-tree Road Race to be held this July 4th at Roswell Park that
benefits The Atlanta Community Food Bank. This great event is a fun run
in the truest sense. You see everyone who signs up is placed in a
division that includes only them - which ensures that when they
complete the race they will have won their division. Imagine that, a

silly rules to abide by or not. For more information contact Sally
Jamara at her website <a href="http://www.roswelltree.org/">www.roswelltree.org</a> <br/></p>









<p class="MsoNormal">On
tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about how to connect with your inner truth so that you can release
emotional barriers and energy blocks that cause pain and disease from author, blogger, speaker Deborah King. Deborah explained&nbsp;
how illnesses of body, mind, and spirit are expressions of a personal imbalance
with the truth.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Deborah said &quot;To many, it's a radical notion, but I have witnessed
countless healings in people who were simply willing, finally, to face the
truth about something in their lives.&quot;</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">She is the author of Truth Heals: What You Hide Can Hurt
You (available early 2009). She is also a health &amp; wellness expert, attorney, frequent
TV commentator, national keynote speaker, and a “healer to the stars.” You can also find her as regular blogger for The Huffington Post. <br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a young attorney and hotel
developer, Deborah suffered from a host of emotional and medical problems,
culminating with cancer in her twenties. Her amazing recovery led her to leave
the corporate arena for the alternative medical field, where she mastered
ancient and modern healing systems and ultimately developed a powerful
technique of her own. She is trained to address both the mind and the body’s
health and disease processes (unlike a psychologist, who is restricted to the
mind) and makes frequent appearances on national news and entertainment
programs. <br/></p>
Deborah guides thousands to
recovery through her public appearances, workshops, and her writings. She
invites you to experience the dynamic principles of how truth heals by going to her website <a href="http://www.deborahkingcenter.com">www.deborahkingcenter.com</a>.<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>We started the show with good friend Matt Bryzcki, author of Youth Fitness: An Action Plan for Shaping America's Kids. Matt is the Assistant Director of Campus Recreation at Princeton University and has over 25 years experience at the collegiate level as a coach, instructor and administrator. Tonight he talked about the importance of doing each repetition in your strength training workout with good form and energy. He also had some great tips to help you choose your next personal trainer.<br type="_moz"/></o:p></p>


<o:p></o:p>We were also joined by regulars Kathy and Fletcher Newbern who just got back to the United States in order to give us their Spa Report. They shared all kinds of stories about their recent, almost 3 week long, trip to the Maldive Islands. The are travel writers who are fortunate enough to spend their days enjoying the most exotic and fabulous destinations around the globe. To learn more about their latest adventure and to see beautiful pictures and read wonderful tales please go to their website <a href="http://www.yourspareport.com">www.yourspareport.com</a> <br/><br/>We closed the show with Lampkin Butts, COO of Sanderson Farms, one of the nation's finest poultry providers. Lampkin is also actively involved in informing the public about some misleading labeling practices authorized by the USDA for fresh poultry. You see some chicken providers are injecting their birds with salt water and calling them &quot;Natural Chickens.&quot; Lampkin's group the Truthful Labeling Coalition doesn't want these compnaies to be able to do that without letting the consumer know about it in big bold letters, not sime fine print on the bottom of the packaging. <br/><br/>At Sanderson Farms where Lampkin works all his chickens are 100% All Natural Chicken no additives of any kind. He believes if you buy his chickens you should get all chicken.

We opened the show with Pilates Expert Brooke Siler. She is the author of some of the most influential pilates books out there. She wrote The Pilates Body and Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge.&nbsp; She is a veteran in the&nbsp; world of pilates and she has been personally trained by  one of Joseph Pilates proteges. She explained to us the difference between yoga and pilates. She also gave us some insight into how pilates gives you a great cardio workout while strengthening your entire body.

For more information about Brooke, her studio, her pilates trainer certification or her books please go to her website <a href="http://">www.reabnyc.com</a><br/><br/>Next up we had on Director Linda Burns and Andrew &quot;Drew&quot; Johnston, star of the new
documentary chronicling Drew’s rise from a cancer diagnosis to him competing in
an Ironman Triathlon in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hawaii</st1:place></st1:state> called Living is Winning.



<p class="MsoNormal">This is a great story - Drew is an elite athlete. He stared out as
a competitive pro cyclist, but after a series of accidents and concussions, he was forced to put down his bike. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Drew quickly changed gears and found success
and a new career as a triathlete. But 2004 brought devastating news for his
family, his friends and his future. Drew was diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous
Leukemia (CML) and his body literally broke down. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>But two years later, after taking an oral chemo called
Gleevac, and continuing his commitment to a healthy organic lifestyle, rigorous
targeted exercise and an extremely positive mental attitude, Drew is in molecular
remission.</p>








<p class="MsoNormal">Today, Drew competes at triathlons and Ironman events
throughout the country with remarkable results.&nbsp; Drew's life story serves as an inspiration to others, to
strive to be your best in every aspect of life and to never give up your
dreams, no matter how distant they may seem. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;Their goal with the Living is Winning movie</o:p> is to reach audiences all over the world, engaging
them with the passion that exists in the sport of triathlons to encourage the
passion that is necessary to continue the search for a cure for cancer. Living
is Winning will entertain everyone from triathletes to couch potatoes with
action packed race footage, moving interviews, lots of humor and a great
original score. They hope to inspire every generation to eat healthy, exercise
and become socially responsible through organizations like Team in Training and
the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. Check out the trailer and buy the dvd at <a href="http://www.livingiswinning.com">www.livingiswinning.com</a></p>

<p>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by over 3 dozen
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the

<p class="MsoNormal">On
tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about eating a more nutritionally dense diet in order to reverse the disease process and lose weight.<br/></p>





<p class="MsoNormal">Dr Joel Fuhrman M.D. is a board–certified family physician
who specializes in preventing and reversing disease through nutritional and
natural methods. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on"></st1:city><st1:state w:st="on"></st1:state></st1:place><o:p> <br/></o:p></p>

Fast and Sustained Weight Loss, which was published in 2003. His most recent
book, published in 2008, Eat For Health (a two volume set) is acclaimed as a
medical breakthrough for weight loss, disease reversal and prevention. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Dr. Fuhrman is one of the country's leading experts on
nutrition and natural healing, Joel has appeared on hundreds of radio and television
shows including: ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, CNN, Today, Good Morning America, the
Discovery Channel, TV Food Network, CNBC and many more. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">In his book Eat To Live. He explains that this is not about
measuring portions and trying to eat less food. It is about choosing the
highest quality foods that can remove your food addictions and about having you
lose your desire to overeat. The more nutrient dense food you consume, the
faster your health will improve. Fat will melt away, the need for medication
will lessen, and you'll reverse the disease process!</p>

losing weight, they call on Dr Fuhrman. So if you want to live longer, reduce
your need for medications, lose weight faster than you ever thought possible,
and dramatically improve your health, you should check out Eat For Health. For

We started the show off with our good friend Tiffany Davis, Atlanta Editor with Daily Candy. She shared some of her best Father's Day Fun Fitness finds. She mentioned <a href="http://www.tastebook.com">www.tastebook.com</a> a website you can create personalized cookbooks for dad featuring only his favorite foods. She also had a great idea to have your Dad train you and hold you accountable for a 5K, that way you two can spend quality time together getting in shape. She had a couple of other great ideas but you'll have to listen to get them. For more fashion, fitness and fun tips every day be sure to check out her website <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com">www.dailycandy.com</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/><br/></span>Next up we had on Dr Therese Pasqualoni shared her unique method for losing weight and living a healthier life called Strike It Healthy® Weight and Health Management Systems
which consists of products and services that go beyond the “weight loss” concept.<br/><p class="MsoNormal">
She says to &quot;put diets and quick fixes aside - it is our lifestyle choices that matter. It’s
about making healthy choices and pursuing healthy weight loss. These products
and services are not about us being obsessive---it’s all about
opportunities---everyone of us has the ability to make changes in our lives
that can benefit us today, tomorrow, next month, next year, and for the rest of
our lives!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Therese Pasqualoni, truly believes that---“It’s not about being perfect, it’s about being
healthier!” The Strike it Healthy® Weight and Health Management Systems philosophy encompasses
three main concepts. 1- “learn about reputable information” to afford us power
to improve our knowledge. 2- <span>&nbsp;</span>“develop
critical thinking skills” to enable us to make healthy choices.” And 3- “surround
ourselves with a strong support system” to encourage each other to pursue
healthier and safer lifestyle behaviors. For more information about Dr
Pasqualoni’s innovative weight loss method please check out her website <a href="http://www.strikeithealthy.com/">www.strikeithealthy.com</a></p>


We closed the show with NY Times bestselling author, Missy Chase Lapine. She wrote the book The Sneaky Chef: Simple Strategies for Hiding Healthy Foods in Kid's Favorite Meals. And now she has just published the sequel The Sneaky Chef: How To Cheat On Your Husband in the Kitchen.<br/><p class="MsoNormal">Missy is the former publisher of Eating Well magazine and
the founder of a natural baby product line Baby Spa®. She is currently on the
Culinary Arts faculty of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.generalstudies.newschool.edu/culinary/">The
New School</a>, in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York City</st1:place></st1:city>,

and demonstrations that teach families how to eat healthier. She is also a
collaborator with The Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a partnership
between the American Heart Association and the William J. Clinton Foundation,
helping schools serve healthier lunches.</p>






<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>For parents of finicky eaters, The Sneaky Chef: How to Hide
Healthy Foods in Kid's Favorite Meals, was the answer to their prayers, giving
them solutions for hiding healthy food in the meals kids crave. But women know
that there's often another picky eater in the family - Men who dismiss healthy
choices as unsatisfying rabbit food. So The Sneaky Chef has now catered to the
guys, creating delicious recipes that will appeal to the manly appetite while
sneaking in ingredients that specifically target men's health issues. <br/>
<br/>
On the show Missy explained her secret to sneak green veggies like spinach, broccoli
and peas into meals. First, you puree the green vegetables then you mix in
tomato paste which turns everything brown. Remember your colors red and green
make brown. Now that you have this brown veggie sauce you can easily mix it
into any meat sauce unnoticed.<o:p><br type="_moz"/></o:p></p>








<p class="MsoNormal">Some Sneaky Recipes for men include: pizza, wings, ribs and
nachos.<br/>Some Sneaky Recipes for kids include: mac and cheese, ice
cream, and noodles.<o:p> </o:p>For more information please check out her website <a href="http://www.thesneakychef.com/">www.thesneakychef.com</a> She says you can

<p class="MsoNormal">Before we got started we thanked Lisa Lillien, the Hungry-Girl for taking us to dinner when she was in Atlanta for her event promoting her NY Times Best Selling book Hungry-Girl: Recipes and Survival Strategies for Guilt-Free Eating in the Real World. Lisa has been coming on our show since we started and we thank her for her support and help spreading the word about our show. Now if you have been living under a rock and haven't heard of Hungry-Girl, now is the time to check her out. go to her website <a href="http://www.hungry-girl.com">www.hungry-girl.com</a> and subscribe to her daily newsletter and buy her book. Our wives bought lots of books to give as presents, it's that good. <br type="_moz"/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On
tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about the dangers of toxins in everyday products like cosmetics and plastics from award winning investigative reporter Mark Schapiro.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mark has been investigating environmental and international&nbsp;&nbsp;  issues for over 20 years. His work has been featured in: Harper's, The Nations, NOW with Bill Moyers, FRONTLINE and NPR.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 2007 he wrote Exposed, a book that compares the proactive governmental policies of the European Union when it comes to environment, safety and health to the the more reactive policies of the US.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mark explained that in the United States their are no government regulators checking to see if there are any toxins in products such as cosmetics and plastics. In Europe that is not the case. The European Union have oversight over cosmetics and they have compiled a list of dangerous ingredients that are not allowed in cosmetics. Sadly in the US cosmetics sold here are filled with carcinogens that are banned in Europe. <br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For more information about Mark, his investigative reporting and his new book Exposed, please go to his website <a href="http://www.centerforinvestigativereporting.org">www.centerforinvestigativereporting.org</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We started the show with Matt Bryzcki, Fitness Expert from Princeton University. Matt comes on each month and dispels some of the strength training and exercise myths that get spread around the internet. Tonight he went after body builders. A lot of super buff looking body builders have websites that give out a lot of bad information about losing weight and getting in shape. For instance Matt shared a story about one body builder who started smoking to lose weight for his competition. He then started eating baby food in an effort to consume more potassium (he never heard of bananas, I guess). Matt is almost finished with his new book about Youth Fitness called Youth Fitness: An Action Plan for Shaping America's Kids. He also talked about some of the books and magazines that influenced him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next we had Dr David Dahlman, author of the book Why Doesn't My Doctor Know This? <br/> </p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Dahlman, is a Chiropractor with a
degree in Nutrition, became the Director of The Hyde Park Holistic Center in order to educate patients that there are alternatives to
traditional medical care.<br/>
<br/>
Treating a variety of chronic health conditions from a nutritional and herbal
perspective, his understanding of the importance of the gastrointestinal system
to human health forms the basis of most treatment protocols. Because of this
focus, he has developed his remarkably successful treatment for any
uncomfortable symptoms associated with the gastrointestinal system.<br/>
<br/>
Whether irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's
or any form of colitis), Dr. Dahlman's treatment protocol has eliminated all
symptoms in a vast majority of his patients.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Dahlman's treatments are patient-centered and focus on finding the cause of
the patient's complaints. The treatments use all-natural supplements; they do
not use dangerous drugs that only suppress symptoms and carry the risk of
significant side effects.<br/>
<br/>On the show Dr Dahlman emphasized the importance of eliminating all dairy if you are afflicted with any of the GI problems. His website is filled with lots of great information, as well as his book so check it out <a href="http://www.drdahlman.com">www.drdahlman.com<br/></a></p>


We closed the show with one of the smartest people we have ever met Dr Cory Kidd, inventor of Autom, the world's first robotic weight loss coach. <br/>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cory recently completed his Ph.D. in human-robot interaction
at the MIT Media Lab and is known as leading researcher in the field. His
experience in human-robot interaction and developing novel technology for
healthcare applications for the last ten years is a key to Intuitive Automata's
success. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Prior to his graduate studies at the Media Lab, Cory was a
research scientist as part of the Aware Home project at the Georgia Institute
of Technology. <br/></p>
Autom was designed to help people who are trying to lose weight keep it off by encouraging them to stick with their diet and exercise program. Autom verbally asks dieters to input data about what they ate on a touch screen then she provides encouragement and advice. Autom will be available for purchase in a year or so, but they will be needing testers sooner than that so if you are interested please go to Cory's website and sign up <a href="http://www.intuitiveautomata">www.intuitiveautomata</a> and <a href="http://www.myautom.com">www.myautom.com</a><br/><br/>No Dr Fitness' Fitness

<p class="MsoNormal">Tonight's show is sponsored by The Card Mom,
Celeste Katz. If you are looking for a great easy to implement system
for sending out personal hand stamped greeting cards please check out
Celeste's great website <a href="http://www.thecardmom.com/">www.thecardmom.com</a> <br/><br/>On
tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about how structure can help you lose weight from the author of The Structure House Weight Loss Plan, Dr Gerard Musante.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Dr Musante's book is about change. Not just change in
your weight—losing the pounds you want to lose. He says weight loss is important, but
it's not really the change that is most important. Rather, The Structure House
Weigh Loss Plan focuses on changing yourself in deeper, more significant, more
durable ways than what you can measure simply by standing on your bathroom
scale. He talks about changing how you view yourself. Changing your
relationship with food. Changing your choices about how to live your life.
Changing your attitude about change itself.<br/>
<br/>
For over thirty years, Dr Musante has helped overweight and obese men and women learn about
change at Structure House, the residential program he founded in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Durham</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">North
  Carolina</st1:state></st1:place>. Approximately one thousand people
participate in their programs there each year. Some of these participants are
ten, twenty, thirty pounds over their desired weight. Others have even more
excess pounds and would be considered obese. Still others are morbidly obese—so
overweight that their health is in immediate jeopardy. <br/>
<br/>
Almost all of the people who have come to Structure House understand that
excess weight can lead to medical problems such as diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, hypertension, and other serious health risks. These participants stay
at Structure House for a period of time and, each in his or her own way, learn
about the possibilities for change and about the skills that make change
possible. For more information about Dr Musante's book (which is now available in paperback) and his amazing program please go to his website <a href="http://www.structurehouse.com">www.structurehouse.com</a><br/></p>

<br/><p class="MsoNormal">We led the show off with Dr Lisa Young, author of the Portion Teller and the Portion Teller Plan.<br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dr Young is a nationally
recognized nutrition consultant and faculty member at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a>. Dr. Young
has been counseling adults and children for more than 15 years, has published
numerous articles on portion sizes, and frequently lectures on nutrition.
Widely considered an expert on portion control, Young is regularly featured in
national publications including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,
USA Today, the Boston Globe, the Washington Post, Newsweek, Self, Fitness, and
Glamour. She has also been featured on national television including the Today
Show, ABC News, CBS News, and CNN, and was in the film Super Size Me.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The Portion Teller Plan will teach you how to understand
portion sizes so that you can lose weight and stop dieting, no matter what your
portion personality might be. Are you a mindless muncher who snacks all day, a
dinner lover who enjoys one big meal a day, or maybe a volume eater who always
wants to sit down with a huge plate of food at every meal? No matter what your
eating habits, The Portion Teller Plan offers a personalized eating plan that
is right for you. <br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Instead of giving up the foods you love, learn to smartsize
them with the help of one of the country’s leading nutritionists. &nbsp; Would
you ever consider going to the kitchen in the morning and grabbing five slices
of bread for breakfast? No? Just one bagel or perhaps a bran muffin is more like
it, right? Well, think again. Your morning bagel or muffin is probably
equivalent to eating five slices of bread, maybe more. That’s most of your
grain servings for the day. &nbsp; And, that steak you ate last night? For all
the calories and protein you consumed, you might as well have eaten 18 eggs.
More than double the amount of protein you need in a day. &nbsp; <br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Surprised at
just how much you are eating? Dr. Lisa Young isn’t. She has been studying how
Americans eat for more than a decade, and what she found is astonishing.
Portion sizes have subtly and steadily increased over the past thirty years and
are now two to five times larger than they were in the past. Even the average
dinner plate has grown several inches to accommodate more food. The portions
we’re served are getting bigger and we keep eating. The end result? That’s
right. Americans are getting fatter. For more information about Dr Young and her books please go to her website <a href="http://www.portionteller.com">www.portionteller.com</a><br/></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Next up we had our good friend Nicci Micco, Senior Editor with Eating Well magazine. We thanked her profusely for helping Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy become Editor's Picks in this month's issue of the magazine. <br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Nicci talked about an important article in her magazine titled &quot;10 Steps to Heart Health&quot; She says that you can change your fate just by Eating Well. 

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, heart disease affects about 9
million adults, killing one every 37 seconds. But the good news—which <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/health/health_diet_centers/heart_disease_qanda.html">Dr.
Philip Ades</a>, author of the new book <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/shop/cookbooks/healthy_heart_cookbook.html">EatingWell
for a Healthy Heart</a> has made it his mission to spread—is that heart-disease
is mostly preventable. Research shows that up to 90 percent of heart disease
can be prevented by changing one’s diet, exercising more, maintaining a healthy
weight and not smoking. </p>







<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/health/health_diet_centers/10_heart_steps_p1.html">Reduce
your risk by following these 10 simple steps.</a><br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1- Know your numbers; 2-Calculate your risk; 3-Lose some weight; 4-less saturated fats; 5-lose the junk food. You'll have to listen to get the rest or go to their website for more information <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com">www.eatingwell.com</a>. You can get Dr Ades' book there as well.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next we had on Evelyn Tribole, author of the book Intuitive Eating.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">

</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.evelyntribole.com/">Evelyn Tribole, MS,
RD,</a> is an award-winning dietitian with a counseling practice in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Irvine</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state></st1:place>,
where she helps clients create a healthy relationship with food, mind and
body.&nbsp; She was the nutrition expert for Good Morning America and qualified
for the 1984 Olympic trials in the women's marathon. Although she no longer
competes, she runs for fun and fitness. <o:p></o:p>Evelyn had some great tips like eat like a food critic...taste each bite and slowly enjoy it. There were lots more tips <br/></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Intuitive eating is an approach that teaches you how
to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;healthy relationship with your food, mind,&nbsp;and
body--where you ultimately become the expert of your own
body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You learn how&nbsp; to distinguish between physical and
emotional feelings, and gain a sense of body wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's also a
process of making peace with food---so that you no longer have constant
&quot;food worry&quot; thoughts.&nbsp; It's knowing that your health and your
worth as a person does not change because you ate a so-called &quot;bad&quot;
or &quot;fattening&quot; food.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
On the surface this may sound simplistic, but it is rather complex. For example
one of the basic principles of Intuitive Eating is the ability to respond to
inner body cues, “Eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full?, which may
sound&nbsp; like a no-brainer. But when you have history of chronic
dieting&nbsp; or rigid “healthy? rules about eating it's quite difficult
because a number of things need to be in place, including the ability to trust
yourself! For more information and to get her book please go to her website <a href="http://www.intuitiveeating.com">www.intuitiveeating.com</a><br/></p>

</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Tonight's show is sponsored by The Card Mom,
Celeste Katz. If you are looking for a great easy to implement system
for sending out personal hand stamped greeting cards please check out
Celeste's great website <a href="http://www.thecardmom.com/">www.thecardmom.com</a> <br/><br/>On
tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn all about how to get in shape for your wedding from the star of Buff Brides Sue Fleming. <br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Fitness expert Sue Fleming is the creator of the Buff
Fitness® workout regimen. The program’s popularity led to a critically
acclaimed reality TV series – Buff Brides – on Discovery Health Channel, still
in reruns on Fit TV. Sue’s new Buff line of workout DVDs are based on her
Random House/Villard book series, which includes Buff Brides, Buff Moms, Buff
Moms-to-Be, and Fashionably Buff. </p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Sue is the newest celebrity trainer to join the roster of
ExerciseTV, a new multi-platform television network dedicated to fitness,
motivation and sports training.&nbsp; Segments from each of Sue’s Buff workout
DVDs can be viewed free on-demand by all Comcast, Time Warner and Cox digital
cable customers.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Sue, a naturally competitive athlete, instinctively knew the
better the bride looked and felt out of her clothes, the more magical she would
look (and feel!) while donning the breath-taking couture creation of her
fantasy wedding. And so was born the Buff Fitness regimen. Far more than another
cleverly packaged brand, Fleming has brought a sense of steadfast teamwork to a
results oriented regimen that has grown into a global health and fitness
empire.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>A native of <st1:state w:st="on">New York</st1:state>’s Long
Island, Fleming found her calling early on as she yearned for the camaraderie
of team sports first at <st1:placename w:st="on">Riverhead</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">High School</st1:placetype> and later while attending <st1:placename w:st="on">Canisius</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">College</st1:placetype>
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Buffalo</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">NY</st1:state></st1:place>, where she earned her Masters. This
proved to be particularly challenging in an era when women in sports were still
a relative rarity.&nbsp; “I was so grateful for women like Chris Evert and
Billie Jean King, as they proved that women could be strong and athletic…and
win!? recalls Fleming.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Sue says that whether you have six days or six months you
can make a huge difference in the way you look and feel.&nbsp; The real
challenge however is to maintain it for 60 years.&nbsp; That’s where Sue takes over.&nbsp; Dedicated to working with clients to overcome their fears of
fitness and body image, Sue develops the most important muscle of all…self-esteem.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Rather than resting on her well-toned laurels, Sue sees
endless possibilities in bringing her message of fitness to the world. That’s
why Sue wants women to understand that a fitness regimen is not a quick fix,
but a long-term way of life.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>A popular fixture in the media... USA
Today, Cosmopolitan and InStyle Weddings not to mention a sought after guest on
ABC TV’s Good Morning America learn more about Sue on her website <a href="http://www.buff-fitness.com/">www.buff-fitness.com</a></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">We started the show off with one of our good friends Tiffany Davis, Atlanta Editor of the Daily Candy. Tiffany shared with our listeners some of the hottest exercise gear choices out there. First she lead off with <a href="http://www.foodtee.com">www.foodtee.com</a> then she got into <a href="http://www.converse.com">www.converse.com</a> and their hip new designs by some guy with a foreign sounding name which must be good.

<br/>
On tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn how about the surprisingly simple weight loss plan for hardworking people who
don't have time to diet from Heather Bauer,
RD, CDN, author of The Wall Street
Diet and founder of&nbsp; <a href="http://www.Nu-Train.com">www.Nu-Train.com</a>.</p>



<p>Heather Bauer&nbsp; is a Registered Dietitian specializing in the
interrelation between eating habits, metabolism, and lifestyle. Since 2001, she
has offered private diet and nutrition counseling through her New York
City-based nutrition practice, Nu-Train.</p>



<p>Ms. Bauer
received her RD from the University of
Wisconsin and started her career in
the pre- and post-natal nutrition unit at Maimonides
Medical Center
in New York,
and as a staff nutritionist at Equinox Fitness Clubs. </p>



<p>Ms. Bauer has
appeared as a featured nutritionist in several health and beauty publications
including Elle,
Marie
Claire, Gotham,
Self, Seventeen, YM, TimeOut, New York Magazine,
and Fitness Magazine. She has also appeared as a guest expert on the CBS Early Morning Show as well as FOX News.</p>





<p>&nbsp;Her brand new book THE WALL STREET
DIET: The Surprisingly Simple Weight Loss Plan for Hardworking People Who
Don't Have Time to Diet (Hardcover) by Heather
Bauer&nbsp; is available at her website&nbsp; <a href="http://www.wallstreetdiet.com">www.wallstreetdiet.com</a>.</p>



<p>Bauer, a
dietician, directs her flexible plan at people who would never go for
prepackaged meals or calorie counting. Her clientele are workaholics who grab
meals on the go, do business over expense-account lunches and are frequently
confronted by unhealthy treats in the conference room or at office parties.
Bauer claims her approach makes losing weight a seamless part of the corporate
lifestyle rather than an add-on project to an already full schedule. <br/></p>
<p>First,
readers are asked to decide if they are a Clean Plate Clubber or a Controlled
Eater, as this will help determine the course of their diet in regards to
snacking, purchasing food and meal portions. Next, they are allowed to choose a
few non-negotiables, i.e., the things they feel they cannot live without. <br/></p>
<p>Once
these guidelines are intact, Bauer offers strategies for dealing with the food
choices most working people confront daily (for ordering in with co-workers,
take note of the healthy menu options beforehand, and don't succumb to dishes
like General Tso's Chicken). Though Bauer's diet consists of nothing
earth-shattering (avoid flour and refined sugar, control portion sizes, etc.),
the specificity of the situations and solutions presented should appeal to its
target audience who are busy people.</p>







<p>Next we had on Laura King with <a href="http://">www.Lauraking.net</a></p>



<p>Laura&nbsp; is frequently sought out by
Olympians, leading edge CEO's, professional athletes, prominent physicians,
award-winning trainers and parents. She teaches individuals how
to utilize their minds to make lasting changes in both their performance and
lives. <br/></p>
<p>In her recent book, The Power to Win, King explains how the use of
hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) can easily help anyone conquer
fear, build confidence and obtain unprecedented success. A popular speaker and
admired life coach, Laura has published over 150 CDs and workbooks covering
topics such as stress management, peak performance, public speaking, overcoming
illness and much more.</p>



<p>Mrs. King is
director and founder of Summit Dynamics, LCC and is a certified hypnotist and
certified sport hypnotist. A student of human excellence and positive behavior
modification for over 25 years, Laura was trained at the Omni
Hypnosis Training
Center and the Don Mottin Sports Hypnosis
 Training Center,
and received her NLP training from Dr. William Horton. She also spent over two
decades studying with her mentor, Dorothy Gates, Ph.D., internationally
recognized authority on child and adult development.</p>



<p>She has an excellent tool to help you lose weight called the Complete Weight
Loss / Be Fit for Life Series.</p>





<p>The Be Fit for
Life Series - Complete Weight Loss Program gets results by retraining your
brain to attain and maintain the ideal weight for your body type. Long-term
weight loss is not a matter of willpower, it's about changing thought patterns
that trigger behavior. Through self-hypnosis CDs, your subconscious mind puts
you on autopilot to get and keep the body that is just right for you. You
become focused on healthy eating, speeding up your metabolism, and developing a
positive self-image. </p>









<p>&nbsp;Then we were lucky to have the most popular home chef in Atlanta<br/>Megan McCarthy with <a href="http://">www.Healthyeating101.com</a> in the studio with us.</p>



<p>Megan is a
former vegan and vegetarian and brings her raw foodist background into real
life, incorporating highly nutritious food into a healthy eating lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Megan took an interest in healthy eating when she was trying to lose weight
after college.&nbsp; After trying every diet out there, she realized it was all
about feeding the body nourishing and smart foods…simply called
&quot;Superfoods.?&nbsp; All-natural and given to us in their perfect form, she
transforms Superfoods into everyday eating pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Megan has been in the restaurant business since she was 16.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
have included “Karyn's Fresh Corner? raw foods restaurant and several “Lettuce
Entertain You?&nbsp;restaurants in Chicago.&nbsp;
&nbsp;She has taught healthy cooking classes for over 8 years.&nbsp; She
teaches in both Chicago and Atlanta
for Whole Foods Market, Cook's Warehouse, Latin School&quot;s Live and Learn, Discovery Center
as well as many private home classes. Her classes sell out fast, as she is always one the most popular cooking instructors wherever she goes.<br/>
<br/>
Megan also provides professional chef services to national corporate tradeshow
clients at FMI (Food Marketing Institute), PMA (Produce Marketing Assoc.) and
the International Home &amp; Housewares Show.&nbsp; She has made guest chef
appearances at Crate &amp; Barrel’s Gourmet Pantry and at the NBC Health and Fitness
Expos.&nbsp;&nbsp; She has also made guest appearances on radio and television
programs, such as the nationally syndicated show, “Starting Over,? helping the
women of the house choose healthier food alternatives.&nbsp; She was recently
featured on DailyCandy.com for her healthy home cooking classes in Chicago.&nbsp;</p>











<p>And finally we closed the show with Jordan Goldberg who is with the website <a href="http://www.stickk.com">www.stickk.com</a></p>



<p>stickK promotes
healthier and happier living by helping people achieve their personal goals
through the signing of Commitment Contracts. Happier people = happier world!</p>
On stickK, you draw up an official commitment
contract that binds you to achieving a personal goal, be it big or small. By
agreeing to this contract, you publicly state your goal and commit to achieving
it. Or, if grand public pronouncements aren’t your style, you can tell only
people you select. Either way, you’ve committed to a goal and people know about
it - so now it’s your reputation at stake!<br/>
<br/>
To make you accountable as you work toward your goal, you file weekly reports
on your success. (And don’t even think about lying -- because you appoint
someone you know as a “referee? to verify the accuracy of your reporting!) You
also enlist as many Supporters as you’d like to encourage you, via the website,
every step of the way. If being part of a group gives you momentum, you can
join a community of people on the site who are working toward the same goal as
you (this feature will be ready in February). To keep yourself focused
throughout your adventure, you record your progress – daily -- in a personal
journal. <br/>
<br/>
Want to up the ante? Gamble more than your reputation. Place a financial wager
on yourself.<br/><br/>No Dr Fitness' Fitness

always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek

compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's

<br/>
On tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn how to dance with the stars and lose some weight while doing it. We had on Jaana Kunitz and Julia Powers stars of the Core Rhythms dance exercise dvd series.

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In CORE RHYTHMS FULL WORKOUT Jaana and Julia teach you the 3
Core Movements essential to Latin dancing and give you drills to exercise your
core to uplifting Latin music. Jaana and Julia make it FUN to follow with their
never before seen instructional help segments within the workout. This workout
is for anyone who is willing to get up and move!</p>








<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Julia is the 12 times undefeated
and US Rhythm Champions as well as 3 times World Mambo Champion. Julia and her husband have won more <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">US</st1:place></st1:country-region> titles than
any other couple in the history of American ballroom dancing.&nbsp; They have taken American Style dancing to new levels with their innovative
choreography and athletic approach. <br/>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><br/>
Jaana and her husband James started their dynamic partnership by competing,

many major corporate events, industrial shows, dance companies, productions,
music videos and movies. They are known for their creative and unique approach

<p class="MsoNormal">
They are one of the most televised DanceSport couples in the world. Their
appearances Include PBS “Championship Ballroom Dancing?, NBC “DanceSport
Series?, Goodlife TV, ESPN, Ole Suzanna, and many, many more. They were also
finalists on the hit movie “Dance with Me? starring Vanessa Williams. Through a constant physical training program including Yoga, Pilates, Hip Hop,

<p class="MsoNormal">For more information about them and all their great videos please go to their website <a href="http://www.corerhythms.com">www.corerhythms.com</a><br/></p>



Next we had on Alisa Menell from Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy's wives favorite shopping social network <a href="http://www.Kaboodle.com">www.Kaboodle.com <br/></a><br/>With Kaboodle, you can collect information from anywhere on
the web, put it into a Kaboodle list that you can share with others, and
discover other interesting lists from like-minded Kaboodlers. You can also
invite your friends to Kaboodle, where you can help one another with research,
planning, or decisions on what to buy.

<br/>

<p class="MsoNormal">Kaboodle is a fun shopping community where people recommend
and discover new things. To use Kaboodle, you get two buttons in your browser.
Whenever you like a product, an article, a picture or any web page, click on
the Add to Kaboodle button and it will add it to your personal collection list
in Kaboodle. You can create a list on any topic ranging from buying a sofa to planning

page. You can <a href="http://www.kaboodle.com/zd/setup/setuphelp.html">download
the buttons here.</a></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>And finally we closed the show with one of our favorite regulars Nicci Micco from EatingWell magazine stopped by to share all she knows about organic food and the importance of eating local.<br type="_moz"/></o:p></p>











<p class="MsoNormal">Eating organic berries instead of conventional ones can reduce your exposure to pesticides, and recent research suggests that it also may give you a nutrient boost.</p>





























<p class="MsoNormal">According to Marissa Lippert's, M.S., R.D. article in this month's Eating Well magazine the bottom line is...“Eating more fresh fruits and vegetables in general [not necessarily organic ones] is the point,? says Alyson Mitchell, Ph.D., an associate professor of food science and technology at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename w:st="on">California</st1:placename></st1:place>, Davis<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"></st1:place></st1:city>. <br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If buying all organic isn’t a priority—or a financial reality for you—you might opt for organic specifically when you’re selecting foods that are most heavily contaminated with pesticide and insecticide residues. According to the Environmental Working Group (<a href="http://www.ewg.org">www.ewg.org</a>), those include peaches, apples, bell peppers, celery, nectarines, strawberries, cherries, lettuce, imported grapes and pears.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For more information about organics and eating well in general check out Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy's favorite foodie magazine at <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com">www.eatingwell.com</a> and when you're their be sure to sign up for some of their great email newsletters.<br/></p>

On tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy learn how make your workouts more eco-friendly and green from Liz Neporent.

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">˜Liz Neporent had some great ideas for ?greening? our
workouts. DVDs are a great way to go. For every 4 copies of the Element: Yoga
for Beginners and Yoga: Ballet Conditioning DVDs (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2nn3xs" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/2nn3xs</a>)
sold, the Arbor Day Foundation plants a tree in a national forest. Good for
you, good for all.™ <br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of her other tips to green your workouts are: 1- walk or run to the gym instead of drive; 2-Be conscious use re-usable water bottles instead of disposable ones; 3-Recycle-your old sneakers can be recycled instead of thrown away. She has more tips on her website <a href="http://www.w360.com ">www.w360.com</a> <br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Liz is the author of several of the &quot;Dummies&quot; books including: Fitness Walking for Dummies, Weight Training for Dummies, Fitness for Dummies and her latest book The Fat Free Truth. Check all those out on her website <a href="http://www.lizzyfit.com">www.lizzyfit.com</a></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>


Next we had on Christina Lindley, the fitness model/spokesperson turned serious actress. Christina was discovered in an Atlanta mall when she was 14 and has parlayed that into a successful career as a fitness model doing work for companies such as <a href="http://www.bsnonline.net">BSN - a leader in supplements</a>, Fitness RX magazine and BodyBuilding.com. She currently writers a column for <a href="http://www.bodybulding.com">www.bodybulding.com</a> and other national fitness magazines.<br/><br/>You can see her on Lifetime in their first ever miniseries &quot;The Capture of the Green River Killer&quot; on March 30 and 31, which she stars in with Tom Cavanaugh. Check out her website for amazing pictures and her schedule of upcoming appearances <a href="http://www.christinalindley.net">www.christinalindley.net</a><br/><br/>We closed the show with one of our good friends John Biggs with his regular Crunchgear report. John travels the world giving our listeners the heads up on the latest fitness gadgets. Tonight he told us about some great iPod headphones you can find at <a href="http://www.jaybirdgear.com">www.jaybirdgear.com</a>. If you love gadgets you must check out <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com">www.crunchgear.com the internet's best source for information about what gear you should buy and what you should avoid.</a><br/><br/>Dr Fitness <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">Fitness
Tips</a> were all about how the pros and cons of Fat Camp for your kid. Number
1 - they have a high compliance rate of success after the kid leaves camp. Number 2
- they improve a kids confidence and self esteem. And Number 3- they teach role playing skills that will kieep the kid on the program when they get home. There were
more great tips but you'll have to listen to get the rest. The Fat Guy gives Fat Camps 2 Chins Up!<br/><br/>The Fat Guy gave his Easter Candy update he read from a recent posting from Sarah Kliff in her article from <a href="http://www.Newsweek.com">www.Newsweek.com</a>. 140 calories in a row of Peeps, 1050 calories in a solid chocolate bunny.<br type="_moz"/>



<p class="MsoNormal">No Rachael the Intern's hot internet finds this week.&nbsp; </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by over 3 dozen
people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have
thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the Fat Guy's eating exploits on
Twitter.&nbsp; Food journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is
always trying anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's
right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy Twitters about it and you
can follow him so that one day if you try real hard you too can look like the
Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Hot mom, Kathie Larkin was not in the studio lending her thoughts and
laughter.&nbsp; You know Kathie as the host of Real Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real
Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms, all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and online and now on in Atlanta. So be
sure to look out for that. Remember Kathie is one of the top&nbsp;feet and legs
model's out there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa
Milano in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure to check

<br/>

On radio station WKNW. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy

a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should

show &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show for your kids. It is kind of

exercises, letting viewers know what they can expect. Muscles are worked from
head to toe, mostly with the help of hand weights. Bonus segments include
“Baywatch Sun Protection Tips? and talent slide shows of Lauren and her two

We also had on regular contributor and Senior Editor of Eating Well Magazine Nicci Micco. Nicci explained to us the difference between farm raised Atlantic salmon and wild salmon. She said that health-wise eating most fish and especially salmon is good for you. But from an environmental perspective eating wild salmon is probably the way to go. To learn more about this issue please go to Dr Fitness' favorite food magazine's website <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com">www.eatingwell.com</a> Remember pick up this months Avocado issue at Whole Foods or&nbsp; subscribe online. <br/><br/>We also had on Susan Bellone and Matt Jones. These two inspirational people have teamed up to help feed the hungry. Susan started Potatoes for Pounds where she has donated 10 pounds of potatoes for every pound she has lost. And she is encouraging others to follow her lead. Matt is a gallery owner who does events and encourages his patrons to donate potatoes and other food as their ticket into his events. He has been doing this for years and has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds of food to food banks.&nbsp; These two are encouraging everyone to get involved start a challenge in your community.

For those not in the know a celebrant helps families heal with uplifting funerals. PAm has done celebrity funerals like Richard Pryor's but spends most of her time helping regular folks go out in a way that really celebrates their life instead of a typical sad preachy service from a religious leader who in some cases barely knows the departed. Funeral's don't have to be a buzz kill they can really be meaningful, fun and inspirational.

Amazingly
the Fat Guy is being followed by over 3 dozen people who are interested in
what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.
That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot
mom, Kathie Larkin was nowhere to be found. she's usually in the studio lending her thoughts and
laughter.&nbsp; You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms,
all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online and now on in Atlanta. So be sure to look out for that. Remember
Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/">www.getkathie.com</a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station WKNW. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc.</a> Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you
should check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio show
&quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with
a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download
the show for your kid. He had a big show recently he interviewed
Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.
And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week. The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a> and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com.
He has gotten emails from kids from England, Australia, China and even
the US. Your encouragement is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks to you his
show is rocketing up the charts!!! <br/><br/>

So please click POD to listen to <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy</a> learn all about how to use your emotions to help you make the changes in your life that need to be made.<br/><br/>Michelle Bersell, author of the book Emotional Abundance: Become
Empowered. This book has been called an owners manual to your emotions.
Michelle is a psychotherapist and life coach who teaches us how to
honor our authentic selves and
utilize our emotional process to reveal the direction that will support
us to
live our best life.
<p class="MsoNormal">She believes that most of us have been going about our lives getting by
with what we feel we can handle.&nbsp; Our lives do not feel balanced because
they are so full.&nbsp; There is so much that we must be responsible for that
our days feel dictated by those demands.&nbsp; When we are living like this, she call it “survival mode.? &nbsp;</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Survival mode is living our life based on what we need to do
to get by each day and fulfilling the demands placed on us.</p>




Unfortunately, when we are in survival mode, we
feel depleted and run down,
which means we are not truly living. this is where we are susceptible
to being overweight.&nbsp; If you are struggling with your weight Michelle
says &quot;Don't be a victim to your weight&quot; Instead of &quot;shoulding&quot; yourself
with put downs try focusing on what is going to best serve you. Are you
really willing to honor yourself? For more information please go to

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/Dr_Fitness_and_the_Fat_Guy_02282008_Karen_Child__Danielle_Tiano_Interview.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We’re trying something new. First we will podcast our show in it’s entirety then we’ll release just the <a href="http://www.drfitnessblog.com/">guest interviews</a> during the week. So please click POD to listen to <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy</a> learn all about how to protect your children from internet porn.<br/><br/>We were so fortunate to have Danielle Tiano and Karen Child in the
studio this evening. They flew all the way from California to meet with
us. They are the creators of the Temptation of a Generation series of
books. While this may seem off topic for us, Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
are both parents who care deeply about protecting children from
unnecessary harm and that's exactly what these brilliant ladies do. <br/><p class="MsoNormal">The Temptation of a Generation series is the first
children's series to tackle the tough issues today's kids face in the
information age. The series addresses pre-teen and adolescent issues such as
self-image, technology addiction, relationships and more. With beautifully detailed
illustrations, the books create a visual experience and teach important life
lessons that will serve children well into adulthood.</p>







<p class="MsoNormal">Both Danielle and Karen have a passion to protect, educate and entertain children
and they believe that the best way to do that is through the parents.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal">Their books begin by encouraging young readers to think about
what effect technology has on their lives, specifically the activities and
relationships they miss out on by focusing on the Internet and other
electronics. The first in the series, Temptation of a Generation, explains the
stages of Internet addiction and how the pornographic industry targets children
as young as 8-years old. <br/></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">
Many families do not know how to open the forbidden lines of
communication
regarding sex and pornography, yet it needs to be addressed in every
home…their
books are the tool to do so.&nbsp;Some parents want to have “the talk? but
don’t know how; others are too busy or naive thinking that problems
will never
find their child.&nbsp;After introducing the tough topic to your child,
Danielle and Karen provide questions to facilitate a discussion and a
worksheet to help develop Internet boundaries for your home. This
series of books is a must have for every parent of kids who are online.
Please go to their websites and get more information and buy their
books. <a href="http://www.temptationofageneration.com/">www.temptationofageneration.com</a>, <a href="http://www.beyondyourwords.com/">www.beyondyourwords.com</a>, <a href="http://www.karenchildmft.com/">www.karenchildmft.com</a> and <a href="http://www.lifestarsocal.com/">www.lifestarsocal.com</a>. They have a newsletter and they are available to help you and help your kids.</p>

First we will podcast our show in it’s entirety then we’ll release just the <a href="http://www.drfitnessblog.com/">guest interviews</a> during the week. So please click POD to listen to <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy</a> learn all about how to Never Be Fat Again and Never Be Sick Again from Raymond Francis,
founder of Beyond Health. Raymond is an M.I.T.-trained scientist and an
expert in
supplement chemistry. He has been called
&quot;one the few scientists to achieve a breakthrough understanding of
health
and disease.&quot; And that endorsement wasn't given to him by his good
friend actor, Rob Schneider.<br/><br/>&nbsp;Forced to save his own life over two
decades ago, Raymond
has created a revolutionary model of health. His model addresses the
causes of disease
rather than treating its symptoms. When you address the causes,
problems
disappear.&nbsp; He believes there is only ONE DISEASE
and only TWO CAUSES of disease. <br/><br/>He wouldn't tell us what that was but
he said his website could give us a lot of good information about it. The health information on his website and in his
books Never Be Sick Again and Never Be Fat Again as well as his
newsletter Beyond Health News is designed to inform you of health
choices that will empower you to choose
health, helping you to get well, stay well and never be sick again.
<br/><br/>During the interview he gave us great tips like eat fresh fruits and
veggies, don't eat processed foods, use high quality supplementation
and make sure you get enough calcium. He also mentioned that because
the soil contains much less minerals and nutrients you have to eat a
lot more vegetables and fruits to get the same level of nutrition as
you would have 50 years ago. So he thinks supplements are the way to
go. <a href="http:///">Please check out his website www.beyondhealth.com</a><a href="http:///"> </a><a href="http://www.beyondhealth.com/">for more information.</a>  <p>

            <description><![CDATA[The most entertaining weight loss and fitness podcast show on radio.&quot;
Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=88916078">To download the show on iTunes please click on this link</a><br/><br/>On
tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
learn how to Never Be Fat Again and Never Be Sick Again from Raymond Francis, founder of Beyond Health. Raymond is an M.I.T.-trained scientist and an expert in
supplement chemistry. He has been called
&quot;one the few scientists to achieve a breakthrough understanding of health
and disease.&quot; And that endorsement wasn't given to him by his good friend actor, Rob Schneider. Forced to save his own life over two decades ago, Raymond
has created a revolutionary model of health. His model addresses the causes of disease
rather than treating its symptoms. When you address the causes, problems
disappear.&nbsp; He believes there is only ONE DISEASE
and only TWO CAUSES of disease. He wouldn't tell us what that was but he said his website could give us a lot of good information about it. 

<p class="MsoNormal">The health information on his website and in his books Never Be Sick Again and Never Be Fat Again as well as his newsletter Beyond Health News is designed to inform you of health choices that will empower you to choose
health, helping you to get well, stay well and never be sick again. During the interview he gave us great tips like eat fresh fruits and veggies, don't eat processed foods, use high quality supplementation and make sure you get enough calcium. He also mentioned that because the soil contains much less minerals and nutrients you have to eat a lot more vegetables and fruits to get the same level of nutrition as you would have 50 years ago. So he thinks supplements are the way to go. <a href="http://">Please check out his website www.beyondhealth.com</a><a href="http://"> </a><a href="http://www.beyondhealth.com">for more information.</a><br/></p>


We were so fortunate to have Danielle Tiano and Karen Child in the studio this evening. They flew all the way from California to meet with us. They are the creators of the Temptation of a Generation series of books. While this may seem off topic for us, Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy are both parents who care deeply about protecting children from unnecessary harm and that's exactly what these brilliant ladies do. <br/><p class="MsoNormal">The Temptation of a Generation series is the first
children's series to tackle the tough issues today's kids face in the
information age. The series addresses pre-teen and adolescent issues such as
self-image, technology addiction, relationships and more. With beautifully detailed
illustrations, the books create a visual experience and teach important life
lessons that will serve children well into adulthood.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Both Danielle and Karen have a passion to protect, educate and entertain children
and they believe that the best way to do that is through the parents.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Their books begin by encouraging young readers to think about
what effect technology has on their lives, specifically the activities and
relationships they miss out on by focusing on the Internet and other
electronics. The first in the series, Temptation of a Generation, explains the
stages of Internet addiction and how the pornographic industry targets children
as young as 8-years old. <br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Many families do not know how to open the forbidden lines of communication
regarding sex and pornography, yet it needs to be addressed in every home…their
books are the tool to do so.&nbsp;Some parents want to have “the talk? but
don’t know how; others are too busy or naive thinking that problems will never
find their child.&nbsp;After introducing the tough topic to your child, Danielle and Karen provide questions to facilitate a discussion and a
worksheet to help develop Internet boundaries for your home. This series of books is a must have for every parent of kids who are online. Please go to their websites and get more information and buy their books. <a href="http://www.temptationofageneration.com">www.temptationofageneration.com</a>, <a href="http://www.beyondyourwords.com">www.beyondyourwords.com</a>, <a href="http://www.karenchildmft.com">www.karenchildmft.com</a> and <a href="http://www.lifestarsocal.com">www.lifestarsocal.com</a>. They have a newsletter and they are available to help you help your kids.</p>
We also had on Minda Burr, author of The Art of Fun and The Power of Play Workbook. Minda shared her experiences helping people regain their sense of fun. She does exciting workshops on the Art of Fun and uses her background as a drama coach to get her clients to loosen up, let their hair down and wake up their inner child. Please check out her website <a href="http://www.mindaburr.com">www.mindaburr.com</a> for more information about her book and to see if there is a workshop coming to your city. BTW she designs the most amazing jewelry, you can see some of it on her website as well.<br/><br/>Next we had on Michelle Bersell, author of the book Emotional Abundance: Become Empowered. This book has been called an owners manual to your emotions. Michelle is a psychotherapist and life coach who teaches us how to honor our authentic selves and
utilize our emotional process to reveal the direction that will support us to
live our best life.

<p class="MsoNormal">She believes that most of us have been going about our lives getting by
with what we feel we can handle.&nbsp; Our lives do not feel balanced because
they are so full.&nbsp; There is so much that we must be responsible for that
our days feel dictated by those demands.&nbsp; When we are living like this, she call it “survival mode.? &nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Survival mode is living our life based on what we need to do
to get by each day and fulfilling the demands placed on us.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, when we are in survival mode, we feel depleted and run down,
which means we are not truly living. this is where we are susceptible to being overweight.&nbsp; If you are struggling with your weight Michelle says &quot;Don't be a victim to your weight&quot; Instead of &quot;shoulding&quot; yourself with put downs try focusing on what is going to best serve you. Are you really willing to honor yourself? For more information please go to Michelle's website <a href="http://www.michellebersell.com">www.michellebersell.com</a>. You can order her book, see when she is doing one of her retreats and sign up for her newsletter. <br/></p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>No Dr Fitness <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">Fitness Tips</a>
and no Rachael the Intern's hot internet finds this week.&nbsp; <br/></p>





Amazingly
the Fat Guy is being followed by over 3 dozen people who are interested in
what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.
That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot
mom, Kathie Larkin was back in the studio lending her thoughts and
laughter.&nbsp; You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms,
all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online and now on in Atlanta. So be sure to look out for that. Remember
Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/">www.getkathie.com</a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station WKNW. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com">Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc.</a> Now these Wellness Minutes are available online.&nbsp; If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you
should check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio show
&quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with
a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download
the show for your kid. He had a big show recently he interviewed
Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.
And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week. The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a> and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com.
He has gotten emails from kids from England, Australia, China and even
the US. Your encouragement is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks to you his
show is rocketing up the charts!!! <br/><br/>

retired by 41 as a millionaire. He might of been rich but he
was also extremely overweight.&nbsp; He tipped the scales at over 2 Fat Guys, in fact he weighed 430 pounds. He says he
had a 62 inch waist when he was at his heaviest. Which by the way, is taller than Dr Fitness. He tried every diet,
he even had his wife gain weight in order to join weight watchers so he
could get their diet plan.<br/>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Then,
almost miraculously, he discovered the start of an eating program that
might work for
him. He ate his son’s frozen grapes and then swapped them for his
nightly bags
of chips and dip. In only a few weeks he had lost 20 pounds. Little by
little
he started eating loads of fruits, vegetables and lean meats...Even
starchy
vegetables – the ones the low-carb plans didn’t allow. He was consuming
1000's
of calories a day, more than any diet had allowed. Better yet? There
were no points,
no food scales, no reading labels or counting carbs. All real foods and
REAL
portions.&nbsp; Roger stumbled on a diet that made him“Feel Full
Faster and Longer?. His book, Lets Do Lunch, shares his story and his&nbsp;
recommendation for the foods you should be eating in order to lose
weight. these are foods that bypass the stomach and go right to the
colon. <br/></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">An amazing weight loss story - Roger has lost 230 pounds and
kept them off for years now.&nbsp; He is offering Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy

<p class="MsoNormal">We were also lucky&nbsp; to have one of the leaders of the healthy food movement on our show this evening. George Mateljan, author of the book, really a desk reference, The World's Healthiest Foods and founder of the George Mateljan Foundation. George gave us his Top 5 healthiest food groups we should be eating in everyday. 1-Fish 2-Fruit 3-Vegetables 4-Nuts 5-Olive oil. He did say not cook with extra virgin olive oil though. Please check out George's website <a href="http://www.whfoods.org">www.whfoods.org</a> or <a href="http://">www.whfoods.com</a> for daily newsletters, information and lots of great free information. George is a guy who really wants to help people live healthier lives.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nicci Micco, Senior Editor of Eating Well magazine also joined us. She said this month's issue's cover features, wait for it, the Artichoke. She also shared some info from an article in the magazine about some myths about which foods/beverages really affect your sleep. Did you know that turkey and warm milk really don't make you sleepy. And alcohol actually represses REM sleep.&nbsp;  Nicci knew all this and more. But Eating Well magazine when it hits the news stand or subscribe at their website <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com">www.eatingwell.com</a>. You also subscribe to some great free newsletters there as well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But that's not all folks, this jam packed show also had on The Nutrition Twins live from New York.

In 1997 they co-founded Healthy Happenings Corp whose mission is to better the health through improved nutrition and lifestyle/behavior modification.</p>

And last but not least we learned all about Ballet Conditioning from fitness expert Elise Gulan.&nbsp; <span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Elise created the Element: Ballet Conditioning&nbsp; workout dvd that uses the strength of the core to create balance and stability in the entire body. She said this workout will help women and men of all shapes and sizes.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span>No Dr Fitness <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">Fitness Tips</a>
but we did have Rachael the Intern's hot internet finds this week.&nbsp; Number 1
- Poodle Fitness on You Tube or <a href="http://www.fugly.com">www.fugly.com</a>. Number 2 - Treadmill Bike on <a href="http://www.bikeforest.com/tread/index.php">www.bikeforest.com/tread/index.php</a> Number 3 Samurai Sword Fighting Workout. <br/></p>



Amazingly
the Fat Guy is being followed by over 3 dozen people who are interested in
what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.
That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot
mom, Kathie Larkin was back in the studio lending her thoughts and
laughter.&nbsp; You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms,
all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online and now on in Atlanta. So be sure to look out for that. Remember
Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/">www.getkathie.com</a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station WKNW. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips
available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you
should check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio show
&quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with
a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download
the show for your kid. He had a big show recently he interviewed
Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.
And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week. The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a> and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com.
He has gotten emails from kids from England, Australia, China and even
the US. Your encouragement is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks to you his
show is rocketing up the charts!!! <br/><br/>

learn all about strength training from Fred Hahn, author of the best
selling book The Slow Burn Fitness Revolution. <br/><br/>Slow Burn exercise
stimulates positive adaptations to every
aspect of your body including the cardiovascular system. Once
stimulated, the
body needs time, roughly 48-96 hours, to produce the benefits. Science
indicates that if the quality of an exercise program is high, 2
sessions a week
of exercise is more than adequate to cause optimal positive results.
More than
three sessions produces little added physical benefits. <br/><br/>Fred says that exercise
itself doesn't make you <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com">&quot;fit&quot; or healthy</a>. That it is sort of a
necessary
evil. The body becomes healthier if the exercise stimulus is adequate
and if
rest and recovery is allowed for. Quality not quantity is the key.
That's why you can get such a great productive effective work out in
such a short time with Fred's Slow Burn method .

<br/><br/>During the show, Fred also talked about his upcoming new book about Childhood Obesity. He feels that eating too much sugar <span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">is a big part of the problem. For more information about Fred and his Slow Burn technique please go to his website <a href="http://www.seriousstrength.com/">www.seriousstrength.com</a> </span><br/>]]></description>

learn&nbsp; about some natural treatments and healing
methods that work from one of Dr Fitness' favorite health experts Jonny Bowden.<br/><br/>
Jonny, Ph.D., C.N.S., is a nationally known <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com">weight loss</a> and nutrition
expert. He is also the author of the book Dr Fitness recommends to all
his friends &quot;150 Healthiest Foods on Earth.&quot; Jonny is always making the
rounds in the media and was recently a guest on Dr Oz's radio show. He
also has been featured
in the New York Times, Time Magazine, GQ and Prevention. <br/><br/>In
his new book Jonny focuses on natural cures,
revealing the best of alternative medicine for a mainstream audience.
Don't confuse this book with a more scammy similarly named book. Jonny
has done his homework. I'm talking thorough extensive research. The
book digs into over 75 common conditions, including
allergies, cancer, high cholesterol, depression, diabetes,
hypertension,
menopause, and stress. Here's his PMS cocktail to help alleviate some
of those PMS symptoms. Twice a day 10 days before your cycle try these
3 supplements 1) 50 mg of B6 2) 400 mg of magnesium and 3) 1000mg of
Evening of Primrose. Within 2 cycles you should notice an improvement.
This book is a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy recommendation. Please check
out his website <a href="http://www.jonnybowden.com/">www.jonnybowden.com</a> to order the book and get more information.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[The most entertaining weight loss and fitness podcast show on radio.&quot;
Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=88916078">To download the show on iTunes please click on this link</a><br/><br/>On
tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
learn about some natural treatments and healing
methods that work from one of Dr Fitness' favorite health experts Jonny Bowden.<br/><br/>
Jonny, Ph.D., C.N.S., is a nationally known weight loss and nutrition expert. He is also the author of the book Dr Fitness recommends to all his friends &quot;150 Healthiest Foods on Earth.&quot; Jonny is always making the rounds in the media and was recently a guest on Dr Oz's radio show. He also has been featured
in the New York Times, Time Magazine, GQ and Prevention. <br/><br/>In his new book Jonny focuses on natural cures,
revealing the best of alternative medicine for a mainstream audience. Don't confuse this book with a more scammy similarly named book. Jonny has done his homework. I'm talking thorough extensive research. The book digs into over 75 common conditions, including
allergies, cancer, high cholesterol, depression, diabetes, hypertension,
menopause, and stress. Here's his PMS cocktail to help alleviate some of those PMS symptoms. Twice a day 10 days before your cycle try these 3 supplements 1) 50 mg of B6 2) 400 mg of magnesium and 3) 1000mg of Evening of Primrose. Within 2 cycles you should notice an improvement. This book is a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy recommendation. Please check out his website <a href="http://www.jonnybowden.com">www.jonnybowden.com</a> to order the book and get more information.<br/>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<br/>We also had on Fred Hahn, author of the best selling book The Slow Burn Fitness Revolution. Slow Burn exercise stimulates positive adaptations to every
aspect of your body including the cardiovascular system. Once stimulated, the
body needs time, roughly 48-96 hours, to produce the benefits. Science
indicates that if the quality of an exercise program is high, 2 sessions a week
of exercise is more than adequate to cause optimal positive results. More than
three sessions produces little added physical benefits. Remember, exercise
itself doesn't make you &quot;fit&quot; or healthy. In fact it is sort of a necessary
evil. The body becomes healthier if the exercise stimulus is adequate and if
rest and recovery is allowed for. Quality not quantity is the key. That's why you can get such a great productive effective work out in such a short time.</p>

Fred also talked about his upcoming new book about Childhood Obesity. He feels that eating too much sugar <span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">is a big part of the problem. For more information about Fred and his Slow Burn technique please go to his website <a href="http://www.seriousstrength.com">www.seriousstrength.com</a> <br/><br/>And finally our last guest this evening was Goddess Life founder and Belly Dancer extraordinaire </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Dolphina.<br/></span>

<br/>Her work has been featured in over 100 magazines and numerous television shows including Sex in the City and The View. <br/>

<p class="MsoNormal">Women responded to The Goddess Workout DVD by proclaiming
it more than just bellydance, but a lifestyle. So, in
early 2001, Dolphina founded her company, GoddessLife , on the belief that
every woman is a goddess. </p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Her first book, Bellydance was published in 2005<st1:country-region w:st="on"></st1:country-region><st1:country-region w:st="on"></st1:country-region><st1:country-region w:st="on"></st1:country-region><st1:country-region w:st="on"></st1:country-region><st1:country-region w:st="on"></st1:country-region><st1:country-region w:st="on"></st1:country-region><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"></st1:place></st1:country-region> and she continues to grow her
network of goddesses worldwide by offering workshops at destination spas and <a href="http://www.dolphina.com/retreats.html"></a>in <st1:state w:st="on">California</st1:state> and <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hawaii</st1:place></st1:state>.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>In January 2008, Dolphina introduced glamour to the Goddess
Workout DVD series with Cardio Burlesque. For more information please check out her website <a href="http://www.goddesslife.com">www.goddesslife.com</a> or <a href="http://www.dolphina.com">www.dolphina.com</a> <br/></p>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span>Dr Fitness also gave us his <a href="http://www.wellnessminutes.com/">Fitness Tips</a>
on the things a Healthy Entrepreneur should be doing each day. Number 1 - wake right up each morning no snooze button. Number 2 - Get some sunlight each day.&nbsp; There were lots more tips but you
have to
listen to get them.<br/></p>

Amazingly
the Fat Guy is being followed by about 3 dozen people who are interested in
what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.
That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot
mom, Kathie Larkin was back in the studio lending her thoughts and
laughter.&nbsp; You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms,
all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online and now on in Atlanta. So be sure to look out for that. Remember
Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/">www.getkathie.com</a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station WKNW. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips
available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you
should check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio show
&quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with
a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download
the show for your kid. He had a big show recently he interviewed
Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.
And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week. The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a> and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com.
He has gotten emails from kids from England, Australia, China and even
the US. Your encouragement is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks to you his
show is rocketing up the charts!!! <br/><br/>

on to talk about his book The UnAmerican Undiet. Pete chronicles his
inspirational story about how he was depressed and fed up with his ballooning weight,
he hit rock bottom then did something drastic about it. He lost 40 pounds in about
3 months by eliminating some very American food ingredients from his
diet like sugar and white flour along with fried foods,
rich sauces and desserts. If the Fat Guy did that he would starve. Then he supercharged his exercise workout
with the help of a trainer and then like magic he lost the weight. He
has kept it off for three or so years now without any drastic setbacks.

Number 1 Use pepper in your wash to whiten those whites. Number 2. Try some white vinegar to get those stubborn deodorant sweat stains from the pits of those shirts. Number 3
Slap some cold potato slices on those puffy eyes after a long night of partying. There were lots more tips but you have to
listen tot get them.<br/><br/>Amazingly
the Fat Guy is being followed by close to 3 dozen people who are interested in
what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.
That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot
mom, Kathie Larkin was back in the studio lending her thoughts and
laughter. She even started a new segment where she asks Dr Fitness a
tough question about something in the news. Tonight she asked him what
he thought about eating cloned meat. You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms,
all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online and now on in Atlanta. So be sure to look out for that. Remember
Kathie is

Dr Fitness also gave us his Fitness Tips on how to find time to fit exercise into your life. Number 1Track how you spend your time each day. Number 2. Promise to move exercise up the priority list. Number 3 Cut out information over load by doing less reading of mags, newspapers and of course less TV time. There were lots more tips but you have to listen tot get them.<br/><br/>Amazingly
the Fat Guy is being followed by close to 3 dozen people who are interested in
what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.
That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot
mom, Kathie Larkin was back in the studio lending her thoughts and
laughter. She even started a new segment where she asks Dr Fitness a
tough question about something in the news. Tonight she asked him what
he thought about eating cloned meat. You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms,
all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online and now on in Atlanta. So be sure to look out for that. Remember
Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/">www.getkathie.com</a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station WKNW. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips
available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you
should check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio show
&quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with
a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download
the show for your kid. He had a big show recently he interviewed
Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.
And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week. The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a> and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com.
He has gotten emails from kids from England, Australia, China and even
the US. Your encouragement is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks to you his
show is rocketing up the charts!!! <br/><br/>

tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
get the skinny
about recipes that are reduced in sugar, fat and calories so you
can enjoy all the foods and sweet treats you love – and still eat healthfully from Marlene Koch.

<p class="MsoNormal">Marlene Koch, RD, is the author of the best-selling cookbook series
including Unbelievable Desserts and Fantastic Food with Splenda and the
recently released Marlene Koch’s 375 Sensational Splenda Recipes. She is a
registered dietitian and culinary nutritionist that specializes in delicious
food for healthy lifestyles.</p>

for all her books and lots of great recipes and information. There is
no denying her ability to make low calorie delicious desserts, drinks
and meals. <o:p></o:p>

</p>

<p>We
also had on one of our favorite regulars John Biggs editor of
CrunchGear. He just got back from CES and reported his findings to us.
there weren't that many fitness
gadgets to share. But he told us some great Las Vegas trade show
stories and that's always fun. Some gadgets he did mention were:
Garmin's 405 ForeRunner and Yamaha's BodyBeat. And he had a tip for
iTunes users about sorting your music by beats per minute. Check out
his blog at <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/">www.crunchgear.com</a> <br/>
              </p>


We also got to learn all about positive parenting from Dr Kerby Alvy





<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Alvy is a clinical child psychologist and
internationally
respected authority on parenting and parent training. He is the
Executive
Director and Founder of the Center for the Improvement of Child Caring
which
is famous for creating model
parent training programs. He is also the Founder and a Founding Board
Member of
the National Effective Parenting Initiative. Dr. Alvy is a prolific
author of books and articles on parenting, parent
training, child development, and child abuse prevention, as well as
authoring
and co-authoring parenting education programs and seminars. Tonight he
talked about the topic of childhood obesity form his his book The
Positive Parent.
Raising Healthy, Happy and Successful
Children Birth- Adolescence. Dr. Alvy said that dealing with a child
struggling with being overweight or obesity usually requires some
professional help. And that the parent has to deal with their own
feelings regarding weight and their child's weight in order to be
successful. And he emphasized the importance of the parents role
modeling a physically active lifestyle and healthy eating. His segment
was filled with parenting tips and advice about losing weight and also
eating disorders. Please go to his website for more information and all
his books <a href="http://www.kirbya.com/">www.kirbya.com</a> </p>

Then
we had Rachael the
Intern who scoured the internet to find these cutting edge workout
classes. First she talked about the <a href="http://www.inshapecircus.com/">Circus Workout</a>. Then she told us all about the <a href="http://www.workoutforbrides.com/">Bride Workout</a>. And she ended with the Fat Guy's favorite <a href="http://swingsetfitness.com/">Swing Set Fitness class</a>. Rachael has been a great help with our MySpace and Facebook
pages. So check us out there and please be our friends.<br/><br/>Amazingly
the Fat Guy is being followed by close to 3 dozen people who are interested in
what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.
That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot
mom, Kathie Larkin was back in the studio lending her thoughts and
laughter. She even started a new segment where she asks Dr Fitness a
tough question about something in the news. Tonight she asked him what
he thought about eating cloned meat. You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms,
all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online and now on in Atlanta. So be sure to look out for that. Remember
Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/">www.getkathie.com</a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station WKNW. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips
available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you
should check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio show
&quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with
a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download
the show for your kid. He had a big show recently he interviewed
Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.
And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week. The show can be found at <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">www.kidpowerradio.com</a> and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com.
He has gotten emails from kids from England, Australia, China and even
the US. Your encouragement is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks to you his
show is rocketing up the charts!!! <br/><br/>

about The Big Fat Health and Fitness Lie from the The Fit Advocate himself...Craig Pepin-Donat.

He breaks through the health information overload and confusion with current health and fitness
news, resources, articles and links to help you make informed
decisions. He also gives you his Best and Worst product reviews along with personal recommendations for the products that really work.

				  	with food and cooking but noticed a lack of knowledge in
				  	the medical field about eating healthy and eating well. Neither
				  	patients nor health care providers understood much about a healthful
				  	diet. Patients, it seemed, were usually told not what they <b>could</b> eat
				  	but, rather, what they <b>could not</b> eat. </p>
And that is where Dr Gourmet was born. He was uniquely qualified to combine the benefits of creating healthy tasty recipes for his his patients. <br/>His website has eatTHISdiet plans for his patients and anyone else who is interested. There are diets that are low cholesterol, low fat, low sodium. If you have acid reflux / GERD or are on Coumadin / Warfarin and soon if you are lactose intolerant you can find recipes just for you. There is even a section for kid friendly meals and how to safely navigate fast food drive thrus. Please check it out. Dr Gourmet is a great resource <a href="http://www.drgourmet.com">www.drgourmet.com</a> <br/><br/>We started the show with the Pasta Queen Jennette Fulda author of the upcoming book Half Assed: A Weight Loss Memoir. Jennette says she entered this world weighing 8
pounds 5 ounces and came close to leaving it at 372 pounds. After
several false starts, she started working her weight loss attempt in 2005.
She blogged about it along the way and two short years later she had officially lost 186 pounds, half her weight. She is looking to drop a few more pounds to get down to her goal weight of 160. Her story is truly inspiring - she started out barely able to go a half mile on the treadmill and today she is training for her first half marathon. Please check out her blog and cheer her on to her goal weight. And while your their you can pre-order her upcoming book. <a href="http://">www.pastaqueen.com</a><br/><br/>Then we had on one of the amazing people we met when we attended the Publicity Summit in New York...Carole Brody Fleet The Widow Who Wears Stilettos. Carole was widowed at a young age and has now devoted large part of her life trying to help other young widows get back on track and live a fuller more balanced life. She has a website and an upcoming book. Her book Widows Wear Stilettos: A Practical Guide For The Young Widow is especially timely now with the war helping to create widows as young as 17 years old. Her website which is the first of its kind to deal with women going through this difficult challenge. Check it out at <a href="http://www.widowswearstilettos.com">www.widowswearstilettos.com</a>.<br/><br/>Then we had the Fat Guy's Favorite drink from 2007 John Paul Lee founder of Tavalon Tea. Tavalon has been called the Starbucks of Tea. But we think they are better than that. Did you know that all tea comes from the tea leaf leaf but how it is processed determines whether it will be green, black or white? John-Paul knows that and so much more. This guy is so passionate about tea and how to give his customers a great tea experience. He talked at length about the health benefits tea. Did you know white tea has the least caffeine and black tea has the most. there are several Tavalon Tea Bars in New York City and I'm sure there will be many more popping up all over the country. This guy is on to something. So if you are interested in learning more about the ant-aging benefits of tea and want a truly premium tea you must go to <a href="http://www.tavalon.com">www.tavalon.com</a>. They will deliver the finest tea and tea accessories right to your door. The fat Guy says checks they are the best!<br/><br/>And we closed the show with sweet talkin Tiffany &quot;T-Love&quot; Davis from the Daily Candy. Tiffany as always shares websites and resources that you cannot find on your own. She is out there scouring the internet and the streets of Atlanta to find the next hot thing. Like Bacon Salt, two flavors that were born to go together like chocolate and peanut butter. Go to <a href="http://www.baconsalt.com">www.baconsalt.com</a> for more info. How about a site that helps you save the world a few grains of rice at a time. Go to <a href="http://">www.freerice.com</a> play a vocabulary game and for every correct answer you are donating some rice to hungry people. Tiffany also mentioned that a great way to start the new year off on the right foot is to start a gratitude journal. Every night before bed just take a moment to write down what you are grateful for. This might be a nice gesture from the stranger who held the door open for you or a kind word you child said to you. Only write about the good things that happened to you and you'll have a much better attidue the next day. For more great stuff from tiffany please sign up for the Daily Candy newsletter at <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com">www.dailycandy.com</a>.<br/><br/>Amazingly
the Fat Guy is being followed by close to 3 dozen people who are interested in
what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay
compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day.
That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot mom, Kathie Larkin was in the studio lending her thoughts and laughter. You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms, all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online and now on in Atlanta. So be sure to look out for that. Remember Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/">www.getkathie.com</a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station WKNW. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips
available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has
been doing a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you
should check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called his family friendly radio show
&quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with
a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download
the show for your kid. He had a big show recently he interviewed
Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.

tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
get the skinny
about Tips and Tricks for Hungry Chicks from the one and only Hungry Girl herself Lisa Lillien. Lisa shared her favorite snacks from 2007 including Breyers Fat Free Double Churn ice cream that will set you back a skinny 90 calories fro a 1/2 cup serving.

Check it out at <a href="http://www.angelfood.org">www.angelfood.org</a><br/><br/>We also had on Harrison Forbes the co-host of Pet Talk. The nation's best pet show on radio. Harrison shared his best dog training tips including his suggestion to use a prong collar when training your dog. He also chimed in on the recent tiger attack at the San Francisco Zoo and how he recently appeared on the Larry King Show to discuss it. &nbsp; He also said that a lot of bad dog behaviors like digging or chewing can be traced to your dogs frustration. And you might be able to cure the dog by exercising your dog. Remember when you do exercise your dog do it at dog speed not Fat Guy speed. Harrison talked about his upcoming project he is working on with James Gandolfini and his upcoming book. For more info on everything he is up to be sure to check out his website <a href="http://www.harrisonforbes.com">www.harrisonforbes.com</a><br/><br/>We led off the show with womens health journalist Karen Bridson author of the book Secrets of Skinny Chicks. Karen interviewed 25 skinny women to learn exactly how they got in shape. She purposely chose women who were not naturally skinny to see what they did and didn't do to achieve their weight loss goal. It seems that in order to lose weight you must be very mindful of your eating and to exercise a lot more than you think is enough. Her book also touches on the dangers of overdoing it. She shares a very personal story of a friend of hers who suffered from an eating disorder. Please check out her book at Amazon, Barnes and noble and other bookstores.<br/><br/>And we ended the show and 2007 with a great interview with one of our BFF's Jennifer Nicole Lee.

the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=88916078">To download the show on iTunes please click on this link</a><br/><br/>On
tonight's show Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy
get the skinny
about how to live a blended life from Robert Tercek President of PeopleJam, Dr Fitness' new favorite blog website. PeopleJam is a community for people who want to learn, live, earn, believe and play. There are a ton of experts, coaches and other knowledgeable people sharing what works and what doesn't in almost all aspects of life. Robert said living a balanced life is tricky but living a blended life is more manageable. Especially with the PeopleJam community helping you every step of the way. Check out their website and sign up for FREE at <a href="http://www.peoplejam.com ">www.peoplejam.com</a> <br/><br/>Our first guest was one of New&nbsp; Jersey's favorite personal trainers and authors...Kevin Valuzzi. His new book &quot;Stop The Fitness Confusion&quot; taps into the wisdom of over 50 top trainers and fitness experts to get their best fitness tips. Kevin says that a suprisingly consistent methodology came up amongst all the trainers. A circuit-style interval training is highly recommended for people who are crunched for time&nbsp; and are looking to burn more calories faster. He said this kind of work out allows you to burn calories all day long. For more information about Kevin, please go to his website <a href="http://www.thefitnessleader.com ">www.thefitnessleader.com</a> and to buy his new book go to <a href="http://www.stopthefitnessconfusion.com ">www.stopthefitnessconfusion.com</a> <br/><br/>Next
up we had on Kevin Betts, the President of Fitness Together, the undisputed leader in the franchised personal fitness trainer business. There are over 600 Fitness Together franchises. Their philosophy is 1 Client 1 Trainer 1 Goal. At a Fitness Together studio the client works one on one with their trainer in a well appointed suite that features all the equipment anyone would need to get a full body workout. For more information and to see if there is a location near you please go to their website <a href="http://www.fitnesstogether.com">www.fitnesstogether.com</a> <br/><br/>Next
we had on Tina Vindum, outdoor fitness expert and host of the radio show Outdoor Fitness on the Lime channel 114 on Sirius Satellite Radio. Tina talked about the importance of training outdoors in order to get one with nature and use the surroundings around you to get a wickedly effective workout. In San Francisco she does outdoor classes with her clients first thing in the morning. They might be doing pull ups on a tree branch one minute and stretching on a parking meter the next. Each workout is different and each is sure to kick your butt. Tina stressed that exercising outdoors is an almost spiritual experience. She says she has had clients get overcome with emotions as they workout. Picture yourself at the crack of dawn, surrounded by the glow of the rising sun, running through the woods with the skyline of San Francisco in front of you as sweat is pouring off your body. Pretty cool huh? For more information about Tina, her only accredited Outdoor Training classes and her radio show please go the her website <a href="http://www.outdoorfitness.com ">www.outdoorfitness.com</a> <br/><br/>Dr
Fitness chimed in with his weight loss tips. And this week they were all about the importance of eating 30 grams of fiber each day. He listed some of the best fiber rich foods and they included: legumes, brans cereals and some fruits and veggies that will surprise you. Be sure to check that out. <br/><br/>Amazingly the Fat Guy is being followed by over 30 people who are interested in what he eats each day. Who would have thought?&nbsp; Anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
anything in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So take a peek
into his
food diary. You never know what he'll write. Somehow he can stay compliant to writing on Twitter but he can't fit in exercise each day. That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> <br/><br/>Hot mom, Kathie Larkin was in the studio lending her thoughts and laughter. You know

a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video

tonight's very special Thanksgiving Show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about all things exercise dvds from three of the best selling exercise dvd instructors in America and the world. First up we had Michelle Dozois from Breakthru Fitness in the studio. 
				Michelle's newest home workout series that will help you lose weight, burn fat and get a Breakthru Body! This amazing 3 dvd series will definitely get you moving and will help you achieve your fitness and weight loss goals. In addition to fitness and pilates, Michelle also shared a truly moving story about how her family has been dealing with an autistic child. Her child had an amazing breakthrough as a result of some fairly simple nutrition modifications and Michelle talked about that. she also shared her feelings about how grateful she was for Jenny McCarthy's book and story because it has really shined a bight light on autism and has really gotten some alternative methods of dealing with autism out into the public eye. Please go to Michelle's website <a href="http://">www.breakthrufitness.com</a> for more information. <br/><br/>Next up we had on Patrica Moreno founder of intenSati Life. Patricia&nbsp; is one of the most respected fitness instructors today. With more than 20 years experience, she is a pioneer in the industry. Today she trains trainers at the prestigious Equinox Fitness Clubs in New York. Her students will follow her anywhere because they cannot get enough of her&nbsp; <i>intenSati<sup>TM</sup></i>,
<i>danceSati<sup>TM</sup></i>, <i>yogaSati<sup>TM</sup></i>, <i>coreSati<sup>TM</sup></i>
and <i>warriorSati<sup>TM</sup></i> classes. Patricia's enthusiasm, energy and
dedication to constantly improving the workout are infectious. Patricia is
recognized as an elite instructor within the industry as well: she teaches her
techniques to other instructors worldwide, and she has been honored by her
peers at training conventions worldwide. In addition, the press, including <i>Allure,
Shape</i>, and <i>W</i> magazines, as well as <i>The New York Sun</i> and <i>ABC
News</i>, have recognized her unique talent.

The creation of the <i>intenSati</i> workout is
evidence that Patricia leads new fitness trends pushes the boundaries: <i>intenSati</i>
combines the best of group fitness with the elements of yoga and life coaching
to create a new workout that is exactly right for our times, combining both
physical and spiritual disciplines to create excellent results. For more information please go to her website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.intensati.com">www.intensati.com</a><br/><br/>Last but never least we had back an old friend Tracey Mallett. 

<p class="MsoNormal">Tracey is an internationally recognized expert known
in the fitness industry and a popular figure among top media, having graced the
cover of Pilates Style and been featured in Shape, Fitness Magazine, Women's
Health, Fit Pregnancy, SELF, Fit Yoga, OK Magazine, and Diet and Fitness.</p>



Tracey is part of the Hot Moms Club and she too has a brand new book and exercise dvd for women coming out in January called &quot;SEXY IN 6&quot; featuring the amazing &quot;6 Minute Quick Blast Method&quot;&nbsp; We had a big surprise for her tonight, because she didn't know that Michelle was with us in the studio. You see they are neighbors in Southern California. It was shockingly hilarious. Please check out Tracey's website <a href="http://www.traceymallett.com">www.traceymallett.com</a> for info on all her dvds. <br/><br/>Please continue making Dr
Fitness jealous by following the Fat Guy on
Twitter. As we've mentioned anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
crazy things in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So you can now peek
into his
food diary. That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> to see exactly what the fat guy eats. We&nbsp; now have literally dozens of people who are following him so please join in.<br/><br/>Hot mom, Kathie Larkin was in the studio lending her thoughts and laughter. You know

Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms, all kinds of moms and is

tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about all things pilates from America's Number 1 Pilates Instructor Jennifer Kries. Dancer, choreographer, yoga devotee, author and Pilates master teacher,
Jennifer Kries is an unparalleled innovator in the realm of alternative
health and fitness. First to bring Pilates to the masses, her
award-winning videos and DVDs, The <strong><em>Method Series</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jennifer   Kries’s Pilates Method</em></strong> and Fox/Fit TV’s, <strong><em>The   Method Show</em></strong>, revolutionized   the fitness community, paving the way for the current wave of enthusiasm   for Pilates mind-body exercise. Jennifer has a couple of hot new Pilates dvds out now and she told us all about them. So if you love pilates or if you're new to pilates you have to look for Yin Yoga and New Body! Pilates on Jennifer's website <a href="http://www.jenniferkries.com">www.jenniferkries.com</a>. She has clips of all her dvds and lots of information for the beginner all the way up to the advanced pilates enthusiast.<br/><br/>Next up we had the always excitable Sgt Harvey Walden. You&nbsp; know Harvey from&nbsp; the smash hit TV show Celebrity Fit Club where he has personally motivated dozens of celebrity recruits back into shape since 2004. Some of the celebs that have felt Sgt Walden's wrath have been Gary Busey, Screech, Tina Yothers, Kelly LeBrock, Victoria Jackson, Carnie Wilson and many more. &nbsp; This year's crew will have their hands full as Harvey is changing up the show to a more boot camp format. And tonight Harvey gave us some great fitness and workout info from his brand new book No Excuses! Fitness Workout as well as inside dish from the real goings on behind the scenes at the Celebrity Fit Club. Be sure to check out the Sgt of Fitness' website <a href="http://www.harveywalden.com">www.harveywalden.com</a> for more info.<br/><br/>Next up we had on some fans of the show Ashley and Lauren who together have lost over 100 pounds. And they did it mostly just by listening to the Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy show. Not exactly, but they did listen to the show when they would walk around Stone Mountain. They shared stories about how they supported each other and how they kept each other accountable and how despite their two totally different metabolisms and body types they were able to work together and achieve their weight loss goals. So big congrats for Ashley and Lauren for losing the weight and finding a great way to keep it off. Please go to their blog <a href="http://www.tralalaonline.com">www.tralalaonline.com</a> and give them some words of support and congratulations. Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy are very proud of their accomplishments. BTW their blog has lots of great info for women on beauty, health, celebrity gossip and fashion. Check it out!<br/><br/>It is so funny to see how jealous Dr Fitness is over all the people who are following the Fat Guy on Twitter. As we've mentioned anyone can follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=88916078">To download the show on iTunes please click on this link</a><br/><br/>On
tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about&nbsp; skinny jeans. These are the only blue jeans that are created with the sole purpose to be more slimming and more flattering. Catherine, the founder, came on and discussed all the ways these skinny jeans make you look good. They include special designed denim and go all the way to optical illusion like hems and super strong pockets. These classic looking jeans will never stretch out, bag out or lose their shape. And you will not have to wash them every time you wear them! She shared the unlikely place (Sex and the City) she got her inspiration for these super denim blue jeans that are showing up on the biggest stars and in the most exclusive boutiques.&nbsp; Finally there are jeans that make you look skinny even if you need to lose a few pounds. No matter if you are apple shaped, pear shaped or even watermelon shaped these jeans will make you look good. For more information about Skinny Jeans please go their website <a href="http://www.skinnyjeans.com">www.skinnyjeans.com</a> <br/><br/>Imagine a day when you can reach into your freezer pull out a donut or cinnamon&nbsp; bun , microwave it for a few seconds&nbsp; and enjoy it without feeling guilty about the gazillion calories and fat you just ate. Well everyone that day is today. Frank Dilullo, a man who was raised in the donut business has figured out a proprietary way to avoid making greasy fattening donuts. These great tasting low fat and low calorie donuts are hand rolled and hand cut, they use a wheat based wheat and avoid any added artificial sweeteners and chemicals. Each donut is hand filled and frosted before being flash frozen and shipped directly to you via Fedex. No, boys and girls, you are not dreaming these massive donuts have been tested in a USDA lab to verify their claims! They passed with flying deliciously frosted colors. A doctor even recommends them, along with Lisa Lillien The Hungry Girl, Donnie Deutsch, and our friends at The Daily Candy. Trust the Fat Guy you will not get a more delicious tasting donut.&nbsp; A healthy donut is only a few mouse clicks away. Today you can only buy them online at their website, but soon they will be opening franchised stores near you (one is in the works in Beverly Hills).&nbsp; <a href="http://www.holeydonuts.net">Go to www.holeydonuts.net and mention Dr Fitness when you give them your email address and order and you get a FREE dozen donuts.</a> <br/><br/>We also had on Tiffany Davis from The Daily Candy who shared her favorite healthy getaways. She talked about resorts from NY to Latin America to California. Check out The Daily Candy at <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com">www.dailycandy.com</a> <br/><br/>As a special bonus we had on Stephen Harkins from Bradley Communications who gave our listeners the recap from our recent appearance as panelists for <a href="http://www.rtir.com">Steve Harrison's National Publicity Summit</a> in New York last week.&nbsp; <br/><br/>Follow the
Fat Guy's eating exploits on Twitter.&nbsp; Food
journals are great ways to lose weight and the Fat Guy is always trying
crazy things in order to lose those last 20 pounds. So you can now peek into his
food diary. That's right, moments after he eats something the Fat Guy
Twitters about it and you can follow him so that one day if you try
real hard you too can look like the Fat Guy. Please go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fatguy">www.twitter.com/fatguy</a> to see exactly what the fat guy eats. So far about 9 people are following him so please join in.<br/><br/>Hot mom, Kathie Larkin was in the studio lending her thoughts and laughter. You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms, all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online. Remember Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out

            <description><![CDATA[The most entertaining weight loss and fitness podcast show on radio.&quot;
Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><br/>On
tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about getting in shape while on holiday from Anja one of the founders of Escape to Shape.&nbsp; Escape to Shape offers vacations combining comfort, culture and fitness at exotic locations around the world. Not only will you enjoy luxurious accommodations, delicious food and the latest fitness class you'll also sample some of the best spa amenities available. Anja says that her vacations are perfect for singles as well as couples. Find out where they are headed next, I'll give you a hint...think The Soprano's. For more information about Escape to Shape check out their website <a href="http://www.escapetoshape.com">www.escapetoshape.com</a><br/><br/>Tonight we had on two of the Internet's biggest stars John Biggs from CrunchGear who shared with us the fitness gadgets he finds from his travels from around the world. He just came back from Japan where he saw the first personal trainer/cell phone. This device is part pedometer, part heart rate monitor, part phone. the only thing it doesn't do is wipe the sweat off your forehead. John also talked about lots of other cool gadgets and fitness gear but you'll have to listen to get the skinny. For more information check out John's blogs&nbsp; <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com">www.crunchgear.com</a> and <a href="http://www.runninggearreview.com ">www.runninggearreview.com</a> <br/><br/>After John we were so lucky to have Tiffany Davis from Daily Candy in the studio with us. Tiffany is one of our favorite guests and she talked all about fun ways to build a healthy kitchen. As you know she and her staff are always researching the latest and the greatest next cool thing. First Tiffany talked about these super cool flavor sheets you put right on top of your favorite food as you cook it. She also mentioned something about the return of the Snoopy Sno Cone Maker and some other equally wild stuff.&nbsp; For more information about The Daily Candy please go to their website <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com">www.dailycandy.com</a> and be one of the 3 gazillion other subscribers to get their daily email newsletter. <br/><br/>And that wasn't it, as you know the Fat Guy is always researching quality, kind of healthy, delicious snacks. And he found another one. PopChips. PopChips are kind of healthy chips. These are never fried, never baked, all natural chips. Since these amazing bites of crunchy goodness are popped instead of fried they can fit more fo them in the bag for the same calories. For example, an old school chip company might fit&nbsp; 10 chips in a 100ish calorie&nbsp; bag with PopChips you'll get twice that for about the same calories. That's right more crunches per calorie. the Fat Guy loved the BBQ and Dr Fitness loved the Wasabi. Try them for yourselves. Go to there website for all the locations you can find them or to order them online. <a href="http://www.PopChips.com">www.PopChips.com</a><br/><br/>Dr. Fitness was back with his tips on how to adjust your workout and attitude to the changing weather. He said 1-bring your workouts indoors; 2-chnage up the workouts...if you were biking and running now try yoga or stretching classes 3- change your wardrobe to accommodate the changing weather...remember no white after Labor Day. He had more great fitness tips but you'll have to listen to get them.<br/><br/>Hot mom, Kathie Larkin was with us again. You know
Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for hot moms, fat moms, all kinds of moms and is
available on most PBS' around the US and
online. Remember Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.getkathie.com</font></a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</font></a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on every morning in Michigan. On radio station WKNW. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips
available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My kid Max has been doing a radio show called &quot;Kid Power Radio&quot; for awhile now and you should check it out. Tiffany from The Daily Candy called it &quot;Hilarious!&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight mixed in with
a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download
the show for your kid. He had a big show recently he interviewed
Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/weightlossradio_10082006_ENTIRE_64.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet.&quot;
Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


<p>Due to Technical Difficulties (actually the Fat Guy started using Alli and we couldn't get him out of the bathroom) we are replaying one of our most popular shows from October of 2006. Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy are very sorry and promise to be back next week with a new show featuring more great weight loss and fitness experts.<br/></p>

<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about the hottest diet out there...The Shangri-La Diet by Seth Roberts.
Stephen Dubner, author of Freakonomics said that this&nbsp;is &quot;A weight-loss
theory that just might benefit a few million people.&quot; Check out all the
Freakonomic spin on&nbsp;The Shangri-La Diet at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/times0911.php">http://www.freakonomics.com/times0911.php</a>&nbsp;The
Fat Guy is going to try this diet as long as he can. So far he has
drank one bottle of sugar water and is feeling full. According to Seth
you should either drink some olive oil or sugar water a couple of times
each day in between meals. This will lower your caloric set point,
which will help you eat less calories each day which will help you lose
weight. Sounds pretty easy, Check out The Shangri-La Diet website to
get tips and great information from the online forum of active dieters
as <a href="http://www.shangriladiet.com/">www.shangriladiet.com</a> </p>



<p>The Doctor also shared his&nbsp;tips on how to make exercise a top 3
non-negotiable priority.&nbsp;Number 1, when you are exercising you are
being a good role model for your family - teaching your kids that
exercise is an important part of each day.&nbsp;Number 2, schedule things
around exercise -&nbsp;don't use your work out&nbsp;time as time that is flexible
to eliminate or move around.&nbsp;And number 3, you will have to listen to
the show to find out that one and all the rest of these great exercise
tips. </p>



<p>Another highlight of this show was the Fat guy giving his how to
peel a pomegranate tip. the Fat Guy has mastered the intricate
technique you need to effectively peel this wonderful fruit. So search
the Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy blog to see how it's done.&nbsp;<br/> </p>

			<title>Hot Work-Outs From Social Diva Lexi. CrunchGear's Latest Fitness Gadgets. Milk 101 With Eating Well Mag. Plus Charles Staley.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/lose_weight_radio_podcast_09272007_64.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The most entertaining weight loss and fitness podcast show on radio. Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com">Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><br/>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about some of the hottest exercise classes that are sweeping the gyms from Social Diva Lexi Tabback. A self-described Jersey Girl, Lexi has tried a whole bunch of the wackiest exercise classes and has reported back her findings. Are you up for Samurai Sword Fighting? What about a little trapeze and aerial dance? Listen to Lexi recount her experiences with these exercise classes and others. For more information about Social Diva, Lexi, her latest book &quot;How To Be A Social Diva&quot; go to their website <a href="http://www.socialdiva.com">www.socialdiva.com</a>. Social Diva lets you know where the hippest, coolest, most happening places are in your city. It is Lexi's job (and the other Divas like Peg Samuel) to personally check out these places and report back to you so you don't waste your time. As Lexi always says, &quot;Diva's don't sweat, they glow&quot; Check them out. <br/><br/>We also had John Biggs on from CrunchGear and RunningGearReview sharing his take on the latest fitness gadgets.&nbsp; Before you buy any gadget I strongly suggest you check out both of these websites. On this show John told us all about: wireless headsets, an ipod pedometer combo, a stereo bluetooth headphone thingy, a waterproof mp3 player case and so much more. His blogs are must reads for gadget lovers. Check them out at <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com">www.crunchgear.com</a> and <a href="\&quot;/%22http://www.runninggearreview.com/%22\&quot;">www.runninggearreview.com</a> <br/><br/>And what a special treat it was to have the return of Nicci Micco and Eating Well magazine. If you haven't already, check this magazine out offline and online. You will not find a better photographed, more intelligent food magazine. Tonight Nicci told us all about milk. She talked about cow snd goat milk, soy milk, almond milk , hemp milk, organic milk. She even explained to the Fat Guy that it is truly impossible to milk a cat. they have a lab where they test things so that must be true. You can listen to the show and learn all about milk or check out the article in the latest issue of Eating Well magazine. Also go to their website and subscribe to their free email newsletters they are awesome <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com">www.eatingwell.com</a> <br/><br/>But that's not all, this show also had on Charles Staley the author of Muscle Logic and other great books. He has appeared on the TODAY show as well as The CBS Early Show and shared his counter-intuitive approach to weight training and fitness. Charles told the fat guy to invert his reps when he strength trains for better results. Dr Fitness had to tell Charles that the Fat Guy doesn't get into the gym much. Charles recommends that instead of 3 sets of 10 you do 10 sets of 3 in the same amount of time. Less reps more sets. The Fat Guy calls this &quot;The Joy of Sets&quot; To learn more check out Charles website <a href="http://www.staleytraining.com">www.staleytraining.com</a> and <a href="\&quot;/%22http://www.charlesstaley.com/%22\&quot;">www.charlesstaley.com</a> <br/><br/>And the Fat Guy wants to give a big thanks to RedGrrl who emailed him and said nice things. Believe it or not, the Fat Guy does not get a lot of fan mail. So thank you RedGrrl for taking the time to email him. And yes hot mom, Jennifer Nicole Lee is &quot;that peppy.&quot; By the way, this weekend is JNL's&nbsp; bikini bootcamp in South Beach. Good luck to her with that.<br/><br/>Kathie Larkin was with us again and she shared important information about her progress as a tennis player and a personal trainer. You know Kathie as the host of Real Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for moms that is available on most Public Broadcasting Stations around the US and online.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/lose_weight_radio_podcast_09202007_64.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The most entertaining weight loss and fitness podcast show on radio.&quot;
Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><br/>On
tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about&nbsp; being a &quot;Fabulously Fit Mom&quot; from America's hottest mom, Jennifer Nicole Lee. That's right, the same JNL who has a calendar, a weight loss book, a clothing line, and an annual bikini fitness boot camp returned to the show. Jennifer is such an inspiration to women and especially moms. She is a hot mom herself and she works every day trying to help mom's get healthy, lose weight and lead an active life. She has a new dvd called &quot;Fabulously Fit Moms&quot; that can be found at Amazon.com and her website <a href="http://www.jennifernicolelee.com">www.jennifernicolelee.com</a>. And as a bonus to regular listeners, be the first hot mom to send an email to Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy with a good mommy story or mom blog entry and we'll send you a free Jennifer Nicole Lee exercise dvd.&nbsp; <br/><p>And
we were happy to have on Alden Mills, former Navy Seal, professional fitness trainer and inventor of the Perfect Pushup. I know you have seen this product. It is on TV all the time. Usually Dr Fitness doesn't like TV exercise gadgets, but he loves the Perfect Pushup. It is built well and really works. You get a great workout with it. You get stronger faster, it reduces strain on your joints and muscles and can cut down on injuries. The Get Ripped workout that is included with the PerfectPushup is a fast and easy workout. Go to <a href="http://www.perfectpushup.com">www.perfectpushup.com</a> or <a href="http://www.bodyrev.com">www.bodyrev.com</a> for more information on all of Alden's great exercise products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone knows the Doctor is an former pro tennis player, so occasionally he has the juice to get famous tennis people on our show. tonight we had on former top 5 ranked men's tennis superstar Robby Ginepri. Robby gave us a peak behind the scenes in the life of a pro tennis player. He told stories about playing poker with fellow tennis stars Andy Roddick and James Blake. Robby told us who the worst poker player on the tennis tour is, but you'll have to listen tot he show to find out. Robby also told us which country has the hottest women tennis players as well as a bunch of stuff about what life on the tour is like. He has donated so much to local communities through his charity events and is a really great guy. For more information about Robby Ginepri's tennis career, his upcoming tennis match with Pete Sampras, his charities and his tennis club please go to his website <a href="http://www.robbyginepri.com">www.robbyginepri.com</a>.<br/></p>




<p>And last but not least we were glad the amazing Cindy Boggs made time to come on our show. She is West Virgina's director of Activate America, a newspaper fitness columnist, and fitness coordinator with the Charleston YMCA. She is also the author of the new book &quot;You Can Find Health In Your Hectic World&quot; This great book is filled with great advice and inspirational words from a truly remarkable woman. Cindy's core message is &quot;Get up. Keep moving. You can do it.&quot; so please check out her website <a href="http://www.cindysays.com">www.cindysays.com</a> for information about the book and all the wonderful things Cindy Boggs is doing to promote health and wellness.<br/></p>

<p>Since Dr Fitness was back he came up with crazy segment about how colors affect your health. He says red gives you energy, green is calming and more stuff like that. but the real reason to listen to this segment is to hear him try and pronounce turquoise. Too funny.<br/></p>

Kathie Larkin was with us again and she shared important information about her progress as a tennis player. She loved talking with hot guys like Alden Mills and Robbie Ginepri for a change. She spent the whole show blushing and checking out their pictures on the computer. You know Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for moms that is
available on most Public Broadcasting Stations around the US and
online. Remember Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><br/>On
tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about&nbsp; menopause and other women things that made the Fat Guy very uncomfortable from TS Wiley the author of &quot;Sex, Lies and Menopause&quot; and &quot;Lights Out: Sleep, Sugar and Survival.&quot;&nbsp; TS also developed The Wiley Protocol the only HRT that has been developed under the scrutiny of a practicing Oncologist. Her revolutionary discovery is the fact that it's the rhythm that matters in the replacement of hormones. TS developed this protocol when she asked the question &quot;if hormone replacement was made of real bio-identical hormones and dosed to mimic the ups and downs of the hormone blood levels in a normal menstrual cycle of a 20 year-old woman, would all the symptoms and disease states of aging decline? Well you'll have to listen to the show to hear her answer. She also revealed one of the first symptoms of menopause. For more information about menopause, getting a good nights sleep, TS Wiley, her books and her Wiley Protocol please go to her website <a href="http://www.thewileyprotocol.com">www.thewileyprotocol.com</a> <br/><p>And
for the first time ever, we had on Eric from TheDietChannel.com. theDietChannel.com is a great website that features straight forward information on diet, fitness, nutrition and health from leading weight loss experts. We discussed things like: does Alli really work; is there an easy weight loss solution; and other diet, fitness and weight loss topics. Eric also told our listeners what he has learned about what diet strategy works, after reviewing all the latest popular and fad diets. You have to listen to the show. You can find all kinds of information on all of the popular diets as well as some practical weight loss tips and commentary. Please go to <a href="http://www.thedietchannel.com">www.thedietchannel.com</a> and check them out.</p>

<p>Since Dr Fitness had better things to do it was left up to Kathie and the Fat Guy to come up with some useful tips and boy did we. Kathie gave some great exercises if you want to get tank top arms. And the Fat Guy gave his annual tip on how to peel a pomegranate. <br/></p>

what would a Dr fitness and the Fat Guy show be without a visit from Sweet Susi May from Fit Sugar. Susi shared lots of cool tips for gear that you should check out like a new bike, a new backpack, and some other stuff. She also had some exercise tips about including walking up hill as part of your exercise routine.

about an innovative copyrighted series of movements that will help you lose inches without weights, equipment or jumping called T-Tapp. T-Tapp was developed by the off the charts with energy Teresa Tapp. She told us how she developed her amazing techniques while working with top models in Europe. I'm talking Claudia Schiffer and others. Remember models really don't care what they weigh as much as how they fit into their clothes. So Teresa's T-Tapp is very comprehensive in delivering fat loss, weight loss and inch loss as well as increasing your overall heath, energy and fitness. You don't have to be superfit to do her technique in fact she had Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy doing some of the exercises on the air. She was talking us through it and the Fat Guy almost did it. I wish we had a webcam so you could have seen it. Teresa has a book called &quot;Fit and Fabulous in 15 Minutes as well as dvds and an information packed website. Please go to her website <a href="http://www.t-tapp.com">www.t-tapp.com</a> and you will find all her stuff plus: contests, a ton of testimonials, amazing before and after pictures and a directory of certified T-Tapp trainers and a whole bunch more.</p>
<p>And you listeners were lucky enough to hear the brilliant Dr Judith Beck , author of &quot;The Beck Diet Solution&quot; which is rocketing up the bestseller lists. Dr Beck has been appearing everywhere in fact when I got home from the show I opened my Health magazine and there she was in there . Well Dr Beck is an authority in cognitive therapy and she uses those techniques to help people lose weight. She doesn't care as much about which diet you are using as long as you eat less calories she cares more about how you are going about the weight loss process. It is here where she is very helpful. Some of the weight loss tips she gave our listeners were: pre-plan your eating each day; only eat sitting down, remind yourself that hunger is never an emergency. She had many more tips but you'll have to listen to the show with a pencil and paper to get them all. Go to her website <a href="http://www.beckdietsolution.com">www.beckdietsolution.com</a> for great downloads you can use today, information on her book &quot;The Beck Diet Solution&quot; and her new workbook that is coming out soon as well as info on Dr Judith Beck herself, there's also a blog. It's worth your time. Dr Fitness was blown away by how smart she was and how good and helpful her info was...so check it out.<br/></p>


<p>And what would Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy show be without some candy...we love our Daily Candy and we were lucky enough to have Tiffany Davis from The Daily Candy in our studio with us this evening. Tiffany leads a life that everyone should be jealous of...I know I am. It is her job to discover the hippest places, the finest restaurants and the coolest clubs. It's not easy being her. Tonight Tiffany shared some places you could go in Atlanta o get an unconventional workout. We talked about kickball leagues, we talked about rock climbing centers we even talked about pole dancing and stiletto heel workouts. There were a lot of laughs and a lot of great info. If you are one of few remaining women who don't subscribe to Daily Candy then hop to it ... go to <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com">www.DailyCandy.com</a> and sign yourself up. They have city centered issues in a lot of big cities, they have special kid issues and more. <br/></p>

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/">Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy</a> radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><br/>Before I get into the show notes I'd like to give a very special shout out to Drea from Indiana she is the winner of a great exercise DVD. She sent in a very kind email sharing her weight loss story - she has lost 160 pounds&nbsp; by listening to the Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy radio show... Her weight loss probably had more to do with the eating and exercise habits  she changed but she did say our show was her favorite to work out to. Great job Drea, keep up the good work and anyone else who wants to win a free exercise dvd please blog about us and email us your weight loss story - it could be a plateau you're trying to break through where Dr Fitness can help or it can be a success story. Either way you can win! <br/><br/>Now on with the show...<br type="_moz"/> 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about where a girl can go to have some fun with the original Social Diva, Peg Samuel. Peg kindly called us right in the middle of her shopping day from in front of the Versace store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California. No matter how much the Fat Guy begged Peg would not bring him back those XL Versace sweatpants he's had his eye on. Peg did share lots of insight into what makes a Social Diva and why <a href="http://www.socialdiva.com">www.SocialDiva.com</a> is the perfect solution for ladies (and smart guys) who are looking for more action. At the Social Diva website you don't get only the skinny on where the latest hot spot is you can also learn where to shop, where to eat and other important things. So check them out for yourself at <a href="http://www.socialdiva.com">www.SocialDiva.com</a> and learn how you can bring out your inner Diva! <br/></p>
<p>And what would Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy show be without Sweet Susi May, the brilliant and beautiful editor of FitSugar. Susi shared lots of tips tonight. She had tips about about gym etiquette, she explained the importance of stretching, she even gave away the 4 most important things you should be doing everyday if you want to live a long life and most importantly she told our listeners an easy way to win a brand new FREE Polar F11 Heart Rate Monitor. If you want a chance to win the Polar Heart Rate monitor all you have to do is go to Fit Sugar and comment on one of the gazillion blog posts they have on the site and you will be entered to win. I think that's what she said, she talks fast so go to <a href="http://www.fitsugar.com">www.FitSugar.com</a> for the exact rules.<br/></p>
<p>And our last guest was JR, the guy behind the Wii Weight Loss Plan. He has lost over 40 pounds just playing video games. He's my hero. Not just any video games though Wii Games...mostly Wii Sports. He especially likes the boxing, but he plays it all every day for at least 30 vigorous minutes at a time. He's trying to lose 80 pounds so he's half way there. So please go to <a href="http://www.wiiweightlossplan.com">www.WiiWeightLossPlan.</a>com and check in on him and give him some encouragement to reach his goal. See you don't have to go to the gym to lose weight.. just find something you like to do and stick with it.<br/></p>

are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips on how to tell if you are a good candidate for lipo. Number
1, should be in pretty good shape. Number
2, people with firm, elastic skin get better results - if your skinny is baggy then it will remain baggy after the lipo. And
Number
3, if you have diabetes, a heart condition or poor circulation you should probably avoid this procedure. Dr Fitness had a
few
more tips
and he gave lots more detail in these tips but you'll have to listen to
get them.<br/><br/>Kathie

<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about how you can get fresh healthy food delivered to you each week. Tonight we were lucky to have Penny Fry, the Operations Manager and Brent McIntire, the Executive Chef of Fresh 'N Fit Cuisine in the studio with us. And it was a party, they brought tons of food for everyone at the station and some people who were just hanging around downstairs. Dr Fitness inhaled every bit of fish he could find. He loved it. And the Fat Guy quickly consumed 2 days worth of calories before the first commercial break. Imagine each day having fresh, healthy, delicious food ready for you to eat already portioned in the proper amounts you need to lose weight. If you choose Fresh 'n Fit Cuisine you can forget about counting calories forever. They do it for you each and every day. So whether you are trying to lose weight or just maintain a healthy lifestyle and are too busy to deal with food you should definitely check out Fresh 'N Fit Cuisine. These guys are only in Georgia but who knows, soon they might be near you. So all you Georgians go to <a href="http://www.freshnfitcuisine.com">www.freshnfitcuisine.com</a> or call 678-208-0341 and try them for a week. It will change your life. <br/></p>
Tonight we also had on Dr Nick Yphantides, Author of &quot;My Big Fat Greek Diet&quot;&nbsp; Dr Nick shared his story about how he went from being the fattest doctor in America to losing almost 300 pounds without surgery. You've got to hear Dr Nick's story, it has everything, it has baseball for the guys, it's got romance for the ladies and it's got drama and inspiration for anyone who is struggling with their weight and has that feeling of hopelessness about them. If Dr Nick can do this so can you. Please go to his website <a href="http://www.mybigfatgreekdiet.com">www.mybigfatgreekdiet.com</a> and check out his book. And also check out <a href="http://www.heathsteward.com">www.healthsteward.com</a> where Dr Nick teaches you the importance of changing the way you see first, in order for you to then change the way you look. <br/><br/>The
Doctor had some interesting wellness tips in his latest installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; series. Tonight it was Common Exercise Mistakes.&nbsp;Here
are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips on how to avoid these common exercise mistakes. Number
1, failure to set goals - don't just show up at the gym and try to wing a workout - have a plan. Number
2, improper technique, pay close attention to your form when you are strength training. this will give you better results, faster and help you avoid getting hurt. And
Number
3, mix things up, a lot of people do the same routine over and over for weeks at a time - variety is the spice of life - your body gets used to the same routine so you have to challenge it differently in order to get good results. Dr Fitness had a
few
more tips
and he gave lots more detail in these tips but you'll have to listen to
get them.<br/><br/>Kathie
Larkin was not in the studio, sorry! Maybe next week she'll be back.&nbsp; You know Kathie as the host of
Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for moms that is
available on most Public Broadcasting Stations around the US and

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy radio show podcast broadcasting live each week from Atlanta, GA, USA.&nbsp; &nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about how you can lose boatloads of weight without gastric bypass surgery or crazy fad diets. Imagine that! First we had on Gary Marino who lost 150 pounds through the amazing eat less and exercise more diet and later on the show we had Lisa Delaney, Health magazine editor who went from 185 pounds to a size two and kept it off for nearly 20 years using similar methods. <br/></p>
<p>Lisa, author of &quot;Secrets of a Former Fat Girl&quot; shared lots of weight loss tips from her inspiring memoir tonight. She encouraged overweight women to keep their weight loss attempt a secret because of the people who will try and undermine you. A lot of time your family members will try and sabotage you by teasing you or overly scrutinizing your food choices so you have got to be ready for that. She also told our listeners what it was like when she hit rock bottom and what she did to transform herself from a fat girl to an avid marathon runner. You can get more information about Lisa, her book and her great blog at <a href="http://www.formerfatgirl.com">www.formerfatgirl.com<br/></a></p>


<p>Gary Marino is on a mission to help fight obesity. He has gone from being a 397 pound hopeless food addict to a nearly svelte 240 pound healthy activist for change. Gary went on a Million Calorie March down the Eastern Seaboard in an effort to bring attention to the obesity crisis that is gripping America (especially our youth). He has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for this cause and has helped inspire thousands of people to lose weight. Gary's book &quot;Big &amp; Tall Chronicles: Misadventures of a Lifelong Food Addict&quot; tells his uplifting story in a humorous and poignant way.

For more information on Gary and all the things he's up to check out his website <a href="http://www.millioncaloriemarch.com">www.millioncaloriemarch.com</a> <br/></p>
<p>Tonight we also had on two of the biggest bloggers out there... Sweet Susi May from FitSugar and Peter Ha from CrunchGear. You have to listen to their segments with a paper and pencil handy because they were throwing out great gadgets, gear and websites left and right.<br/></p>
<p>Susi in her regular FitSugar segment to our show had great fashion gear tips for the ladies. Did you know that there is a new bikini for women that has a drawstring so you can be active at the beach without any fears of losing your bottoms? I did not know that but Susi did. She also had some tips about the dangers of soda and a new water bottle that holds two beverages in one bottle. Amazing. Ladies, if you are not going to FitSugar everyday you are seriously missing out. they are blogging like 20 times a day with all the latest recipes, fitness gear, celebrity news, exercise tips. FitSugar and all the Sugar blogs should be on your must read list each day. Check them out at <a href="http://www.fitsugar.com">www.FitSugar.com  <br/></a></p>
<p>And guys for the first time in Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy history we had on someone from CrunchGear, part of Michael Arrington's empire. CrunchGear doesn't always have fitness gear there (that's why the Fat Guy likes it) but it is the place where the Fat Guy finds out about all the latest gadgets and computer stuff. So if you want to know how the new iPhone is performing or a what is the latest must have computer accessory CrunchGear is the place to look. I get it in my inbox everyday. So tonight Peter Ha, updated us on what is the latest gadgets for marathon training and getting more enjoyment out of outdoor activities. There is a new watch that counts calories, a new accessory for the Wii and a bunch more stuff that you should know about. To learn more about CrunchGear and subscribe to their blog go to <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com">www.CrunchGear.com</a> &nbsp;  <br/></p>
The
Doctor didn't have any tips tonight because we ran out of time but he did get fired up about the media created bottled water controversy regarding Aquafina and Dasani actually being tap water. You have got to hear him rant about that.<br/><br/>Kathie
Larkin was in the studio and she gave an inspiring story about how she started running.And she ran all the way to her boyfriend Tom's house who lives almost a mile away from her. You know Kathie as the host of Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for moms that is
available on most Public Broadcasting Stations around the US and
online. Remember Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
in that Veet commercial that is on TV 24 hours a day. Be sure

create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each morning at around 7:40. Each Wellness Minute

that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an

kid Max made
his radio debut in his new show &quot;Kid Power Radio.&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's

So if you are interesting in a healthy vacation where you can get away from it all and drop a few pounds then you better check out Amansala.

<p>Jessica Myers from Garmin (the GPS folks) came on to discuss a new Garmin product - the &quot;Forerunner 305&quot; that combines a watch with a heart rate monitor and a gps device. This amazing watch tracks your every move while you run or play sports. You can see your heart rate and your exact running course. Dr Fitness absolutely loved it. He had it on while he played soccer and realized he doesn't run anywhere near the amount he thought he did.&nbsp; It also works with software that lets you track your progress and it even interacts with Google Earth. Please go to <a href="http://www.garmin.com">www.garmin.com</a> to get more information on this amazing device . <br/></p>

are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips on how to avoid a migraine. Number

Number

Their device uses cameras to detect a drowning victim. The YMCA's have really embraced their technology and are using it throughout the country in their pools. Russell also said they have a device that would be appropriate for home pools as well. Russell said that when a person drowns they do not flail about like in the movies but they quietly sink to the bottom.

1, get out of bed as soon as you shut off the alarm. Number
2, if you are having trouble getting up in the morning put the alarm on loud and far away from the bed so it forces you to get out of bed to shut it off. And
Number
3, if you wake up earlier you can get more done because you will have less distractions - this could become your quiet oasis of calm before starting your hectic day. He had a
few
more tips
and he gave lots more detail in these tips but you'll have to listen to
get them.<br/><br/>Kathie

to the interview to see if that worked. He had some great advice and
you should check out his website for more info about him and his Great
Expectations Seminars <a href="http://www.carltonreedgreatexpectations.org/">www.carltonreedgreatexpectations.org</a> <br/><br/>The
Doctor had some interesting wellness tips in his latest installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; series. Tonight it was Bizarre
Natural Cures.&nbsp;Here
are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' strange but true natural cures of common
ailments. Number
1, if you have a tickle in your throat then scratch your ear and it
will go away.
Number
2, if you are with a low talker then turn to them with your right ear.
your right hear can pick up low voices better than your left ear. And
Number
3, if you are going to the doctor and he is giving you an injection -
if you cough rioght before then that will lessen the pain - it works
for kids. He had a
few
more tips
and he gave lots more detail in these tips but you'll have to listen to
get them.<br/><br/>Kathie
Larkin was in the studio and she is slowly taking over the show. I
think she wears sexy outfits to try and distract Dr Fitness and sadly
it seems to be working. She had great questions for both Lisa Lillien
and Gillian Marloth. You know Kathie as the host of Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for moms that is
available on most Public Broadcasting Stations around the US and
online. Remember Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano
recently.&nbsp;Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.getkathie.com</font></a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</font></a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on Michigan radio station WKNW this day. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each day. Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips
available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My nine year
kid Max made
his radio debut in his new show &quot;Kid Power Radio.&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's

a little Wayne's World. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video
games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download

the Fat Guy radio show podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about all the weight loss and health benefits of jumping rope from Jump Snap inventor and Brad LaTour. If you want all the benefits of jumping rope but are too uncoordinated to do it properly (like the Fat Guy) you have to check this product out. Jump Snap is a ropeless jump rope. It has handles with a short rope and ball attached. You hold the handles and go through the motions of jumping rope. But there is no actual rope the Jump Snap has a speaker that makes the sound of the rope swinging and it keeps track of calories burned, how many repetitions you done and it even talks to you. How cool is that? Please go to Brad's website www.jumpsnap.com and check it out. How bad can it be Hilary Swank uses it and she's pretty hot, right? <br/></p>

<p>We also had on Raymond Francis author of &quot;Never Be Sick Again&quot; and
his brand new book &quot;Never Be Fat Again&quot;. Raymond had a spirited
discussion about the steps needed to lose weight and keep it off
permanently. He was very passionate and almost convinced the Fat Guy
that he should lay off processed food. Dr Fitness loved his message and
strongly suggested checking out his books. Raymond also does a lot of
work trying to help children and the alarming childhood obesity and
health crisis in this country. Please go to Raymond's website <a href="http://www.beyondhealth.com/">www.beyondhealth.com&nbsp;</a>
for great information including a couple of real powerful free reports
called &quot;The Roadmap to Ultimate Health&quot; and &quot;The Roadmap to
Supplements&quot; And for more information about his non-profit group that
helps children learn the basics of good health please go to <a href="http://www.healtheamerica.org/">www.healtheamerica.org</a> <br/></p>

The
Doctor had some fitness tips in his latest installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Get Ready For Your First
Spinning Class Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here
are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about the things you should do to see if
spinning is for you. Number
1, check out the spinning class before you start - make sure you like
the instructor - in group exercise classes the instructor is critical.
Number
2, check out the equipment - make sure your gym has good solid
equipment - you don't want the bike to be falling apart mid-ride. And
Number
3, when you get on the bike make sure you have the seat at the right
height - a good spin instructor will come over to make sure you are on
right. He had a
few
more tips
but since I've never been anywhere near a spinning class I kind of lost
interest but you'll have to listen to get them.<br/><br/>Kathie
Larkin was in the house and she was fired up about landing a big part
in a movie that is being filmed here in Atlanta. She told us all about
it. You know Kathie as the host of Real
Savvy Moms.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for moms that is
available on most Public Broadcasting Stations around the US and

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy radio show podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about how a dancer from Madison Wisconsin transforms himself into one of the hottest dancers/choreographers in the world. Jamie King, the creator of the &quot;Rock Your Body with Jamie King&quot; dvd and book shares his story of growing up in Wisconsin, struggling as a background dancer, meeting his mentor Prince then being plucked out of the American Music Awards by Madonna. Today Jamie is on top of the world with his sponsorship by Nike, his work with greats like Shakira, Madonna, and just about everyone else as well as his brand new exercise dvd Rock Your World and the book that tells his story. He has got a great story and his dvd will get you moving that is for sure. Check out Jamie's website <a href="http://www.jamiekingofficial.com">www.jamiekingofficial.com</a> or Nike's dance fitness site <a href="http://www.nikewomen.com">www.nikewomen.com</a> or <a href="http://www.rockyourbodyprogram.com">www.rockyourbodyprogram.com</a><a href="http://www.carriestevens.com/"><br/></a></p>


We also got to spend time with Jim Karas, the author of &quot;The Cardio Free Diet&quot; His book shows you dispels the myth that more time running on the treadmill is the key to losing weight. He believes that if you want to lose weight you must be strength training and eating right. Cardio does not really help you lose weight in fact he believes that it could hinder your weight loss. A man after the Fat Guy's heart. I don't know if Dr Fitness totally bought in to his theory but the Fat Guy is with Jim 100%. Jim is the Fitness contributor for Good Morning America and has worked with clients such as: Hugh Jackman, Diane Sawyer, Emma Thompson, Candace Bergen and more in his studios in New York and Chicago. To learn more about Jim and his new Book as well as his old books check out his website <a href="http://www.jimkaras.com">www.jimkaras.com</a> <br/><br/>Next up we had the editor of Fit Sugar Sweet Susi May. Susi is the fitness editor behind one of the Fat Guy wife's favorite blogs Fit Sugar. In fact if you are a woman and have not been checking out the whole family of Sugar Publishing sites you are truly missing out. First go to <a href="http://www.fitsugar.com">www.FitSugar.com</a> and you'll see why this blog is so cool. They review healthy snacks, exercise videos, they have calorie breakdowns of the foods you actually eat an a whole bunch more. That is why they are our the Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy Blog of the Week. And once you get to <a href="http://www.fitsugar.com">www.fitsugar.com</a> scroll down to the bottom of the page and check out the other sugar sites like: <a href="http://www.popsugar.com">popsugar</a>, <a href="http://www.buzzsugar.com">buzzsugar</a>, <a href="http://www.geeksugar.com">geeksugar</a>, <a href="http://www.dearsugar.com">dearsugar</a> and more. They are all awesome! <br/><br/>And
last but not least we had on Lisa Newton, the brains behind Weight1Minute. Weight1Minute is a new subscription service for implementing your personally customized weight loss, exercise and nutrition goals. Go the her website <a href="http://www.weight1minute.com">www.weight1minute.com</a> and try them for free for one month.<br/><br/>The Doctor had some his latest installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to watch out for seemingly healthy choices that pack a lot of calories at some of your favorite restaurants. Number
1, Ruby Tuesday's Veggie Burger has over 900 calories, bet you didn't know that. Number
2, Chili's grilled salmon meal gives you 8 oz of salmon some rice and veggies for about 700 calories - probably more than you thought but it sounds good to the Fat Guy. And
Number
3, beware the Macha Green Tea Blast at Jamba Juice...that 32 ounce smoothie will cost you well over 600 calories. For that amount of calories I'd much rather have the salmon from Chili's. He had a few
more tips
but you'll have to listen to get them.<br/><br/>Kathie
finally came back to the studio and she promised that she would be around more often. She was in Cancun and New York filming the Real Savvy Moms TV show.&nbsp; Real Savvy Moms is a great show for moms that is available on most Public Broadcasting Stations around the US and online. Remember Kathie is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano a
few weeks ago.&nbsp;Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.getkathie.com</font></a>. Also check out her hosting skills on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</font></a>. <br/><br/>Remember
we are now on Michigan radio station WKNW this day. They asked us to
create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new
Wellness Minute runs on that station each day. Each Wellness Minute
features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given
wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a
healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips
available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station
that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an
email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us
everyday too.<br/>








<br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My nine year
kid Max made
his radio debut in his new show &quot;Kid Power Radio.&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of David Spade's
&quot;Showbiz Show&quot; on Comedy Central or Entertainment Tonight. Max recaps the week in entertainment
and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies, video games, in books
and in
music and even restaurant reviews. Please go to his site and download the show for your kid. And if
your kid sends Max an email he'll read it on the air next week. <a href="http://www.kidpowerradio.com/">The show can be found at www.kidpowerradio.com</a> and you can email Max at RadioStarMax at Yahoo.com. Your encouragement is greatly appreciated. Thanks!!! <br/><br/>

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy radio show podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about how a small town girl from Massachusetts becomes a Playboy Playmate. Carrie Stevens, the former Miss June 1997 is now an actress, a model, a television host and writer. She has recently lost over 70 pounds and shares how she did it. She is a writer with The Hot Moms Club and some of her work can be found at <a href="http://www.hmcmagazine.com">www.hmcmagazine.com</a> In the interview she told stories about what it's like at the Playboy Mansion and how dating the drummer for Kiss helped inspire and motivate her to take her career to the level it is today. When her son was born Carrie was over 70 pounds heavier than she was during her Playboy Playmate days and her &quot;friends&quot; at Hef's place doubted she could get her hotness back. That was inspiration enough for Carrie and she worked her butt off to get back to where she was. She takes a lot of pride in achieving all the fitness and weight loss goals she set for herself. Because of her amazing story Carrie was chosen to be the spokesperson for Diet Classics. For more information on what Carrie is up to please check out her website <a href="http://www.carriestevens.com">www.carriestevens.com <br/></a></p>




We also got to spend time with Fred Hahn, the author of &quot;The Slow Burn Revolution&quot; His book shows you how slow motion exercising can change your body in less than 30 minutes a week. That's right not 30 minutes a day -- 30 minutes a week. This is perfect for the Fat Guy. He is devouring the book and all the dvds to see if he can do it. Fred says that to lose the weight you have to also implement a protein rich diet that he also covers in his book. Fred's co-authors are: Michael and Mary Dan Eades who wrote Protein Power. Fred's strength training techniques are perfect for the gym and also can be done in your home with stuff you have a round your house. Go to Fred's website <a href="http://www.seriousstrength.com">www.seriousstrength.com</a> and you can find all kinds of info on his slow burn method. <br/><br/>And last but never least we had on the lovely and talented Jennifer Nicole Lee. JNL updated us on what's happening in her world. She has her Bikini Boot Camp coming up in September, she has a line of bathing suits, she has a calendar she has her Fabulously Fit Moms thing going on. you name it Jennifer Nicole Lee is doing it. Who knows what's next..movies, TV, world fitness domination. Please go to her website <a href="http://www.jennifernicolelee.com">www.jennifernicolelee.com</a> to learn more.<br/><br/>The Doctor had some fair health tips on ways to block inflammation without taking drugs. So we had a new installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Naturally Block Inflammation Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to block inflammation...Number
1, lose weight...being over weight promotes joint and tissue damage. Number
2, eat less saturated fats - that means less red meat. And
Number
3, Eat more pineapple. Pineapple contains bromelain and that has been proven to lower inflammation. He had a few
more tips
but you'll have to listen to get them.<br/><br/>Kathie
was still away doing something for the Real Savvy Moms TV show.&nbsp; If she doesn't come back soon Dr Fitness is going to send out a search party to find her. Remember she is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy radio show podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about the Dr Gerald Musante's World Renowned Weight Loss Clinic and book called &quot;Structure House&quot; The Structure House Weight Loss Plan is rocketing up the best seller lists because it is less a diet and more about strategies and tools you can use to permanently change your poor eating behaviors and your relationship with food. Dr Musante spent a lot of time patiently explaining to the fat guy tips and techniques he could use to lose weight.&nbsp; A great weight loss tip from Dr Musante was to eat only three meals a day. During the interview everyone agreed that the best chance for the fat guy to lose weight and keep it off would be through an intervention at the Structure House in Durham, North Carolina. For more information on this great, logical and easy to implement weight loss plan please check out <a href="http://www.structurehouse.com">Dr Gerald Musante's website www.structurehouse.com</a> </p>


We also got to spend time with Wade Meredith, the brains behind Healthbolt. Healthbolt is a fun and informative blog about all things health related. Wade is not a real doctor like Dr Fitness but he is a pretty sharp guy with a passion for health. His blog delves into topics like &quot;What happens to your body if you drink a Coke right now&quot; or &quot;If you stop smoking right now&quot; He also has&nbsp; a bunch of health tips that are so easy the fat guy could do most of them. Please go to his blog at <a href="http://www.healthbolt.net">www.healthbolt.net</a> for all the tips, information and more. It's a great read and we're happy to make Healthbolt our blog of the Week!<br/><br/>Lisa Cohen also joined us to share her experience with bariatric surgery. Now we have had bariatric surgeons on the show before but Lisa was the first bariatric survivor to join us. She has lost 75 pounds and kept it off for almost 2 years now. The surgery worked great for her and she has not had any setbacks. If you are considering bariatric surgery - Lisa did the lap band you have to listen to hear all about her experience. This surgery set her back a lot of money that she had to pay for out of pocket - but she does share a way that her mother got the surgery done for almost nothing. And this did not require a trip to a medical clinic in a third world country.&nbsp; Also go to the <a href="http://www.weightlossradio.blogspot.com">Dr Fitness' blog to see unbelievable before and after pictures of Lisa.</a> <br/><br/>
The Doctor had to bring some great health tips on ways to protect yourself from the sun this summer. So we had a new installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Not Get Sunburned Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to avoid a bad sunburn...Number 1, use lots of sunscreen a minimum of spf 30. Put on more than you think you need and reapply if you go in the water. Number
2, if you have fair skin wear a big brimmed hat and sunglasses. And
Number
3, stay out of the sun during peak times of 10am and 2pm. He had a few more tips
but you'll have to listen to get them.<br/><br/>Kathie
was still away doing something for the Real Savvy Moms TV show.&nbsp; She'll be
away for the next couple of weeks as she films
her Real Savvy Moms show in hot spots around the world. Remember she is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano a

So we had another installment of ...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to avoid calorie traps at the salad bar...Number 1, avoid the muffins, candy yogurt toppings and crunchy salad toppings. Number 2, avoid the mayo based salad dressings. And Number 3, watch out for the cream based soups - stick to the broth based or tomato based soups with lots of veggies in them. He had a few more tips but you'll have to listen to get them.<br/><br/>Kathie was still away doing something for the Real Savvy Moms TV show.&nbsp; She'll be away for the next couple of weeks as she films her Real Savvy Moms show in hot spots around the world. Remember she is one of the top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano a few weeks ago.&nbsp;Be sure to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.getkathie.com</font></a>. Also check her out&nbsp;on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</font></a>. <br/><br/>Remember we are now on Michigan radio station WKNW this day. They asked us to create a Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy &quot;Wellness Minute.&quot; So now a new Wellness Minute runs on that station each day. Each Wellness Minute features the doctor and I going over 5 of his best tips on a given wellness subject like: losing weight, getting in shape, living a healthy lifestyle, etc. We're working on ways to make those tips available to all our listeners. If you have a favorite radio station that you think would benefit from our Wellness Minutes send them an email telling them about it and who knows maybe you can hear us everyday too.<br/><br/>Also once again, I need you to please do me a favor. My nine year kid Max made his radio debut in his new show &quot;Kid Power Radio.&quot; This is a great show for your kids.

<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about weight loss and fitness from the one and only Dr Fitness. <br/></p>

We gave a few shout outs. First a big thank you to the Hungry Girl. Please check out her site at <a href="http://www.hungry-girl.com">www.hungry-girl.com.</a> She was kind enough to run an article Dr Fitness wrote on what to eat before a workout and that brought in a whole new bunch of listeners. So Thank you very much.<br type="_moz"/><p>We would also like to welcome Dr Monte into the fold. Dr Monte does the Fitness Rocks podcast at <a href="http://www.fitnessrocks.org">www.fitnessrocks.org.</a> Fitness Rocks is a popular podcast that is always one of the top ranked podcasts in <a href="http://www.itunes.com">iTunes</a></p>

And we gave a big shout outs to all the Moms that listen. Happy Mother's Day.<br/><br/>This is the first time since we started doing the show that both guests didn't call in. That's not good. So tonight the doctor and me just chatted about all things fitness. So if you tune in for me and the doctor bantering you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>
The Doctor had to bring some great workout tips because we didn't have any guests to carry the show like usual. So we had another installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight
Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to make sure you are losing weight even if you do some traveling at hotels...Number 1, before you book the hotel make sure they have some workout equipment or pool. Number
2, avoid the vending machines. Bring in healthy snacks from nearby grocery stores. And
Number
3, explore the city - go for a walk or a run. <br/><br/>The Doctor had to bring a double dose of tips. Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to sleep well each and every night...Number 1, don't eat right before bedtime.
Number
2, take a hot bath or shower right before going to bed. And
Number
3, make the bedroom a sanctuary - no TV,&nbsp; no computer - just a place to rest and relax. <br/>
<br/>Kathie
was in Michigan doing something for the Real Savvy Moms TV show but she
did give away some of our books which made the doctor happy. She'll be
away for the next couple of weeks as she films
her Real Savvy Moms show in hot spots around the world. Boy could we have used her tonight. Remember she is
one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano a
few weeks ago.&nbsp;Be sure

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy radio show podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about weight loss and fitness from Sgt Harvey Walden, star of the Celebrity Fit Club on <a href="http://www.vh1.com">VH1</a> and England's &quot;Fat Club&quot; Sgt Harvey has whipped celebrities like: Gary Busey, Tempestt Bledsoe, Kelly LeBrock, Tina Yothers and Vincent Pastore into shape on his popular fitness and weight loss TV show. He recently completed &quot;The Celebrity Fit Club Bootcamp Workout&quot; dvd and his book &quot;Harvey's No Excuses Workout&quot; will be out in August. Sgt Harvey believes in tough love and doesn't take kindly to excuses. So if you want some of his best tips and a little behind the scenes gossip from one of TV's best personal trainers you're going to love tonight's show.</p>

<p>Check out First Sgt Harvey Walden's website <a href="http://www.harveywalden.com">www.harveywalden.com</a> for more info.<br/></p>


We also got to spend time with Tanya Shorrock, Diet Nutritionist for Diet Classics. If you have listened to Dr Fitness for any length of time you know that he is dead set against any diet pill. So interviewing Tanya was pretty intense. She held her own with the Fat Guy and there were plenty of laughs. Her feelings are if you are going to spend money for diet pills at least Diet Classics pills are half the price of the name brand ones. Tanya is a nutritionist and a personal trainer in California and she herself doesn't use these pills and all she is trying to do is to give some good information to those people out there who are going to try diet pills anyway. She knows that the only way to lose weight is through eating right and exercising. <br/><br/>
The Doctor had to bring some great workout tips because of the quality
of the guests we had on and he did. So we had another installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight
Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to make sure you are doing a well balanced workout when you strength train...Number 1, always do a full body workout. Don't do arms one day and legs another day. Number 2, only do 8-12 exercises when you workout at the gym. And
Number
3, don't spend too much time on one body part, especially your core. Those one hour abs classes are a waste of time and you can get hurt. <br/><br/>Kathie was in Michigan doing something for the Real Savvy Moms TV show but she did give away some of our books which made the doctor happy. She'll be away for the next couple of weeks as she films
her Real Savvy Moms show in hot spots around the world. Remember she is

Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about weight loss and fitness from the godfather of fitness Jack Lalanne. Jack Lalanne gives a rare interview where he discusses the state of America's obesity problem and what he thinks are the solutions to this crisis. He shares weight loss tips and gives a glimpse into his daily exercise regimen. Even as he passes the 90 year mark Jack still exercises over an hour a day seven days a week. This was truly an unforgettable show. And as a bonus Jack sings a song to close out his segment. For more information on Jack Lalanne, his juicer, his workout dvds and books and all the other stuff please go to his website <a href="http://www.jacklalanne.com">www.jacklalanne.com</a><br/></p>
We also got to spend time with another legend in health and wellness Dr. Jonny Bowden. Jonny has written several bestselling books including: &quot;Living the Low Carb Life&quot; and &quot;Choosing the Diet That's Right For You from Atkins to Zone&quot;. He also is a former winner of the consumer choice award for best nutrition book. When it comes to food and eating healthy Jonny Bowden is in a league of his own. He came on to talk about his new book &quot;The 150 Healthiest Foods on the Planet&quot; Some of these foods are obvious but you'll be pleasantly surprised by a few of them. For more information about healthy food please go to Jonny's website <a href="http://www.jonnybowden.com">www.jonnybowden.com</a> <br/><br/>
The Doctor had to bring some great eating tips because of the quality of the guests we had on and he did. So we had another installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight
Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to eat healthy when you go out to eat...Number 1, always get half of your food to go. Do this before they even bring it out to the table. Restaurant portions are so large you can get half to go and not even notice it.
Number 2, if you are going to get a dessert just get one and share that around the table. And
Number
3, start eating the low calorie healthy foods first and slowly work your way to the meats and starches. Hopefully you'll get full before you get to those higher calorie foods and stop eating. There
were a couple more tips
from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the <a href="http://www.weightlossradio.libsyn.com/">podcast</a> or go to his
<a href="http://www.weightlossradio.blogspot.com/">blog</a> to get the rest.

<br/><br/>Kathie made sure she was in the studio so she could talk with Jack Lalanne. She'll be away for the next couple of weeks as she films her Real Savvy Moms show in hot spots around the world. Remember she is one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano a few weeks ago.&nbsp;Be sure

the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about getting into bikini shape from the Queen of the bikini herself Jennifer Nicole Lee. Jennifer is training hard for her upcoming Bikini Universe competition.

<p>We also got to spend some quality time with Andy Langberg the professional athletes secret weapon. Andy developed a technique to treat athletes and regular folks who have normal aches and pains called Total body Reactivation or TBR. This technique can improve your range of motion and helps get your body in a position to heal itself. Tiki Barber , ex New York Giant running back and current Today Show contributor says &quot;I recommend that every athlete get on Andy's table.&quot; Andy works with athletes in every sport and has treatment centers in New York, NewJersey and soon to be in Florida. to learn more check out Andy Langberg's website <a href="http://www.reactivateme.com">www.reactivateme.com</a> <br/></p>

We also found out about this cool new website called ITrainHarder. this site was developed by Harold E Smith III. He created it after trying other online training sites and combining all the best elements and getting rid of the lousy elements. ITrainHarder has a nutrition/food tracker as well as a training tracker. Harold said that they are working on demonstrations of the exercises as well as a message board/forum for additional support.&nbsp; Please check out his website <a href="http://www.itrainharder.com">www.itrainharder.com&nbsp;</a> this is a solid and affordable online fitness program. <br/><br/>
The Doctor had his fitness tips again. So we had another installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight
Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets about how to start your fitness program...Number 1, consult your doctor before beginning any fitness program.
Number 2, find a coach to teach you the proper form before you begin any strength training. Bad form leads to injuries which leads to quitting. And we don't want you to do that.
And
Number
3, start slowly. Do not go from not exercising to training like Lance Armstrong. Slow and steady wins the race. Remember you are going to be active for a lifetime go slow and ease your way into it. There
were a couple more tips

<a href="http://www.weightlossradio.blogspot.com/">blog</a> to get the rest.

<br/><br/>Kathie was not with us in the studio this week. We missed her. Remember she is one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano a few weeks ago.&nbsp;Be sure

<br/>We were happy to give away that free consultation with Jennifer Nicole Lee . The winner was Angela in Enoch, UTAH. She sent in an amazing email that touched Dr Fitness' heart. Here is some of what she wrote...<br/><br/>
<div><div class="RTE">&quot;Well, as you guys already know, there are a million plus one 
websites/blogs out there that can possibly help you lose weight.&nbsp; I for one 
don't have near enough time to peruse them all if I am following your 
instructions to get up and out to exercise.&nbsp; I have found that I will make time 
to listen to your podcast viz iTunes.&nbsp; I subscribe to nothing else faithfully.&nbsp; 
I have however, taking a liking and feel a connection with Jennifer Nicole Lee.&nbsp; 
Being a working woman and full time mother blogging is not something that I have 
made time to do.&nbsp; I added you to my Myspace&nbsp;blog as well as my Yahoo page as a 
favorite, and a comment out to my friends at Traineo. &nbsp;I do spread the word 
about your podcast to my friends because there is nothing&nbsp;better than hearing 
Dr. Fitness drool over a hot chick on the air or The Fat Guy laughing at 
himself.&nbsp; He may not like people but I can assure you that people like him.&nbsp; 
Listening to your show often is what makes life more enjoyable.&nbsp; Thanks for 
bringing the laugh back in.&quot;</div></div><br clear="all"/>Man that was so nice. And she isn't even related to us. So congratulations Angela. Let us know how your consult with Jennifer goes. And eveyone else who entered but did not win. Sorry, there's always next time.<br/><p>Also I need you to please do me a favor. My nine year kid Max made
his radio debut in his new show &quot;Kid Power Radio.&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of Entertainment
Tonight. Max recaps the week in entertainment and gives his take and
review of what he liked and didn't like on TV, at the movies and in
music. Please go to his site and download the show for your kid. And if

            <description><![CDATA[The most entertaining weight loss and fitness&nbsp;show on radio.&quot;
Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about erasing stress from your life from the Stress Eraser's Director of Clinical Research Fred Muench. Fred talked about the dangers of stress and gave some good tips on how breathing properly can help you relax. He shared lots of good information about the Stress Eraser (which is like a mini bio-feedback machine) and how it can help you coordinate your breathing with your heartbeat which helps you relax. Kathie tried the Stress Eraser on the air and was able to really slow down her breathing using it. She loved. Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy have each been using it for awhile now and we both love it also. <a href="http://www.stresseraser.com">Please go to their website and check it our for yourself www.stresseraser.com</a> It is also available at <a href="http://www.sharperimage.com">Sharper Image</a>, <a href="http://www.skymall.com">Sky Mall</a> and a bunch of other high end catalogues. <br/></p>




<p>We also got to spend some quality time with Sarah Bellum, head trainer and professional Pillow Fighter. (I don't think that is her real name..it might have been because she seemed pretty smart) Sarah represents the Pillow Fight League. The Pillow Fight League has been sweeping Canada and has recently made it's way into the United States. Recently the league got banned from competing in New York because they violated a law that prohibits the use of weapons at various venues. The Fighters pillows were considered weapons. Give me a break. Sarah shared some of the pillow fighter techniques and training tips. She said that fighters do get hurt and this is not like the kind of pillow fights you had when you were a kid. To me the pillow fight league sounds like a cross between roller derby and the glamorous girls of wrestling. <a href="http://www.gopfl.com">Check them out for yourself at their website www.gopfl.com They have dvds, t-shirts, and even pillow cases for sale there. You can also check out where they are competing next.</a> <br/></p>

The Doctor had his fitness tips again. So we had another installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight
Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets...Number 1, make weight loss a priority. Number 2, Skip the all you can eat buffets. Yes even the salad bars. Salad bars are a trap to get you to overeat. you know you are not going to only eat salad..you are going to go for the yogurt and the muffins. And
Number
3, make only one change to your diet at a time.&nbsp; <br/>There
were a couple more tips
from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the <a href="http://www.weightlossradio.libsyn.com/">podcast</a> or go to his
<a href="http://www.weightlossradio.blogspot.com/">blog</a> to get the rest.

Kathie was back in the studio this week. The doctor had a grin from ear to ear for the whole show. Remember she is one of the
top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out
there... she is so hot she got to be a body double for Alyssa Milano a few weeks ago.&nbsp;Be sure
to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.getkathie.com</font></a>. Also check her out&nbsp;on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</font></a>. <br/>








<br/>Jennifer Nicole Lee has offered to give away a FREE 30 minute
consultation and one of her inspirationally hot calendars to one of our
lucky listeners. So if you are interested in winning send the Doctor an
email at Adam@drfitnessandthefatguy.com. We are choosing the winner
based on two things. First a compelling reason why you would benefit
from chatting with Jennifer Nicole Lee and second how many mentions you
can get the Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy website and radio show in
blogs. So start spreading the word about the show because we will be
selecting the winner in a couple of weeks!!! <br/>


























<p>Also I need you to please do me a favor. My nine year kid Max made
his radio debut in his new show &quot;Kid Power Radio.&quot; This is a great show
for your kids. It is kind of like a kids version of Entertainment

the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about mindless eating from the the guy who wrote the book on the subject Brian Wansink. Brian is the director of the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab. He also wrote the bestselling book &quot;Mindless Eating. Why We Eat More Than We Think.&quot; He has appeared all over the place including, the New York Times, MSNBC and now on an upcoming PBS special. His work was instrumental in the creation of all those 100 calorie snacks bags that are in your grocery store. Brian shared lots of tips and great strategies for you to&nbsp; stop that mindless eating that sabotages the best dieting intentions. He also invited our listeners to attend a very special FREE Consumer Camp being held at his lab on April 13-15. You can see firsthand how he does his groundbreaking research and hopefully you'll come away with a handle on controlling your snacking. <a href="http://www.mindlesseating.org">Please check out Brian's website www.mindlesseating.org for lots of great info on his book, the camp and other resources.</a><br/></p>


<p>We also got to spend some quality time with Gillian Verga, the founder of Weight Circles. WeightCircles is a great new online community that helps people who want to lose weight keep it off. This wonderful community connects people together in circles and helps them stay motivated, exchanging tips and encouraging each other. If you have had trouble sticking with a diet you should give weightcircles a try. It is free and they have a circle for just about everyone. There are circles for seniors, for men, for women, for those who need to lose a lot of weight and for those who just need help maintaining the weight they have already lost. <a href="http://www.weightcircles.com">Please go to www.weightcircles.com and you can explore this website yourself. I'm sure you will find a circle to help you achieve your goals.</a><br/></p>


Our last guest was Sara Holliday a yoga expert and a contributor to the Hot Moms Club. Sara has produced a series of yoga videos specifically for mothers to help them stay in shape during pregnancy and lose the weight and get in shape after the birth of their baby. She has the only yoga programs out there that are tailored to each trimester of pregnancy.

<p> The Doctor is really getting into his fitness tips now. He has
stopped recycling old weight loss tips and is somehow coming up with
new helpful weight control material. So here is another installment of
...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight
Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets...Number 1, take a fast food break. No more drive thru's for the rest of the month. Number 2, spring is a great time to clean out your pantry. Get rid of high calorie snacks and try some new recipes. And
Number
3, break out that food journal again. Some bad habits have probably snuck back into your eating so write down what you are currently eating to see where you are at. Remember if you are not assessing you are guessing. There
were a couple more tips
from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the <a href="http://www.weightlossradio.libsyn.com/">podcast</a> or go to his

the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; 










<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about cheerleading and dance fitness from the folks at Cheeracise. They&nbsp; have dvds and a website that teaches girls how to cheer like a pro cheerleader and also gives exercise dvd lovers a change of pace from their same old boring exercise routines with hot new cheerleader dance and fitness moves. We talked to Todd Regenbogen the founder of Cheeracise and one of the original Cheeracise girls Kathlyne. Todd shared how they use a lot of plyometric exercises in their videos and Kathlyne shared some killer cheerleading stories. <a href="http://www.cheeracise.com">Go to their website www.cheeracise.com for more.</a><br/></p>
<p>Next up was Celebrity Fit Club hypnotherapist Marisa Peer calling in from England. On the show which airs on VH1, she did her best to keep all those celebrities on the straight and narrow using hypnosis and lots of nurturing. And that hot British accent didn't hurt either. She shared lots of weight loss tips for our listeners like the importance of changing the language you use. For instance don't say you want to lose weight! When you use phrases like that your mind spends a lot of time and energy helping you get things you lost back. Marisa thinks that is partially the reason why diets don't work. In addition to being too restrictive they&nbsp; have you focusing on the wrong things. Instead try thinking about how you have a super fast metabolism. You have to listen to the rest to get all her great tips. Marisa Peer also has a new book called &quot;Think Yourself Thin Forever.&quot; Her website features a lot of resources for people who want assistance with:&nbsp; relaxation, weight control,  self confidence, self esteem, perfect pregnancy, conception, younger skin and lots more. <a href="http://www.marisapeer.com">She was a great guest and you should definitely check out her website www.marisapeer.com.</a><br/></p>
Our last guest was old friend Bob Fox from Speed Stacks. He wanted to&nbsp; let our listeners know that the 2007 WSSA World Sport Stacking Championships will be held April 14-15 in Denver. Once again ESPN will be televising this great event. <a href="http://www.speedstacks.com">Go to Bob's website www.speedstacks.com for more info about sport stacking in general as well as links to the Championship event coming up.</a><br/>






<p> The Doctor is really getting into his fitness tips now. He has stopped recycling old weight loss tips and is somehow coming up with new helpful weight control material. So here is another installment of ...Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight
Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' secrets...Number 1, use props and smaller plates in order to really visualize what a proper portion size looks like. For example the meat portion of your meal should be no bigger than a deck of cards. Number 2, When you are eating...concentrate on your food, bite by bite. Eating slowly and chewing deliberately will help you feel full faster. And
Number
3, listen to your body. Pay attention for cues that you are full. And when you feel full - stop eating. Also don't eat if you are feeling full to begin with. There
were a couple more tips
from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the <a href="http://www.weightlossradio.libsyn.com">podcast</a> or go to his
<a href="http://www.weightlossradio.blogspot.com">blog</a> to get the rest.</p>

top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out

So put down the snicker bar and check out <a href="http://www.livinlavidalowcarb.com">www.livinlavidalowcarb.com</a> right now. I can't promise you you'll drop 200 pounds like Jimmy, but you will be amazed at the amount of info on the low carb diet he provides. But that's not all Jimmy has his fingers all over these websites too...<a href="http://www.carbwire.com">CarbWire.com</a>, <a href="http://www.lowcarbnewsline.com">LowCarbNewsline.com</a>, <a href="http://www.commonvoice.com">CommonVoice.com</a> and <a href="http://www.dietdetective.com">DietDetective.com</a></p>
We also heard from Dr David Katz. This guy is the real deal his claim to diet fame did not come from starring in a sitcom or fitness video. He actually wrote the text book on weight loss. This Yalee can now be regularly seen on the pages of Oprah's magazine as well as the NY Times. The premise of his Flavor Point Diet is that you have a tendency to stay hungry longer and eat more when you eat more flavors. So limit the flavors you eat and lose weight. He also has some strong views on the obesity epidemic. Check out his website at <a href="http://www.davidkatzmd.com">www.davidkatzmd.com</a> and learn more<br/>

Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, start the day off with exercise. Number 2, eat some fruit for breakfast because fiber fills you up. Some high fiber fruits include: apples, pears, and berries. And
Number
3, slow down while you eat. It's even a good idea to get up and walk away. There
were a couple more tips
from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the podcast or go to his

Mountain biking is a great sport for anyone looking to take their bike riding to the next level. You get a great workout and don't need to spend a fortune for equipment.

the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>








<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about an amazing weight loss story from Shauna. She lives in Scotland and she has been blogging as DietGirl for over 6 years now. She has transformed herself from weighing over 350 pounds to now less than 180 pounds. That's right she has lost well over 170 pounds and kept it off. You must check out her blog at <a href="http://www.dietgirl.org">www.dietgirl.org</a> if you want to be inspired and see for yourself that it is possible to lose weight, even a lot of weight if you stick with it and keep plugging away day after day. We are so proud of what Shauna has accomplished. She is a wonderful role model for all of us who know that we should lose weight but struggle with the enormity of the task. She talked about the importance of persistence not perfection. And also said not to put your life on hold until you get skinny.&nbsp; I think that Shauna is truly amazing and if you are a book publisher you should contact her and offer her a deal, because what she did and is still doing is worthy of being shared with everyone.</p>















<p>We also heard from Leigh Crews. Leigh is a professional fitness instructor and yoga expert. She was recently voted one of America's best trainers by Vogue magazine. In addition to lots of yoga and fitness dvds, Leigh has been working with the folks at PodFitness. Podfitness is the first fitness system that builds customized audio workouts based on your fitness goals. You just download the fitness workout onto your ipod or mp3 player and the trainer's voice comes on over your own music to tell you what to do and keep you going. You can choose from lots of trainers (we recommend Leigh) and any just about any workout imaginable.&nbsp; For more info on Leigh...her dvds and her workshops check out her website <a href="http://www.leighcrews.com">www.leighcrews.com</a> For more information about PodFitness check out their website <a href="http://www.podfitness.com">www.podfitness.com</a></p>



<p> This week&nbsp;we had time for the tips segment of the show which is now
called Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Lose Weight Tomorrow.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, weigh yourself every day. the Fat Guy said not to do this, but Dr Fitness insisted that weighing yourself is a great way to keep yourself accountable and therefore make any adjustments in a timely manner. Number 2, eat more fiber,&nbsp; especially fruit and vegetables. Fiber makes you feel full. And Number 3, go dancing more often. Dancing is a great and fun way to burn tons of calories. There
was&nbsp;a lot more
from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the podcast or go to his
blog to get the rest.</p>



The Fat Guy finally got around to showing Dr Fitness how to play the&nbsp; Nintendo Wii. Dr Fitness, being the exceptional athlete that he is picked it up right away. He is now on the look out for his own Wii. <br/><br/>We covered lots of news this week. Sadly Richard Jeni passed away this weekend. Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy saw him at a comedy club the last time he was in Atlanta. Also we talked about the 90 year old guy who wants to fight Jack LaLanne. That would make a great pay per view. Dr Fitness was excited about the gym in Holland that allowed you to workout naked. Yeah, how would you like to get on that bike right after the naked guy finished up. No thanks! And the Fat Guy tried Samoan food.<br/>

<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about the weight loss diet that has been sweeping Canada and is now moving into the U.S. Dr Stanley Bernstein, the best selling author and founder of&nbsp; Canada's most successful health and diet clinic shares the secret behind what makes his medically supervised weight loss program so effective. His program gets you into the state of ketosis in just a day or two so the weight comes off fast, sometimes as much as 5 pounds a week.&nbsp; Remember this is a medically supervised program that requires you to eat very specifically and come into his clinic about 3 times a week. He said the results are dramatic. For more information, please check out his website <a href="http://www.drbdiet.com">www.drbdiet.com</a> <br/></p>

She was a former 4 time Aerobic champion in Canada and has parlayed that into her great series on Fit TV as well as a wonderful DVD exercise series called &quot;The Works&quot; In her dvds she has some people exercising at an advanced level, others at an intermediate level and others at a beginner level. This way you can work out at your own pace and progress to higher levels as you get in better and better shape. For more info on Sharon...her dvds, her newsletter and her show

Lee got a new Nintendo Wii and expects to use it to lose weight. So far he has been unable to beat his 9 year old kid at any of the sports games, but expects to soon. Because now he can practice all day while his kid is in school.<br/>

This week&nbsp;we had time for the tips segment of the show which is now
called Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Choose The Right Athletic Shoe. Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, make sure you buy a shoe that is right for your foot type. Low arch, medium arch or high arch. Number 2, to determine what kind of arch you have do this...Wet the sole of your foot then step on a paper bag. If the visible print of the bottom of your foot looks like a foot then you have a low arch or flat feet. If the curve of your foot cuts all the way across the width of your foot then you have a high arch. And Number 3, for more information about choosing the right shoe for your foot check out the website <a href="http://www.apma.org">www.apma.org</a>.There
was&nbsp;a lot more
from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the podcast or go to his

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The most entertaining weight loss and fitness&nbsp;show on radio.&quot;
Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and
the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny
about staying strong and slim from nationally known health reporter and nutrition expert Lisa Drayer. Lisa shares lots of tips straight out of her brand new book &quot;Strong Slim and 30! Eat Right, Stay Young, Feel Great, and Look FABULOUS&quot; And who wouldn't want to do all that? Lisa told us the secret to great skin and hair begins at the dinner table. She said eat more healthy fats and a little more protein and your skin will glow and your hair will shine. She had lots of other great tips, but you'll have to hear them for yourself. check out her website <a href="http://www.lisadrayer.com">www.lisadrayer.com</a> for more info about her and her new book.<br/></p>


<p>We also heard from Jennifer Kries. America's #1 pilates expert goes way beyond her award winning and best selling &quot;Method&quot; series. She throws in some yin yang energy and a few longevity exercises and a lot of other surprises to get her new Hot Body Cool Mind series of full body workouts. When I say full body I mean it. She has exercises for every body part including your fingers, hands and feet. That is full body. These dvds are so good that Dr Fitness himself was on the floor doing the exercises. I can't wait until that video hits <a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a> Jennifer has an extensive dance background and she combined that with a little eastern&nbsp; philosophy and you get the Hot Body Cool Mind workout that will change your life. For more info on Jennifer and her dvds check out her website <a href="http://www.jenniferkries.com">www.jenniferkries.com</a>&nbsp; </p>



<p>We also spoke with Greg Todd, the soon to be famous other Fat Guy. He has been chronicling his weight loss journey on his blog <a href="http://fatguyblog.com">www.fatguyblog.com</a> for awhile now and is making great progress towards his goal of losing 100 pounds. So far he has lost about 25 pounds. Greg said that putting his weight loss out there for the world to see has really held him accountable. He feels that if he doesn't post or eats poorly that he is letting his readers down. Great job Greg and I know our listeners will stop by your site to cheer you on and keep you motivated. <br/></p>



<p>This week&nbsp;we had time for the tips segment of the show which is now
called Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Become A Well Rounded Fit Person.&nbsp;Here are
a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, work on flexibility...stretch more and maybe take a yoga or pilates class or buy Jennifer's dvd. Number 2, work on your cardio...make sure you use a heart rate monitor to make sure you are not overdoing it.&nbsp;And Number 3, work on your balance..mix agility disc training into your weekly workouts. There was&nbsp;a lot more
from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the podcast or go to his
blog to get the rest.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The most entertaining weight loss and fitness&nbsp;show on radio.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about fitting exercise in a tight schedule from the Queen of&nbsp;exercise dvds herself, Tamilee Webb from&nbsp;Buns of Steel fame. Tamilee talks about her new &quot;Tight on Time&quot; series of dvds as well as gives a whole bunch of insight into exercise, fitness and her own philosophy of what it means to look good. Her Tight on Time dvds break workouts down into 10 minute chunks so you can fit them in when you have the time to do so. You can do the entire program for an ultra-varied workout or just select the workout that fits your mood or schedule. Come on, everyone can find 10 minutes a day, right? Tamilee also shared some of the other things she's up to. Like her Hawaiian Workout Cruise&nbsp;that will happen this September. She's&nbsp;trying to get the &quot;Body By Gilad&quot; guy on the boat too. Imagine going on a cruise around Hawaii and working out with Tamilee Webb each day. How awesome would that be? Our friend Kathie Larkin from Real Savvy Moms, can't wait to sign up. Tamilee also has a Tight on Time line of healthy foods that can be delivered to you each week. Please go to her websites <a href="http://www.webbworkout.com/">www.webbworkout.com</a> or <a href="http://www.tamileewebb.com/">www.tamileewebb.com</a> to get more info on all her stuff. </p>
<p>We also spoke with Renee,&nbsp;the energy behind on the the most thorough and comprehensive weight loss, fitness and health&nbsp;blog directory on the internet <a href="http://www.fatfighterblogs.com/">www.fatfighterblogs.com</a>. Renee has been blogging for over 5 years and she has over 400 sites connected to her directory in almost every category related to health. Renee also chronicles her personal weight loss journey on her blog <a href="http://www.reneegetsfit.com">www.reneegetsfit.com</a>. There she has photos, videos and and podcasts of herself as she continues on her path to getting in great shape. Dr Fitness has volunteered to help Renee so we plan on&nbsp;having her back throughout the year to see&nbsp;if having&nbsp;the Doctor on her team helps her progress. Her blogs are a great place for other people struggling with weight loss to come and share what's working and what's not. You get a true sense of community there and Renee has been able to meet lots of wonderful people through her blogs. Dr Fitness says that writing a food journal is an important part of a weight loss program to keep you accountable and now with blogging you can chronicle your journey online and connect with people like Renee on her Fat Fighter Blog as well to get additional support.</p>
<p>This week&nbsp;we had time for the tips segment of the show which is now called Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Cut Calories.&nbsp;Here are a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, cut out sugared sodas - instead go to half club soda with a splash of fruit juice. Number 2, lose the high calorie condiments like mayo and oil.&nbsp;And Number 3, make more&nbsp;rock star salads - throw in everything, nuts, turkey, berries, mushrooms, avocado, onions, peppers. Make that your meal.&nbsp;There was&nbsp;a lot more from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to listen to the podcast or go to his blog to get the rest.</p>
<p>Yeah, Kathie was back from Las Vegas. As you know Kathie Larkin, fitness model, actress, soon to be exercise dvd star&nbsp;and host of the Real Savvy Moms TV show comes on our show to be our&nbsp;co-host when she can fit it into her busy schedule. Last week, Kathie was in Las Vegas showing off her legs and feet at the largest shoe convention in the world. She is one of the top&nbsp;feet and legs model's out there.&nbsp;Be sure to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.getkathie.com</font></a>. Also check her out&nbsp;on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</font></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one told Kathie that what happens in Vegas is supposed to stay in Vegas since she&nbsp;shared an interesting steam room and jacuzzie story that involved a lot of nudity. It seems that Vegas loosens up a lot of women's inhibitions. Who knew?</p>
<p>We gave away&nbsp;another&nbsp;FREE BioTrainer. We gave it&nbsp;to Renee from <a href="http://www.fatfighterblogs.com/">www.fatfighterblogs.com</a>. Remember, we are still giving BioTrainers&nbsp;away to one lucky&nbsp;subscriber to our email newsletter each week until we run out of them.&nbsp;So if you are not already a subscriber then please go to our website <a href="http://www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.drfitnessandthefatguy.com</font></a> and sign up for our free newsletter to automatically enter yourself in this weekly drawing. </p>

<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about what it takes to be the personal trainer for Hollywood's Top Celebrities from Fit TV's Host of FitNation Gina Lombardi. Gina told hilarious stories about training such stars as Kevin James from &quot;King of Queens&quot; fame as well as Kirstie Alley (before she met Jenny Craig). You've got to hear Gina tell her story about how Kirstie and her were photographed by paparazzi in Italy and were declared to be a hot&nbsp;couple!&nbsp;Gina also talked about how to stay compliant on your exercise program... which everyone knows is so challenging. For more on Gina check out her website <a href="http://www.ginalombardi.com/">www.ginalombardi.com</a> For more on Fit TV check out their website <a href="http://fittv.discovery.com/">http://fittv.discovery.com/</a>&nbsp;Imagine an entire TV channel devoted to all things fitness. That's Fit TV. It's on Direct TV as well as on cable.</p>
<p>We also spoke with Annette Hudson, the creator of the Fit America contest. This is one of the only fitness contests around that is free for you to participate in and also will be giving away over $50,000 worth of prizes. The winners won't necessarily be the ones who have lost the most weight, they will be the ones who made the most progress in adopting a healthier lifestyle. For more information on the contest check out the <a href="http://www.fitamericacontest.com/">www.fitamericacontest.com</a> website. When you enter the contest you will have access to lots of fitness experts who are available to help you succeed (including our very own Dr Fitness - Dr Adam Shafran) For more info on Annette Hudson - please check out her website <a href="http://www.myfitnesstrainer.com/">www.myfitnesstrainer.com</a> By the way we asked Annette to give our listeners her top Fitness Tips and she said her number one weight loss tip would be for you have a&nbsp;positive attitude. For the rest of her tips you'll have to download this podcast. </p>
<p>Dr. Fitness found some funny fitness questions people have asked other trainers on the internet. Like is &quot;Is how I'm breathing the reason&nbsp;why I'm not losing weight?&quot; Yeah it's your breathing not the fact you can't go by a McDonald's without stopping your car. The Fat Guy shared a new french fry invention by Longhorn - they have taken french fries to a new level. And we also discussed how binge eating is the new number one eating disorder knocking&nbsp;anorexia and bulimia out of the top spot. </p>
<p>This week we ran out of time for the&nbsp;Doctor's&nbsp;tips. The tips segment is now called Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; To Add Life To Your Boring Workout Routine.&nbsp;Here are a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, change your routine by slowing it down do less sets or take shorter breaks between sets. Number 2, join a league. A tennis league, a basketball league, flag football, ballroom dancing, anything that makes you sweat.&nbsp;And Number 3, get a partner - working out with someone else makes it fun. There was&nbsp;a lot more from Dr. Fitness, but you'll have to go to his blog to get the rest.</p>
<p>We were without&nbsp;Kathie Larkin, fitness model, actress, soon to be exercise dvd star&nbsp;and host of the Real Savvy Moms TV show on as a co-host. Kathie was in Las Vegas showing off her legs and feet at the largest shoe convention in the world.

<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about eating healthy from our &quot;Blogger of the Week&quot; Dr Tanya Taylor. Tanya is the editor of <a href="http://www.iateapie.net/">www.IAteAPie.Net</a> a great blog that reviews foods that dieters like to eat. Tanya has her PhD in Food Science and Nutrition and she loves to talk food. She has some strong opinions about everything from articificial sweetners like Splenda to the government regulating trans fats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also spoke with Sheri Gilburth. Sheri is a certified massage therapist and she spoke extensively about Reiki, an ancient healing technique that compliments massage therapy as well as other massage techniques. She told us stories about how she has been able to help her clients deal with stress, depression and maximize their athletic potential. &nbsp;You can learn more about her practice at <a href="http://www.heartcenteredtherapy.com/">www.heartcenteredtherapy.com</a> </p>
<p>Dr. Fitness seemed to have read the news this week and he had some thoughts about mindless eating from a study by Cornell University and he was freaking out about the increase of obesity related surgeries that are happening. The Fat Guy thinks obesity surgeries are good for everyone but Dr Fitness has a problem with people taking the easy way out.</p>
<p>This week the good Doctor was kind enough to come up with a few tips. The tips segment is now called Dr Fitness' &quot;Things You Can Do Today&quot; to squeeze in activity into your busy schedule.&nbsp;Here are a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, always take the stairs. Number 2, set your watch to beep every hour...then get up and do some light exercises for 5 minutes. Do things like jog in place or squats. If you do this 6-8 times a day you have done a nice easy workout.&nbsp;And Number 3, always park far away, the walk will do you good. Remember exercise has a cumulative effect every little bit helps. There was&nbsp;a lot more from Dr. Fitness, so you will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of these&nbsp;great&nbsp;tips. And I'm sure he'll post all the tips on his blog.</p>
<p>The doctor also mentioned (again) that he has been chosen to be an expert on the Fit America contest. That means that if you sign up for this great contest you can get extra help from your favorite fitness doctor. So learn more about this contest at <a href="http://www.fitamericacontest.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.fitamericacontest.com</font></a>&nbsp;you can win great prizes and lose weight how cool is that?&nbsp;Next week we will have the founder of this contest on the show.</p>
<p>Once again we were also lucky enough to have Kathie Larkin, fitness model, actress, soon to be exercise dvd star&nbsp;and host of the Real Savvy Moms TV show on as a co-host. Kathie had a lot of questions for our&nbsp; our food doctor. she also made fun of the Fat Guy pretty good. that was nice. She'll be in Las Vegas for the next couple of weeks showing off her legs at some big shoe trade show. She is a foot and legs model.&nbsp;But she promised she will be back. Be sure to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.getkathie.com</font></a>. Also check her out as on <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.RealSavvyMoms.com</a> Be on the look out for her during the Super Bowl. she will be in one of the commercials during the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fat Guy was&nbsp;his usual sarcastic self... teasing each of the guests and especially the doctor. He was a uncomfortable talking about massage&nbsp; because he doesn't really like to be touched. And he was very intimidated by the food doctor because she obviously was the smartest person on the show.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We also talked about our new contest! We are giving away a FREE BioTrainer to a subscriber to our email newsletter each week until we run out of them. This week's winner was Stacy Flynn.

			<title>Play The Fitness Challenge Game And Lose Weight. Relax At Chateau Elan Spa. And Be Pain Free With Painmaster Patch.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/lose_weight_radio_01212007_64_weight_loss_game.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The most entertaining weight loss and fitness&nbsp;show on radio.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy radio show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about the only weight loss board game&nbsp;from Vicki Sorenson creator of The Fitness Challenge.&nbsp;We also spoke with Fran Powell with the Painmaster Patch who shared how his product can help treat a wide range of injuries and painful conditions. Then we spoke with Michelle Ufer-Herold the Spa Director at Chateau Elan, Atlanta's best kept spa and resort secret.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone knows that losing weight is difficult because it is so tough to stick with your exercise program for any length of time. That's where The Fitness Challenge comes in. This game is for any age or fitness level. Players compete against each other during their 8 week game. Exercise 3 times in a week and you get a bunch of stars. The player with the most stars wins a prize. And this is where the fun comes in, the loser has to pay up. That could mean washing the winner's car, cleaning their house or babysitting their kid. This game is a great way to keep compliant. Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy are about to go head to head and give it a try. Check out Vicki's website <a href="http://www.fitnesschallenge.com/">www.fitnesschallenge.com</a> for more information and all the places you can&nbsp;get the game. Vicki lost 60 pounds on it!</p>
<p>When Dr Fitness took his girlfriend to the Chateau Elan for a romantic getaway he was blown away by the great food, the relaxing atmosphere and the superb service. He and his girlfriend left relaxed, recharged and refreshed. Michelle Ufer-Herold, the Spa Director shared some of the services and events that the doctor missed. For instance, each year you can stomp the grapes at the award winning vineyard that is on site. They also have a heated indoor pool, golf, tennis and horses for your pleasure. There is so much more to see and do, please check out their website <a href="http://www.chateauelan.com/">www.chateauelan.com</a> and see for yourself. They are having Valentine's Day specials so be sure to think of that if you want to be a star for your significant other this V-Day. </p>
<p>As you know Dr Fitness is a chiropractor and he helps people deal with pain on a regular basis. He came across the Painmaster patch and he can't stop talking about it. This small portable device uses micro current therapy which uses small pulsating currents of electricity that cannot be felt on the afflicted area in order to alleviate the pain. You just slap a couple of these patches on the area that hurts and forgot about it for a few hours. Then low and behold you will be amazed at the improvement in the pain. It is common for patients to have pain at an 8 level when they go to sleep then wake up and the pain is down to a 3 or 4 level when they use the patches. Only doctors can prescribe this therapy so be sure to ask your doctor about it. If they have any questions they and you can check out Fran's websites <a href="http://www.painmastercanada.com/">www.painmastercanada.com</a> or <a href="http://www.painmasterpatch.com/">www.painmasterpatch.com</a> Fran said that if you want to try the device risk free have your physician send an email to chris at painmasterproducts dot com and (for a limited time) he will send a device to your doctor for you to try at no charge. This device does a great job at reducing inflammation and helping injured cells to heal.</p>
<p>Dr. Fitness also chimed in with his&nbsp;tips about what to do if you have a lot of weight to lose.&nbsp;Here are a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, set short term goals. Number 2, manage your expectations...you didn't gain the weight in 30 days and you definitely won't lose the weight in 30 days. And Number 3, don't have an all or nothing mentality. If you only have time to exercise for 10 minutes do that...a little bit each day is better than nothing.&nbsp;There was&nbsp;a lot more from Dr. Fitness, so you will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of these&nbsp;great&nbsp;tips. And I'm sure he'll post all the tips on his blog.</p>
<p>The doctor also announced that he has been chosen to be an expert on the Fit America contest. That means that if you sign up for this great contest you can get extra help from your favorite fitness doctor. So learn more about this contest at <a href="http://www.fitamericacontest.com/">www.fitamericacontest.com</a>&nbsp;you can win great prizes and lose weight how cool is that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were also lucky enough to have Kathie Larkin, fitness model, actress, soon to be exercise dvd star&nbsp;and host of the Real Savvy Moms TV show on as a co-host. Kathie talked about the challenges of&nbsp;fitting in eating well and exercise into&nbsp;a busy moms hectic schedule. Be sure to check out Kathie's website <a href="http://www.getkathie.com/">www.getkathie.com</a>. She can be seen in a commercial in this year's Super Bowl as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fat Guy was in rare form teasing each of the guests and especially the doctor. He was a little out of sorts becuase his wife was gone all week in Mexico on business while he had to stay at home with his kid. </p>
<p>We also talked about our contest where we are giving away a FREE BioTrainer to a subscriber to our email newsletter each week until we run out of them.

<p>When it comes to emotional eating and the other pyschological issues involved in weight management there are not many more people as qualified as&nbsp;Linda Spangle. Jorge Cruise calls her a &quot;true genius&quot; and &quot;an expert in emotional eating.&quot; Linda shared some of her best weight loss&nbsp;tips such as when you have a craving for crunchy or chewy foods ask yourself what's bothering you? Is it stress? Family issues? Money? Will eating those chips make those real problems go away? You'll learn a bunch more during her interivew.

<p>Juliet Zuercher joined us and shared some important information regarding eating disorders in women. She gave some great tips on what to do to prevent your daughter from getting an eating disorder such as not freaking out if she is a picky eater. Kids are great at regulating their nutrition instinctively. You'll be surprised to know that a lot of times your kid will pick the healthy choice on her own.

<p>Dr. Fitness also chimed in with his&nbsp;tips about the things your gym won't tell you.&nbsp;Here are a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, that the drop out rate of members who actually use the gym is astronomical. About 75% of members stop going to the gym in 90 days. Number 2, gyms are a cesspool. There are germs everywhere...on the machines, the swiss balls, the mats, the cardio equipment. Be sure to wipe down everything you touch. And Number 3, try not to have a heart attack at the gym...most are not equipped to handle any kind of medical emergency. There was&nbsp;a lot more from Dr. Fitness, so you will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of these&nbsp;great&nbsp;tips. And I'm sure he'll post all the tips on his blog.</p>

<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about how to stick to your Top&nbsp;New Year's resolutions from Discovery Network's Fit TV's &quot;Diet Doctor&quot; Dr. Melina Jampolis and Atlanta's top Stop Smoking expert Dr. Varada Divgi. </p>
<p>Dr. Melina took time out from promoting her brand new book &quot;The No Time To Lose Diet&quot; to share some of her top weight loss tips. Be sure to check her out this Friday, January 12 on the Regis and Kelly show. She is also a regular contributor to <a href="http://www.vivmag.com/">www.vivmag.com</a>, the first digital only, interactive women's lifestyle magazine. Dr. Melina is one of only 200 physician nutrition specialist, so she knows what she talking about when it comes to losing weight. She said her said her top tip for our listeners who want to lose weight would be to never have an all or nothing mentality when it comes to your diet. Avoid super restrictive diets that require you to radically change how you normally eat. She said that just sets you up to fail. Be sure to check out her website <a href="http://www.drmelina.com/">www.drmelina.com</a> to learn more about her book, her nutritional products and her blog.</p>
<p>We also had on Dr. Varada who passionately spoke about the importance of quitting smoking. Dr. Varada has seen first hand the damaging effects from smoking during her decades working as a pulmonologist. She was the first pediatric pulmonologist in Atlanta in 1981. Now she runs the Smoking and Tobacco Addiction Relief Center in Atlanta. She uses a low level laser therapy to help people quit smoking. To get more information about her program go to her website <a href="http://www.quitsmoke.us/">www.quitsmoke.us</a> </p>
<p>Dr. Fitness had some really good tips about how to get the most out of your workout in 2007.&nbsp;Here are a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, get your workout done early in the day. Number 2, pick an activity that you love to do.&nbsp;And Number 3, get a partner...you will slip up, lose interest and have setbacks...a partner watches your back to get you back on track. There was&nbsp;a lot more from Dr. Fitness, so you will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of these&nbsp;great&nbsp;tips. And I'm sure he'll post all the tips on his blog.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the&nbsp;Fat Guy's new website <a href="http://www.gymsarearipoff.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.GymsAreARipOff.com</font></a> the Fat Guy thinks that gyms prey upon sedentary people and basically take their money knowing full well that they will stop going to the gym in a matter of weeks. So check out the Fat Guys &quot;Gyms Are A Rip Off&quot; blog and submit your gym horror story. It seems that people are frustrated by the broken promises their gym gave them when they joined and also they are usually disappointed when their hometown gym gets bought out by a large national corporate chain.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/weightlossradio_10292006_ENTIRE_64_Hungry-Girl_NutritionTwins.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a replay of our listeners favorite show from 2006. We will begin broadcasting new shows next week.</p>
<p>"The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet." Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about how to survive Halloween without putting on too many extra pounds.&nbsp;This is Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy's 2nd Annual Halloween Calorie Saving Tip Show. Last year we were lucky enough to have Lisa Lillien, the Hungry-Girl on our first Halloween Show and she is back again this year. This year we also pulled some strings and had on Lyssie and Tammy Lakatos, the Nutrition Twins. And for the first time we had on&nbsp;one of New york's best personal trainers, who was recently featured in Oprah's O Magazine, Michael Gonzalez-Wallace.</p>
<p>We started off with Michael telling us about "The Workout That Does It All" this workout strengthens your mind as well as your muscles. It boosts your&nbsp;immune system while burning calorie after calorie. Micheal is a former professional basketball player from Spain who is now taking over New York City with this awesome exercise program. Check out his website <a href="http://www.sportstrengthtraining.com/"><span style="color: #4182b8;">www.sportstrengthtraining.com</span></a>&nbsp;and see clips of his brand new DVDs. You can also learn all about the Neuromuscular Strength Training system he specifically developed to help his clients on the upper East Side of Manhattan. His Upper East Side Workout video was filmed in Central Park so you won't find a more picturesque looking exercise dvd. Micheal lost 9 pounds during the filming of these videos so imagine how much weight you'll lose if you use them a couple times a week. If you mention Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy when you order his exercise dvds Michael will knock off 15% of the purchase price.</p>
<p>Next we were joined by Lyssie and Tammy Lakatos, the Nutrition Twins. They recently were kind of regulars on the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy TV show. They can also be seen all the time on&nbsp;WABC news in New York giving all kinds of nutrition advice, recently they did an extended segment all about Halloween Candy.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's what we talked about tonight on our show. The Nutrition Twins are big fans of Tootsie pops and other lollipops for treats. They also love Adora Calcium Supplements, which can be found at <a href="http://www.adoracalcium.com/"><span style="color: #4182b8;">www.AdoraCalcium.com</span></a>. For some reason, we also talked about tips to help you start gaining weight. Probably because Nicole Richie is in the news struggling with gaining weight. Yeah, her and 3 other people out there.</p>
<p>Please, check out Tammy and Lyssie's&nbsp;website <a href="http://www.nutritiontwins.com/"><span style="color: #4182b8;">www.NutritionTwins.com</span></a>&nbsp;It is filled with lots of great information about losing weight and healthy eating. They will answer your nutrition questions and send you great recipes when you&nbsp;subscribe to their newsletter. &nbsp;You can also get their wonderful book "Fire Up your Metabolism: 9 Proven Principles for Burning Fat and Losing Weight Forever."</p>
<p>Then last, but certainly not least we had on Lisa Lillien, The Hungry-Girl herself.&nbsp;She has without a doubt the&nbsp;Number 1 email newsletter for hungry girls and hungry boys. Go to <a href="http://www.hungry-girl.com/"><span style="color: #4182b8;">www.Hungry-Girl.com</span></a> check it out and subscribe.&nbsp;It is my wife's favorite newsletter and she can't wait to get it each morning. We use more recipes and calorie saving techniques from Hungry-Girl than any other source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa talked about her mad scientist laboratory, I mean kitchen, where she mixes and matches low fat and low calorie ingredients to come up with her very own tasty concoctions. Her tips for this Halloween are more&nbsp;candy corn and peeps and less&nbsp;Snickers and Reese's. She also mentioned her tip for using Fiber One as a bread crumb substitute, but you'll have to listen to the show to see how to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Fitness also shared his&nbsp;tips on how to deal with the curve balls life thows you to knock you off your exercise program.&nbsp;Here are Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, start today, do not put off exercising until Next week or New Years.&nbsp;Number 2, Get involved in a team activity. And Number 3, get a partner to watch your back. You need support, everyone does. You will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of Dr Fitness'&nbsp;great exercise tips.</p>
<p>The Fat Guy gave his&nbsp;Sarah Reinersten on the Amazing Race 10 on CBS update.&nbsp;Sadly she and Peter were eliminated. They had finished first the week before, but kept bickering, they got lost and finished well behind the rest of the other teams.&nbsp;She is the triathlete with the fake leg. So this marks the end of the&nbsp;Amazing Race updates.&nbsp;Check out the Amazing Race website here <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race10/"><strong><span style="color: #3333dd;">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race10/</span></strong></a>&nbsp;and Sarah's website here <a href="http://www.iamsarah.org/"><strong><span style="color: #3333dd;">www.iamsarah.org</span></strong></a></p>
<p>Another highlight of this show was the Fat Guy and Dr Fitness arguing over the basketball coaching merits of Red Auerbach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week's bonus is...free books to the top 10 best weight loss success stories from our listeners. Just email us your struggles or your successes and we will send you a free copy of our book "You Can't Lose Weight Alone. The Partner Power Weight Loss Program" if we think they are good enough.

<p>We also had on Hope White-Huff who gave the Doctor an antioxidant scan with her Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner. Dr. Fitness scored 29,000. Lance Armstrong was over 100,000 so the Doctor needs&nbsp;to do some more work. Hope helps people learn what their antioxidant level is so they can improve it by exercising more, eating more fruits and vegetables and using supplements.&nbsp;Her website is <a href="http://www.ksbwellness.mypharmanex.com/"><span style="color: #4182b8;">www.ksbwellness.mypharmanex.com</span></a>.

He said to make sure you get the right shoe for whatever exercise or sport you are doing. Go to a shoe store that has a treadmill or track so that the shoe salesperson can observe your walking or running style in order to suggest the exact right brand and style for you.&nbsp;You'll have to listen to get the rest of the tips.</p>
<p>Why does Dr.Fitness have to always bring up either tennis or soccer on every show, it is driving the Fat Guy nuts. Tonight Dr. Fitness was pining for Andre Agassi. Big deal the guy loses a match in the U.S. Open and says he is retired. Boo Hoo. The Doctor was actually weeping as he talked about it.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/drfitness12182006.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about hotness from one of the hottest actresses to grace our studio, Kathie Larkin. We also got the skinny on how to be skinny from Skinny Bitch author Rory Freedman. Then Lisa Taylor called in to share her tips on how to be a savvy mom.&nbsp; </p>
<p>First we had on Kathie Larkin who gave us a little insight into the modelling and acting world. Kathie has worked for years as a model, an actress, a national spokesperson and is now the dynamic co-host of the &quot;Real Moms, Real Stories, Real Savvy&quot; TV show. But her career almost didn't get off the ground.&nbsp; Very early in she was told by a top NY agent that she wasn't pretty enough, that she didn't have what it took to succeed. Kathie refused to believe that and has achieved so much despite her early rejection. Learn more about Kathie at her website <a href="http://getkathie.com">getkathie.com</a></p>
<p>Rory Freedman, the co-author of the red hot, brutally honest, hilarious diet book Skinny Bitch was our next guest. She really tells it like it is when it comes to losing weight and being skinny. Her book pulls no punches and shares that not so pretty side of looking hot. Check out her website <a href="http://www.skinnybitch.net/">www.skinnybitch.net</a></p>
<p>Lisa Taylor joined us next and classed up the show with her British accent. She is with the &quot;Real Moms, Real Stories, Real Savvy&quot; TV show. Check out the website <a href="http://www.realsavvymoms.com/">www.realsavvymoms.com</a> for more info on the show and learn how you could submit a video and be featured on a future episode. There are also lots of great parenting tips and wisdom at the site.</p>
<p>Dr. Fitness had some really good tips about how to lose weight for the new year. New Year's resolution time is coming and everyone is going to want to pretend to try and lose weight to start 2007.&nbsp;Here a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, cut your portions 25% at every meal. Number 2, do not make all or nothing sacrifices - don't say no more cookies...just eat less.&nbsp;And Number 3, slow down...meals are not a race. There were a lot more detail from Dr. Fitness, so you will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of these&nbsp;great&nbsp;tips. And I'm sure he'll post all the tips on his blog, even the ones we didn't get to tonight.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the&nbsp;Fat Guy's new website <a href="http://www.gymsarearipoff.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.GymsAreARipOff.com</font></a> the Fat Guy thinks that gyms prey upon sedentary people and basically take their money knowing full well that they will stop going to the gym in a matter of weeks. So check out the Fat Guys &quot;Gyms Are A Rip Off&quot; blog and submit your gym horror story. It seems that people are frustrated by the broken promises their gym gave them when they joined and also they are usually disappointed when their hometown gym gets bought out by a large national corporate chain. Service usually goes downhill fast.</p>

			<title>Pedometers Are Now Obsolete. BioTrainer Weight Loss System Works Better. Also Forget Video Games - Speed Stacks Rule This Xmas!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/weightlossradio_12102006_ENTIRE_64.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about two of the hottest&nbsp;gifts for the fitness lover or the weight loss wannabe in your family. </p>
<p>First we had on Patrick Cioffi, Jr from Bio Trainer. Bio Trainer is the new device by Premier Products that will make pedometers obsolete. You see Bio Trainer tracks all your physical activities and then calculates how many calories you burned. Each day you can use their online service and actually know if you gained or lost weight that day. Pretty amazing stuff. Denise Austin has signed on as their official spokesperson so you know it's good. Forget joining a gym this January, buy this product instead and save yourself a fortune. Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy listeners save even more. Just type in the promo code Dr Fitness on the order form and you save big bucks. Bio Trainer is having a special this Holiday season - if you sign up for a year of the online service for $100 they will throw in a free BioTrainer. That saves you about 50 bucks, right there. Check them out at <a href="http://www.biotrainerusa.com/">www.biotrainerusa.com</a> </p>
<p>We also had on Bob Fox the president of Speed Stacks. Speed Stacks is the must have gift for your kid this holiday season. Forget about Playstation 3 or Nintendo Wii, get your kid a set of Speed Stacks and they will love it. The Fat Guys kid has stopped playing with his video game and plays with his Speed Stacks almost everyday. This is a sport that the whole family can play together. It's easy to learn and very addicting. The object is to take the Speed Stack cups and stack&nbsp;3 pyramids with them then immediately unstack them. You have to do this as fast as you can without knocking them over. Sounds easy but when you have the pressure of the ticking clock things get interesting. Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.Youtube.com</a> and search for&nbsp;&quot;sport stacking&quot; or &quot;speed stacks&quot; and you will be blown away at how fast these kids can do this. The sport is called Sport Stacking, it is catching on all over the world, it is even in PE classes around the country and the World Championships have been broadcasted on ESPN. Go to Bob's website <a href="http://www.speedstacks.com/">www.SpeedStacks.com</a> and check them out.</p>
<p>Dr. Fitness had some really good tips about how to Stick to your New Year's Resolution this January.&nbsp;We didn't get to all of them, but here a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, make your goal a top 3 non-negotiable goal.&nbsp;Number 2, make it fun, and tell lots of people about your goal.&nbsp;And Number 3, get a partner to watch your back. They will be there to get you back on your program when you get frustrated or lose interest. There were a lot more detail from Dr. Fitness, so you will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of these&nbsp;great&nbsp;tips. And I'm sure he'll post all the tips on his blog, even the ones we didn't get to tonight.</p>
<p>Another highlight of this show was&nbsp;Fat Guy talking about his new website <a href="http://www.gymsarearipoff.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.GymsAreARipOff.com</font></a> the Fat Guy thinks that gyms prey upon sedentary people and basically take their money knowing full well that they will stop going to the gym in a matter of weeks.

They come in five varieties - mango, pear/caramel, stawberry/banana, blueberry/rasberry and kiwi. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about Hot Moms and Fitness from Hot Moms Club Fitness and Weight Loss Guru&nbsp;Jennifer Nicole Lee. You might remember Jennifer's remarkable story from her appearance on Oprah or CBS Early Morning Show or even Inside Edition. After this amazing woman had her second son she decided to dedicate herself to transforming herself into a supermodel. And she did it. She lost some weight, about 70 pounds. Then she promptly won Ms. Bikini America. Since then she has appeared on countless magazine covers, like FHM, Maxim and more. She even has her own calendar, dvd and is working on a book. She has her own line of swimwear with Fiu Fiu. Hot moms don't come hotter than Jennifer. And what she has done for herself since having her kids is truly inspirational. If you want to learn more about Jennifer&nbsp;head over to the website <a href="http://www.hotmomsclub.com/"><font color="#4182b8">www.HotMomsClub.com</font></a>&nbsp;site and click on Fitness, you'll see her fitness and weight loss tips and articles there.

<p>We also were pleased to have on Louise Wanstall from ExtraPounds.com, her FREE, friendly and informative website has helped thousands of people lose weight and keep it off. She called in from Barcelona, Spain at around one in the morning so we are very grateful. <a href="http://www.extrapounds.com/">www.ExtraPounds.com</a> has proven to help people lose weight due to the vital support members receive from their fellow bloggers on the site. The website is fun and easy to navigate. Each member gets a blog, tracking devices and a fun avatar to help them stay on track. This is a great site for anyone who needs more support and accountablity in the weight loss program and Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy heartily recommend it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Bob Gray from <a href="http://www.FitPod.com">www.FitPod.com</a> also joined us this evening. FitPod is also a free community online for everything fitness and iPod. They are fitness and music enthusiasts who are trying to build the best fitness and music site on the web. One of the funnest things on the site are the fitLists. A fitList is a playlist created for specific fitness or wellness activities. One of the keys to a good fitList is to match the Beats per Minute to the activity. For walking you need music that is around 110 beats per minute, while running you need to be in the 135-150 bpm range.</p>
<p>Dr. Fitness had some really good tips about how to avoid weight gain this Thanksgiving.&nbsp;We didn't get to all of them, but here a&nbsp;few of Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, try to make exercise part of your Turkey Day celebration, maybe a family walk after the meal or a game of football or even do a Turkey Trot in the morning.&nbsp;Number 2, watch the casseroles.&nbsp;And Number 3, watch the alcohol intake.&nbsp;There were a lot more detail from Dr. Fitness, so you will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of these&nbsp;great&nbsp;tips. And I'm sure he'll post all the tips on his blog, even the ones we didn't get to tonight.</p>
<p>Another highlight of this show was&nbsp;Fat Guy talking about his new website <a href="http://www.GymsAreARipOff.com">www.GymsAreARipOff.com</a> the Fat Guy thinks that gyms prey upon sedentary people and basically take their money knowing full well that they will stop going to the gym in a matter of weeks.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about Hot Moms from Hot Moms Club co-founder Jessica Denay. The Hot Moms Club is a fun group dedicated to redefining motherhood. These moms are not your stereotypical &quot;American Mom&quot;. These moms are professionals, unapologetically sexy or simply dynamic women who break the typical mommy mold. Jessica is the mother of a six year old son and she is the author of the Hot Moms Handbook as well as editor of HMC Magazine. The Hot Moms Club has been featured all over the place from the Today Show to the New York Times, to People magazine to CNN. If you want to learn more about Jessica and her group, please head over to her website <a href="http://www.hotmomsclub.com/">www.HotMomsClub.com</a>. Sign up for the club, buy their book, check out the ultrahip Hot Moms Club clothing, listen to &quot;Beautiful Now&quot; the official Hot Moms Club song and most importantly see if there is a Hot Moms Club near you to join. Also be sure to check out Jessica's personal website <a href="http://www.jessicadenay.com/">www.JessicaDenay.com</a> to see what she is up to.</p>
<p>We also were proud to have on Dr. Vic Naumov, the President of The National Coalition For The Advancement of Drug Free Athletics. He talked about the &quot;Choose Not To Use&quot; campaign that Kevin Valluzzi, one of New&nbsp;Jersey's top personal trainers and he are trying to spread the word about.

<p>Dr. Fitness had some really good tips about correct weight lifting techniques to prevent injuries and maximize your results.&nbsp;The Fat Guy's only tip was how to psych out your opponent in tennis by asking him if he exhales or inhales when he serves. Even Dr. Fitness agreed that would probably work on him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, if you are new to strength training be sure to hire a personal trainer to learn the proper form. This will make your future workouts more productive and decrease the chance of you injuring yourself.&nbsp;Number 2, try relaxing uninvolved muscles while working out target muscles. For example, if you are working out your chest, try and relax your legs.&nbsp;And Number 3, balance strength exercises for opposing muscle groups to avoid injury.&nbsp;There were a lot more detail from Dr. Fitness, so you will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of these&nbsp;great&nbsp;tips. </p>
<p>Another highlight of this show was the Fat Guy and Dr Fitness talking about college football. Since Adam went to Rutgers he thinks they are deserving of a National Championship bowl game. All the Fat Guy thinks is that Rutgers should play Boise State for a very special College Championship Game. </p>

			<title>2nd Annual Halloween Calorie Saving Tip Show with The Hungry-Girl, The Nutrition Twins and Oprah Mags' Michael Gonzalez-Wallace</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://weightlossradio.libsyn.com/2nd_annual_halloween_calorie_saving_tip_show_with_the_hungry_girl_the_nutrition_twins_and_oprah_mags_michael_gonzalez_wallace]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about how to survive Halloween without putting on too many extra pounds.&nbsp;This is Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy's 2nd Annual Halloween Calorie Saving Tip Show. Last year we were lucky enough to have Lisa Lillien, the Hungry-Girl on our first Halloween Show and she is back again this year. This year we also pulled some strings and had on Lyssie and Tammy Lakatos, the Nutrition Twins. And for the first time we had on&nbsp;one of New york's best personal trainers, who was recently featured in Oprah's O Magazine, Michael Gonzalez-Wallace.</p>
<p>We started off with Michael telling us about &quot;The Workout That Does It All&quot; this workout strengthens your mind as well as your muscles. It boosts your&nbsp;immune system while burning calorie after calorie. Micheal is a former professional basketball player from Spain who is now taking over New York City with this awesome exercise program. Check out his website <a href="http://www.sportstrengthtraining.com/">www.sportstrengthtraining.com</a>&nbsp;and see clips of his brand new DVDs. You can also learn all about the Neuromuscular Strength Training system he specifically developed to help his clients on the upper East Side of Manhattan. His Upper East Side Workout video was filmed in Central Park so you won't find a more picturesque looking exercise dvd. Micheal lost 9 pounds during the filming of these videos so imagine how much weight you'll lose if you use them a couple times a week. If you mention Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy when you order his exercise dvds Michael will knock off 15% of the purchase price. </p>
<p>Next we were joined by Lyssie and Tammy Lakatos, the Nutrition Twins. They recently were kind of regulars on the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy TV show. They can also be seen all the time on&nbsp;WABC news in New York giving all kinds of nutrition advice, recently they did an extended segment all about Halloween Candy.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's what we talked about tonight on our show. The Nutrition Twins are big fans of Tootsie pops and other lollipops for treats. They also love Adora Calcium Supplements, which can be found at <a href="http://www.adoracalcium.com/">www.AdoraCalcium.com</a>. For some reason, we also talked about tips to help you start gaining weight. Probably because Nicole Richie is in the news struggling with gaining weight. Yeah, her and 3 other people out there.</p>
<p>Please, check out Tammy and Lyssie's&nbsp;website <a href="http://www.nutritiontwins.com/">www.NutritionTwins.com</a>&nbsp;It is filled with lots of great information about losing weight and healthy eating. They will answer your nutrition questions and send you great recipes when you&nbsp;subscribe to their newsletter. &nbsp;You can also get their wonderful book &quot;Fire Up your Metabolism: 9 Proven Principles for Burning Fat and Losing Weight Forever.&quot; </p>
<p>Then last, but certainly not least we had on Lisa Lillien, The Hungry-Girl herself.&nbsp;She has without a doubt the&nbsp;Number 1 email newsletter for hungry girls and hungry boys. Go to <a href="http://www.hungry-girl.com/">www.Hungry-Girl.com</a> check it out and subscribe.&nbsp;It is my wife's favorite newsletter and she can't wait to get it each morning. We use more recipes and calorie saving techniques from Hungry-Girl than any other source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa talked about her mad scientist laboratory, I mean kitchen, where she mixes and matches low fat and low calorie ingredients to come up with her very own tasty concoctions. Her tips for this Halloween are more&nbsp;candy corn and peeps and less&nbsp;Snickers and Reese's. She also mentioned her tip for using Fiber One as a bread crumb substitute, but you'll have to listen to the show to see how to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Fitness also shared his&nbsp;tips on how to deal with the curve balls life thows you to knock you off your exercise program.&nbsp;Here are Dr. Fitness' tips...Number 1, start today, do not put off exercising until Next week or New Years.&nbsp;Number 2, Get involved in a team activity. And Number 3, get a partner to watch your back. You need support, everyone does. You will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of Dr Fitness'&nbsp;great exercise tips. </p>
<p>The Fat Guy gave his&nbsp;Sarah Reinersten on the Amazing Race 10 on CBS update.&nbsp;Sadly she and Peter were eliminated. They had finished first the week before, but kept bickering, they got lost and finished well behind the rest of the other teams.&nbsp;She is the triathlete with the fake leg. So this marks the end of the&nbsp;Amazing Race updates.&nbsp;Check out the Amazing Race website here <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race10/"><strong><font color="#3333dd">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race10/</font></strong></a>&nbsp;and Sarah's website here <a href="http://www.iamsarah.org/"><strong><font color="#3333dd">www.iamsarah.org</font></strong></a></p>
<p>Another highlight of this show was the Fat Guy and Dr Fitness arguing over the basketball coaching merits of Red Auerbach.&nbsp;</p>

			<title>Jami Bernard's Tips On How To Lose Weight While Watching Movies. And Dr. Fitness Gives His Tips On Breaking Out Of A Slump.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/weightlossradio_10222006_ENTIRE_64.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about losing weight from Jami Bernard. Jami was the Film Critic for the New York Daily News. Her latest book is &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Critic: 75 Pounds and Still Counting: My Excellent Adventure in Weight Loss.&quot; Jami bravely chronicled her weight loss in her column in the newspaper. Then wrote her book to summarize all that she learned. Her book is funny, informative and brutally honest. Losing 75 pounds is hard enough, but imagine doing it with New York City watching your every move. That's tough. So a big congrats to Jami for losing the weight and keeping it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; We got to talk to her about some of the crazy diets she tried over they years and what it was that ultimately worked for her. You'll have to listen to the show to find out what her weight loss secret was. You can check out her website <a href="http://www.jamibernard.com/">www.jamibernard.com</a> and buy this book or any of her&nbsp;other books. Be sure to check out&nbsp;her blog, it is filled with insights into the life of a film critic, a best selling author as well as her&nbsp;wonderful weight loss success story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Fitness also shared his&nbsp;tips on what to do if you are in an exercise slump. You know like the one I am perpetually in. Where you just cannot get motivated to move your body. This happens to me quite a bit now that the temperature has dropped into the 40s and 50s. Here are Dr. Fitness' tips to get out of that slump...Number 1, crank up the tunes, listen to music or watch TV, talk on your cell phone...&nbsp;do anything to take your mind off exercising&nbsp;Number 2, schedule time into your exercise program to take breaks, every 6 weeks you should take a week off. And Number 3, get a partner to watch your back. You will slip up, everyone does, you just need someone to get you back on track as soon as possible. You will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of Dr Fitness'&nbsp;great exercise tips. </p>
<p>The Fat Guy forgot to give his&nbsp;Sarah Reinersten on the Amazing Race 10 on CBS update for the second week in a row. She is the triathlete with the fake leg. She and Peter finished 1st in the fifth round and we will be tracking her progress each week on our show.&nbsp;there is definitely trouble in paradise for Sarah's and Peter's relationship. I think they have a better chance on winning the Amazing Race than staying a couple.&nbsp;Check out the Amazing Race website here <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race10/"><strong><font color="#3333dd">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race10/</font></strong></a>&nbsp;and Sarah's website here <a href="http://www.iamsarah.org/"><strong><font color="#3333dd">www.iamsarah.org</font></strong></a></p>
<p>Another highlight of this show was the Fat Guy sharing his recent trip to Burts pumpkin farm and the apple orchards in the North Georgia mountains. </p>
<p>We also talked about Josh, a guy who is a competitive weightlifter who asked us to sponsor his&nbsp;attempt to be on the U.S. Olympic Weightlifting Team. Currently he is ranked 13th in the United States. What do you think, should we sponsor this guy or not. We'll let the listeners decide.</p>
<p>And as a bonus to our listeners here's a link to an article on the best diet and weight loss websites from the Los Angeles&nbsp;Times. I don't know how it happened but the Dr Fitness and the Fat Guy website didn't make the list. It must&nbsp;have been an oversight. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-lean23oct23,1,2604503,print.story?coll=la-headlines-health">http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-lean23oct23,1,2604503,print.story?coll=la-headlines-health</a></p>

<p>On tonight's show,&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about all kinds of tips. Our listeners have been emailing us about having a tip show and we listened to them. There are more weight loss tips on the show then we have ever had. First we had our very own Dr. Fitness give some awesome exercise and fitness tips. Then we brought on Carolyn O'Neil, the best selling author of the Best Health and Nutriton Cookbook (according to the Gourmand people and the World Food Media) titled &quot;The Dish on Eating Healthy and Being Fabulous.&quot; Shape magazine called this book &quot;one of the top 5 diet books you've gotta have.&quot; She couldn't stop talking about&nbsp;all kinds of tips on eating, exercising&nbsp;while talking on the phone, eating&nbsp;out at restaurants, even what adult beverages you should never order at&nbsp;the pool.

<p>Then we had the pleasure of hearing from Dr. Frenesa Hall, a Harvard educated M.D. who left the traditional doctor office behind and goes directly to her patients at their home or their office. That's right she is bringing back the house call. Her company Mobile-Medicine.Net is an innovator&nbsp;in improving the healthcare experience for&nbsp;her patients. Imagine a doctor who will spend as much time as you need going over your illness with you, instead of the 6 minutes they typically give you. Dr. Hall is an amazing doctor and she is truly doing great things. She had some great tips on how to avoid getting the flu or a cold this winter. You can learn more about her and her company at her website <a href="http://www.mobile-medicine.net/">www.mobile-medicine.net</a>.&nbsp;On her website you can get information about her personal services as well as information on the AmeriScience line of supplements that she recommends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Fitness also shared his&nbsp;tips on how to&nbsp;jump start your weight loss program now instead of waiting until New Years.&nbsp;Number 1, make a goal, write it down.&nbsp;Number 2, tell 10 people your goal in order to create some accountability. And Number 3, get a partner to watch your back. You will slip up, everyone does, you just need someone to get you back on track as soon as possible. You will have to listen to the show to find out&nbsp;all the rest of Dr Fitness'&nbsp;great exercise tips. </p>

<p>The Doctor also shared his&nbsp;tips on how to pick the right workout facilty or gym for you. Number 1, it has to be convenient, either on your way to work or one your way home. It shouldn't be more that 15 minutes from your work or home. Number 2, it's got to be clean. Number 3, it has to address your needs. And number 4, you will have to listen to the show to find out that one and all the rest of these great exercise tips. </p>
<p>The Fat Guy gave his&nbsp;Sarah Reinersten on the Amazing Race 10 on CBS update. She is the triathlete with the fake leg. She and Peter finished 1st in the second round and we will be tracking her progress each week on our show. Some of the other contestants are not happy Sarah gets to board planes first or uses her one leggedness to get cabs. But all is fair in love, war and the Amazing Race.

<p>Another highlight of this show was the Doctor sharing how he used to workout at the same gym as his hero Bruce Springsteen. That's right Dr. Fitness used to spot Bruce Sprinsteen, Clarence, Max and the rest of the E Street Band. I think he still has the sweaty bandana&nbsp;the Boss used when he bench pressed during his Born to Run Tour in the 80's.</p>

<p>We also had on Ellen Lau from Zone Diet At Home. Ellen very generously sent the Fat Guy a weeks worth of the Zone Diet food in a effort to have him lose some weight and keep him on this planet for a little longer. The food was awesome. The quality was top notch. The Fat Guy did get a little overwhelmed when the huge box of portion controlled meals and snacks arrived on his doorstep. it took tremenous will power on his opart not to eat the entire box worth of food in one sitting. But overall he was very impressed with the whole operation. The Fat Guy's kid loved the mac and cheese and most of the healthy snacks that were in there, especially the soy bbq chips. They were a big hit for eveyone. to learn more about the Zone Diet at Home program go to their web site <a href="http://www.zonedietathome.com/">www.zonedietathome.com</a>.&nbsp;There are plans that fit every budget and even the pickiest eater.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Fitness&nbsp;made it into the studio tonight so that was kind of a buzz kill for the Fat Guy but he tried to deal with it the best he could. We talked about some weight loss myths like...drinking water will cause you to lose weight (false); calories eaten after 8pm turn straight into fat (false). The Fat Guy tried to exercise last week and got depressed. We also talked a little about September 11 and how the Doctor, because of his intense fear of flying, initially thought&nbsp;the planes were crashing into the Twin Towers because of pilot error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/weightlossradio/weightlossradio_08272006_ENTIRE_64.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet.&quot; Please click on the POD button to listen to the latest Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy show.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>On tonight's show&nbsp;Doctor Fitness and the Fat Guy get the skinny about women and their body image issues from author Leslie Goldman. She wrote the book &quot;Locker Room Diaries: The Naked Truth about Women, Body Image and Re-Imagining the &quot;Perfect&quot; Body.&quot; She was recently a guest on the Today Show and her book has been featured in <br/>People Magazine. Leslie is a health and medical writer for the American Medical Association and a regular contributor for the Chicago Tribune,&nbsp; Health, Marie Claire, Redbook and Self. Some of her stories from the women's locker room were funny and some were a little disturbing. She told us about 14 year old girls getting bikini waxes because a character on the O.C. was getting one. I don't know what's scarier the kid wanting one or the parent taking her to get one. Please go to Leslie's website <a href="http://www.lrdiaries.com/">www.LRDiaries.com</a> and learn more about this eye opening book. In her book and on our radio show Leslie also shares&nbsp;her tips to help young women feel better about their bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a parent of a teenage daughter I highly recommend this book and website.</p>
<p>We also had on Diane Whitman. Diane is currently a business coach with Realized Potential Inc. in Atlanta, GA. &nbsp;Diane was a professional golfer on the LPGA tour. She has been able to take what she learned playing golf at the highest level and transfer some of the lessons in order to help businesses grow and realize their fullest potential. Diane's website is <a href="http://www.realizedpotentialinc.com/">www.realizedpotentialinc.com</a> and it is filled with info about her as well as tips and other good stuff. </p>
<p>Once again SuperCop Sean visited. Tonight's Sean&nbsp;highlight occured when he tried to explain the benfits of carrying pepper spray while you jog. Just make sure that any wind is blowing on the&nbsp;bad guy when you spray him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Doctor also shared his&nbsp;tips on how to get out of an exercise slump and get&nbsp; back on your program again. I think these were his best tips in a long time.&nbsp;He said to start right away - don't put off exercising until that infamous Monday morning - start right this minute - or when you're done reading this blog entry.&nbsp;He gave several other tips including watching &quot;Rocky&quot; which is his favorite movie but&nbsp;you'll have to listen to get the rest of the tips.</p>
<p>The fat guy shared a story about going to the dermatologist to get a lesion removed from his face. The doctor and Super Cop Sean made sure to tease the fat guy about the thing on his face.

            <description><![CDATA[Please click on the pod button to your left to listen to this weeks Dr. Fitness and the Fat Guy podcast, the funniest weight loss and fitness radio show on the internet. Our new and improved podcast has no commercials. This week Doctor Fitness gives you the skinny on separating fact from fiction when it comes to As Seen On Tv weight loss and exercise gadgets. Here's 3 of the Doctor's tips to avoid being ripped off by those late night infomercials.#1. The cost of these products are too little. A commercial quality treadmill at a gym costs from $4000 to $5000. $1000 sounds like a lot of money for a product from TV but when it comes to this kind of exercise equipment it really isn't that much. #2. Don't buy any piece of equipment without trying it out. That way you'll see if it's sturdy and if it will fit your body. #3. Don't believe the hype. those models demonstrating the product didn't get that way by using that product.
