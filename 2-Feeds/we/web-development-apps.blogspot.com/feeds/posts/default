The company has tied up with government-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited to launch the tablet in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wi-Fi version of the iPad will be priced between Rs 26,000 and Rs 33,000,&amp;nbsp; while the 3G+Wi-Fi version will be priced between Rs 33,000 and Rs 44,000. Both versions will come in three capacities, 16GB, 32GB and 64GB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India has never been the most important market for Apple so it has always delayed its India launch. It is finally launching in India when there are already rumours of the iPad 2 launch just few months away.&lt;br /&gt;The big question is will iPad really woo Indian techies?&amp;nbsp; We don't think so. At a time when the market is flooded with tablets from &lt;a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=123jvogm0/**http%3A//www.engadget.com/2010/09/02/samsung-galaxy-tab-preview/" target="_blank" title="tab"&gt;Samsung,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=11r108ref/**http%3A//www.engadget.com/2010/06/06/dell-streak-review/" target="_blank" title="dell streak"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=140t6b9aa/**http%3A//timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Enter-Adam-the-iPad-killer-made-in-India/articleshow/5570642.cms" target="_blank" title="notion ink"&gt;Notion Ink&lt;/a&gt;, iPad doesn't give the customers anything different. Little wonder that in India, iPhone hasn't been a best seller yet.&amp;nbsp; At best, the device might eat into Apple's iPod touch sales compared to other branded PC sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its reputation preceding it, it has already evoked price-cuts from rivals - the Samsung Galaxy Tab, for instance, is now available at Rs 29,500, down from the launch price of Rs 36,499.&lt;br /&gt;However, the android bug is rather big in India. So will have to wait and see if the iPad can outdo the Android.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/iPad-finally-India-yahoofinancein-3234226421.html"&gt;Yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1234654929448774513-8843675712871822382?l=web-development-apps.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://web-development-apps.blogspot.com/feeds/8843675712871822382/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://web-development-apps.blogspot.com/2011/01/ipad-is-finally-here-in-india.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1234654929448774513/posts/default/8843675712871822382'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/1234654929448774513/posts/default/8843675712871822382'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://web-development-apps.blogspot.com/2011/01/ipad-is-finally-here-in-india.html' title='iPad is finally here in India!'/><author><name>Web Development</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05864207885056732352</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_630BX4U8ZMY/TUOaOzkLzHI/AAAAAAAAABA/A_qtTNQk1Qg/s72-c/ipad.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1234654929448774513.post-5683295837680317847</id><published>2010-12-17T22:06:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2010-12-17T22:08:59.928-08:00</updated><title type='text'>J2EE Web Application Development</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKJYMj7TWqB6FM1CGFix9Ej33jr8jZu9U-B2HRCRWGSjQJBz1y" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKJYMj7TWqB6FM1CGFix9Ej33jr8jZu9U-B2HRCRWGSjQJBz1y" border="0" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKJYMj7TWqB6FM1CGFix9Ej33jr8jZu9U-B2HRCRWGSjQJBz1y" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Over the recent years, J2EE web application development has became huge successful amongst end users and web developers.

There are lessons that we can learn from those who have blazed the trails before us, and those who have been burned by the blaze. Get your fingers ready to count the five fundamental considerations for implementing new technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_630BX4U8ZMY/TO995zinFEI/AAAAAAAAAAU/BOeaoLgJSKE/s1600/web_+development_1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_630BX4U8ZMY/TO995zinFEI/AAAAAAAAAAU/BOeaoLgJSKE/s200/web_+development_1.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we learned from Oracle &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The original plan was to transition the existing IT infrastructure to Oracle over a period of three months. It is three years later, and we think that we are almost done with our Oracle implementation." Does this sound familiar? if so, you have plenty of good company. Oracle is a powerful engine. It is high octane, scalable, and has flexible object oriented architecture to allow continuous growth and integration. So, what went wrong? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite often, in the eager anticipation to install the latest and greatest engine, the other parts of the car were forgotten or overlooked. Sure you have a powerful new engine, but your steering wheel is gone. It was replaced by a series of point and click drop down boxes to precisely instruct the car to turn at a specific angle. Do you want to make a 30 degree turn, a forty degree turn, or a 90 degree turn, right or left? Simply choose the appropriate item from the drop down menu and you will have the exact turn that you desire. &lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gone is that old fashioned and inaccurate steering wheel that required manual intervention and guidance to gradually adjust the turn in process, and installed is the precision turning device that is managed by your mouse. The problem is, nobody mentioned that the new steering mechanism was sold separately, and would take another six months to program. Nobody mentioned that everyone responsible for driving the car would have to learn a new steering methodology, lose the ability to make manual adjustments along the way, and need to learn to be more predictive and accurate in the selection of the accurate turn. Adjustments can be made along the way to correct a turn, with more point and click menu selections, if necessary. The extra time, design and development costs, and employee training are sold separately. You see, Oracles sells that powerful engine, not the steering wheel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does that sound funny or familiar? If it sounds familiar, then the humor is bitter-sweet. If it sounds ridiculous, then you have not experienced it yet. The steering wheel is only one example. Once the steering mechanism is programmed and put into place, then the other discoveries begin. That powerful engine comes with a speedometer and tachometer, so you can see your performance and the RPM of the engine. Isn't is exciting to see that you have only partially tapped into the incredible power of this magnificent Oracle engine? Unfortunately, if you rely on other dashboard devices like signals for turns, air conditioning, or a radio, then you have to build these things yourself. After all, the engineers of the engine realize that you turn on different roads than everyone else, you have personal preferences for your climate controls, and you have personal preferences for terrestrial or Sirius satellite radio stations. Therefore, you need to build the point and click objects, menus, and radio buttons to accommodate your personal preferences, and all the possible variations thereof.
