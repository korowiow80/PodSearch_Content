<itunes:summary>Evolutionary Astrologer, Medium, and Channel Tom Jacobs answers listeners\&#039; questions about their lives, stepping into their birth charts from the perspective of evolutionary astrology (EA), an approach based in free will, choice and self-responsibility. Tom will show individuals how to unravel their own karma, which is to say beliefs about what\&#039;s happening, and see how to change their lives for the better. He also aims to educate about what karma really is, and guide listeners into the dynamic view into astrology and people that EA offers.
Send questions for Tom to answer during future podcasts at karma@tdjacobs.com.
See http://tdjacobs.com for more info on his work, to book a private consultation, or to order a Lilith or 2012 natal report.</itunes:summary>
