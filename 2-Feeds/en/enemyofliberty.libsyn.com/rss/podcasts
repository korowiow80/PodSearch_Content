Our seventh episode focuses on the Bonus Army demonstrations occurring in Washington, D.C. in 1932. The Bonus Army was a group of unemployed and destitute World War 1 veterans who traveled to Washington, D.C. during the Spring and Summer of 1932 to conduct peaceful demonstrations in an effort to convince the United States Government to proceed with paying World War 1 veterans their promised combat service pay. The efforts of the veterans were rewarded with armored tanks, tear gas, fixed bayonets and drawn sabres as American troops and tanks were used in an assault against the veterans and their families occurring on July 28, 1932.

In 1932, the United States Public Health Service began a study to record the natural progression of syphilis in black males. After an effective medical treatment for syphilis was discovered in the mid-1940&rsquo;s, those government officials in charge of the Tuskegee&nbsp;Experiment chose to prevent the participants of the study from receiving the new medical treatment and took exhaustive steps to insure that the study participants would never know about the available medical treatment or understand the extent of their roles in the study. The government concealed the facts from the study participants and the general public for over thirty years, and it was not until 1972 that the nation learned the truth about the infamous Tuskegee Experiment.

Our fourth episode reviews a truly dark chapter in our nation&rsquo;s history. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, many state governments enacted laws that granted government officials the power to sterilize human beings without their consent. Under such laws (commonly referred to as &ldquo;eugenical sterilization laws&rdquo;), literally tens of thousands of citizens (including large numbers of people with physical and mental disabilities) were sterilized against their will in hospitals, mental facilities&nbsp;and prisons located throughout the country. Even more surprising is the fact that such compulsory sterilizations continued in our country in large numbers&nbsp;through the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s.

Our third episode focuses on an obscure event in American History that is virtually unknown to most citizens. In the early 1940's in the rural mining town of Copperhill, Tennessee, several union miners were deprived of their constitutional rights and liberties at the hands of federal, state and local law enforcement officials during a hotly contested labor union strike occurring on the eve of America's involvement in the Second World War.
