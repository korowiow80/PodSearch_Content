Arup engineers became convinced of the global threat of human-motivated climate change because its environmental physics team did a detailed review of the science and its validity. They say climate change will potentially affect everything the firm does. In a "drivers of change" project, Luebkeman embarked on 30 months of global workshops involving thousands of people in and out of the firm. One result was a boxed card set giving facts and figures on social, technical and economic issues. Arup has sold thousands of the sets in 15 countries for about $40 each.</description><author>enr_web_editors@mcgraw-hill.com</author><category>Sustainability</category><enclosure url="http://ripple.radiotail.com/74/chrisL-jlt-1.mp3" length="" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">{b5da73a7-e9a7-81fd-8d08-ea1e534585b2}</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2007 16:50:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Embracing Change at Caltrans:  A Discussion with Will Kempton, director of the California Dept. of Transportation</title><link>http://enr.construction.com/people/multimedia/podcasts/2007/070203.asp</link><description>Caltrans has had a reputation among contractors as a difficult agency to work for, with lack of communication and efficiency.

Akron, Ohio, is working on a trendier image by using an international starchitect for its art museum expansion. The project is the first public building in the U.S. by the Austrian firm Coop Himmelb(l)au.

The museum carries a signature design element, a “roof cloud,” which the architectural theorists and practitioners use “to help buildings escape from their sense of weightiness and gravity,” says museum director Mitchell D. Kahan. The 300-ft-long roof armature unites the new glass-enclosed entry pavilion, called the “crystal,” and the box-shaped new galleries with the 19th Century existing building.</description><author>enr_web_editors@mcgraw-hill.com</author><category>Engineering</category><enclosure url="http://www.radiotail.com/rt/cast/1632/enr-wolf_prix.mp3" length="" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">{86fbb3ba-be4c-19ec-a72c-7016897fd8ce}</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2006 20:46:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Charlotte Revs Up:  A Conversation with Mecklenburg County Commissioner Parks Helms</title><link>http://enr.construction.com/people/multimedia/podcasts/2006/061024.asp</link><description>Parks Helms, current and five-time chairman of the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners, provides his insights on one of Charlotte's biggest building booms.</description><author>scott_judy@mcgraw-hill.com</author><category>Construction</category><enclosure url="http://www.radiotail.com/rt/cast/1483/enr5_-_charlotte_revs_up.mp3" length="" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">{79a55cb6-78c6-9507-bad7-cc258bff5388}</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2006 21:09:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Planes, Pains and Payments:  The Roundtable Discussion</title><link>http://www.enr.com/features/transportation/archives/061021.asp</link><description>ENR and Aviation Week co-sponsored Planes, Pains and Payments, an aviation roundtable, on Oct. 6. Almost 30 aviation officials representing federal agencies, airports, vendors, consultants and contractors discussed the crucial challenges facing them now and in the future. Shrinking budgets coupled with increasing infrastructure needs to handle security and traffic demands are requiring all sectors to look for ways to increase revenue and build better, smarter and cheaper.

New developments loom on the taxiway that will affect all American airports. From the FAAs Next Generation Airport Transportation Systems program to microjets, from alternative project delivery solutions to privatization, all involved with operating and expanding airports must be prepared. In-line baggage screening systems, new runways and common-use facilities present ongoing challenges. Branding of airports, concessions planning and parking all present possibilities for revenue. Many called for a change in the policy on passenger facility charges, a crucial factor in current funding of capital programs. </description><author>enr_web_editors@mcgraw-hill.com</author><category>Engineering</category><enclosure url="http://www.radiotail.com/rt/cast/5617/rtgroup2finalfile.mp3" length="" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">{f134d7b-64d0-fc8d-e621-b98c922db598}</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2006 23:23:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Planes, Pains and Payments: A Roundtable Discussion on Rescreening Canadian Transfer Bags in the U.S.</title><link>http://www.enr.com/people/multimedia/podcasts/061021-canada.asp</link><description> The Oct. 6 aviation roundtable sponsored by ENR and Aviation Week highlighted some of the key issues facing airport builders and planners today.

The multi-market prime contractor had $3.33 billion in 2005 revenue, up 27% from 2004, and sailed into 2006 with a $4.19-billion backlog, up from $2.2 billion in 2002.

Last year, PCL picked up 552 new hires, which represents 26.7% of its total salaried staff. In 2002, PCL only hired 182 people, which accounted for 11.2% of its staff at the time. In 2006, PCL expects to take on at least as many people as it did in 2005.

While PCL occasionally has sought to increase its market share through acquisitionspicking up an industrial and a power-market contractor in recent years, its preferred path to growth is to hire new staff, says Peter Greene, PCLs vice president of professional development. The companys favorite targets are recent graduates. They learn the PCL culture more quickly and are less likely to carry ingrained bad habits, such as adversarial attitudes toward clients, says Greene. </description><author>enr_web_editors@mcgraw-hill.com</author><category>Engineering</category><enclosure url="http://www.enr.construction.com/people/multimedia/podcasts/mm/060707-korman-pcl.mp3" length="" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">{d970877c-afe5-2cc6-117b-3f961577ea6}</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2006 23:36:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Future of the Interstate: An Interview with Gene McCormick: The Future of the Interstate</title><link>http://enr.construction.com/people/multimedia/podcasts/2006/060614.asp</link><description>Addressing topics such as the future of the gas tax and the issue of "earmarked" projects, Gene McCormick, chairman of the American Road &amp; Transportation Builders Association, talks about the future of the Interstate Highway System.</description><author>scott_judy@mcgraw-hill.com</author><category>Construction</category><enclosure url="http://www.radiotail.com/rt/cast/1037/enr4_mccormick.mp3" length="" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">{606341d1-1fda-cb42-4675-7017107f1455}</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2006 21:25:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Today's Infrastructure Challenges: An Interview with General Barry R.

What could be a foundation for a comprehensive regional flood control program, a proposal called Coast 2050, is now being considered by Congress as part of a new water resources bill. 

Listen to the debate about how the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina could accelerate long-stalled flood control projects and even change longstanding national policy. </description><author>enr_web_editors@mcgraw-hill.com</author><category>Engineering</category><enclosure url="http://www.radiotail.com/podcasts/enr/enr1-flood_protection_after_katrina.mp3" length="" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">{67f5153a-1e1f-91a9-114f-5a40e801637}</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2005 23:13:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
