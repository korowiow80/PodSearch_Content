한글날

안녕하세요. 
KoreanClass101.com 여러분! 줄리아입니다.
오늘은 특별히 조금 더 뜻 깊은 주제를 소개해 드리고 싶은 마음에 10월 9일, ‘한글날’에 대해 이야기해 나가려고 합니다. 
한글날은 세종대왕의 한글 반포를 기념하고 한글의 우수성을 선양하며 나아가서는 한글의 연구, 보급을 장려하기 위해서 정한 날입니다. 
한글날에는 한글 바르게 쓰기 대회, 맞춤법 대회 등의 한글과 관련된 여러 가지 행사를 하며 기념을 하고 있답니다.

여러분은 이미 아실 거라 생각하지만 다시 한번 한글의 유래를 살펴보겠습니다. 
조선 시대, 백성이 글을 읽지 못해 그들의 목소리를 낼 수 없다는 것에 안타까움을 느낀 세종대왕은 집현전을 만들고 집현전의 학자들과 우리나라 말을 오랫동안 연구한 끝에 만들어진 언어가 훈민정음입니다. 
백성의 목소리를 듣기 위해 만들어진 훈민정음은 말 그래도 백성을 가르치는 바른 소리라는 뜻입니다. 
이 훈민정음은 한글이란 이름으로 일반화되었고요. 
한글은 ‘한’이란 겨레의 글, ‘한’이란 나라의 글, 곧 ‘우리나라의 글’이란 뜻이라고 합니다. 
기본 자음 14자, 기본 모음 10자로 구성되며 이 24자로 만들 수 있는 글자가 무궁무진하답니다. 
과학성, 합리성, 독창성을 다 가지고 있는 한글은 세계 언어 학자들 사이에서 최고의 문자로 찬양받고 있답니다. 

지금 제가 이렇게 글을 쓸 수 있고 말을 할 수 있다는 것은 세종대왕의 한글 창제가 없었다면 상상도 할 수 없는 일이었을 것입니다. 
내 나라의 언어가 있다는 것 자체가 정말 감사해야 할 일이며, 한글날을 통해 많은 사람들이 이러한 마음을 되새길 수 있었으면 좋겠네요. 
지금까지 블로그를 쓰면서 최대한 많은 한국의 문화를 여러분께 알려드리기 위해 힘써 왔지만 제한된 공간이기에 쉽지 않았던 것 같습니다. 
조금이나마 여러분들께 도움이 되었기를 바라며 여기에서 줄리아의 블로그는 막을 내리겠습니다. 

그 동안 들어주셔서 대단히 감사 드립니다.   

^o^줄리아에게 말해봐!
여러분의 언어는 어떻게 창조되었나요?

Hangul Day
Hello, all in KoreanClass101.com! It's Julia.
Today, to introduce you some special topics, I would like to talk about Hangul Day on October ninth. 
Hangul Day is a day designated for commemorating King Sejong's proclamation of Hangul, boosting the superiority of Hangul, and promoting the research and spread of Hangul.
On Hangul Day, there are celebrating events related to Hangul, such as proper-Hangul-usage competitions and spelling competitions. 

I think you probably know about it already, but I will again explain the origin of Hangul. 
The King Sejong, who found out Korean people couldn't make their voice heard clearly because they couldn't read, set up Giphyeonjeon to study its own language for a long time with scholars, and they introduced &quot;HunminJeongeum.&quot;
&quot;HunminJeongeum&quot; was invented to listen to what people say, and literally it means &quot;the right language as teaching the people.&quot; This language has been known as &quot;Hangul&quot; generally. &quot;Hangul&quot; means the language of people and nation, which also means the language of the whole country. 
It is composed of fourteen basic consonants and ten basic vowels, and these twenty-four letters can make various set of words.
A scientific, rational, and innovative language, Hangul has been praised as the best language by linguists around the world. 
I cannot imagine me writing and speaking in Korean if Hangul had not been invented by King Sejong.
We should think that about the fact that we have our own language, and I wish many people can remember the meaning on Hangul Day.
So far, I have been doing my best to introduce Korean culture to all of you. However, I think it was not easy because of the limited space.
As I am hoping that I have helped you so far, I would like to make an end of the Julia's blogs. 

Thank you for your listening. 

^o^ Talk to Julia!
When and how was your language created?

앵커: 며칠째 내린 강한 비바람으로 인해 산동산에 산사태가 일어났습니다. 
박대기 기자가 전해드립니다.
기자: 오늘 오전 9시, 산동산에서 산사태가 일어났습니다. 
도로와 집들이 진흙에 덮였습니다. 
16명이 목숨을 잃었고 3명이 실종되었습니다. 
대피한 시민들은 망연자실한 표정입니다. 산사태에서 대피한 시민 중 한 명의 이야기를 들어보겠습니다.
인터뷰: 3년 전부터 아파트단지 건설 현장에서 작은 산사태들은 있었어요. 
시 당국에 그렇게 이야기를 했었지만 결국 이렇게 되었네요.
시 당국은 이번 산사태는 강한 비때문이라고 밝혔습니다. 
하지만 주민들은 이미 몇달 전부터 이상징후가 있어 시에 신고했지만, 아무런 대책이 없었다고 주장하고 있습니다. 
주민들은 이번 산사태가 시의 관리 책임때문이라고 지적했습니다. 
주민들과 서울시의 주장이 팽팽히 맞선 가운데 당분간 첨예한 의견대립이 있을 것으로 전망됩니다. 
NBS뉴스 박대기입니다.

김팀장: 이번 신제품 프리젠테이션 준비는 잘 돼가?
이대리: 그게.. 사실 다음 기회에 프리젠테이션해도 괜찮을까요? 이번 말고 다음에요.
김팀장: 왜? 무슨 일 있어? 
이대리: 그게.. 제가 무대공포증이 있거든요. 프리젠테이션하려고 사람들 앞에 나가기만 하면 손에 땀이 흥건할 정도로 긴장을 해요. 대학때부터 친구들이 도와주려고 노력했지만 정말 다들 두 손 두 발 들고 포기했었어요.
김팀장: 지난번 프리젠테이션은 잘 했잖아.
이대리: 그 땐 사실 긴장을 없애려고 술을 조금 마셨어요. 그래서 프리젠테이션에 대한 기억이 없어요. 필름이 끊겼었거든요.
김팀장: 그 정도야..? 심각한데? 그렇다고 언제까지 프리젠테이션에 손도 안 댈 수는 없잖아. 게다가 우리팀에 손도 부족하고.. 
이대리: 죄송합니다. 이번 한 번만 부탁드릴게요.
김팀장: 알았어 생각해볼게. 근데 TV에 저건 무슨 뉴스야? 비가 많이 오더니 물난리라도 난 건가?

Kim: How's the presentation preparation going?
Lee: About that...could I do the presentation next time? Not this time, but next?
Kim: Why? What's going on? 
Lee: You see...I have stage fright. Whenever I stand in front of people, sweat starts pouring from my hands—that's how nervous I get. My friends have tried to help me with this since college, but they've given up (literally, &quot;raised their hands and feet&quot;).
Kim: But you gave a good presentation last time.
Lee: Actually, I had some alcohol before that one to calm my nerves. So I can't remember anything about it. It's like I blacked out (literally, &quot;my film got cut&quot;).
Kim: It's that big of a problem? Seems serious. Even so, you can't avoid presentations forever (literally, &quot;You'll have to put your hands on a presentation.&quot;). Our team's short on manpower as it is.
Lee: I'm sorry. Please excuse me this one time.
Kim: OK, I'll consider it. Anyway, what's the news about on TV? Flooding due to heavy rain this morning?

추석

안녕하세요. 
KoreanClass101.com 여러분! 줄리아입니다.
한국의 가장 큰 명절, 한가위 추석에 대해 이야기해 보겠습니다. 
추석은 음력 8월 15일로 한 해 농사의 결실을 거두고 햇곡식, 햇과일로 조상님께 차례를 지내며 그 해에 대해 감사의 마음과 다음 해의 풍년을 기원하는 마음을 전하는 날입니다. 
일년 중 가장 풍족한 시간일 뿐만 아니라 사람들의 마음도 풍족해 지는 날이지요. 
우리 선조들은 강강술래, 줄다리기, 씨름 등의 민속 놀이를 하며 축제를 즐겼다고 합니다. 
여기에서 강강술래에 대해 살짝 설명해 드릴게요. 
강강술래는 수십 명의 부녀자들이 밝은 달빛 아래에서 손에 손을 잡고 원을 둥글게 만들고 춤을 추는 놀이를 말합니다.

추석이 오기 전에 해야 할 일이 있습니다. 
여름 동안 무성하게 자란 잡초를 베어 주는 작업인 '벌초'입니다. 
벌초를 하는 이유는 자손으로서의 도리, 효성을 나타내는 하나의 방법이지요. 
저희 집의 경우에는 추석이 다가오기 몇 주전, 작은 아버지들과 저희 아버지가 조상의 무덤에 가셔서 벌초를 하십니다. 
그리고 추석이 되면 설날 아침처럼 차례를 지내고 성묘를 갑니다. 
앞서 말씀 드렸듯이 추석에는 그 해에 거두어드린 곡식으로 송편과 음식을 만듭니다. 

설날과 추석은 일년 중 가장 큰 명절입니다. 
명절은 친척들 모두 모여 앉아서 도란도란 이야기도 하고, 게임도 하고, 즐거운 시간을 보낼 수 있기에 항상 기다려집니다. 
오늘은 추석에 대해 살펴 보았습니다. 
다음 시간까지 안녕히 계세요.  

^o^줄리아에게 말해봐!
여러분의 나라에서는 대표적인 명절이 언제인가요?

Chuseok

Hello. 
All in KoreanClass101.com! It's Julia.
We are going to talk about the biggest holiday in Korea, Hangawi or Chuseok. 
Chuseok is on August fifteenth of the lunar calendar. On the day, people harvest all the crops; have memorial rites for our ancestors with the newly harvested grains and fruits; and thank them for the year, wishing good luck for the following year.
It is not only the most fruitful time of the entire year, but also it is the time that people feel full of happiness.
It is said that our ancestors enjoyed the festivals by playing folk games such as &quot;Gang-gangsullae,&quot; tug-of-war, wrestling, etc.
I will be explaining &quot;Gang-gangsullae&quot; briefly.
&quot;Gang-gangsullae&quot; refers to a game with a lot of women dancing in a circle, holding hands under the bright moonlight.

There are things to be done before Chuseok comes.
It is the &quot;Beolcho,&quot; the task of chopping weeds that have grown thickly in the summer.
We do &quot;Beolcho&quot; because it is the way to express filial piety as a duty.
In the case of my family, a few weeks before Chuseok, my uncle and father went to the ancestral graves and did &quot;Beolcho.&quot;
Then, on the Chuseok day, we had ancestral rites like we did on the morning of Seolnal and went to the graves.
As I said before, on Chuseok, Songpeyeon and foods are made with the grains harvested of the year.

Seolnal and Chuseok are the biggest holidays during the year.
On holidays, all relatives are gathering next to each other, having casual conversations and games. That is what I am always waiting for. 
Today we have talked about Chuseok. 
Good-bye until next time.

^o^ Talk to Julia!
When are the important holidays in your country?

이대리: 아니 그게 아니고.. 저 옆 팀에 있는 유리씨랑 사귀고 있었잖아요.
김팀장: 응. 그런데?
이대리: 지난 주에 유리씨랑 회사 근처 커피숍에서 데이트하고 있는데 옆팀 마당발 소희씨가 그 장면을 봐 버렸어요.
김팀장: 아, 소희씨 유명하지. 입이 가벼워서 하늘을 둥둥 떠다닌다는.
이대리: 그러니까요. 그래서 단단히 입단속 부탁했죠. 그랬더니 소희씨가 입이 심심하다며 저한테 저녁을 사달라는 거에요. 저녁 같이 먹으면서 입이 닳도록 입단속 부탁했어요.
김팀장: 저녁밥이 별로 맛이 없었나보네.
이대리: 네? 무슨 뜻이세요?
김팀장: 이미 소문 다 퍼졌어. 오늘 출근하는데 옆팀 팀장이 이야기하더라구. 이대리랑 유리씨랑 사귄다고. 
이대리: 아 정말요? 그렇게 여러번 입단속을 부탁했는데. 왜 우리 회사에는 입이 무거운 사람이 아무도 없는거죠?

Kim: Wow, it's raining so much. It wasn't easy to coming to work.
Lee: Team Manager. We have a big problem.
Kim: What happened? Have we been beaten by the competition (literally, &quot;drunk water&quot;) again?
Lee: No, see...I've been dating Yuri from the next team over.
Kim: Yes, so?
Lee: Last week, I was on a date with her at a coffee shop near the office, and we were spotted by Sohee, who knows everyone (literally, &quot;has flat feet&quot;).
Kim: Ah, Sohee's famous. She's quite the rumor-monger (literally, &quot;her mouth's so light that it floats in the sky&quot;).
Lee: That's what I'm saying. Well, I asked her not to tell anyone (literally, &quot;to lock her mouth&quot;). So she asked me to buy her dinner because she was feeling hungry (literally, &quot;her mouth was bored&quot;). Over dinner, I begged her over and over (literally, &quot;wore out our mouths&quot;) not to tell.
Kim: Looks like that dinner wasn't tasty enough.
Lee: Huh? What do you mean?
Kim: Everyone knows the story now. Sohee's team leader told me this morning that you and Yuri are dating. 
Lee: Oh, seriously? Even though I asked her so many times! Is there no one here who can keep a secret (literally, &quot;whose mouth is heavy&quot;)?
