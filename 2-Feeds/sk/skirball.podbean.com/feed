			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine yourself immersed in a favorite childhood tale. Five years in the making and occupying an 8,000-square-foot gallery, Noah&#8217;s Ark at the Skirball welcomes children and families to take this journey together. Inspired by the ancient flood story, which has parallels in diverse cultures around the world, this one-of-a-kind new destination invites visitors of all generations to have fun—and to connect with one another, learn the value of community, and help build a better world.</p>
<p>Inside a floor-to-ceiling wooden ark, filled to the rafters with whimsical animals, you and your family will play, build, climb, explore, collaborate, and more. Conduct a storm, help construct the ark, and bask in the glow of a beautiful rainbow. Mingle with hundreds of fanciful animals—from cuddly companions to life–sized puppets—all crafted from recycled materials and everyday objects, including bottle caps, bicycle parts, baseball mitts, croquet balls, mop heads, and rear-view mirrors.</p>
<p> Unique to the Noah&#8217;s Ark experience are impromptu &#8220;happenings,&#8221; surprise interactions, and drop-in activities. While visiting the galleries, meet a puppet, create a take-home art project, or hear a story. Complete your visit by experiencing the outdoor rainbow mist in the arroyo park just outside the galleries.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Ongoing through August 9, 2009</h4>
<h6>ADMISSION: Included with Museum admission (tickets at the door): $10 General; $7 Seniors and Full-Time Students; $5 Children 2–12; Free to Members and Children under 2; Free to all on Thursdays!</h6>
<p>Through never-before exhibited art and objects culled from private and institutional collections, <em>ZAP! POW! BAM! The Superhero: The Golden Age of Comic Books, 1938-1950</em> explores the genesis of cultural icons such as <strong>Superman, Batman, Captain Marvel,</strong> and <strong>Wonder Woman</strong>. In the midst of the economic and political turmoil of the 1930s and 1940s, comic books offered America champions who shaped the values of an entire generation. <em>ZAP! POW! BAM!</em> examines the creative processes and influences that drove young Jewish artists to express their talents through the storylines and art of comic books. The exhibition features rare vintage artwork and books, 1940s Hollywood movie serials, and colorful interactive displays including a drawing studio, a newsstand, a vintage <strong>Batmobile </strong>ride, and stations that allow children to dress up as Superheroes or transform themselves via a quick costume change in a telephone booth. Guest curator Jerry Robinson brings a long history as a comic book industry insider to the exhibition. Working with<strong> Batman</strong> co-creators Bob Kane and Bill Finger, Robinson named Robin, Batman&#8217;s young protégé. Robinson also co-created <strong>The Joker,</strong> Batman&#8217;s nemesis and one of the first Super-Villains.

		<itunes:summary>We are here today with Yatrika Shah-Rais and she is here to tell us about the first of the series of concerts at the Skirball Cultural Center on July 17, 2008 Tcheka. Welcome Yatrika.

Hi. How are you Rich? Well tell us a little bit about the Summer Series you have at the Skirball.

The “Summer Series” are yearly. We have had them ever since the Skirball opened and we are well into our twelfth year and they are a free series every Thursday night in the months of July and August that feature music really from around the globe. The first concert is on July 17, 2008. All of the concerts by the way start at 8pm and the doors open at 7pm. So the first concert is Tchecka and he is a singer, songwriter from the archipelago of Cape Verde which is off the West Coast of Africa and Tcheka is an up and coming young musician who is fantastic. I mean, you have to watch him play. He is a wizard on the guitar and had really breathed new music into the music if Cape Verde because what he does is takw the rhythms of the Batuki which is a style of music traditionally played by women in Cape Verde and he transposes them to the guitar. So although he has influences from the Western Styles of Music and various other styles of Cape Verde he has really tried to keep the music more Cape Verde and more Africanized.

Please join us on Thursday, July 17th, 2008 at the Skirball Cultural Center for the first in the series of their free Summer Concerts – Tcheka. Concert starts at 8pm, doors open at 7pm and once again the admission is free. Hope to see you there!</itunes:summary>
