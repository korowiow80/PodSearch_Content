      <title>Adam and Eve.com Product Reviews, Vol. 3 - 18&quot; Double Dong!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1124570/600x600_1232594.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If for whatever reason you missed the first product review featuring LaRin Lane and her glorious Oh's and Ah's, this is a good show to start your love and worship of Skeet and Big Sexy, and oh yeah, the show. Just seeing her hold this monstrosity of a Dong was sexy as hell. Kind of a shame though seeing as she only used about 4 inches of it. She promised after the show, next time around she'll bring a friend to &quot;pick up the slack.&quot; And/Or double penetrate it! Good times.</description>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1124570/600x600_1547065.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the latest in our world renowned series of Chick Lists where we hip you to the world of beautiful and sexy women that you'll never touch, but you'll sure as hell jack to. Today's installment focuses on the hot chicks of yesteryear that you probably developed your stroke to. Girls like Pamela Anderson and Madonna who you worshiped as a teen, but now that you're getting older, you realize that they've gotten older with you, and it hasn't agreed with most of them. So sit back, relax, and enjoy your boys walk through former hotness and as always, if you have any names we missed, let us know. Also, with this show of the veterans comes a potential show of the Rookies so send us your up and coming names in the world of hotness too! We know you pervs have a couple secret bitches up your jack sleeves.</description>

      <itunes:summary>First things first, Skeet and Big Sexy have absolutely nothing against gay people in any way whatsoever, especially lesbians, but this episode shines a light on the apparent blurring of the gender lines that is running rampant in the Good Ol' US of A. Between manicures and facials alone, we felt we had to step up and say something. Plastic Surgery for men, Frosted tips, and sculpted eyebrows... Something needs to be done!

It's such an easy topic, such an easy question, but never were there more variables and hilarious possibilities then during this show. Definitely a Hall of Fame caliber show. Did I hype it up enough for you guys? Trust me it delivers. I actually laughed and I was there the first time. Send us your pairings cause this is a definite Series Premiere.</description>

The Worst Superhero movies according to AOL &amp; Moviefone.com. The 'Best' List was controversial to say the least but, Skeet and Big Sexy both fully get behind this 'Worst' List. The only change I might make is switching the top 2 around, both because of the costumes. These are some shitty movies. Killing dreams all over the world.</description>

It was about 2:30am - Me, Skeet, and our homeboy Ronnie just got back from a celebratory drinking session at the local watering hole and someone (probably Skeet) came up with the bright idea to do a show even though none of us could carry a drunken sentence (Especially our host, Ronnie). Me being the Executive Producer that I am said &quot;Hey, let's do a Post Game Wrap-up of LaRin Lane's amazing appearance on the show.&quot; Initially, thats how this episode starts and one of the many funny things going on is hearing me try to bring it back to that, but this show had a higher calling and couldn't be stopped. Skeet's now infamous Drunken Rambles take on a whole new level of random. Levels I haven't even seen before. Ronnie's in the background slurring and mumbling everything and trying not to pass out, and no that's not an exaggeration. I lost all interest at about minute 10 of the 26, but I kept it running cause this is fucking Radio Gold!!</description>

My personal favorite part, beside the raging orgasm that dwarfed the first 2, the clicking sound the glass made against her clit piercing and then even better the clicking of her teeth when she sucks her juices off of it. Yeah bitches, it was that good!!</description>

Until then, it's our duty to try to help you sniveling comic book lovers try to get some pussy. GAME 2.0 touches on some new developments in the world and then I go after Skeet for almost getting played by a stripper who surprised both of us with some Top Shelf Game of her own.

However, the state of Hip Hop right now is nothing short of pathetic. Every song sounds the same as the others and all these Young and Lil' wannabes are more annoying then poppin'. It's a young man's game now I guess, or better yet, a young girls game cause that's who they make all their Lollipop's and Sexy Can I's for. The final straw was MTV making a List of the top rappers in the game right now and me not knowing half the names. This is our list to combat the wackness of right now with some greatness from when we were coming up and rap was in it's prime, not on life support like it is now.</description>

Fool don't be no dummy&quot; Truer words never were spoken, trust your boys! Somewhere in the middle of the Money section though comes a rare thing called &quot;Selling out.&quot; In a nutshell, a sellout is someone who will do anything, including abandoning everything they are and everything they know for the almighty dollar. And it's not just people as Skeet will point out, companies and businesses have ditched the public for greener pastures, too. This is mostly an urban thing where community and culture are strong in our upbringing. All our lighter brothers, prepare for some knowledge. You might know some people too so hit us up!</description>

      <itunes:summary>Last year Skeet took so much backlash for mentioning 2 animated movies in his Greatest Action Movies List that we had to talk about it in a show. Add that to the hugely successful episode &quot;Greatest Super Heroes&quot; up on http://skeetandbigsexy.com and now with the Transformers and upcoming G.I. Joe movies this show has a whole new meaning. Go to the new website to hear all the new shit and see a couple hot chicks in the process. It's worth the trip!</itunes:summary>

The first time was because it was just unprepared and boring. The second time was because your boy Skeet was being a pussy and didn't want to talk about his past indiscretions. Either way you end up with radio gold! Look for an updated version of this show as we talk about Las Vegas hummers in the back of Strip Clubs, Ensenada Massage Parlors, and other great adventures only at www.SkeetandBigSexy.com</description>

But take this opportunity to learn about another culture that judging by &quot;our&quot; music, &quot;our&quot; clothes, and &quot;our&quot; lifestyle that you love to show off as your own, you know damn well you're interested in. So the way I see it, you can take this show one of 3 ways. It can be simply a look into some specifics about how your idols Skeet and Big Sexy grew up and where (Our thousands of e-mails say you care). #2 it could be a look into a culture that is foreign to you. Anthropologically speaking. Or #3, if you're one of those die hard 'Wiggers' out there, take notes so that if you're ever confronted by someone from a real hood, maybe these details can save you from an ass-whoopin. Either way, enjoy!</description>

A pretty classic topic if you ask me. For all the many women out there reading the title of the show, you'll automatically say yes, but listen closely and hopefully you'll be hip to all guys' true reason for being your friend. Here's a hint, there's always an ulterior motive. Sorry guys, I know we're giving away Top Secret game, but it needed to be talked about. Send us your opinions on this cause i'm just guessing that there's gonna be some disagreeing.</description>

      <title>The Art of The Wingman</title>

Even Michael Jordan couldn't win a playoff series without Scottie Pippen. The same can and should be the same for your sorry excuse for a &quot;Playa&quot; in the game of life. This episode focuses on details that will help you and your friends at least try to hook up with the opposite sex. We even throw in some advanced techniques that we've used on and for each other.

You probably could've guessed that by the lack of football shows even though were in the playoffs now. Anyways, because of this, I have to dig deep into the vault and pull out another one of those classic shows that for one reason or another got lost in the shuffle. I don't remember when we did this show, but it was a while ago. Mid-Summer I think. It's pretty self explanatory though. Skeet started talking shit based on some of the comments left by our die-hards. That started a mini-war where we got on each other for our &quot;less than manly&quot; Guilty Pleasures. Listening back, Skeet forgot a couple about me so I dominated... again.</description>

The only thing that compares is the fabled &quot;Cartoon Show&quot; of this past Summer. For those of you that don't know what's going on, Skeet invented a move back in the late 90's designed solely for getting girls attention and pouncing on them in the clubs. We tiptoed around it in the &quot;Check the Technique&quot; episode and a couple of our die hard fans took the ball and ran with it. One of which was a young player in training who took what little bit of game we gave him and went into the lions den unprepared. The phrase &quot;Knife to a Gun fight&quot; comes to mind. Anyways, this is the wrap up of that and the detailed instructions on how to use the &quot;Tap Tap&quot; move to your advantage. If you still feel like a sexual predator after this, you have bigger problems that we're not responsible for. Good Luck.</description>

Yeah... but because of unforeseen issues that i'm not sure we're gonna tell you yet, I couldn't until today. Luckily for you, the sentiment of how overrated and misrepresented your favorite holiday is comes through even 5 days after. If your greedy little hearts weren't satisfied by all the gifts and gluttonous meals, please enjoy this. Beware though, before starting this show I was just indifferent about Christmas, now... I'm pretty sure I don't like it. The sales are cool though.</description>

We needed guidance from older men besides our family members, we needed advice and skills from people who had been there and done that. Instead of doing a couple competing Top 10 Lists like we were originally gonna do, there were so many important men that needed to get there names and contributions to the Male Community represented equally. With that said this is only Part 1 of our extensive list. E-mail us all your additions that we might've left off. I think we got the big ones covered though!</description>

Well believe it or not, this is it! At the top of the list of potential arguments was this controversial issue that we've been talking about for 15 years. In the spirit of total honesty, this is our second attempt at this show because some of us, were a little afraid to be so honest. I think we nailed it though. Let us know your take. William, we already know your answer.</description>

      <title>The Top 10 Lists, Vol. 8: GREATEST ATHLETES</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1124570/600x600_1361421.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know how exactly, but this show slipped through the cracks. Way through the cracks! I think we originally started recording this show in mid-June, then you'll hear that we had to pick up recording in mid-July, and now it's not going up until mid-November. Go figure. Either way it's a good list show. These are our favorites, maybe not the best of All-Time as you'll see with my putting Michael Jordan #5 and Skeet putting Kobayashi the Hot Dog swallower at #10. Feel free to let us know what you think and your favorites we might've left off.</description>

      <title>Skeet VS. Big Sexy</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1124570/600x600_1355920.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment you've all been waiting for. Jake da Snake you asked for it in your comment and here it is. Skeet vs. Big Sexy. For those of you new to the show, the basic ground work was founded on me and Skeet arguing and talking shit about everything (Obviously), but we contain our crap to others around us. This show takes it to a new level. After the whole LaRin night and Aftermath was basically over Skeet got on his high horse and felt like calling me out. What kind of guy would I be not to defend my turf. It gets pretty ugly in the middle but if you ask me, it's one of the funniest shows we've ever done. Get ready to cringe in laughter! The power is now in your hands though. CHOOSE OR LOSE - VOTE OR DIE. Who's the most IMPORTANT/BEST/YOUR FAVORITE ON THE BUSH?</description>

I'll be honest... when we found out we were getting products from our great sponsor AdamandEve.com to review, a Penis Pump sounded like an obvious, hilarious idea. Little did I know it would hurt so much. We did this review a couple months ago and in the spirit of honesty, I haven't even attempted to use it again. If that's your &quot;Bag&quot; like Austin Powers check it out.</description>

There's actually some big shit going on in the world right now that can and might effect your lives, namely, the U.S. Presidential Elections in a couple weeks. There's no way we could let this come and go without throwin' our stank on it. We know you don't come to &quot;The Bush&quot; for your topical Political Punditry, but guess what, we know shit too! You learn through listening to this episode that Skeet and Big Sexy without any alcohol are almost more scary than their usual totally buzzed selves. They say a mind is a terrible thing to waste. Apparently, its also pretty bad to use it.</description>
