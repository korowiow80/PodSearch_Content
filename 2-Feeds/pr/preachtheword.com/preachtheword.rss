<description>In part 4 of our series of studies entitled 'The God Of Justice', taking us through the Minor Prophet of Amos, we see 'The Third Charge, Apathy', which is brought against the accused people. This final charge has great application today in our churches and our lives. Our dry-eyed complacency stands in stark contrast to the prophet's cries, and challenges us to seek God for a revival in our lands, churches and lives.

<description>Join us for part 4 of our series of studies looking at 'The Presence Of God'. We have traced God's presence from the Garden of Eden to the ultimate manifestation in Immanuel, our Lord Jesus Christ. In this message we move to examine 'The Presence Of God In Pentecost'. When Christ told His disciples that He would send 'another Helper', what did He mean? What part does the Holy Spirit play in manifesting the presence and glory of God? How should this be seen and experienced today? This sermon is available now from http://www.preachtheword.com in MP3, WMA and text formats...</description>

<description>In part 2 of our look at 'The Presence Of God' throughout history, we move on in time from the Garden Of Eden to the times when God's presence was manifested 'In The Tabernacle And Temple'. We begin by looking at the Tabernacle in the wilderness, where God's Shekinah glory dwelt among His people. We then move on to see how His presence dwelt in Solomon's Temple, and how ultimately His presence was lost to the people because of their idolatry. How does this history of the presence of God relate to our experience today? Join us for this sermon which is available now from http://www.preachtheword.com in MP3, WMA and text formats...</description>

<description>In this new series, David Legge will be seeking to trace in Scripture 'The Presence Of God' as it has been manifested throughout history. In our first study, we begin at Genesis where we see how God's presence was encountered 'In The Garden', as Adam and Eve lived in the paradise of Eden. How did Adam and Eve experience the presence of God? How does their experience relate to ours today? They ultimately lost this close sense of God's presence - have we lost it too?

<description>Our 'Studies In Mark' conclude with a look at the remainder of chapter 16, focusing on the 'Fear' the disciples experienced after the crucifixion of Christ. Their doubt and disbelief when word began to spread of Christ's resurrection only served to increase their despair. Are you living under a similar cloud of fear, depression, or doubt? Have you experienced the power of the resurrection in your life? Join us now for the conclusion of our journey through Mark's Gospel.

<description>For our penultimate study in Mark's Gospel, we witness the shocking brutality of 'Golgotha'. The physical, mental and emotional sufferings of Christ on Calvary are laid out for us in the Gospels, but we must not miss the greater spiritual suffering He endured in paying the price for our sins. Have you seen the crucified Christ as He suffered for you on the cross? Join us as we turn our gaze on Him, and anticipate His resurrection in the following chapter.

<description>The 'Trial And Denial' of Christ are the focus of our 55th 'Studies In Mark' message. The Lord Jesus is brought before the Sanhedrin and Pontius Pilate in an illegal mock trial, resulting in His sentence of death by crucifixion. Meanwhile, Peter cowers in the background, and ultimately denies His Lord with oaths and curses. Join us as we study this solemn scene as recorded in Mark's Gospel.

<description>In part 54 of our 'Studies In Mark', the scene shifts to the Garden of Gethsemane. We see 'The Agony Of Gethsemane' for the Lord Jesus Christ as His disciples flee, and He is betrayed by Judas Iscariot. Those moments alone in Gethsemane held great significance, as Christ endured great sorrow and distress as He anticipated what lay before Him in the 'Countdown To Calvary'.

Are you ignoring Christ because you have mistakenly focused on the church or on Christians? Don't make the mistake of failing to look at Christ Himself, examine Him and His claims, and make your own informed decision about who He is! You can still have your own 'Eureka!' moment!

<description>Join us for a fresh look at the familiar stories of 'A Miserable Betrayer and An Extravagant Worshipper' in part 52 of our 'Studies In Mark' - part 4 of the 'Countdown To Calvary' sub-series. The well-known story of Judas Iscariot and his betrayal of Christ is contrasted with the example of the woman in Simon's house who anointed Christ's head with ointment. To which of these could you be compared? Miserable betrayer or extravagant worshipper?

<description>Part 51 of our 'Studies In Mark' forms part 3 of the 'Countdown To Calvary' sub-series. We arrive at chapter 13 of Mark's Gospel, in which he records the famous 'Olivet Discourse'. Christ takes time with Peter, James, John and Andrew on the Mount of Olives to tell them of the 'Signs Of The Second Coming'. These warning signs are applicable today more than ever - are you watching for them? Will you be ready when the signs give way to the event of His return?

<description>This new Topical Sermon examines what God can do with 'Only A Rod'. Moses had spent 40 years in the Midianite desert, as God prepared him for the huge task that lay ahead: leading the people of Israel out of Egypt to the Promised Land. Before Moses could be presented with the prospect of this unimaginable undertaking, God had to bring brokenness into his life, so that He could use him once again. Are you broken? Do you, like Moses, feel useless before God? Come and see how God can use 'Only A Rod'!

<description>As we come to the final week of our Lord's life on earth, as recorded in Mark's Gospel, Part 49 of our 'Studies In Mark' begins a sub-series entitled 'Countdown To Calvary'. In this message we see 'The Servant King's Short-Lived Welcome', as Jesus makes His triumphal entry into Jerusalem riding on a donkey. This fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy is closely followed by a depiction of the fruitlessness of Israel in the cursing of the fig tree - but what about you? Is your life bearing fruit, or are you just taking up space? This sermon is available now from http://www.preachtheword.com in 32K MP3, 64K MP3, WMA and text formats...</description>
