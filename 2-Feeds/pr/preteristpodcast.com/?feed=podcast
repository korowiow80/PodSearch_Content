			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perissos Resources along with Theologyweb.com are discussing co-hosting a large theology convention in Jacksonville, FL March 1-3, 2013. We want to center the event around 2 formally-formatted 3-hour debates on eschatology (end-time philosophy) and a benefit banquet with a well-known keynote speaker. We&#8217;re also considering inviting several ministries to speak and raise awareness, hold book/media signings, and have several panel discussions. Some of you know we&#8217;ve done two small TWeb staff conventions in the past (2007, 2009), but we think it&#8217;s time to do a much bigger event that will almost feel like TWeb, only in person.</p>
<p>Our primary objective is to bring glory to God and see His kingdom advance. To that end, we want minister to the public with these programs as well as financially benefit the two ministries that will dedicate the next year of their lives to bring this event to fruition. The first step in this process is to test the market. If we’re the only ones excited about such an event, then it wouldn’t make much sense to go forward. So, we’re praying for clear direction and we’re asking you to tell us what you think of this concept. Your input at this crucial phase of our planning can make all the difference in whether or not this exciting event becomes a reality.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a large endeavor. It will require a budget, sponsors, and, most importantly, sufficient interest to justify putting such an event together. We think this could have great ministry value and community impact, but we&#8217;d like to know what you think! We’ve put together a brief survey you can complete that will help us measure interest. You can access it below. We’re asking you to complete the survey (it&#8217;ll take about 2 minutes) and then tell all your friends about it so they can come and chime in, too. </p>
<p>It is our sincere hope that we can draw about 500 people to this event and that process begins right here. If we don’t get 250 responses in the next 2 weeks, the project may never see the light of day. We’d be sad to see that happen, since we’re already talking to some of the names you’ll see on the survey and there is interest on their part to participate. Please, be as social as you can about this! Post the link on Facebook, talk about it with friends, send an email to your fellow theology buffs!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance and stay tuned for updates!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Ep.54 we continue to examine the Olivet Discourse, specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>Matthew 24:32-33: Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near-at the doors!</p></blockquote>
<p>I also answer listener questions and have a brief discussion about <em>The Hunger Games</em>.</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://credenda.org/index.php/Reviews/christians-and-the-hunger-games.html" target="_blank">A review by Doug Wilson</a>. I note that Doug gets something factually significant wrong.  I say factually significant because we all miss things in books, particularly if we are not a rabid fan of the book, so I expect that I have noticed way more minutae in my multiple readings of the book that Doug did not see.  But he makes the statement:<br />
<blockquote><p>If you hate spoilers, you can stop reading here. Katniss does survive, and she does so without doing anything perfectly appalling. But this only happens because of luck, not because she learned anything about how the world is actually governed. There is a functional omniscience that the Capitol has in the arena—everything is filmed—and she has real distaste for that functional omniscience, but without any sense that there is any other kind of omniscience. And she does kill one of the bad guy tributes right at the end, but as this is arranged in the book, it is a mercy killing.</p></blockquote>
<p>But that simply is not true.  Katniss&#8217; killing of Cato is not the first time she kills, nor is it the significant time, i.e. the time that is the true loss of her innocence.  That comes when she kills Marvel in retaliation for killing Rue.  It surprises me that Doug missed that, and it causes me to give his review less weight than otherwise.</li>

There is a functional omniscience that the Capitol has in the arenamdash;everything is filmedmdash;and she has real distaste for that functional omniscience, but without any sense that there is any other kind of omniscience. And she does kill one of the bad guy tributes right at the end, but as this is arranged in the book, it is a mercy killing.

But that simply is not true.  Katniss' killing of Cato is not the first time she kills, nor is it the significant time, i.e. the time that is the true loss of her innocence.  That comes when she kills Marvel in retaliation for killing Rue.  It surprises me that Doug missed that, and it causes me to give his review less weight than otherwise. 

An excellent rebuttal to Doug Wilson: Worldview Writing 

Focus on the Family's Book Review 

The Hunger Games Movie: A Christian Perspective

Christianity Today's Movie Review

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is part six of a somewhat humorous critique that Dee Dee has been doing on the audio version of <em>Left Behind</em> by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, this time hosted by Chris Date, guest author at <a href="www.preteristblog.com">The Preterist Blog</a> and host of the <a href="theopologetics.podbean.com">Theopologetics Podcast</a>. Although we are handling this in a joking manner, infantile reduction of Christianity in American Christianity is a major problem.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ep. 44 is the seventeenth  of an ongoing verse by verse study of the Olivet Discourse as recorded in Matthew 24 and is intended to be an audio companion to the written commentary <a href="http://www.preteristsite.com/plain/warrenend.html">It’s Not the End of the World</a> located at http://www.preteristsite.com/plain/warrenend.html. The topic in this episode is continuing with Matthew 24:30 (specifically with the italized part):</p>
<p><strong> Matthew 24:30: Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, <em>and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, </em>and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  </strong></p>
<p>I also answer some pushbacks to my monergistic view including the classic synergistic reliance on Matthew 23:37:</p>
<p><strong>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned in the previous episode, Chris Date had been working on an episode of his podcasts looking at how the phrase &#8220;this generation&#8221; and the Greek word <em>genea</em> are used in Scripture. He has since published that episode, but for those of you who haven&#8217;t yet tuned in to his show, he wrapped the content of that episode in the Preterist Podcast theme and I&#8217;m including in this feed for your listening pleasure. Just forgive him his poor choice in operating systems and music players.  And if you noticed an odd hiccup in the transition between the intro theme and the main content, I had to do a hack and slash on Garage Band (in a good operating system) since apparently Chris&#8217; Windows workflow doesn&#8217;t know from level controls, and I had pity on the eardrums of you, dear listeners, for no matter how awesome the theme music is, nothing is good that LOUD.</p>

<h3>An interesting aside&#8230;</h3>
<p>If you are a word geek, you will enjoy the podcast, A Way With Words.  In the introductory comments to this episode, you may remember that I said &#8220;the implications are enormous.&#8221;  I used that descriptive with care.  On a recent episode of a <a href="http://www.waywordradio.org/" target="_blank">Way With Words</a> (<a href="http://www.waywordradio.org/cut-to-the-chase/" target="_blank">link</a>), the hosts discussed the semantic cultural shift that is occurring with the use of the word enormous/enormity.  Here is the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/enormous" target="_blank">dictionary.com definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>–adjective<br />
1.  greatly exceeding the common size, extent, etc.; huge; immense: an enormous fortune.<br />
2.  outrageous or atrocious: enormous wickedness; enormous crimes.</p></blockquote>
<p>I never really considered the second option, but it turns out that this qualitative rather than quantitative meaning has purists in stitches over President Obama apparently using the word the word &#8220;enormity&#8221; solely in the first capacity, or so it is claimed.  I know now that I have another awesome nuance to play with.</p>

As a result, Jesus&#8217; words, especially the expression, &#8220;this generation&#8221; have undergone reinterpretation.

G. Abbott-Smith writes that the Greek word genea means &#8220;race, stock, family,&#8221; but in the New Testament always &#8220;generation&#8221; (G. Abbott-Smith, Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament, 2nd ed., Edinburgh: T.&#038;T. Clarke, 1923, p. 89). Arndt and Gingrich note that the term means &#8220;literally, those descended from a common ancestor,&#8221; but &#8220;basically, the sum total of those born at the same time, expanded to include all those living at a given time, generation, contemporaries&#8221; (W.F. Arndt and F.W. Gingrich, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1957, p. 153).</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As originally posted at The Preterist Blog.</em></p>
<p><strong>By Dr. Kenneth Talbot</strong></p>
<p>As most of you realize, Dee Dee has not been regularly posting here at “Pret Blog” for some time. She has repeatedly expressed the need for prayer as she was dealing with some serious personal problems. As things have now progressed, Dee Dee has asked me to relate this personal information to her friends and request that you give special times of prayer to her current circumstances. As the Apostle Paul states: “… The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.” (James 5:16)</p>
<p>I have been in consultation with Dee Dee for some time now as a pastor, mentor, and friend. As I have gotten to know Dee Dee, she has become a special Christian Lady who I am proud to call my friend. Early on in our relationship, Dee Dee asked me to counsel her about problems in her marriage as a Minister/Pastor and Licensed Marriage and Family Counselor. Every effort to get her husband into Christian counseling was given by Dee Dee, but we were met with rejection at every turn. Dee Dee was committed to making her marriage work, and as a Christian, felt that she needed to pursue that objective above all other duties and tasks currently in her life, which explains why she has not been actively blogging at this time.</p>
<p>In the end, a divorce is inevitable and the reasons why are not important information that needs to be known. What is most important to Dee Dee is letting her friends know that she has done everything asked of her to make the marriage work. She did so with a passion, but the problem is not with her. I assure you that under the authority of Scripture and with full confessional consideration the divorce is biblical for her and she is not at fault before God and the Church. There have been many tears, heartaches, and disappointments, not to mention stress and depression. We know that God’s grace is sufficient. I ask that you pray that God’s grace be granted to our sister-in-Christ. She needs, now more than ever, to be embraced by her Christian friends, assuring her that we are united with her and willing to give the love and support she needs to get through these trying times.</p>
<p>I ask that you pray for our sister, and send letters (e-mails) of encouragement. Please allow her to continue have the personal space she needs to continue healing emotionally and spiritually. I assure you that she will be back stronger than ever and more committed to the advancement of the truth of Christ’s Gospel.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Content Warning:</strong> The material discussed is of a disturbing nature and may not be suitable for everyone.  It is highly personal and autobiographical.  May God use this information for His glory.</p>
<p>Like Episode 5, this podcast was unplanned, but recent events have caused me to finally expose the seedy underbelly of hyperpreterism and turn on the lights.  This episode deals in somewhat explicit detail my experiences with the worst of the hyperpreterist movement for the past decade.  It is also a long episode.  If you are at all interested in the back-story of this type of work, it is a must-listen.  If you are not particularly interested in my own personal story (and that is fine, believe me, I am not interested in the personal stories of a lot of podcasters I  listen to), but really only the exegesis of the preterist passages, then you will want to skip this podcast.  The humour-content of this episode is also very light due to the subject matter addressed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I was not able to create an introductory video but see further down for some Apple videos I have done.</p>

The topic in this episode is Matthew 24:23–26:</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:23-26: Then if anyone says to you, &#8216;Look, here is the Christ!&#8217; or &#8216;There!&#8217; do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. &#8220;Therefore if they say to you, &#8216;Look, He is in the desert!&#8217; do not go out; or &#8216;Look, He is in the inner rooms!&#8217; do not believe it.</strong></p>
<p>And I am going to add. . .</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:27-28: For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</strong></p>

		<itunes:summary>Ep. 19 is the twelfth of an ongoing verse by verse study of the Olivet Discourse as recorded in Matthew 24 and is intended to be an audio companion to the written commentary Itrsquo;s Not the End of the World located at http://www.preteristsite.com/plain/warrenend.html. The topic in this episode is Matthew 24:23ndash;26:

Matthew 24:23-26: Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There!' do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. "Therefore if they say to you, 'Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out; or 'Look, He is in the inner rooms!' do not believe it.

And I am going to add. . .

Matthew 24:27-28: For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is part two of a somewhat humourous critique that I will be doing on the audio version of <em>Left Behind</em> by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins.  This is the second part and still barely gets into the opening chapter of the first book.  I explain further why I am doing this to begin with and why, although I am handling this is a joking manner, infantile reduction of Christianity in American Christianity is a major problem.</p>
<h3>Issues Discussed</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<em>
<li>Immature depiction of the roles of men and women with juvenile suggestive names.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Being obsessed with the &#8220;End Times&#8221; and the &#8220;Rapture&#8221; &#8211; i.e. the Rapture is not the Gospel nor is it our calling to wait around to be snatched out of the world.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Christianity is about death and resurrection, not about Jesus coming back to get us before we die.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Using scare-tactic eschatology as a witnessing tool.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Nonsensical eisgesis.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Sensationalism.</li>
<p></em>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: I quoted another author&#8217;s critique in my introduction.  It is possible that some listening may think I was claiming that LaHaye and Jenkins are not Christians or that the Gospel is not presented at all in the book.  I absolutely have no reason to believe that LaHaye and Jenkins are not brothers in Lord, and yes, there are times when the very basic Gospel is presented, but the doctrines stressed in Left Behind are not the Gospel and can distract from any true Gospel messages.</p>
<h3>Links and Resources</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/left_behind/page/22/">Slacktivist: Left Behind </a>.  The arrangement of the pages is somewhat odd, rather than hitting &#8220;next&#8221; to move forward, hit &#8220;previous.&#8221;  Think of it as reading from right to left rather than left to right.  Also, you will need to read from the bottom entry on the page to the top.  Don&#8217;t blame me, that is the way the material is set up.</li>

		<itunes:summary>This is part two of a somewhat humourous critique that I will be doing on the audio version of Left Behind by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins.  This is the second part and still barely gets into the opening chapter of the first book.  I explain further why I am doing this to begin with and why, although I am handling this is a joking manner, infantile reduction of Christianity in American Christianity is a major problem.
Issues Discussed

	Immature depiction of the roles of men and women with juvenile suggestive names.
	Being obsessed with the "End Times" and the "Rapture" - i.e. the Rapture is not the Gospel nor is it our calling to wait around to be snatched out of the world.
	Christianity is about death and resurrection, not about Jesus coming back to get us before we die.
	Using scare-tactic eschatology as a witnessing tool.
	Nonsensical eisgesis.
	Sensationalism.

IMPORTANT: I quoted another author's critique in my introduction.  It is possible that some listening may think I was claiming that LaHaye and Jenkins are not Christians or that the Gospel is not presented at all in the book.  I absolutely have no reason to believe that LaHaye and Jenkins are not brothers in Lord, and yes, there are times when the very basic Gospel is presented, but the doctrines stressed in Left Behind are not the Gospel and can distract from any true Gospel messages.
Links and Resources

	Slacktivist: Left Behind .  The arrangement of the pages is somewhat odd, rather than hitting "next" to move forward, hit "previous."  Think of it as reading from right to left rather than left to right.  Also, you will need to read from the bottom entry on the page to the top.  Don't blame me, that is the way the material is set up.

<p><strong> . . then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house.

<h3>Important Podcast News</h3>
<p>I am taking about two weeks off as I am overloaded with some other projects, so I will not even be thinking of <em>starting</em> preparation for the next episode until then.  So it will be three to four weeks until the next episode, unless I finish my other projects sooner.  And it is likely that the next one will be <em>Kicking Some Left Behind Part Two</em>, but I haven&#8217;t decided yet.  I have some notes written for that already, so I might do that while it is fresh in my head.  Having fresh <em>Left Behind</em> in your head in not a pleasant experience.</p>
<h3>Baby Pictures</h3>
<p>I have temporarily misplaced my camera.  I will post the baby pictures in a separate post.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ep.11 is the sixth of an ongoing verse by verse study of the Olivet Discourse as recorded in Matthew 24 and is intended to be an audio companion to the written commentary <a href="http://www.preteristsite.com/plain/warrenend.html">It’s Not the End of the World </a>located at http://www.preteristsite.com/plain/warrenend.html. The topic in this episode is Matthew 24:9-13:</p>
<p><strong><em>Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name&#8217;s sake.

Cause I&#8217;ll never be with you</p>
<p>Yes it caught my eye<br />
and I can&#8217;t help but sigh<br />
I could see that this processor would just fly<br />
And I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ll see it again<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ep. 8c&#8217;s topic is irresponsible laxity on the part of some orthodox preterists when it comes to the issue of hyperpreterism, specifically, very prominent and influential preterist Gary DeMar of American Vision.  There are two goals for this episode.  First, to warn people to be wary of Gary DeMar and others who might blur the line between orthodoxy and heresy through passive complicity and to see the harm that such behaviour can cause.  Secondarily, it would be to get Gary to change his ways on this subject, and if not, for those who support him to bring some pressure to bear until he does for the sake of the Church or at the very least to be completely cognizant that Gary has not been a champion of the historic faith in areas completely relevant to his ministry.</p>

<p>Here is a banner ad currently appearing on a heretical preterist site.  Has Gary asked for it to be removed?  I doubt it, he participates there (at least as of last year or so) where people are led into heresy on a daily basis.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not a real episode.  It&#8217;s a &#8220;get a grip&#8221; episode &#8211; preparing you, gentle listener, for what&#8217;s ahead.  Episode 8 will be up as soon as possible.  I am not going to tell you what it is about because, well, that&#8217;s how I roll.  But I will tell you that Roderick Edwards is my co-host for that episode&#8211;the one I won&#8217;t tell you about.  Unfortunately, I made a boo-boo in recording the Skype call.  It was completely my fault; not the fault of my Mac.  Nothing is ever the fault of my Mac.  When I set my Skype settings, I properly split the conversation into two tracks, but like a Windoze dork, I didn&#8217;t set the record settings to record in AIFF format but rather the crappy AAC format which didn&#8217;t properly preserve the split.  Fortunately Roderick sounds great, but I sound like a warmed over turd omelet thrown into a pit of hissing snakes.  Yes, it&#8217;s that bad.  So I have a LOT of post-production to do on my end.  On the upside, it gives me the opportunity to play with some of my new production toys such as Peak LE5 and SoundSoap.  Worst case scenario, I just re-record exactly what I said the first time and carve out Roderick&#8217;s side and splice them back together.  If you are thinking that this sounds like it might be a good twelve hours of work, you would be right.  Wish me luck.</p>
<p>Anyways, here is the non-episode you MUST listen to in order to be prepared for Roderick and I on Episode 8.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>&#8220;Keith Mathison was correct on this point: If futurism is true, then [full] preterism is definitely (not &#8220;possibly,&#8221; as I said) a damnable doctrine.&#8221;</em> </strong>- Hyperpreterist David Green.  Ep. 7 is a special episode for me for two reasons.  One, it is my first interview of a guest.  Yay!  But more importantly, it is an interview with my long-time friend and former hyperpreterist Roderick Edwards.  Roderick and I have an informal discussion of the state of hyperpreterism today, and Roderick lends his perspective on issues within hyperpreterism as someone who was an insider.  I hope you find the discussion informative and enjoyable.</p>

		<itunes:summary>"Keith Mathison was correct on this point: If futurism is true, then [full] preterism is definitely (not "possibly," as I said) a damnable doctrine." - Hyperpreterist David Green.  Ep. 7 is a special episode for me for two reasons.  One, it is my first interview of a guest.  Yay!  But more importantly, it is an interview with my long-time friend and former hyperpreterist Roderick Edwards.  Roderick and I have an informal discussion of the state of hyperpreterism today, and Roderick lends his perspective on issues within hyperpreterism as someone who was an insider.  I hope you find the discussion informative and enjoyable.

Debate between hyperpreterist David Green and preterist Keith Mathison on David's article [Hyper]Preterism and the Ecumenical Creeds in which David conceded that there are only two possibilities for the hyperpreterist position:  it is either right or it is definitely damnable heresy (David's words).

An additional interview with Roderick is planned for the near future dealing with the responsibility of preterists to be wary of imprecision and co-mingling with hyperpreterists which can be exploited to lead people into hyperpreterism.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ep. 3 is the third in an introductory series.  In this episode I lay out the case for the importance of terminology in the eschatological debate between heretical preterism (hyperpreterism) and preterism.  This podcast goes twice the length as my target length, so I recommend listening to half and returning to listen to the other half at another time.   I go into great minutae on the history and rational behind the specific terminology that we use.  The issue is very important, I thank you for your attention.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Ep. 3 is the third in an introductory series.  In this episode I lay out the case for the importance of terminology in the eschatological debate between heretical preterism (hyperpreterism) and preterism.  This podcast goes twice the length as my target length, so I recommend listening to half and returning to listen to the other half at another time.   I go into great minutae on the history and rational behind the specific terminology that we use.  The issue is very important, I thank you for your attention.

<p>Sorry for the bit of a scratchy voice &#8211; I was very tired at the time of recording and had a bit of a cold coming on.  I am not sure which I prefer better, the scratchy voice or the terrifying idea that I sound like an NPR announcer.  Ack!</p>
<p><strong>Links and resources:</strong></p>
<p>The written study guide for this episode: <a href="http://www.preteristsite.com/docs/warrenpositivepreterism.pdf" target="_blank">Dee Dee&#8217;s Positive Case for Preterism</a></p>
<p>Extensive commentary I have written on Matthew 24: <a href="http://www.preteristsite.com/plain/warrenend.html" target="_blank">It&#8217;s Not the End of the World!</a></p>
<p>Polemic against the hyperpreterist heresy: <a href="http://www.preteristsite.com/docs/warrengrave.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Grave&#8221; Heresy: Hyperpreterism and the Response of the Church</a></p>

<p><strong>And remember &#8211; theological novelty is NOT a good thing.</strong></p>
<p>Updated news on subscribing to the feed.  I had an awesome experience with Apple iTunes support and it turns out for whatever reason, my prior submission did not go through.  The support guy helped me out, and now it has been submitted, and may take up to a week to get approved.  I will let you know.</p>
<p>So until then, you can manually subscribe to the feed by going under the “advanced” menu in iTunes and inputting in to the “subscribe to podcast” selection. This is the feed:http://www.preteristpodcast.com/?feed=podcast</p>
