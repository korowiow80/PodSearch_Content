Whether you’re looking for information or inspiration, you’ll find it at PrettyTough.com.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, not every girl is a damsel in distress looking for Prince Charming. The days when girls were expected to play with dolls, wear pink dresses, have perfect hair, and be quiet and clean are long gone.  For many girls, role models aren’t delicate princesses but kick-butt women who surf twenty- foot waves, dunk basketballs, sail off vert ramps, hit homeruns, beat guys on the motor track and more.</p>
<p>Being a female athlete isn’t just about physical challenges &#8211; it’s also about being surrounded by amazing teammates who personify that while winning is important, sport is also about unity, laughter, dreaming, growing, persisting, dancing and believing.</p>
<p>Sports teach girls to love the skin they’re in. To be themselves. To celebrate others. To smile rather than panic in moments of adversity. To explore. To take risks. To act rather than react. To approach each day with a smile.</p>
<p>And now, sporty girls have an <a title="Pretty Tough Social" href="http://community.prettytough.com">online hub</a> where they can follow their favorite athletes, share stories, learn from role models, replay and relive favorite sports moments and be inspired. By creating a platform that allows female athletes, women’s sports fans, coaches and families to connect, active girls now have their very own virtual sports community.</p>
<p>Members will be able to create their own Pretty Tough profile, join a local group, friend athletes with similar interests, upload pictures and videos to promote themselves and their sports, voice their opinion in an online discussion or keep track of events going on in their area.</p>
<p>With the Olympics fast approaching, we’re going to be talking lots of sports. Favorite events, great comebacks and upsets, and our own dreams for getting to the Olympics. So sign up or log in &#8211; you can log in using your personal Facebook page &#8211; and participate in a discussion or poll, post updates or blogs and get the latest news and perspectives in women’s sports and fitness.</p>
<p>The site also has a mobile feature, so it will be easy to keep in touch with Pretty Tough on the go. So spread the word to your family and friends that the PT community has been launched. You do not want to miss the excitement!</p>
<p>PrettyTough.com and its community of dynamic members are dedicated to all the girls who bust stereotypes – and prove every day they’re “Pretty Tough.”  Check it out and find out what tough really looks like.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lYqsxEw3Lic" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>The video features amateur and Pro female athletes performing and commenting. Pro athletes include, soccer legend, Olympian and five time FIFA World Player of the Year Marta, World and Olympic champion sprinter Allyson Felix, Olympic hurdler Lolo Jones, Olympic and WNBA champion baller Lisa Leslie, World Cup and Olympic champion softballer Jessica Mendoza, NCAA hurdler Ginnie Crawford and X Games champion skateboarder Alexis Sablone.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/shawnjohnson_visa2008.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1486" title="Shawn Johnson Visa Championships 2008" src="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/shawnjohnson_visa2008.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="400" /></a>Olympic gold medalist <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/olympic-gold-medalist-shawn-johnson-retires-olympic-trials-212200893.html">Shawn Johnson announced her retirement</a> Sunday, saying repeated setbacks with her left knee made contending for a spot at the London Games impossible.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It just little by little gets worse and worse,&#8221; Johnson told The Associated Press. &#8220;My body is to the point where I need time to rest and retire so I can be healthy for the rest of my life. It&#8217;s hard to wrap my mind around. Gymnastics has been my entire life, and now it&#8217;s no more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Johnson, who is now 20 years old, made the announcement just four days before the start of the U.S. gymnastics championships.  Her competitive career, which took her from Iowa to Hollywood, with a few world titles, a trip to Beijing and an Olympic gold medal in between, is sadly over.</p>
<p>The petite gymnast with a bubbly personality won four medals — three silvers and a gold — with the U.S. team during the 2008  Beijing Games and returned home a celebrity athlete, signing numerous endorsement deals and winning the television competition show <em>Dancing with Stars</em>.</p>
<p>Johnson left the door open to a return for a London but blew out her knee in a 2010 ski accident,  tearing her ACL, MCL meniscus and hamstring in one fell swoop. Despite the setback, she and her coach Liang Chow began plotting a comeback.</p>
<p>She made the team for last year&#8217;s Pan American Games, where she helped the Americans win the team gold. But when she tried to increase her training over the last few months to get ready for London, her surgically repaired knee just couldn&#8217;t cope with a rigorous Olympic training regimen,</p>
<p>Finally, Chow sat Johnson down and said they needed to be realistic. She couldn&#8217;t put in the training she needed, and she was looking at an entire knee reconstruction if she kept going.</p>
<div id="ad_mid_article">
<form id="qas_dfp_frm" action="" method="get" name="qas_dfp_frm" target=""></form>
</div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a really hard decision. How can you tell yourself, `No, I think it&#8217;s time to say it&#8217;s finally done?&#8217;&#8221; said Johnson, 20. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to be 30 and have kids and run around with them. It became more about my future life than this future one moment. I&#8217;m looking at the bigger picture of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it still hurts.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s weird, for the first time in my career I came up short. But I feel like I succeeded as well,&#8221; said Johnson, who listed making the Pan Am team after the knee injury as one of her proudest accomplishments. &#8220;It almost came too easy the first time. It was a humbling experience this time around.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Famous is the story of  how her coach got Johnson her first invitation to a national team training camp. Unsolicited, Chow sent national team coordinator Martha Karolyi a highlight tape and promised that &#8220;this kid will help the U.S. team.&#8221; Based on the pure moxie of the move, Karolyi couldn&#8217;t help but take a look. Chow turned out to be right.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shawn will always hold a special place in gymnastics and my heart,&#8221; Karolyi said. &#8220;She always showed the joy of doing gymnastics.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with her gold on balance beam in Beijing, Johnson won silvers in the all-around, team competition and floor exercise. Her all-around title at the 2007 world championships was at the time the fourth by a U.S. woman, and she also led the Americans to their third team title and took gold on the floor exercise. Shannon Miller is the only other American to win three golds at a single world championships.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s performance at worlds was the exclamation point on a winning streak the likes of which is rarely seen in gymnastics. She won every event she entered in 2007,  establishing herself as one of the poster kids for the 2008 Olympics. It also set up a compelling, yet friendly, rivalry with fellow gymnast Nastia Liukin.</p>
<p>After finishing second to Liukin at the Beijing Games, Johnson was among the first to embrace her teammate and congratulate her. If she was disappointed, she wasn&#8217;t going to spoil Liukin&#8217;s accomplishment by showing it.</p>
<p>Johnson said she made her decision to call it quits last Friday, then spent the next day telling those closest to her. But no matter how many times she said the words, they hadn&#8217;t quite sunk in. It will no doubt be difficult over the coming months, as she watches the rest of the U.S. women fight for a spot on the Olympic team and experience everything she did just four years ago.</p>
<p>She still plans to attend the Olympic trials where hopefully her training partner, Gabby Douglas, will make the U.S. team. And she also  plans to go to London, where she promised to be &#8220;the greatest cheerleader in the stands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her autobiography, &#8220;Winning Balance,&#8221; is being released Tuesday, and she plans to go to college in the fall of 2013, though she hasn&#8217;t settled on a school.</p>
<p>Though her comeback may not have ended how she imagined or hoped, Johnson said she has no regrets. She felt she had gotten &#8220;off track&#8221; in the two years after Beijing, and returning to gymnastics reminded her of what was really important.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The comeback has made me 10 times more a stronger person than I ever was,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The past two years in gymnastics brought me back to the real me. I feel like no matter where I go next, I&#8217;ll be more level-headed about it. And do what&#8217;s right for me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So all you gymnastics fans out there will have to rearrange the brackets you&#8217;ve been working on. With Johnson out, who will make the U.S. team?</p>
<p>And as a reminder of how good Johnson was, take a look at the <a href="http://youtu.be/OnrS4o-dQLE">video </a>from her winning performance as a 15-year-old phenom at the 2007 World Championships.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Chicago Surfing" href="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/chicagosurf.jpg"><img src="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/chicagosurf.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Chicago Surfing" /></a>The Windy City is one of America&#8217;s sports meccas: home to the Bears and the Bulls, the Sox and the Cubs, and but can it become Surf City, U.S.A.? Technically no,  since that name belongs to Huntington Beach, California but Chicago now allows surfers access to specific beaches. Whaa?</p>
<p>Up until recently, wave riders risked massive fines for attempting a session as if 20 degree air temperatures and erratic surf potential weren&#8217;t enough deterrents to would be surfers. The move will effectively legalize surfing in the heart of the Midwest and make Chicago an unlikely beachfront in the war to extend surfing&#8217;s influence across the country.</p>
<p>So after 20+ years of surfing bans,  Chicagoans can ride the waves at five beaches &#8220;ath their own risk.&#8221; . 41st Beach will be open to surf all year, Montrose, Osterman, 57th St &amp; Rainbow will be open Labor Day &#8211; Memorial Day (fall/winter is when the waves are really kicking.)</p>
<p>The city that helped transform Obama from Hawaiian bodysurfer to Presidential golden child (not sure he ever took to the shores of Lake Michigan) will now let folks trudge through the city with  rafts, boogie boards and, of course, surfboards to grab a few cold ones. Chicago has a surf shop and a Surfrider chapter and sometimes even some surf, so why not?</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1904261,00.html">Time Magazine</a>, this is part of a push to extend surfing&#8217;s influence inland. Global companies like Billabong and Quicksilver and Volcom know that expansion means going beyond nature&#8217;s coastal boundaries. After all, that&#8217;s where the cash potential lies. It&#8217;s an untapped resource up to this point.</p>
<p>In reality, surfing is happening in bodies of water everywhere. Stand-up paddle boarding, wake surfing, kite surfing, surfing in rivers and giant lakes and Arctic seas, and even some action happening in truly viable wave pools. This might be a sea change moment for ocean surfers: the great shift inland for surf culture. It&#8217;s an interesting thought.</p>
<p>Filmmaker Vince Deur, co-chair of the Surfrider Foundation&#8217;s chapter in Chicago,said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We know that in the world of great surfing, as far as quality goes, we&#8217;re at the bottom. We&#8217;re in it for the fun. We understand and respect the city&#8217;s small-step approach to opening these beaches. And we consider this a victory.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As a southern Californian girl who thinks the Pacific is a bit icy  &#8211; I guess fun is all in the eyes of the beholder. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be booking a surf vacation to Chicago anytime soon.</p>

If you&#8217;ve thought about playing the sport, you&#8217;ve probably quickly realized how much equipment you&#8217;ll need to get started. Unlike other sports such as baseball and basketball that need little equipment to get started, a sport such as lacrosse can make it feel like you&#8217;re shopping for groceries when purchasing the equipment. To help you better understand what equipment will be required during an official lacrosse game, here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll more need:</p>
<p><strong>Cleats</strong> &#8212; Most lacrosse players will use cleats that are similar to those that football players wear. There are also cleats on the market that are designated solely for lacrosse.</p>
<p><strong>Elbow Pads</strong> &#8212; Protecting the elbows, these pads may have to be a certain color per your league&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p><strong>Gloves</strong> &#8212; Depending on your club, they may supply the player with gloves based on the team colors. Every league will vary.</p>
<p><strong>Helmet</strong> &#8212; Most players are required to purchase their own helmet. Depending on the player&#8217;s age and head size, helmets can vary. When purchasing a lacrosse helmet, make sure that you always try it on in person to make sure that it has a comfortable fit.</p>
<p><strong>Mouth Guard</strong> &#8212; Even though a player will wear a helmet, mouth guards are recommended. League rules may have specifications as to what color the mouth guard can be. These guards normally don&#8217;t attach to the helmet.</p>
<p><strong>Rib Pads</strong> &#8212; This is an optional piece of equipment. Generally not provided by the club, rib pads are ideal for players playing the attack and midfield positions.</p>
<p><strong>Shorts</strong> &#8211; <a href="http://www.lacrossemonkey.com/mens-shorts-pants.html">shorts for lacrosse</a> are usually supplied by the club. They will usually consist of the team&#8217;s colors and will be similar to a pair of basketball shorts.</p>
<p><strong>Shoulder Pads</strong> &#8212; Like the elbow pads, shoulder pads could have color restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Stick</strong> &#8212; Probably the most important part of the game. Sticks can come in all shapes and forms. Be sure to know what the size restrictions are. Most leagues recommend that sticks are between 37 and 42 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Uniforms</strong> &#8212; Like the shorts, uniforms can be provided by the club. These <a href="http://www.lacrossemonkey.com/lacrosse-2009-2010-uniforms.html">custom uniforms</a> will usually have the team colors, a logo and a unique design.</p>
<p>Depending on the division you join, leagues can widely vary with the rules. The league can also vary in terms of what they give the player. All in all, the equipment listed above is required for any official lacrosse game. For the equipment that you do need to purchase, always make sure that you comparison shop and try things on before making a decision.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7365.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10499" title="IMG_7365" src="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7365-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Amanda Schaap of Jenison, MI won the general classification at last weekend&#8217;s 2nd annual Western Michigan Stage Race (<a href="http://www.wmsr.co/">WMSR</a>) in the women&#8217;s category 3/4.</p>
<p>Clear skies, sunshine and temperatures upward of 80 degrees Fahrenheit were a fixture for the event. One of the newest members to Team Kenda, Schaap was presented by Geargrinder, a women-only team based in Indiana which, since 1999, has been helping women compete on their bikes around the nation.</p>
<p>Schaap is a registered nurse who works in the neonatal intensive care unit at the Helen DeVos Children&#8217;s Hospital in Grand Rapids, MI. &#8220;I had a blast at this race!&#8221; gushed an overjoyed Amanda. &#8220;This was Michigan&#8221;s first stage race of the year and we had at least 32 women in the field, which is one of the largest women&#8217;s category 3/4 fields I have raced. The more in the field the more fun the race. The field was smart and fast, two things that help make a great race, especially at this level.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time since I have been racing, my parents were there to witness my win on Saturday&#8217;s criterium: the second event of the stage on a 0.9-mile closed-course at Kent Intermediate School District at Knapp Street and the East Beltline.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the race my mom said, &#8220;Watching you win today will stay etched in my mind for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Winning the overall stage race was my goal from the start, so to actually earn the win is surreal.&#8221; After Saturday&#8217;s race, Amanda moved on to the third and last stage of the event, a 30-mile (48- kilometer) road race in and around the Flat River Grill in Lowell, MI. Again, Amanda finished in the field and solidified her overall general classification (GC) win. Ellie Burke, a second-year racer who works as a business administrator and lives in Grand Rapids, placed seventh in the GC. Burke stated that this was a fun event with a phenomenal turnout. &#8220;It was amazing racing with so many women. Team Kenda had a terrific showing with women coming from all over the U.S. to participate.&#8221; She expressed her gratitude to Cheryl Olson and to the Priority Health women&#8217;s team for awakening the women&#8217;s cycling scene in the Michigan metro area.</p>
<p>In the professional category women pro/1/2, the team was among the largest with five riders of which three, Sheila Orem (NC), Krystal Lacy-McNutt (OH) and Beth Lauer (WI), placed fourth, seventh and ninth in the general classification. Gray Patton from Bradford Woods, PA (Cleveland Clinic/RGF/Carbon) won the GC by securing a win in the road race. The WMSR consisted of three events: a 7.2-mile time trial at Chief Hazy Cloud Park near Ada; a second stage on a 0.9-mile criterium on a closed-course at Kent Intermediate School District at Knapp Street and the East Beltline; and Sunday&#8217;s final stage, a road race consisting of 30, 60 or 90 miles, depending on the rider&#8217;s racing category.</p>
<p>Sunday&#8217;s road race began at the Flat River Grill in Lowell. The event offered $8,000 cash awards. The race was promoted and directed by 42-85 Event Promotions and Race Timing of Grand Rapids, MI. This yearâ€™s event drew 267 total riders (205 men and 62 women) with 50 from out of state. The majority of the riders traveled from Illinois and Ohio, while a few came in from as far as Canada. Race Director Brian Bangma declared that 42-85 Event Promotions and Race Timing is already planning for the 2013 West Michigan Stage Race and hopes to bring in 400 racers.

<p>About Team Kenda Women&#8217;s Cycling: Team Kenda began in 1999 as Team Ameritech with nine riders who excelled at bicycle racing. Over the years, the team has steadily grown in size and now boasts NRC/NCC Elite, as well as Southeast, Mid-Atlantic Elite, Midwest, and West Regional Teams. The team competes in the United States focusing on the National Race Calendars, both NRC and NCC. In 2010, the team finished 8th among 73 teams in the National Racing Calendar (NRC) Womenâ€™s Team competition and 8th in the 2011 NRC campaign.

After a year of school and cold weather, it&#8217;s now time to enjoy the Cali sun.</p>
<p>This summer, my to-do list includes scuba diving in Belize, cave tubing in Guatemala, surfing in Malibu, and wakeboarding in Tahoe. With such an active lifestyle, I need a swimsuit that won’t fall off (but that looks cute too.) I did not spend hours in the gym to wear a one-piece…</p>
<p>I was sent a Calavera bikini and I have to say – I’m in love. Calavera has three style options: glam, solid/wicked, and fierce. I opted to mix and match colors and ended up with a glam black hipster bottom and a glam red twist top. The hipster bottom comes with an inside non-stretch string and the top has an elastic under bust band to ensure that your top WON’T fall off.  Pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Check them out for yourself:</p>

<p><em>(Ed. Note: Pretty Tough Team Rider <a href="http://prettytough.com/melissa_becker/">Melissa Becker Ponce de Leon</a> is a pro mountainboarder with multiple U.S. Championships)</em></p>
<p><em> </em>Snowboarders, Surfers and all other boarders: What do you do when there&#8217;s  no snow or water to shred?? Check out Mountainboarding, an off-road board you can ride just about anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>What is Mountainboarding?</strong> A mountainboard is a cross between a skateboard and a snowboard. Mountain Board Sports (<a href="http://www.mbs.com" target="_blank">www.mbs.com</a>) is one of the founders of the sport. The best thing about a mountainboard is you can ride it just about anywhere. We ride dirt roads, skate parks, grass hills, pavement, bmx tracks, ski areas and just about anywhere else you can imagine. The eight-inch nomadic dirt wheels and the truck systems make off-roading so much fun. Mountainboarding is also a  great way to stay in shape year-round and we use it as a cross training for all other board sports.</p>
<p><strong>Who Mountainboards?</strong> Anyone can ride a mountainboard. We have found places to teach just about anyone who would ever want to learn. From my three-year old niece to a 60 year old grandpa, anyone can learn. You may never leave a grass hill but let me tell you, grass is one of the most fun  surfaces to ride on a mountainboard. And if you&#8217;re looking for something more challenging, there is always somewhere new and big to drop or ride.</p>
<p><strong>Want to learn? </strong>We teach lessons out of Altitude Sickness Boardshop in Empire, CO. If you are interested please feel free to e-mail me at: <a href="mailto:melissarae_1999@yahoo.com" target="_blank">melissarae_1999@yahoo.com</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2012 French Open got an infusion of drama late Tuesday when 13-time Grand Slam title winner <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/sports/tennis/2012-french-open-serena-williams-ousted-in-first-round.html">Serena Williams suffered a stunning first-round loss </a>to 111th-ranked Virginie Razzano of France.  The 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-3 upset was Williams&#8217; worst Grand Slam defeat in 47 appearances.</p>
<p>It looked like Williams, the tournament&#8217;s fifth seed, had the late evening match at Roland Garros under control when she led by a set and 5-1 in the second set tiebreaker. She was two points from victory nine times in that set.</p>
<p>But Williams lost momentum after stopping a point in the tiebreak, erroneously believing Razzano&#8217;s shot had sailed long. Then Razzano, the darling of the Paris crowd after playing the 2011 French Open just days after her <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/sports/tennis/25iht-TENNIS25.html">fiancé and coach died from cancer</a>, managed to reel off the next six points to level the tie and ultimately force a third set.</p>
<p>Williams entered the day with a 46-0 record in first-round matches at Grand Slam tournaments. It was her first opening-round loss and earliest exit since losing in the second round to her sister Venus in her majors debut at the 1998 Australian Open. She had been looking for her 14th major title, and second at Roland Garros and was visibly upset, even appearing to cry while sitting court side during the changeover.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.snappytv.com/snap/serena-crying-during-changeover-rg12-frenchopen-about-french-open-on-court-phillipe-chatrier-on-french-open-court-phillipe-chatrier?w=480&amp;h=302" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="480" height="302"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Williams then fell to pieces during the deciding set, slipping two breaks down to trail, 4-0. She had to regather when umpire Eva Asderaki, with whom she famously  clashed during her 2011 United States Open final defeat against Samantha Stosur, ordered the first point of the fifth game to be replayed.</p>
<p>Razzano proceeded to serve an ace to lead, 5-0, but the drama did not stop there. Williams clawed her way back to 3-5 and had a break point when Asderaki punished Razzano for hindrance. She saved it and went to match point, which she squandered on a double fault.</p>
<p>Eight match points later, after 3 hours and 3 minutes of action, Razzano finally got the epic win when Williams sent a return long.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I fought until the end,” Razzano told the crowd after a three-hour struggle. “You gave me your energy. I’m going to have to rest. Thank you all for your support.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Williams&#8217;s problems were largely her own doing. She committed 47 unforced errors to 36 for the Frenchwoman.</p>
<p>A lot of tennis fans believe Serena is a poor sport whose emotional outbursts are childish &#8211; which may well be true &#8211; but it&#8217;s always difficult to watch a powerhouse like Serena suffer such a devastating loss.</p>
<p>On the other hand, kudos to Razzano who will now face Arantxa Rus of the Netherlands for a place in the Round of 32. On any given day, there&#8217;s a winner and a loser and Razzano clearly had a big win today.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Women’s National Team head coach Pia Sundhage has named the 18-player roster for the 2012 Olympic Games. Eleven players make a return to the Olympics after helping the USA to the gold medal in 2008 in Beijing, China. Midfielders Shannon Boxx and Heather O’Reilly and defender Heather Mitts make their third Olympic Team while U.S. captain Christie Rampone will be playing in a U.S. record fourth Olympic Games.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s summer break for the girls at Beachwood Academy and that means sun, surf, and sensational escapades at the Beachwood Country Club. Abby, a rising sophomore, is so excited to have gotten a last-minute gig as a lifeguard, especially because jobs are usually reserved for club members.</p>
<p>Abby desperately wants to win the annual lifeguarding competition, and with it a college scholarship. But when she arrives for her first day on the job, she finds herself face-to-face with some serious club member attitude. And there&#8217;s an even bigger surprise waiting for her: the gorge senior boy she&#8217;s been pining over ever since they met at a swimming competition earlier this year.</p>
<p>Can Abby break through the rules, regs, and mean girls to be the first-ever non-club member to win the summertime lifeguarding competition and maybe even the boy of her dreams?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/indy500.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10464" title="indy500" src="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/indy500-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>The <a href="http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/eventinfo/35391-Schedule/">Indianapolis 500</a> may be in Danica Patrick&#8217;s rear view mirror, but the race will still take place this Sunday,  just as it has every Memorial Day weekend.  Once the green flag drops, a 33- car field will accelerate to more than 200 mph and continue at a blistering speed around the track for 500 miles.</p>
<p>While Patrick&#8217;s fame was launched at the Indy 500, where she typically ran well, she made the move to NASCAR this year and won&#8217;t be at the Brickyard this weekend (she&#8217;ll be in North Carolina at the Coca-Cola 600). The huge increase in exposure &#8212; millions more watch NASCAR than IndyCar&#8211; is just one of the many reasons Patrick made the full-time switch to stock cars.</p>
<p>The Indy 500 is not without a female presence this year however. In fact it will be a historic day for women. The 96th running of the race will feature the first all-female racing team, sponsored by TrueCar. British driver<strong></strong> <a href="http://www.katherinelegge.com/">Katherine Legge</a>, one of the six on the brand-new team, spoke to <a href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/05/13/katherine-legge-indianapolis-500-all-female-team/">Hollywood Life</a> about what it means to be a part of such a ground-breaking venture .</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s just an amazing initiative. What TrueCar has done is forward-thinking and very ground-breaking. It’s empowering because there are six of us, and we’re all very supportive of each other. In order for this to succeed, we all need to do well. For me, it’s the most amazing experience I’ve ever been given, and one I’m deeply passionate about making successful.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Legge is just one of three women racing Sunday &#8212; she&#8217;ll be on the track with 22 year-old Swiss driver Simona de Silvestro and 27 year-old Brazilian Ana Beatriz. Although Patrick will not be present, the women  are chasing her 2009 third-place finish, the best finish for a woman in the Indy 500.</p>
<p>Be sure to catch all the action Sunday May 27 (noon ET, ABC) .</p>
<p>Why is Indianapolis 500 such a huge draw each year? Tradition rules at the race, which celebrated its 100th anniversary last year, from the singing of &#8220;Back Home Again in Indiana&#8221; before the race to the winner&#8217;s celebratory bottle of milk. (Although the first Indy 500 was run in 1911, the event was not held in 1917-18 and 1942-45 because of the world wars.)</p>
<p>Here are a few more bits of <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20110529/SPORTS0107/105290386">trivia </a>about the Memorial Day weekend classic:</p>
<p><strong>How big is the track?</strong> It&#8217;s a rectangular, 2.5-mile track, and the speedway likes to note that Vatican City, Churchill Downs, Yankee Stadium, the Rose Bowl and the Roman Colosseum combined could fit within its 253-acre infield.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the track called the Brickyard?</strong> Early in its history, the speedway&#8217;s surface consisted of 3.2 million bricks. There is still a 3-foot-wide strip of the bricks at the start-finish line.</p>
<p><strong>How many spectators attend?</strong> The Speedway has 257,325 permanent seats, making it the world&#8217;s largest spectator sporting facility. If placed end to end, the seat boards from the grandstand would stretch 99.5 miles. Several thousand more people watch from the infield.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the first woman to drive in the 500?</strong> <a href="http://www.janetguthrie.com">Janet Guthrie</a> was the first female driver in 1977, and she competed in three consecutive races. The second female driver didn&#8217;t come along until 1992, when Lyn St. James made the first of her seven starts.</p>
<p><strong>How many women have raced the Indy 500?</strong> Eight women have started the race: Janet Guthrie, Lyn St. James, Sarah Fisher, Danica Patrick, Milka Duno, Ana Beatriz,  Simona De Silvestro and  Pippa Mann.</p>
<p><strong>Which female driver had the best finish? </strong> Danica Patrick has the highest starting position for a female driver, at fourth in 2005, and also the highest finish, at third in 2009. She also has five top-10 finishes. Janet Guthrie (ninth in 1978) is the only other female to finish in the top 10.</p>
<p><strong>Which female had the most starts? </strong> Sarah Fisher has more career starts than any other female, with nine.</p>
<p><strong>How long is the race?</strong> The first race in 1911 lasted 6 hours, 42 minutes, 8 seconds with an average speed of 74.602 mph. Last year&#8217;s race lasted 3:05:37.0131 with an average speed of 161.623 mph.</p>
<p><strong>Why do the winners drink milk?</strong> After three-time winner Louis Meyer drank buttermilk in Victory Lane in 1936, a milk industry executive made an effort to have future winners repeat the gesture, and it eventually stuck.</p>
<p><strong>How much d0es the winner earn?</strong> Winner Dario Franchitti won $2.8 million.</p>
<p><strong>What is the winner&#8217;s wreath made of?</strong> For most of the past 30 years, 33 ivory-colored Cymbidium orchids with burgundy tips have been a part of the winner&#8217;s wreath. It also includes 33 miniature checkered flags with red, white and blue ribbons.</p>
<p>Predictions for this year&#8217;s winner?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kimclijsters.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10449" title="kimclijsters" src="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kimclijsters-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Brussels &#8211; Former world No 1 Kim Clijsters announced on Tuesday she is to retire after the US Open in September.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Belgian told a news conference that she wanted to sign out in New York where she enjoyed the biggest success of her career winning the women&#8217;s singles title at Flushing Meadow three times in 2005, 2009 and 2010.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As it stands I will end my career at the US Open, that is where I enjoyed my greatest triumphs and it is a very special place for me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stadium is only about 45 minutes away from our house in the United States and my parents-in-law will be able to be present.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Clijsters is married to former US basketball player Brian Lynch and the couple have a daughter Jada.</p>
<p>She retired for a first time in May, 2007 and gave birth to her daughter before staging a remarkable comeback in 2009 which ended in her triumph at the US Open which she successfully defended the following year.</p>
<p>Clijsters also won the Australian Open in 2011, the same year she topped the world rankings for the first time in five years.</p>
<p>But she has increasingly been dogged by injuries which caused her to draw down the curtain on the clay-court season and concentrate instead on the London Olympics and the US Open.</p>

<p>Set in the summer of 1985, the coming-of-age film centers on a teenage boy obsessed with the game and hip-hop and a family vacation that changes everything. Sarandon’s involvement is a logical extension of her much publicized love of the game: The Oscar-winning actress launched SPiN in New York City and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/janelevere/2012/05/11/susan-sarandon-discusses-her-musician-envy-passion-for-ping-pong-and-summer-plans/" rel="nofollow">recently told</a> <em>Forbes</em> that she plans to franchise the program to other cities like L.A.</p>
<p>With the Olympics coming up this summer, ping pong (aka table tennis) will get some additional love. All events at the Games will take the form of a knockout competition and will take place from Saturday 28 July to Wednesday 8 August 2012 .</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shawn_johnson_headshot.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10428" title="shawn_johnson_headshot" src="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shawn_johnson_headshot-150x150.jpg" alt="Gymnast Shawn Johnson" width="150" height="150" /></a>Athletes are not immune to having negative body image concerns or being vulnerable to bodysnarking. Twenty-year-old Shawn Johnson has a highly decorated career as a gymnast. She won three silver medals and one gold at the 2008 Olympic Games and is making a run at the 2012 Olympics. And she&#8217;s weighing in on her recent weight loss.</p>
<p>In gymnastics, where body frame matters, Johnson was always cast against type. Her 4-9 frame was more fireplug than sprite and comparisons to the taller, leaner Nastia Liukin were inevitable.</p>
<p>This week, Johnson is making headlines not so much for her stellar athletic ability, but for losing 25 pounds. At the Olympic Media Summit in Dallas on Monday, the gymnast shared her weight loss story.  In a sport where struggles with anorexia and bulimia aren&#8217;t unusual, Johnson&#8217;s message about body image resonates.</p>
<p>After three years away from international competition, Johnson had packed on a few pounds.  She said people were accustomed to seeing her with 6% total body fat, not look like a normal chocolate cake, ice-cream eating teenager. &#8220;At my heaviest all the tabloids said some pretty hurtful things,&#8221; said Johnson, who lost the weight launching an Olympic comeback.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/gymnastics/story/2012-05-14/shawn-johnson-loses-weight-speaks-out-body-image/54959326/1">USATODAY</a> spoke to Johnson at the Media Summit and she said “I was always on top. I wasn’t used to being the critic’s choice.” The experience made her more resilient, teaching her “how to stay strong when other people don’t want you to (succeed).”</p>
<p>She went on to say,”I was at the Olympic Games winning medals and I still doubted my image. I doubted what I looked like. That’s sad. Girls should be taught different than that. I think everyone should be taught different than that.”</p>
<p>Thanks for speaking out Shawn &#8211; a gold medal for promoting healthy body image!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spending hours every day on the driving range and the rest of your time traveling the world with the LPGA doesn&#8217;t leave a girl a lot of time to score a prom date.</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old Lexi Thompson, a card-carrying member of the LPGA, posted a video on her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lexi/app_317494768322881">Facebook page</a> last month asking for a date to take her to the prom on May 18. But not just any guy could make the cut. She was looking for a man in uniform. &#8220;For my date, I&#8217;m looking for somebody special and somebody who I respect, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m choosing a guy from the service,&#8221; the golfer said on the video.</p>
<p>In addition to military service, guys must be between 18-20 years old. Though not a requirement, her Facebook page says it&#8217;s a plus if&nbsp;the guy is&nbsp;6 feet tall or more since she&#8217;ll be trading in her golf spikes for heels.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UV7-KFnBe0w?rel=0" width="468" frameborder="0" height="268"></iframe></p>
<p>The winner will be flown to Fort Lauderdale, FL this weekend&nbsp;all expenses paid. So, professional athlete for a date? Check. Free trip? Check. Where do you sign up? Well the contest is now closed but fans helped Thompson choose the winner. On her Twitter timeline, Thompson wrote &#8220;I&#8217;m humbled by the responses. Each story was inspiring &amp; you are all American Heroes in my mind.&#8221;&nbsp; So &#8211; <a href="http://youtu.be/o7ryle1_XCk">who did she pick</a>? Drum roll, please.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>I have decided to go to prom with USMC wounded warrior and Purple Heart recipient Lance Corporal Mark Scott from Naperville, IL. Mark&#8217;s story was simply amazing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thompson became the youngest winner in LPGA history when she won the Navistar LPGA Classic last September at only 16 years old. Two weeks later, the tour approved her petition to join full time, waiving its policy that members be at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>All the career stuff takes a backseat, however, as Thompson preps for her big night. Again, the busy teen looks to social media for help. Fans can create an inspiration board on <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/266556871665311462/">Pinterest</a> with their favorite prom styles and even win a bag of designer goodies (deadline is 11:59 EDT May 16, 2001). For updates or to ask questions, follow Thompson on Twitter @Lexi and follow #Lexiprom</p>
<p>Pretty cool, huh?&nbsp; Have fun, Lexi!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="See Mommy" href="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/j0431278.jpg"><img style="float: left;" src="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/j0431278.thumbnail.jpg" alt="See Mommy" hspace="6" vspace="5" /></a> More and more, elite female athletes are taking on a challenge greater than sports. They&#8217;re returning to the competitive world of sports while juggling motherhood.</p>
<p>Soccer moms have long led the charge. The U.S. Women&#8217;s National Team has consistently featured mothers on its roster since 1994, when Joy Fawcett became the first &#8220;Soccer Mom&#8221; to give birth and continue playing at the highest levels of international soccer. Carla Overbeck and Danielle Fotopoulos also had kids while on the U.S. team, and more recently, three moms have played for the USA in defenders Kate Markgraf (mother of Keegan), Christie Rampone (mother of Riley and Reece) and Tina Frimpong (mother of MacKenzie). Though retired from competitive play, Mia Hamm joined the Soccer Moms Club when she and husband Nomar Garciaparra welcomed twin daughters in 2007. Four years ago, Brandi Chastain became mom to little Connor and three years ago Julie Foudy, former captain of the US Women&#8217;s soccer team, had a baby girl named Isabel. Former captain <a href="http://www.kristinelilly13.com" target="_blank">Kristine Lilly</a> returned to play after daughter Sidney was born. She retired from professional soccer at the beginning of 2011 and gave birth to another daughter.</p>
<p>Obviously, competitive women aren&#8217;t waiting until their athletic careers are over to start families. And while the physical and emotional challenges of motherhood can be difficult, most athlete moms wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. <a title="Lisa Leslie Mother’s Day" href="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/leslie_mothersday.jpg"><img style="float: left;" src="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/leslie_mothersday.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Lisa Leslie Mother’s Day" hspace="5" vspace="6" /></a>WNBA player <a href="http://www.lisaleslie9.com" target="_blank">Lisa Leslie</a> sat out a season with the Los Angeles Sparks to give birth to a daughter but she returned to the pro team for a year and had a great season before giving birth to baby #2 and retiring. Leslie&#8217;s teammate, MVP and Rookie of the Year Candace Parker is also a new mom enjoying baby Laila while playing in both the Euroleague and the WNBA. Other WNBA moms share their favorite Mother&#8217;s Day memories on <a href="http://www.wnba.com/features/mothersday_090508.html" target="_blank">WNBA.com.</a> But Parker and Leslie are far from the first WNBA stars to have their basketball careers impacted by pregnancy. In previous seasons, <a href="http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/sheryl_swoopes/index.html">Sheryl Swoopes</a>, <a href="http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/tina_thompson/index.html">Tina Thompson</a>, <a href="http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/taj_mcwilliams-franklin/index.html">Taj McWilliams-Franklin</a> and others have missed time, and occasionally entire seasons, to focus on their families.</p>
<p>Pitcher <a href="http://www.jenniefinch.com" target="_blank">Jennie Finch</a> has a son named Ace with husband Casey Daigle and she competed with the Women&#8217;s National Softball Team at the Beijing Olympics and until recently played for the Chicago Bandits. Her second son Diesel arrived last summer.</p>
<p>When the U.S. women&#8217;s hockey team beat Finland to win the bronze medal at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games, forward Jenny Potter skated around the rink in celebration with her then 5-year-old daughter Madison in her arms. Potter&#8217;s daughter was a fixture at the rink at an early age. A week after Madison was born in January 2001, Jenny was skating again. Three months later, she was back playing for the U.S. women&#8217;s hockey team in the world championships. What&#8217;s even more impressive is that Jenny did it all again. Just 83 days after having her second child, Potter helped the 2007 U.S. Women&#8217;s National Team to a 9-0 victory over Kazakhstan in the opening game of the 2007 IIIHF Women&#8217;s World Championship. <a title="Lindsay Davenport &amp; Jagger" href="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/davenport_baby.jpg"><img style="float: left;" src="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/davenport_baby.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Lindsay Davenport &amp; Jagger" hspace="6" vspace="5" /></a></p>
<p>Tennis player Lindsay Davenport had an amazing comeback after giving birth to her son Jagger. Just three months after the birth of her first child, Davenport became an instant and almost shocking success winning a number of high profile tournaments. She recently gave birth to her second child. Kim Clisjters came out of retirement after her daughter was born and famously won the U.S. Open as an unseeded player.</p>
<p>Other images from the world of women&#8217;s sports clearly show the tide has turned. Legendary Czech cross county skier Katerina Neumannova collapsed on her knees at the finish line after winning gold in the 30-kilometre race at the 2006 Turin Olympics, her poles askew as she hugged her two-year-old daughter, Lucie. <a title="Paula Radcliffe" href="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/paularadcliffe300.jpg"><img style="float: left;" src="http://prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/paularadcliffe300.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Paula Radcliffe" hspace="6" vspace="5" /></a>Former Ironman world champion Lori Bowden placed second at Ironman Austria, just 10 months after giving birth to her son Tyson. And pro cyclist Sue Palmar-Komar, a 2002 Commonwealth Games silver medallist, at age 41, had a sibling for her seven-year-old daughter Trinity. And who can forget long distance runner Paula Radcliffe who won the New York Marathon months after giving birth to daugher Isla. Kara Goucher is the newest marathon mom having completed the Boston race last month six months after having her son.</p>
<p>On the long list of athlete moms is Gold medal-winning swimmer Dara Torres, who made an amazing comeback while mothering toddler Tessa, and fellow swimmer Summer Sanders who is married to three-time Olympic skier Erik Schlopy with whom she has a daughter and a son.</p>
<p>Most of these working moms admit they can&#8217;t do it alone. And while their spouses and families pitch in, they are also assisted by their leagues and teams. Potter said USA Hockey provides helpful financial assistance during Olympic years. And before the Women&#8217;s United Soccer Association (WUSA) folded, the league mandated that home teams must provide child care for the mothers on visiting teams. The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) takes things to a whole new level. Since 1993, the LPGA has operated the LPGA Child Development Center, which travels to more than 25 tournaments per year. Bardine May, the Center&#8217;s director, said the LPGA was motivated to provide child care so that its athletes didn&#8217;t have to choose between playing the game and having a family.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of mothers in this world. There are professionals and homemakers. Some are fashionable, some conservative, some are modern and some are cool. Fortunately some are competitive athletes as well.</p>
<p>Be sure to tell YOUR mom how much you appreciate her this Mother&#8217;s Day.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/paige.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10411" title="paige" src="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/paige-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Remember last year when <a href="http://www.prettytough.com/is-high-school-ready-for-girls'-wrestling/">a male high school wrestler forfeited</a> a round in the state championships rather than wrestle a girl?  This time it&#8217;s a high school baseball team in Phoenix forfeiting the championship because their opponent&#8217;s second baseman is a girl. In both cases, religious beliefs were cited as the reason.</p>
<p>Who is at the center of this latest controversy? Freshman Paige Sultzbach, who played softball and volleyball in junior high, tried out for the <a href="http://www.mesaprep.org/">Mesa Preparatory Academy</a> baseball team because there wasn&#8217;t a varsity softball team.  She&#8217;s a talented player but isn&#8217;t bigger, better or more intimidating than any of her teammates. In fact she&#8217;s pretty much an average 15-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The Arizona Charter Athletic Association state championship baseball game was scheduled to be played Thursday night between Mesa Prep and Our Lady of Sorrows Academy. But Our Lady of Sorrows said its boys would not compete against a team with a girl and forfeited the game &#8211; and the state title &#8211; to Mesa Prep.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a Catholic school, we promote the ideal of forming and educating boys and girls separately during the adolescent years, especially in physical education,” Our Lady of Sorrows said in a statement, <a href="http://www.azfamily.com/news/Phoenix-school-refuses-to-play-baseball-against-a-girl-151049865.html">according to CNN affiliate KTVK</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teaching our boys to treat ladies with deference, we choose not to place them in an athletic competition where proper boundaries can only be respected with difficulty,&#8221; the statement continued. &#8220;Our school aims to instill in our boys a profound respect for women and girls.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div>
<p>Our Lady of Sorrows is run by the U.S. branch of the Society of Saint Pius X which claims to run 88 schools worldwide. The group represents conservative, traditional priests who broke from the Catholic Church in the 1980s. According to a spokesman, the school is not part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix and Pope Benedict XVI has declared that the society has no canonical status.</p>
<p>Sultzbach&#8217;s mother, Pamela Sultzbach, believes her daughter and the Mesa Prep Monsoons were done a disservice.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is not a contact sport. It shouldn&#8217;t be an issue. It wasn&#8217;t that they were afraid they were going to hurt or injure her, it&#8217;s that (they believe) that a girl&#8217;s place is not on a field,&#8221; <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/sports/preps/se/articles/2012/05/09/20120509school-balks-over-having-face-girl-state-title-game.html#ixzz1uYhsiYD5">Pamela Sultzbach told the Arizona Republic</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I respect their views, but it&#8217;s a bit out of the 18th century,&#8221; Amy Arnold, Mesa Prep&#8217;s athletic director, told the Republic.</p>
<p>Even the 18th century was more <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21547230">tolerant </a>than Our Lady of Sorrows. If their adolescent boys don’t know the difference between playing sports and hooking up, maybe their educational methods should be revisited.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.themarysue.com/girl-wont-play-baseball/">The Mary Sue writes</a>:  &#8220;It’s almost sounds like telling women to cover up so men don’t grope them. No, just don’t grope them. Same thing here – just play sports.&#8221;</p>
<div>
<p>Mesa Prep and Our Lady of Sorrows played twice during the regular season, but Sultzbach sat out, as they were away games  and she felt a need to respect the rules of the home team. The final, however, was scheduled at Phoenix College on a neutral field and Sultzbach wanted to play.</p>
<p>Despite being hailed as state champions, Pamela Sultzbach believes Mesa Prep missed something.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This team has worked so hard,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;re undefeated. They had one game left. At our school, we&#8217;re taught that when you start something, you complete it, and they weren&#8217;t done.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nancy Hogshead-Makar, senior director of advocacy for the Women&#8217;s Sports Foundation, said <a href="http://espn.go.com/high-school/story/_/id/7918253/girl-baseball-player-15-cited-opponent-forfeit-phoenix">the school&#8217;s decision to forfeit doesn&#8217;t aid its own students</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In real life, these boys are going to be competing against the girls for jobs, for positions in graduate programs or in trade schools,&#8221; Hogshead-Makar said. &#8220;In every other area of their life, they are going to be competing side by side.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Were the boys right to forfeit?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dallascowboycheer2_tn.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10403" title="dallascowboycheer2_tn" src="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dallascowboycheer2_tn-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Fifty-five year-old grandmother of two <a href="http://www.foxsportssouthwest.com/05/05/12/Grandma-auditions-for-Cowboys-Cheerleade/msn_landing.html?blockID=724042&amp;#38;feedID=4680">Sharon Simmons </a>has some serious swag. Plus, she&#8217;s a prime example that you&#8217;re never too old to go after your dreams.  Simmons almost tried out for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders 33 years ago but was sidetracked by motherhood and other responsibilities. Rather than pack the lifelong dream away for good, she thought &#8220;why not now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Last Saturday, Simmons showed up with hundreds of other (mostly younger) hopefuls wearing a midriff-bearing top, ready to cheer her heart out for the Dallas Cowboys. If she makes the squad she will 56 at the start of the 2012 football season and the oldest NFL cheerleader in history. The previous cheerleader to hold the &#8220;oldest&#8221; title was 43-year-old Laura Vikmanis of the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
<p>Simmons, however, isn&#8217;t your average granny sitting at home knitting socks and baking pies. She works in commercial real estate, is an author, an actress and fitness competitor who entered her first fitness contest at the age of 50. She has already won nine of the 20 competitions she has entered (which explains why she rocks such a mean six-pack at age 55.) To help compete in the audition, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/grandmother-auditions-dallas-cowboys-cheerleader-134227521.html">Yahoo Sports</a> reports that Simmons hired a former Cowboys cheerleader to help her get ready for the tryouts at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas.</p>
<p>Auditions are ongoing and no word yet on whether Simmons made the squad, but the Cowboys should seriously think about hiring her. She&#8217;s an inspiration to all and a great reminder that as long as you believe in yourself, you&#8217;re never too old to go after what you want.</p>
<p>Hearing the story of Simmons&#8217; journey made me realize there are probably dreams I&#8217;ve stored away that can be revisited.  What about you? Any dreams you&#8217;ve been putting off? Do you think she&#8217;s too old to go after her dreams?</p>
