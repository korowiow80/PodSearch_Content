<p>At the time of this podcast release (March 3, 2012), I&#8217;m offering a <strong>free 30 days&#8217; access to the Master The MCAT program</strong>, and all of the Study Techniques and Dr. Dan&#8217;s personal MCAT notes for positive reviews in iTunes, YouTube, and Facebook. You can get 10 days&#8217; access for a positive review in each place, for a total of 30.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re just now finding this podcast months or years from the release date, you should still write the positive review! You&#8217;d be surprised how often only grumpy people fill out reviews so it will take a lot more positive ones than I ever thought to balance that out.</p>

<p>I look forward to your participation in the Medical Mastermind Community from that point forward!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 35: Did you know there will be sociology, psychology and an increased emphasis on critical thinking and reasoning skills on the new MCAT? Well, some of the changes are already in effect and have been for a few years!</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this episode, Dr. Dan explains the why, what and when of the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/blog/mcat"><span style="color: #0000ff;">new 2015 MCAT changes</span></a></span> that are coming.</p>
<h1>Why change the new 2015 MCAT?</h1>
<p>The AAMC cites that increasing population diversity and new medical science have spurred their changes. Read their full recommendations here:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://premedicaluniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/The-New-2015-MCAT-Changes.pdf">The New 2015 MCAT Changes</a></h3>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">What will the MCAT changes be?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">A new psychological, sociological and biological foundations of behavior sections will be included, according the above report.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, an increased emphasis on Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills will be placed. Of course, these have been tested for many years in various ways. Interestingly, in 2009, the AAMC released a book that revealed<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/blog/mcat"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the 4 cognitive skills </span></a></span>being used to test every MCAT passage.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">The 4 cognitive skills ALWAYS being tested in any MCAT passage are:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Comprehension</li>
<li>Incorporation</li>
</ol>
<p>Strikingly, only 25% of these questions types (1/4) require any previous knowledge to answer the question; no wonder the literature majors do so well on Verbal Reasoning!</p>
<h2>Can you name the three cognitive skills that require NO OUTSIDE INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>If not, you&#8217;re apparently like most students who take the MCAT. No MCAT prep company really uses these cognitive skills, published by the AAMC itself &#8211; who writes the MCAT, to teach people about the MCAT.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time you learn about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/blog/mcat"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Master The MCAT program</span></a></span>, brought to you exclusively from the Medical Mastermind Community.

<p>In this episode, Dr. Dan breaks his usual format in order to answer listener questions.</p>
<h1>Premed Questions and Answers</h1>
<p>You have to listen to the podacst to get the answers, but here are the questions that he addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have any new tips and tricks regarding MCAT prep classes?</li>
<li>I got a 24 on the AAMC MCAT test #3 and have one month to study for the MCAT. Shall I go for it?</li>
<li>I received an F in Physics in undergrad, but then got an A later in grad school. Do you think it will seriously affect my chances of getting into medical school?</li>
<li>If I upgrade my subscription in the Medical Mastermind Community, what CD&#8217;s will I receive? Where is the CD shipping schedule?</li>
<li>I&#8217;m overwhelmed by the amount of material inside the Mastermind Community and on the Mindmap CD. Do I have to read it all?</li>
<li>Thank you for giving me feedback on my personal statement. Should I comment on the philosophy of osteopathic medicine in my DO application?</li>
</ol>

	If I upgrade my subscription in the Medical Mastermind Community, what CD's will I receive? Where is the CD shipping schedule?
	I'm overwhelmed by the amount of material inside the Mastermind Community and on the Mindmap CD. Do I have to read it all?
	Thank you for giving me feedback on my personal statement. Should I comment on the philosophy of osteopathic medicine in my DO application?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 26: Learn the &#8220;Master Key&#8221; to taking notes and converting them for the Free Recall Study Method. Dr. Dan discovered it independently and, years later, found that he was not alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this episode, I&#8217;m going to tell you exactly how to prepare your notes from class and employ the free recall method. Something like one or two weeks before your exams to give you a serious boost to your exams scores. Now this is no BS, this is no hype. I&#8217;m just excited about it. Apollo audio books actually uses this exact same format which I discovered on my own as a pre med in all of their professional medical school audio courses. And right now, I&#8217;m in negotiations with Princeton review for you guys, to get them to create a full blown MCAT version.</p>
<p><span id="more-1203"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight only notes or passages that you DON&#8221;T ALREADY KNOW</li>
<li>Record these high yield notes in a Question-Pause-Answer format</li>
<li>Listen to them throughout the day</li>
</ul>
<p>But you do not have to wait one or two years. By then you may already be in medical school. I truly hope you are. I&#8217;m going to teach you right now, exactly how to use the wisdom behind this study method in your daily operations of undergrad courses. And for your MCAT review. You do not have to wait. Let&#8217;s get started now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to start of explaining this format by exactly what kind of pressures and needs triggered me to discover this secret on my own. Going back to the time when I got out of the army and took on a job as a phlebotomist, for two years straight, as a full time student in pre med I worked from Friday afternoon at five until Sunday at midnight on call to be a phlebotomist and drive around a tri-state area covering hundreds of miles and drawing blood in nursing homes usually stat orders that didn&#8217;t necessarily qualify these elderly people to go to the hospital but couldn&#8217;t wait until Monday. I sort of cover these places on the weekend. Which meant I drove hundreds of miles every weekend, the troll truck I was in used to hurt my back, the whole story, you get the idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>MCAT STUDY TECHNIQUE</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge as a pre med though, was I really needed study time. That was a problem because starting Friday afternoon, my pager would start going off and I couldn&#8217;t sit in front of the book. So that was a big pressure situation. I made decent money back then, and this was around 2000 when I got out and was a pre med and for the next two years before medical school. And while I was actually driving, I got paid mileage too on top of $9 an hour. It worked out to something like $17 an hour if I was on the road. It wasn&#8217;t bad money at all. And with my military benefits, I could afford to live on my own in an apartment and things like that, you know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I was kind of strived for cash, totally strived for time, yet I need to ace my courses. And I did pretty much ace my courses. I did graduate with 3.85 magna cum laude at MI University in Biology. So that was pretty good. I figured out a way, to study without sitting in front of books. It did require some preparation during the week. But let me go through that process of the things I tried and what worked and what didn&#8217;t. First of all, the funny thing, and fun thing about this is, my portable recording device was a cassette tape recorder. This was only 11 years ago from the time of this recording. Now I&#8217;m using a – several hundred dollar digital device with a microphone and a podcasting studio at my home. Things have changed a lot. And there are some specific advantages to the digital voice recorders that are out there in Wall Mart and Best Buy and everything right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>MCAT MP3s<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay. So when I first decided that, &#8220;Hey, recording my notes and reading them on to a recorder and then hitting the road and driving around, and doing the blood draws that I had to do was a great idea. That&#8217;s exactly what I did. I first started by just taking my notes that I had written in class from Monday through Thursday and try by Thursday night to be caught up reading all of them verbatim into this cassette recorder. There were a couple of problems with that. Okay. The first problem was that I wasn&#8217;t filtering out what was important from what wasn&#8217;t important. And I was reading things in to this recorder that I actually already knew that didn&#8217;t need to be reviewed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the first principle to take home here is do not spend time reviewing things that you already know. Focus on the things you don&#8217;t know. And let me tell you, if you can start that habit now, and continually be asking yourself while you study, &#8220;Do I already know this?&#8221; &#8220;Would I be able to recall this on an exam or not?&#8221; Always be doing that when you&#8217;re spending time reviewing and studying because if an answer is, &#8220;Yes, I already know this, I could answer – I could take questions on this,&#8221; you know. Then move on. Do not waste your time on it. So – and when I very first started as a pre med, after the army, I didn&#8217;t know that yet. So I just read everything. And I spent a lot of time in a car listening to things that I already knew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that was kind of boring. But I thought that was what you were supposed to do. I though you were supposed to review it and hear a bunch of times so it would stick. I didn&#8217;t realize that I&#8217;ve already knew the information, it had already stuck. So learn how to recognize what has already stuck in your memory. Okay. That&#8217;s a huge principle. And that will save you a ton of time. And that&#8217;s a major core principle of what I teach about in my study techniques course. Okay. More about that later. The next important thing I want to tell you about what I learned in the audio recording was that I was simply reading the notes. Okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Free Recall Study Method<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It got really, really boring to listen to. Okay, so what I decided to do was flip it around and do a question because that would keep me engaged, it would make me listen, it would also give me the opportunity to pause the recorder device when I&#8217;m playing it back, and stop and think about the answer for a minute. And that&#8217;s when I began using the free recall method. Many, many times, students all over the world, read the material in the book, they think they got it down because they read it a few times, it&#8217;s so familiar to them, they go and take the test, and they do not score as well as they would like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the world out there, and pod casting land, listen to this, okay, if you do not, turn that information into the from of a question, you are not preparing your brain and your memory recall processes through your neural connections in your head to recall that information on a test. This is why practice test books are important. And we utilize the fire out of them in med school. And you want to know why so many people don&#8217;t do well on the MCAT? It&#8217;s because they save full length practice MCAT test for within the last couple of weeks before they take the exam. They have not appropriately converted their mind into the test taking mode. And that is a super core principle that I would drill into your head in my study techniques course. And I hope this podcast is enough to let you begin experimenting with this idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>ANALOG CASSETTE RECORDER VERSUS DIGITAL RECORDERS</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay. Now, a comparison between the analog cassette tape that I was using back then, and the digital voice recorders that I use now. And that really came out and became affordable when I was in medical school. When – I had a cassette player. And I was listening to something, it was kind of boring, I&#8217;ll say I had a two hour drive, or 45-minute drive, or something like that, maybe when even I was at the gym. I didn&#8217;t do a lot of that then, but I do now. I do study in the gym a lot now. So I&#8217;ve been doing audio recording since studying and learning and filling the gaps throughout my day such as doing laundry and at the gym or drives, for about 11 years now. Okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, I&#8217;ve been doing this for a while, and I discovered that when I&#8217;m listening to something that&#8217;s boring because I already knew it, the old cassette tapes, I could just click skip to the next file. I had to fast forward and then find out where I was. There was a lot of time wasted in fast forwarding and rewinding, fast forward and rewinding. When I got to medical school, the digital recording device, the little hand-held things solved this problem. What I decided to do , is put one question or just 5 questions on one particular audio file. You just hit the record button, and instead of reading a paragraph from your notes, or something you&#8217;ve highlighted in your book, something you have previous identified as, number 1, &#8220;I  don&#8217;t know this material yet,&#8221; and number  2, &#8220;I need to know it for the exam. I need to review this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You look at that paragraph, and instead of just reading it, you turn it around to a question. Okay, if it gives you a formula, don&#8217;t just say, &#8220;The formula for such and such I blank.&#8221; Say, &#8220;What is the formula for such and such?&#8221; Then pause, not pause the recording. Build in a little dead space during the recording of the file for you to answer back when you listen to this later. And then read the answer. And then, I would hit stop. And would stop it. And those little digital devices will save that as an individual mp3 file. Just that one question, or a small group of questions related to a particular topic. All right, the huge advantage is, when you&#8217;re walking your dog, or whatever it is you do, and you&#8217;re studying this audio recording that you made, whenever you listen to it, and you begin to hear the question, you can say, &#8220;Do I know this?&#8221; or &#8220;Do I not know this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure, than when the question is read, and there&#8217;s that blank pause space for you to answer, you click pause on the digital device and you think about it for as long as you want. There is no rush. You&#8217;re studying, it doesn&#8217;t even matter if you walk the dog for 15 minutes and you only did two questions, you were thinking about it and you&#8217;re studying and you are changing the neuro kinetics in your brain to begin to retrieve the information that you&#8217;ve been reading about. It&#8217;s sort of like two different languages. You learn how to speak English, and then when you switch into free recall method, it&#8217;s like having to learn how to speak Spanish. Or something similar to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217; very different when you say, &#8220;Hey I have experienced this material one way, but on a test, I have to experience it a totally different way. And you absolutely need more practice, experience in that other way. Then you probably do reading it in the first place. So I think people have this backwards, and they need to employ the free recall method and take my study techniques course too because there are a ton of other ways to do this besides audio versions. There&#8217;s tons of different kinds of content out there. Some of it does not land itself very well to audio recording.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>OTHER STUDYING TECHNIQUES</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I teach you how to identify the different types of content and several techniques besides audio to use for the other things. A super fun application of separating different questions into different mp3 files on your device, is you get to delete them if you want to. Now personally, I hope that you will contribute to the Medical Mastermind Community. And send me a copy of your questions. Okay. Send me those mp3 files. If you do, I&#8217;ll tell you this, I&#8217;ll give you free account to the Medical Mastermind Community. That&#8217;s where I have the study techniques course, et cetera. If you&#8217;ll really try this, I promise, this offer will not end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>CONTRIBUTION WILL GET YOU A FREE ACCOUNT</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you contribute to the Medical Mastermind Community, with your mp3 files that you use to study for undergraduate courses, and for the MCAT, I will give you a free account to the Medical Mastermind Community. No questions asked, a huge thank you. That&#8217;s what a mastermind community is exactly all about, helping each other out. I would sometimes use 3&#215;5 cards. And when you&#8217;re in medical school, you just have to mix up your study approach sometime just because of the sheer boredom in the hours you spend doing it. So this sounds silly, but I would write out 3&#215;5 cards, sit on the couch and go through them and use very much, the same approach as for digital. Okay. The digital recordings, that is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I knew the question, I would say the answer out loud and use free recall, glance at the back to make sure I was right, and that I didn&#8217;t miss anything. And if I was right, then I would throw the card away. But it got a little funner than that. I would put the trash can kind of far away from me and then sort of try to throw all the card. And if you&#8217;ve ever tried to throw a card, you know, it flies all over the room. I had a lot of fun throwing my 3&#215;5 cards all over the room and making a big mess. When I was done with that study session, I would go pick them up and throw them in the trash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t keep all those to share now. But I do have my notes from undergrad on the Medical Mastermind Community site. So, we&#8217;ve also put together all the reviews that students wrote in medical school for all the medical school test that&#8217;s also there. And we&#8217;re about to do a podcast on that one as well to release for you guys about the medical student notes. And what you do after you get accepted to medical school, but before it actually starts. How can you get ready for that huge transition into the first year of medical school. The comparison of throwing my note cards all over the room to having a digital device is, the digital device will tell you how many files you have in there which are questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s so fun to delete a question after you know it, and watch that number go down, and down and down. It is a way to feel that you&#8217;re on top of your study program and always know exactly how much you have left. So that is the story of how I discovered this particular study technique on my own. And I hope that makes sense to you. So that carried me through undergrad, through the good grades at my pre med school. I did get into medical school only after the second attempt. And in the mastermind community I also explained everything I&#8217;ve learned since. You know, it&#8217;s sort of like capturing the whole process of the medical education journey and saying, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m trying to help the people coming up behind me.&#8221; Most doctors move on and get too busy in their lives. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s only on Medical Mastermind Community. No one does anything like it out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>DISCOVERING APOLLO AUDIO BOOKS</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what I want to do now is tell you about what I discovered with Apollo audio books. Now Apollo audio books is a company that distributes like professional, they charge for mp3 audio review courses. And I was contacted through a friend, through Dr. Brett Ferdinand, author of the Gold Standard MCAT. And Dr. Ferdinand referred Dr. Justin Anderson to me from Apollo audio books. And he said to me, &#8220;Hey, I would like to add my U.S MLE product,&#8221; now that&#8217;s the medical school licensing exam test that you take. He doesn&#8217;t have MCAT stuff. But, &#8220;I would like to provide them with your Medical Mastermind Community membership.&#8221; So we went back and forth for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then finally came up with a distribution agreement. So I&#8217;m no w providing Apollo audio books to the med students. But there&#8217;s nothing like this with the MCAT. The last good MCAT audio review course, this practically, really just mp3, was published in 2002, and funny I didn&#8217;t know about then, because I could have used it, and it was from exam crackers. They have not kept it updated. All over the forums and chat rooms online, people are begging exam crackers to make another one and keep that updated. But they&#8217;re not stepping up to the plate. I have invited them to podcast interviews multiple times, and I can&#8217;t from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They really have great book. And I think they would be a good mastermind community partner with us in our community. But I can&#8217;t hear from them yet. So if you happen to be involved with exam crackers, please pass this on to the bosses, because it&#8217;s not getting pass the secretary. All right, I just wanted to stick that out there because I can&#8217;t seem to solve that problem on my own. So about a month ago, I had a conversation with Princeton review trying to beg them, &#8220;Hey, will you fund the creation on an MCAT audio review, a full blown one in this exact format of Apollo audio books? And if you want to hear that format, then you need to go to medicalmastermindcommunity.com.&#8221; Medicalmastermindcommunity.com. You can sign up for free zip file that has like – I don&#8217;t remember how many hours of medical school topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what I&#8217;ve decided to do in the meantime, until we can get Princeton review on board with creating a product like this for you, is I&#8217;m going to start making my own mp3 audio product that is full blown for you guys. Every week, I will be sitting down on a teleconference software. If you join the mastermind community, of course you could listen in, and ask questions and make it interactive. And I also have more advanced students, those that are getting accepted into medical school and those about to that have been in the mastermind community a long time. They&#8217;re beginning to host their own teleconferences in the site, the mastermind community that are on MCAT topics. For example, next month, we&#8217;re going to be doing verbal reasoning tactics one Saturday morning. The next week, MCAT genetics, the next week, MCAT microbiology. So that&#8217;s going to kind of round out some biological sciences and verbal reasoning topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then I&#8217;m going to get into specific stuff during the week. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, or if you want full access to the online versions of the study techniques course, my two video, and two curriculum set of speed reading, and the test taking skill seminar that we do with Princeton review, than you need to go to medicalmastermindcommunity.com. Everyone that goes through those materials says they&#8217;re very happy with it. And it is a monthly recurring membership. But you can cancel after a month if you want. But before you cancel I&#8217;d encourage you to get on one of the live calls with us and see what we can really do for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the magic happens live. If you like these podcasts, you&#8217;re going to like a live stuff ten times better. Good luck out there on your next exam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Medical Mastermind Community has no affiliation with any of these test name services. All the trademarks are their own. A simple way to get to all the websites are to either type in medical school podcast, or medicalmastermindcommunity.com</p>

		<itunes:summary>Episode 26: Learn the "Master Key" to taking notes and converting them for the Free Recall Study Method. Dr. Dan discovered it independently and, years later, found that he was not alone.



In this episode, I'm going to tell you exactly how to prepare your notes from class and employ the free recall method. Something like one or two weeks before your exams to give you a serious boost to your exams scores. Now this is no BS, this is no hype. I'm just excited about it. Apollo audio books actually uses this exact same format which I discovered on my own as a pre med in all of their professional medical school audio courses. And right now, I'm in negotiations with Princeton review for you guys, to get them to create a full blown MCAT version.



	Highlight only notes or passages that you DON"T ALREADY KNOW
	Record these high yield notes in a Question-Pause-Answer format
	Listen to them throughout the day

But you do not have to wait one or two years. By then you may already be in medical school. I truly hope you are. I'm going to teach you right now, exactly how to use the wisdom behind this study method in your daily operations of undergrad courses. And for your MCAT review. You do not have to wait. Let's get started now.

&#160;

I want to start of explaining this format by exactly what kind of pressures and needs triggered me to discover this secret on my own. Going back to the time when I got out of the army and took on a job as a phlebotomist, for two years straight, as a full time student in pre med I worked from Friday afternoon at five until Sunday at midnight on call to be a phlebotomist and drive around a tri-state area covering hundreds of miles and drawing blood in nursing homes usually stat orders that didn't necessarily qualify these elderly people to go to the hospital but couldn't wait until Monday. I sort of cover these places on the weekend. Which meant I drove hundreds of miles every weekend, the troll truck I was in used to hurt my back, the whole story, you get the idea.

&#160;
MCAT STUDY TECHNIQUE
&#160;

The challenge as a pre med though, was I really needed study time. That was a problem because starting Friday afternoon, my pager would start going off and I couldn't sit in front of the book. So that was a big pressure situation. I made decent money back then, and this was around 2000 when I got out and was a pre med and for the next two years before medical school. And while I was actually driving, I got paid mileage too on top of $9 an hour. It worked out to something like $17 an hour if I was on the road. It wasn't bad money at all. And with my military benefits, I could afford to live on my own in an apartment and things like that, you know.

&#160;

So I was kind of strived for cash, totally strived for time, yet I need to ace my courses. And I did pretty much ace my courses. I did graduate with 3.85 magna cum laude at MI University in Biology. So that was pretty good. I figured out a way, to study without sitting in front of books. It did require some preparation during the week. But let me go through that process of the things I tried and what worked and what didn't. First of all, the funny thing, and fun thing about this is, my portable recording device was a cassette tape recorder. This was only 11 years ago from the time of this recording. Now I'm using a – several hundred dollar digital device with a microphone and a podcasting studio at my home. Things have changed a lot. And there are some specific advantages to the digital voice recorders that are out there in Wall Mart and Best Buy and everything right now.

&#160;
MCAT MP3s

&#160;

Okay. So when I first decided that, "Hey, recording my notes and reading them on to a recorder and then hitting the road and driving around, and doing the blood draws that I had to do was a great idea. That's exactly what I did. I first started by just taking my notes that I had written in class from Monday through Thursday an</itunes:summary>

<p></p>
<h1>MCAT Physics</h1>
<h2>Vectors</h2>
<p>Scalar quantities, such as temperature, have magnitude only and are specified by a number with a unit, 67 degrees Celsius and obey the rules of ordinary algebra.  Vectors, such as displacement, have both <strong>magnitude and direction</strong>, six meters west and obey the special rules of vector algebra.</p>
<h3>X and Y Coordinates</h3>
<p>Two vectors A and B may be added geometrically by drawing them to a common scale and placing them head to tail.  The vector connecting the tail of A to the head of B is the sum vector.  To subtract B from A, reverse the direction of B and then add to A.  The component A<sub>X</sub> and A<sub>Y</sub> of any vector A are the perpendicular projections of A on the coordinate axes.</p>
<h3>Pythagoras&#8217; theorem</h3>
<p>Analytically, the components are given by <em>A<sub>X</sub>=A (cos theta)</em> and <em>A<sub>Y</sub>=A (sine theta)</em>.  Given the component, we can reconstruct the vector from:  A is given by the square root of the quantity, <em>A<sub>X</sub><sup>2</sup> + A<sub>Y</sub><sup>2</sup></em>, which is a derivation of the Pythagoras&#8217; theorem.</p>
<h2>Kinematics</h2>
<p>The motion of a body is described by giving its position or displacement, its velocity and its acceleration.  The average speed is defined as the distance traveled divided by the elapsed time.  The average velocity is the displacement vector divided by the elapsed time.</p>
<h3>Displacement</h3>
<p>Displacement is the vector representing the position of an object relative to its position at some chosen earlier time, or its point of origin.  Whereas speed is a scalar quantity, velocity is a vector.  The instantaneous velocity whose magnitude is the same as the instantaneous speed is the average velocity taken over an indefinitely short period of time.</p>
<h3>Acceleration</h3>
<p>Velocity as well other qualities describing motion are always measured with respect to some frame of reference.  Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.  The change of velocity divided by the elapsed time, it is a vector.  If an object moves in a straight line with constant acceleration, the velocity, <em>V</em>, and the acceleration, <em>A</em>, are related to the initial velocity <em>V<sub>0</sub></em> and the displacement, <em>D</em>, and the time, <em>T</em>, by the equations-<em>V=V<sub>0</sub> + AT</em>; D, the displacement, equals <em>V<sub>0</sub>T + ½AT<sup>2</sup></em>; <em>V<sup>2</sup>=V<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2AD</em>.  The mean velocity equals <em>V + V<sub>0</sub>/2</em>.  Objects allow to fall freely without air resistance all fall with the same constant acceleration, <em>G=</em>9.8 meters/second<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<h1>Motion and force.</h1>
<h2>Newton&#8217;s 3 Laws</h2>
<h3>Number 1</h3>
<p>Newton&#8217;s three laws of motion are the basic laws explaining motion.  Newton&#8217;s first law states that if the net force on an object is zero, the object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion remains in motion in a straight line with constant velocity.  The tendency of a body to resist a change in motion is called inertia.  Mass is a measure of inertia.  Weight refers to the force of gravity on an object.</p>
<h3>Number 2</h3>
<p>Newton&#8217;s second law states that the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.  <em>F=ma</em>, where <em>F</em> is the force, <em>m</em> is the mass, and <em>A</em>, the acceleration.  Force, which is a vector, is a push or a pull.  More precisely, Newton&#8217;s second law can be used as a definition of force as that action which is capable of accelerating an object.  Net force refers to the vector sum of all forces acting on a body.<strong> </strong>The force of gravity acting on a body is the product of its mass times the acceleration of gravity.<strong></strong></p>
<h3>Number 3</h3>
<p>Newton&#8217;s third law states that when every one body exerts a force on a second body, the second exerts an equal force on the first in the opposite direction.  A consistent set of units must always be used when making calculations.  SI unit s are the standard ones used for scientific work and these include the meter, kilogram and second.</p>
<h2>Friction</h2>
<p>When two bodies are in contact or slide over one another, the force of friction each exerts on the other can be written force of friction equals <em>mu N</em>, where <em>N</em> is the normal force, the force each body exerts on the other perpendicular to the surface in contact.  Mu is the coefficient of kinetic friction if the bodies are moving relative to each other.  If they are not moving, the above equation gives the maximum friction force where mu is the coefficient of static friction.</p>
<h2>Projectile motion</h2>
<p>That of an object moving through the air can be analyzed as two separate motions in the horizontal and vertical directions.  If air resistance can be ignored, the horizontal motion is at constant velocity where the vertical motion is uniformly accelerated and is the same as for the body falling vertically under the action of gravity.</p>
<h2>Circular motion and gravitation</h2>
<p>Angular quantities are defined in analogy with linear quantities.  Angles can be measured in degrees, revolutions or radians, where two pi radians is equal to one revolution, which is equal to 360 degrees.  A particle moving with constant speed, <em>V</em>, in a circle of radius, <em>R</em>, has a linear centripetal, which means towards the center acceleration.  That acceleration is given by <em>V<sup>2</sup>/R</em>.  Because the velocity vector is continually changing in direction, that&#8217;s why there is an acceleration.  A force acting towards the center is thus needed to keep a particle revolving in a circle.  If the particle is revolving in a circle with non-uniform speed, it will have both centripetal and tangential linear acceleration.</p>
<h2>Gravity</h2>
<p>Newton&#8217;s law of universal gravitation states that every body in the universe attracts every other body with a force proportional to the product of their two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  It is this force of gravity that keeps the moon in its orbit around the Earth and the planets in their orbits around the sun.  The dynamics of rotation is analogous to the dynamic of linear motion.  Force can be replaced by torque which is defined as the product of force times the perpendicular distance from the pivot point.</p>
<h2>Inertia</h2>
<p>Mass is replaced by the moment of inertia which depends not only on the mass of the body, but also on how the mass is distributed about the axis of rotation.</p>
<h2>Angular Acceleration</h2>
<p>And linear acceleration is replaced by angular acceleration.  So, instead of seeing <em>F=ma</em> as we previously saw, now we have the rotational equivalent of Newton&#8217;s second law, which is <em>tau</em>, the torque force, equals <em>I</em>, the moment inertia times <em>alpha</em>, the angular acceleration.</p>
<h2>Center of Gravity</h2>
<p>The center of gravity of a body is that point at which the force of gravity can be considered to act for purposes of determining the motion of the body as a whole.  The complete motion of a body can be described as the translational motion of its center of gravity, plus the rotation about its center of gravity.</p>
<h2>Equilibrium</h2>
<p>We will now discuss bodies in equilibrium.  A body at rest or one in uniform motion at constant velocity is said to be in equilibrium.  The determination of the forces within a structure at rest is the field called statics.  The two necessary conditions for a body to be in equilibrium are:  one, the vector sum of all the forces on it must be zero and, two, the sum of all the torques calculated about any arbitrary point as axis must also be zero.  It&#8217;s important when doing statics problems to apply the equilibrium conditions to only one body at a time.</p>
<p>A body in static equilibrium is said to be in stable, unstable or neutral equilibrium, depending on whether a slight displacement leads to a return to the original position, that would be stable equilibrium, or further movement, which would be unstable, or a rest in the new position, which would be neutral equilibrium.  An object in stable equilibrium is also said to be in balance.</p>
<h2>Elasticity</h2>
<p>Hooke&#8217;s law applies to many elastic solids, and states that the change in length of an object is proportional to the applied force.  If the force is too great, the object will exceed its elastic limit, which means it will no longer return to its original shape when the distorting force is removed.  If the force is even greater, the ultimate strength of the material can be exceeded and the object fractures.</p>
<h2>Stress</h2>
<p>The force per unit area acting on a body is called the stress.  And the resulting fractional change in length is called the strain.  The stress on a body is present within the body and can be of three types-compression, tension and shear.  The ratio of stress to strain is called the elastic modulus of the material.  Young modulus applies for compression and tension and the shear modulus for shear.</p>
<p>Both moduli apply to an object whose volume changes as a result of pressure on all sides.  All three moduli are constants for a given material when distorted within its elastic region.</p>
<p>The subject of statics is especially useful for calculating forces within muscles and bones and in structures such as buildings and bridges.</p>
<h1>Momentum and energy</h1>
<p>The momentum, <em>P</em>, of a body is defined as its mass times its velocity where <em>P=MV</em>.  In terms of momentum, Newton&#8217;s second law can be written, <em>F</em>, the force equals <em><!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->dP</em> over <em><!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->dT</em>, which is the rate of change of a momentum equals the net applied force.</p>
<p>Momentum is a conserved quantity.  The law of conservation of a momentum states that the total momentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.  An isolated system is one on which the net external force is zero.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Work is done on an object by a force when the force moves the object through a distance, <em>D</em>.  If the direction of the force makes an angle, <em>theta</em>, with the direction of motion, the work done by this force is given by <em>W=FD (cos theta)</em>.</p>
<h2>Energy</h2>
<p>Energy is defined as the ability to do work.  Both work and energy are measured in Joules, where one Joule equals one Newton meter.  Kinetic energy is energy of motion.  A body of mass, <em>m</em>, and speed, <em>V</em>, has translational kinetic energy equal to <em>½ MV<sup>2</sup></em>.</p>
<p>An object can have potential energy by virtue of its position or shape.  Examples are gravitational potential energy, which is equal to <em>mgh</em>, where <em>h</em> is the height of the object of mass, <em>m</em>, above an arbitrary reference point.  An object can also have elastic potential energy, such as a compressed spring.  An object can also have chemical, electrical, or nuclear energy.</p>
<p>The change of potential energy of an object when it changes position is defined as the work needed to take it from one position to the other.  The work energy theorem states that the net work done on a body by the net force equals the change in kinetic energy of that body.</p>
<p>The law of conservation of energy states that energy can be transformed from one type to another, but the total energy remains constant.  It is valid even when friction is present since the heat generated by friction can be considered a form of energy.  Momentum is conserved in any collision between objects.  Energy is conserved, too, but kinetic energy only in so-called elastic collisions in which other forms of energy do not change.</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>Power is defined as the rate at which work is done or the rate in which energy is transformed.  The SI unit of power is the watt, where 1 watt equals one Joule per second.</p>
<h1>Fluids</h1>
<p>Now, let us look at fluids.  The three common phases of matter are solid, liquid and gas.  Liquids and gases are collectively called fluids.  Meaning they have the ability to flow.  The density of a material is defined as its mass per unit volume.  Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of the material to the density of water.  Pressure is defined as force per unit area.  The pressure at a depth, <em>h</em>, in a liquid is given by <em>rho gh</em>, where <em>rho</em> is the density of the liquid and <em>g</em> is the acceleration due to gravity.</p>
<p>In addition, if an external pressure is applied to a confined fluid, this pressure is transmitted throughout the fluid.  This is known as Pascal&#8217;s principle.  Pressure is measured using manometer or other types of gauge.  A barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure.  Standard atmospheric pressure, which is the average at sea level, is 1.01 x 10<sup>5</sup> Newton per meter squared.</p>
<h2>Archimedes Principle</h2>
<p>Archimedes principle states that an object submerged wholly or partially in a fluid is bouoyed up by a force equal to the weight of fluid it displaces.  This principle is used in a method to determine specific gravity and explains why objects whose density is less than that of liquid will float in that liquid.</p>
<p>Fluid flow rate is the mass or volume of fluid that passes a given point per unit time.  The equation of continuity states that for an incompressible fluid flowing in an enclosed tube, the product of the velocity of flow and the cross-sectional area of the tube remains constant.  <em>AV</em> is a constant.</p>
<h2>Bernoulli&#8217;s Equation</h2>
<p>Bernoulli&#8217;s equation tells us that where the velocity of a fluid is high, the pressure in it is low.  And where the velocity is low, the pressure is high.  Bernoulli&#8217;s principle explains many common phenomena.  Fluid flow can be characterized either as streamline, sometimes called laminar in which the layers of fluid move smoothly and regularly along paths called streamlines, or it can be characterized as turbulent in which case the flow is not smooth and regular, but it&#8217;s characterized by irregularly shaped whirlpools.</p>
<h2>Viscocity</h2>
<p>Viscosity refers to friction within a fluid that prevents the fluid from flowing freely and is essentially a frictional force between different layers of fluid as they move pass one another.</p>
<p>Temperature and the kinetic theory.  The atomic theory of matter postulates that all matter is made up of tiny entities called atoms.  Some substances are made up of only one type atom, and these are called elements.  Atoms can combine to form molecules and substances made up of a single type of molecule are called compounds.  A substance made up of more than one type of molecule is called a mixture.</p>
<p>Atomic and molecular masses are specified on a scale that&#8217;s compared to Carbon 12.  The distinction between solid, liquid and gases can be attributed to the strength of the attractive forces between the atoms and molecules and depends on their average speed.</p>
<p>Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold a body is.  Thermometers are used to measure temperature on the Celsius, Fahrenhiet and Kelvin scales.  Two standard points on each scale are the freezing point of water, which is zero degrees Celsius, 32 degrees Fahrenhiet, and 273 Kelvin, and the boiling point of water which is 100 degrees Celsius, 212 degrees Fahrenhiet, and 373 degrees Kelvin.  A change in temperature of one Kelvin equals a change of one Celsius degrees or 9/5 Fahrenhiet degrees.</p>
<p>The change of length, <em><!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->L</em>, of a solid when its temperature changes by an amount, <em><!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->T</em>, is directly proportional to the temperature change and to its original length, <em>L<sub>0</sub></em><sub>.</sub> That is <!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->L is equal to <em>alpha L<sub>0</sub> <!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->T</em>, where <em>alpha</em> is the coefficient of linear expansion.</p>
<p>The change in volume of most solids, liquids and gases is proportional to the temperature change and to the original volume, <em>V<sub>0</sub></em>, where <!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]--><em>V</em> is equal to <em>beta V<sub>0</sub> <!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->T</em>.  The coefficient of volume expansion, <em>beta</em>, is approximately equal to 3 times alpha for solids.  Water is unusual because unlike most materials whose volume increases with temperature, its volume actually decreases as the temperature increases from 0 degrees Celsius to 4 degrees Celsius.</p>
<h2>Kinetic Theory of Gases</h2>
<p>According to the kinetic theory of gases, which is based on the idea that a gas is made up molecules that are moving rapidly and at random, the average kinetic energy of the molecule is proportional to the Kelvin temperature.  At any moment, there exists a wide distribution of molecular speeds within a substance.</p>
<h2>Heat</h2>
<p>Thermal energy or internal energy refers to the total energy of all the molecules in a body.  Heat refers to the transfer of energy from one body to another because of a difference of temperature.  Heat is thus measured in energy units such as Joules.  Heat and thermal energy are also sometimes specified in calories or kilocalories where one calorie is equal to 4.18 Joules, and one calorie is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1 degree Celsius.</p>
<h2>Heat Capacity</h2>
<p>The specific heat capacity, <em>C</em>, of a substance is defined as the energy or heat required to change the temperature of unit mass of substance by 1 degree.  In the equation, <em>Q=mc <!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->T</em>, where <em>Q</em> is the heat absorbed or given off, <em><!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->T</em> the temperature rise or decline, and m, the mass of the substance, that is <em>Q=mc <!--[if gte vml 1]> <![endif]-->T</em>.  When heat flows within an isolated system, the heat gained by one part of the system is equal to the heat lost by the other part of the system.</p>
<h3>Calorimetry</h3>
<p>This is the basis for calorimetry, which is the quantitative measurement of heat exchange.  An exchange of energy occurs without a change in temperature whenever substance changes phase.  This happens because the potential energy of the molecules changes as a result of the changes in the relative positions of the molecules.</p>
<h3>Heat of Fusion</h3>
<p>The heat of fusion is the heat required to melt one kilogram of a solid into the liquid phase.  It is also equal to the heat given off when the substance changes from liquid to solid.  The heat of vaporization is the energy required to change one kilogram of a substance from the liquid to the vapor phase.  It is also the energy given off when the substance changes from vapor to liquid.</p>
<h3>Heat Transfer</h3>
<p>Heat is transferred from one place or body to another in three different ways.  In conduction, energy is transferred from higher kinetic energy molecules to a lower kinetic energy neighboring molecules when they collide.  Convection is a transfer of energy by the mass movement of molecules over considerable distances.  Radiation, which does not require the presence of matter, is energy transfer by electromagnetic way, such as from the sun.</p>
<p>All bodies radiate energy in an amount that is proportional to their surface area and to the fourth power of their Kelvin temperature.  The energy radiated or absorbed also depends on the nature of the surface, dark and absorbing versus brightly reflecting, which is characterized by the emissivity.</p>
<h2>The first and second laws of thermodynamics</h2>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system, Q minus the work, W, done by the system.  This is simply a restatement of the conservation of energy and it&#8217;s found to hold for all types of processes.</p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in several equivalent ways.  One, heat flows spontaneously from a hot object to a cold one but not the reverse.  Two, there can be no 100% efficient heat energy.  That is, one that can change a given amount of heat completely into work.  And, three, natural processes tend to move toward a state of greater disorder or greater entropy.  Entropy is a quantitative measure of the disorder of the system.  From statistical point of view, the most probable state of a system is that with the most entropy or disorder.</p>
<h1>Vibrations and waves</h1>
<p>A vibrating object undergoes simple harmonic motion if the restoring force is proportional to the displacement.  In other words, it obeys Hooke&#8217;s law.  The force constant, <em>K</em>, is the ratio of restoring force to the displacement.  The maximum displacement is called the amplitude.  The period, <em>T</em>, is the time required for one complete cycle back and forth and the frequency, <em>F</em>, is the number of cycles per second.  They are related by <em>F=1/T</em>, the period.  The period of vibration for a mass, <em>m</em>, on the end of a spring is given by the following relationship.  <em>T=2 pi square root quantity m/K</em>.</p>
<h2>Harmonic Motion</h2>
<p>Simple harmonic motion is sinusoidal, which means that the displacement as a function of time follows a sine or a cosine curve.  A simple pendulum of length, <em>L</em>, approximates simple harmonic motion if the amplitude is not too great.  Its period is given by, <em>T=2 pi the square root of l/g</em>, where <em>g</em> is the acceleration due to gravity.</p>
<h2>Resonance</h2>
<p>During a vibration, the energy continually alternates between kinetic and potential.  When friction is present, the motion is said to damped.  The displacement decreases in time and the energy is eventually all transformed to heat.  When an oscillating force is applied to a system capable of vibrating, the amplitude of vibration is very large if the frequency of the applied force equals or nearly equals the natural frequency of vibration of the object.  This is called resonance.</p>

MCAT Physics
Vectors
Scalar quantities, such as temperature, have magnitude only and are specified by a number with a unit, 67 degrees Celsius and obey the rules of ordinary algebra.  Vectors, such as displacement, have both magnitude and direction, six meters west and obey the special rules of vector algebra.
X and Y Coordinates
Two vectors A and B may be added geometrically by drawing them to a common scale and placing them head to tail.  The vector connecting the tail of A to the head of B is the sum vector.  To subtract B from A, reverse the direction of B and then add to A.  The component AX and AY of any vector A are the perpendicular projections of A on the coordinate axes.
Pythagoras' theorem
Analytically, the components are given by AX=A (cos theta) and AY=A (sine theta).  Given the component, we can reconstruct the vector from:  A is given by the square root of the quantity, AX2 + AY2, which is a derivation of the Pythagoras' theorem.
Kinematics
The motion of a body is described by giving its position or displacement, its velocity and its acceleration.  The average speed is defined as the distance traveled divided by the elapsed time.  The average velocity is the displacement vector divided by the elapsed time.
Displacement
Displacement is the vector representing the position of an object relative to its position at some chosen earlier time, or its point of origin.  Whereas speed is a scalar quantity, velocity is a vector.  The instantaneous velocity whose magnitude is the same as the instantaneous speed is the average velocity taken over an indefinitely short period of time.
Acceleration
Velocity as well other qualities describing motion are always measured with respect to some frame of reference.  Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.  The change of velocity divided by the elapsed time, it is a vector.  If an object moves in a straight line with constant acceleration, the velocity, V, and the acceleration, A, are related to the initial velocity V0 and the displacement, D, and the time, T, by the equations-V=V0 + AT; D, the displacement, equals V0T + ½AT2; V2=V02 + 2AD.  The mean velocity equals V + V0/2.  Objects allow to fall freely without air resistance all fall with the same constant acceleration, G=9.8 meters/second2.
Motion and force.
Newton's 3 Laws
Number 1
Newton's three laws of motion are the basic laws explaining motion.  Newton's first law states that if the net force on an object is zero, the object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion remains in motion in a straight line with constant velocity.  The tendency of a body to resist a change in motion is called inertia.  Mass is a measure of inertia.  Weight refers to the force of gravity on an object.
Number 2
Newton's second law states that the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.  F=ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and A, the acceleration.  Force, which is a vector, is a push or a pull.  More precisely, Newton's second law can be used as a definition of force as that action which is capable of accelerating an object.  Net force refers to the vector sum of all forces acting on a body. The force of gravity acting on a body is the product of its mass times the acceleration of gravity.
Number 3
Newton's third law states that when every one body exerts a force on a second body, the second exerts an equal force on the first in the opposite direction.  A consistent set of units must always be used when making calculations.  SI unit s are the standard ones used for scientific work and these include the meter, kilogram and second.
Friction
When two bodies are in contact or slide over one another, the force of friction each exerts on the other can be written forc</itunes:summary>

<p></p>
<h1><strong>Cancers and Associated Diseases &#8211; Part II<br />
</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Xeroderma pigmentosa </strong>– sun exposed areas, auto recessive, can  cause all skin cancers (BCC, SCC, and melanomas), and <strong>the defect is  in DNA repair enzymes</strong>. Other DNA repair defects are associated with  BRCA1 and BRCA2, p53, they splice out the defects, this group is called  the chromosomal instability syndromes – Wiskott Aldrich, Blooms, Ataxia  Telangiectasias, and Fanconi’s, all have probs with DNA repair.</p>
<p><strong>Basic rule of thumb for BCC and SCC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upper lip and up is basal cell carcinoma;</strong></li>
<li><strong>lower lip and down is squamous cell</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(therefore, lesion on lower lip = sq cell; lesion on upper lip =  basal cell)</strong></p>
<p>Example: inside nose is BCC, b/c above the upper lip</p>
<p>Example: keloid – sq cell carcinomas and 3rd degree burns and sq cell  carcinoma developing in areas of drainage from the sinus and ulcer that  doesn’t heal from antibiotics. So, wherever there is constant  irritation, and division of cells related to irritation, there is an  increase susceptibility to cancer. This does not hold true for scar  cancer tissue related cancers of the lungs or adenocarcinoma (just  applies to things on the skin – ie burns and draining of sinus tracts).  Only bacteria assoc with cancer? H. pylori – adenocarcinoma and low  grade malignant lymphomas.</p>
<h2><strong>XII. Grade vs Stage</strong></h2>
<p><strong>A. Grade </strong>= <strong>what does it look like? </strong>The term well  differentiated means that the tumor is making something like keratin or  glands, and if it’s identifiable it’s called low grade. When the cells  are anaplastic, poorly differentiated under the microscope, and if you  cannot tell what it is, then it’s called high grade.</p>
<p>Example: sq cell carcinoma can see keratin pearls; can ID it, so it’s  a low grade cancer.</p>
<p>Example: see gland like spaces, can ID so its low grade</p>
<p><strong>B. Stage = (TNM) </strong>MC staging system; goes from least imp to  most imp (TNM)</p>
<p>Example: breast cancer with axillary node involvement; therefore, the  N=1, but the “M” is worse, b/c it indicates that cancer has spread to  other organs like bone, etc. Just b/c it goes to lymph nodes doesn’t  mean it is the most imp prognostic factor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>T</strong>=size  of tumor; if tumor is over 2 sonometers, it has a chance of mets</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>N</strong>=nodes  (next most imp for prognosis)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>M</strong>=mets  outside of nodes (most imp prognostic factor)</p>
<p>Stage is more important than grade for prognosis; and within staging,  M is the most imp factor for prognosis.</p>
<p>Example: pt with prostate cancer, which of following has it the  worst? The answer choices were cancer limited to prostate, it went into  seminal vesicles, it involved the wall of bladder, went to lymph nodes,  or bone? Answer = bone (bone represents the “M” of the TNM system – this  is stage 4 by definition=mets)</p>
<p>Example: a slide of a colon cancer and a lymph node: what is most  important – size of tumor or lymph node involvement? Lymph node. If it  was also in the liver, what is most imp? Liver specimen is the most imp  prognostic factor.</p>
<h3><strong>XIII. Host defenses </strong>– most important is Cytotoxic CD8 T cell</h3>
<p>Others – NK cells, Ab’s, macrophages, type 2 HPY. In hospital, they  look for altered MHC class I Ag’s in the cancer pt, b/c cancer wants to  kill T cells; they do this by putting in perforins, which activate   caspasases, and this leads to apoptosis (the signal, from the perforins,  activate the caspasases, which have proteases, which break down the  nucleus and mitochondria, and cell dies, without any inflammatory  infiltrate).</p>
<h2><strong>XIV. Other diseases seen in malignancy:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>A. Cachexia </strong>– cause is TNF alpha; it is irreversible. Once you  see a pt with disseminated cancer about to go into catabolic state, can  give then total nutrition, but still won’t help. (Will not get muscle  mass back, and this is due to TNF-alpha)</p>
<p><strong>B. Many hematologic causes of anemia seen in malignancy</strong></p>
<p>MC anemia in malignancy is Anemia of chronic disease (this is the  overall most common)</p>
<p><strong>Colon cancer: left side obstructs w/ right side bleeds; if you  have RT side bleed in colon cancer, Fe def anemia is very common.</strong></p>
<p>Mets to BM and replace BM. Or, use chemotherapy drugs that are cell  cycle specific or cell cycle nonspecific – they wipe out the marrow. Can  have autoimmune mechanism with certain malignant dz.</p>
<p><strong>C. Associations with disseminated cancers:</strong></p>
<p>1. Most pts with disseminated cancers are <strong>hypercoagulable</strong>,  meaning that they have a tendency for forming clots. Classic Example: a  pt with painless jaundice, left supraclavicular node (this is a  distracter), had light color stools, lesions that jump from one part of  body to next – trousseau’s sign: a superficial migratory  thrombophlebitis due to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas).  Pancreatic cancers can ALSO mets to left supraclavicular node (virchow’s  node), and often describe trousseau’s sign, which is a vascular problem  in the veins that jumps from one place to the next.</p>
<p>2. Another common thing seen is disseminated cancers is <strong>thrombocytosis </strong>– an elevated platelet count. Other causes of thrombocytosis: Fe  def, splenectomy (ie see scar on abdomen), TB, anemias. If you  cannot  find any obvious cause of thrombocytosis then the cause is cancer. 40%  of disseminated cancers are thrombocytosis. Or a do a stool guaic for  colon cancer.</p>
<p><strong>D. MCC fever in malignancy = gram neg. infection</strong>. An E. coli  if you have an indwelling catheter; Pseudomonas if you have a  respirator, staph aureus can also be the cause from an indwelling  catheter, but this is gram “+”. MCC death in cancer = infection.</p>
<h2><strong>XV. Paraneoplastic syndromes</strong></h2>
<p>These are signs and sometimes symptoms saying that you may have an  underlying cancer present. Its important b/c when you recognize the  signs and symptoms, then you can catch the cancer before it metastasize.</p>
<p><strong>MC Paraneoplastic syndrome = hypercalcemia</strong></p>
<p>2 mechanism for hypercalcemia in malignancy:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) mets  to bone, produce a chemical (IL-1, PGE2, both of which activate  osteoclasts) that produces lytic lesions in bone, and you get  hypercalcemia</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) renal  adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma of mainstem bronchus that sits  there and makes PTH-like peptide and causes hypercalcemia b/c it acts  like PTH and breaks down bone. This is Paraneoplastic, but it’s not the  most common one.</p>
<p>Example: 2 black lesions – both are markers for gastric  adenocarcinoma; usually under the arm – called acanthosis nigricans, and  other is called seborrheic keratosis (these are not neoplasms);  however, when  these suddenly develop overnight, you get multiple  outcroppings, and the outcroppings is a phenotypic marker for <strong>gastroadenocarcinoma</strong>;  this is easy to remember b/c 2 black lesions are markers from  gastroadenocarcinoma.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>clubbing </strong>– inflammation beneath on the bone called  periostitis; inflamm of underlying bone causes proliferation of the soft  tissue around it, which leads to clubbing (called hypertrophic  osteoarthropathy). Clubbing is not always assoc with cancer; also assoc  with bronchiectasis, IBS. But, if it’s a malignancy, it is due to  primary lung dz.</p>
<p>Example: least common collagen vascular dz, but the most often assoc  with a certain cancer. They have an elevation of serum CK; this is  dermatomyositis; raccoon eyes, so you see inflammation of skin and  muscle; high assoc with leukemias, lymphomas and lung cancer. patches of  knuckles – Goltrin’s patches (seen in dermatomyositis).</p>
<p>Example: vegetations (sterile) on the mitral valve – assoc with  mucous producing cancers such as colon cancer; this is called marantic  endocarditis-aka nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis; they are not  infections and these marantic vegetations are assoc with mucous  secreting colon cancers. Can they embolize? Yes. You will need history  to separate from rheumatic fever, but history will relate more to colon  cancer (ie polyarthritis).</p>
<p>Example: hyponatremia or Cushing’s – cancer in the lung = small cell  carcinoma, which is secreting either ADH or ACTH; also, for small cell,  they are aput tumors, S-100 Ag positive, neural crest origin, neural  secretory granules.</p>
<p>Example: Hypercalcemia or secondary polycythemia: renal  adenocarcinoma (can make PTH like peptide and/or EPO).</p>
<p><strong>Example: Hypoglycemia or secondary polycythemia: Hepatocellular  carcinoma (they can make EPO or insulin-like factor).</strong></p>
<p>Example: Hypocalcemia or Cushing’s: auto dominant, and the rare tumor  marker that can be converted to amyloid (calcitonin) – medullary  carcinoma of the thyroid.</p>
<h2><strong>XVI. Tumor markers</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>2 markers associated with Testicular cancer – alpha feto protein  (AFP) (which is really the albumin of a fetus) and HCG.</li>
<li>AFP is a maker for–yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus tumor). So the  tumors in kids are yolk sac tumors (alpha feto protein). AFP is also  assoc with Hepatocellular carcinoma, increased in neural tube defects  (must be on folate while pregnant to prevent neural tube defects). In  Down’s syndrome AFP is decreased. Marker for malignancy in bone, assoc  with monoclonal spike: Bence Jones Proteins (light chain Ig), assoc with  Multiple Myeloma.</li>
<li> Tumor marker for prostate cancer: PSA; not sp for cancer b/c it can  be also increased in hyperplasia; it is sensitive but not specific. If  you do a rectal exam, it is not increased. PSA is NOT an enzyme; it is  an Ag and is within the actual cell. It will not increase with a rectal  exam.</li>
<li>Breast cancer (surface derived) – 15, 3.</li>
<li>CEA–125: Ovarian cancer</li>
<li>CEA –Ag for colon cancer; and sometimes used for small cell, and  breast ca. CEA can be a part of an immune complex, and will get CEA:  anti-CEA immune complexes which deposit in the kidney, and lead to  nephrotic syndrome – this is diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis = MC  overall cause of nephrotic syndrome. Many of these are related to  malignancy b/c CEA can be the Ag that is deposits in the glomeruli.</li>
<li>Woman with a trophoblastic mole, what would you get? Beta HCG</li>
</ol>
<h2>Most Common Causes (MCC) of Cancer:</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is MC primary tumor of the brain in kids? Cerebellar cystic  astrocytoma (B9). It’s not medulloblastoma. All astrocytomas are B9 (if  asked what is the most common malignant primary tumor, and then the  answer is medulloblastoma, which derives from cerebellum). MC actual  tumor of the brain – cerebellar tumor derived from astrocytes;</li>
<li><strong>MC childhood cancer </strong>= ALL leukemia (other childhood tumors  include CNS tumors, neuroblastomas (in the adrenal medulla), Burkitts,  Ewing’s (tumor of bone with onion skinning), embryonal  rhabdomyosarcoma.)</li>
<li><strong>Adults</strong>: incidence:</li>
<li>Woman: breast, lung, colon</li>
<li>Men: prostate, lung, and colon</li>
<li>Killers: lung is #1 in both (followed by prostate/breast and colon)</li>
<li>2nd MC cancer and cancer killer in men and women combined = colon</li>
<li>Therefore, from age 50 and on, you should get a rectal exam and a  stool guaic. After 50, MCC cancer of “+” stool guaic is colon cancer.</li>
<li><strong>MC gyn cancer: </strong>endometrial (#2 is ovarian, and #3 is cervix)</li>
<li>Cervix is least common b/c Pap smear. When you do a cervical pap,  picking up cervical dysplasia, not cervical cancer (therefore the  ‘incidence’ isn’t the highest).</li>
<li>B/c cervical pap smears; the incidence of cervical cancer has gone  down significantly b/c the detection of the precursor lesion, cervical  dysplasia. So, b/c cervical Pap smear, incidence of cervical cancer has  gone down dramatically (picking up the precursor lesion); with  mammography, the incidence of breast cancer decreases, same with PSA.</li>
<li><strong>MC Gyn cancer killer: </strong>ovarian (#2 = cervical, #3 =  endometrial); therefore to remember, the MC has the best prognosis –  endometrial is MC and has the best prognosis. What is the only known  existing tumor vaccine? HBV …why? MC infection transmitted by accidental  needle stick in the hospital = Hepatitis B. B/c viral burden of  Hepatitis B is greater than any infection, even more so than HIV. So,  with the Hepatitis B vaccine, you won’t get three things (1) Hepatitis  B, (2) Hepatitis D (requires Hep B), and (3) hepatocellular carcinoma  (related to Hepatitis B related cirrhosis).</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you eradicate hepatocellular carcinoma? Vaccination (ie in the  Far East).</p>

Cancers and Associated Diseases - Part II

Xeroderma pigmentosa – sun exposed areas, auto recessive, can  cause all skin cancers (BCC, SCC, and melanomas), and the defect is  in DNA repair enzymes. Other DNA repair defects are associated with  BRCA1 and BRCA2, p53, they splice out the defects, this group is called  the chromosomal instability syndromes – Wiskott Aldrich, Blooms, Ataxia  Telangiectasias, and Fanconi’s, all have probs with DNA repair.

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h1>H.R. 3590</h1>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 21: This is a General Chemistry 101 overview for the MCAT. Get ready for more specific and detailed podcasts on a WEEKLY basis.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Conservation of Mass</h1>
<p>The Law of Conservation of Mass state that there are no detectable changes in mass in any chemical reaction.  This indicates that there are the same number of atoms of each types present after a chemical reaction as there were before the reaction.  A balanced equation shows equal numbers of each type of atom on each side of the equation and is, thereby, consistent with the Law of Conservation of Mass.</p>
<h2>MCAT Equations (<a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/member-content/mcat" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">download complete list of MCAT equations</span></span></a>)</h2>
<p>Equations are balanced by placing coefficients in front of the chemical formulas for the substances involved in the reactions.  It is possible to predict the products of simple reactions by analogy to known reactions and by use of the periodic table.  Among the reactions, there are the followings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One; combustion in oxygen in which an organic compound reacts with oxygen forming carbon dioxide, water and possibly other products depending on the composition of the compound.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Two; neutralization reaction in which an acid plus a base react to form water or another neutral compound and a salt.  There are precipitation reactions in which one of the products over reaction between two substances in solution is insoluble in the solution.  The coefficient in a balanced equation can be interpreted as either the relative number of formula units involved in the reaction or the relative number of moles.</p>
<h2>Avagadro&#8217;s Number</h2>
<p>A mole of any substance is Avogadro&#8217;s number, which is 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> of formula units of that substance.  The mass of a mole of atoms, molecules or ions is the formula weight expressed in grams.  For example, a single molecule of water, H<sub>2</sub>O, weighs 18 amu, which are atomic mass units.  A mole of water weighs 18 grams.  The empirical formula, or simplest formula, of a substance expresses the composition in terms of the smallest possible set of whole number subscripts denoting the relative number of atoms.  The mole concept can be used to determine the empirical formula of a compound and calculate the quantities involved in chemical reactions.  In dealing with reactions between substances and solutions, it is convenient to employ the concept of solution concentration.</p>
<h2>Molarity</h2>
<p>Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  Molarity serves as a conversion factor for interconverting solution volume and number of moles of solute.</p>
<h1>Chemical equations and energy</h1>
<p>We will look specifically at the energy and the first law of thermodynamics.  Energy can be measured in terms of the ability to accomplish work or transfer heat.  An object may possess potential energy because of its position relative to another object or because of its composition.  Thus, chemical energy is potential energy which can be released when the object undergoes a chemical change.  An object may possess kinetic energy because if it&#8217;s relative motion to another object.  The first law of thermodynamics<strong> </strong>also referred to as the law of conservation of energy states that in any change that occurs in nature, the total energy of the universe remains constant.</p>
<p>It is often convenient to consider one portion of nature called the system as separate from all the rest called the surroundings.  According to the first law of thermodynamics<strong> </strong>any energy gained by the system in a change must equal the energy lost from the surroundings.  Any process in which heat energy is lost to the surroundings is termed &#8220;exothermic&#8221;.  On the other hand, when heat energy is absorbed by the system from the surroundings, the process is termed &#8220;endothermic&#8221;.</p>
<p>Heat changes occurring at constant pressure are of special interest.  The heat gained or lost by the system in a process occurring at constant pressure is termed the enthalpy<strong> </strong>change, represented by the symbol delta H.  This quantity is negative for an exothermic process and positive for an endothermic process.</p>
<h2>Enthalpy</h2>
<p>Enthalpy is a state function, which means that the enthalpy of a system is determined by specifying its present condition and not by the details of how it came to be in that state.  If a particular overall change can be described as the sum of several individual changes then<strong> e</strong>nthalpy change for the overall process is equal to the sum of the enthalpy changes associated with the individual steps.</p>
<h2>Hess&#8217; Law of Constant Heat Summation</h2>
<p>This statement is known as Hess&#8217;s law of constant heat summation<strong>. </strong>In applying Hess&#8217;s law, it is useful to define the standard heat of formation<strong> </strong>of a substance, which is the heat change in the formation of a substance from the elements, all in the states in which they are most stable at the temperature of interest.  This is usually 25 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Using Hess&#8217;s law, the enthalpy change in any reaction can be described as the sum of the heat of formation of all the products, less the heat of formation of all reactants.  In solving problems dealing with enthalpy changes, it is important to keep the following points in mind.</p>
<p>First, the enthalpy change in a reaction, delta-H,<strong> </strong>is directly proportional to the amount of substance that reacts or is produced.  Secondly, delta-H for any reaction is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the value of delta-H<strong> </strong>for the reverse reaction.  Thirdly, the heat of formation for any element in its standard state is zero.</p>
<h2>Quantum Numbers</h2>
<p>Now, we shall look at the quantum numbers.  According to quantum mechanics, the state of an electron in an atom is specified by four quantum numbers-<em>n, l, m<sub>l</sub> and m<sub>s</sub></em>.  The principle quantum number, <em>n,</em> can take any integer value-one, two, three, etc.  <em>l</em>, the orbital quantum number can take on values from zero up to n<sup>-</sup>1.<strong> </strong><em>m<sub>l</sub></em><em> </em>the magnetic quantum number can take on integer values from <sup>-</sup>l to <sup>+</sup>l.  And <em>m<sub>s</sub></em><strong>, </strong>the magnetic spin quantum number can be either <sup>+</sup> ½ or &#8211; ½.</p>
<p>The energy levels in the hydrogen atom depend on <em>n</em> whereas in other atoms, they depend on <em>n</em> and <em>l</em>.  When an external magnetic field is applied, the spectral lines are split, indicating that the energy depends also on <em>m<sub>l</sub></em>.  Even in the absence of a magnetic field, precise measurements of spectral lines show a tiny splitting of the lines called fine structure, whose explanation is that the energy depends very slightly on the spin quantum number <em>m<sub>s</sub></em>.</p>
<h2>Pauli Exclusion Principle</h2>
<p>The arrangement of electrons in multi<sup>-</sup>electron atoms is governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state.  That is, they cannot have these same set of quantum numbers <em>n, l, m<sub>l</sub> and m<sub>s</sub></em>.  The electrons as a result are grouped into shells according to the value of <em>n</em> and subshells according to the value of <em>l</em>.  This shell structure gives rise to a periodicity in the properties of the elements.</p>
<h1>Chemical Bonds</h1>
<p>Now, we shall look at chemical bonds.  Ionic bonding results from the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another with formation of a three dimensional lattice of charged particles.  The stabilities of ionic substances result from the powerful electrostatic attractive forces between an ion and all these surrounding ions of opposite charge.  They call anions are negative ions, while cations are positive.  These interactions are measured by the lattice energy.</p>
<p>Covalent bonding results from the sharing of electron between atoms.  The rules that govern this sharing are based on the stability of the noble gas electron configuration.  This is called the Octet Rule.  We can represent shared electron pair structures of molecules by means of Lewis structures, which show the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.</p>
<p>The sharing of one pair of electron produces a single bond.  The sharing of two or three pairs of electrons between atoms produces double and triple bonds, respectively.  It sometimes happens that a single Lewis structure is inadequate to represent a particular molecule.  But then an average of two or more Lewis structures does form a satisfactory representation.</p>
<h2>Lewis Structures and Resonance Forms</h2>
<p>In these cases, the Lewis structures are referred to as Resonance Forms.  It also sometimes happens that the Octet Rule is not obeyed.  This situation occurs mainly when a large atom is surrounded by small electronegative atoms, like fluorine, oxygen or chlorine.  In such instances, the large atom often has more than an octet of electrons.</p>
<p>The strength of covalent bonds increase with the number of electron pairs shared between two atoms.  In single bonds, the bond strings are generally higher between atoms of smaller size.  It is important to recognize that even in covalent bonding electrons may not be shared equally between two atoms.</p>
<h2>Electronegativity</h2>
<p>Electronegativity is a measure of the ability of an atom to compete with other atoms for the electrons shared between them.  Highly electronegative elements strongly attract electrons.  The electronegativities of the elements which show regular periodic relationship are an important guide to chemical behavior.  The difference in electronegativities of bonded atoms is used to determine of the polarity of the bond.</p>
<p>Another application of electronegativity is in the assignment of oxidation numbers which are formal whole number charges assigned to atoms in molecules and ions.  Although the oxidation numbers do not represent the real charges on atoms except in simple ionic substances, they are of great value in helping us to organize chemical facts and are in aid in balancing equations and in the naming of compounds.</p>
<h2>Oxidation Number</h2>
<p>Oxidation may be defined as the process in which an atom undergoes an increase in oxidation number.  Reduction is a process in which an element undergoes a decrease in oxidation number.  In an oxidation<sup>-</sup>reduction reaction, both oxidation and reduction occur in such a manner as to balance the total increases and decreases in oxidation numbers.</p>
<h1>Stoichiometry</h1>
<p>Chemical bonds and shapes.  The three dimensional structures of molecules are determined by the distances between bonded atoms and by the directions of chemical bonds with the respect to one another around a particular atom.  The Valence shell electron pair repulsion model explains these relative directions in term of the repulsions that exist between electron pairs.</p>
<h2>Electrostatic Repulsions</h2>
<p>According to this model, electron pairs around an atom orient themselves so as to minimize electrostatic repulsions.  That is, they remain as far apart as possible.  By recognizing the unshared electron pair take up more space, i.e. they exert greater repulsive forces then shared electron pairs, it is possible to account for the departures of bond angles from the ideal<sup>-</sup>like values and to explain many other aspects of molecular structure.  The shape of a molecule and the bond polarities determine whether or not a molecule will be polar.  The degree of polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment.</p>
<p>The Lewis model for covalent bonding can be extended to account very nicely for the geometrical properties of molecules.  We can imagine that the atoms in a molecule are bonded to one another by electron pairs that occupy pairs of overlapping atomic orbitals.  The extent to which the atomic orbitals share the same region of space, called overlap, is important in determining the amount of stability that results from bond formation.</p>
<h2>Sigma (Single) Bonds</h2>
<p>The bonds directed along the internuclear axes are called sigma bonds, sigma bonds or single bonds.  It is possible to formulate orbitals on an atom that are directed toward each of the other atoms surrounding it by forming a hybrid orbital.  These orbitals are made up of mixtures of the familiar SPND atomic orbitals.  Depending on the particular number of other atoms bonded to an atom and their arrangement in space, a particular set of hybrid orbitals can be formulated that has the necessary directional characteristics.</p>
<p>For example, SP3 hybrid orbitals are directed towards the corners of a tetrahedron.  In addition to the sigma bonds which determine the geometry of the bonding around a particular atom, there are also pi bonds constructed from remaining unhybridized atomic orbitals.  Thus, double bonds consisting of a sigma and a pi bond, or triple bonds consisting of a sigma and two pi bonds may be formed.  In some molecules, the pi bond may extend or be delocalized over several atoms.</p>
<p>Delocalization of the pi electron in a cyclic structure, such as in benzene or throughout a plane, leads to a special stability.  The coming together of atoms to form molecules may be viewed also as the coming together of the atomic orbitals to from molecular orbitals.  Atomic orbitals may combine with one another in various ways.  The rules for combining atomic orbitals on atoms to form molecular orbitals allow us to account very well for the observed properties of the diatomic molecules formed by the first several elements of the periodic table.</p>
<h1>Properties of gases</h1>
<p>To describe the state or condition of a gas, it is necessary to specify four variables-pressure, temperature, volume, and the quantity of the gas.  Volume is usually measured in liters and temperature in the Kelvin scale.  Pressure is defined as the force per unit area.  It is expressed in the SI unit as Pascals, where one Pascal is equal to one Newton per meter squared, which in turn is equal to one kilogram per meter second squared.  Pressure can also be defined in millimeters of mercury.  One standard atmosphere of pressure equals 101.3 kilopascals or 760 millimeter of mercury.  A barometer is often used to measure the atmospheric pressure.</p>
<h2>The ideal gas equation</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>PV=nRT</em></h3>
<p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;">Where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and t is the Temperature in Kelvin.</p>
<p>Most gases at pressures of about one atmosphere and temperatures of 300 Kelvin and above obey the ideal gas equation reasonably well.  We can use the ideal gas equation to calculate variations in one variable when one or more of the others are changed.</p>
<h2>Boyle&#8217;s Law</h2>
<p>For a constant quantity of gas at constant temperature, the pressure of the gas is inversely proportional to the volume.  That is Boyle&#8217;s law.</p>
<h2>Charles&#8217; Law</h2>
<p>Similarly for a constant quantity of gas at constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to temperature.  That is Charles&#8217; law.</p>
<h2>Dalton&#8217;s Law of Partial Pressures</h2>
<p>In gas mixtures, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures that each gas would exert if it were present alone under the same conditions.  That is the Dalton&#8217;s law of partial pressures.  In all applications of the ideal gas equation, we must remember to convert temperature to the absolute temperature scale, in Kelvin.  It is important to be able to use the ideal gas equation to solve problems involving gases as reactants or products in chemical reactions.</p>
<h2>Molecular Weight of Gas</h2>
<p>From the gas density, rho, under given conditions of pressure and temperature, it is possible to calculate the molecular weight of the gas, where molecular weight will, therefore, be equal to rho rt/p, this can be derived from <em>PV=nRT</em>.  As long as you remember that the density is equal mass divided by volume.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Density = Mass / Volume</h3>
<p>In calculating the quantity of gas collected over water, correction must be made for the partial pressure of water vapor in the container.</p>
<h2>Kinetic Molecular Theory (analagous to Brownian Motion)</h2>
<p>The kinetic molecular theory accounts for the properties of an ideal gas in terms of a set of assumptions about the nature of gases.  Briefly, these assumptions are that molecules are in ceaseless, chaotic motion, that the volume of gas molecule is negligible in relation to the volume of their container, that the gas molecules have no attracted forces for one another, and finally, that the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is proportional to absolute temperature.</p>
<p>The molecules of a gas do not all have the same kinetic energy at a given instance.  Their speeds are distributed over a wide range.  The distribution varies with the molecular weight of the gas and with the temperature.  The root mean square speed varies in proportion to the square root of absolute temperature and inversely with the square root of molecular weight.  It follows that the rate at which a gas escapes or effuses through a tiny hole is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight.</p>
<h2>Non-Ideal Gases</h2>
<p>Molecules in a real gas posses finite volume and, thus, undergo frequent collisions with one another.  These frequent collisions will limit the rate at which a gas molecule can diffuse through a space occupied by other gas molecules and determine the thermal conductivity of the gas.  The extent of non ideality of a real gas can be seen by examining the quantity PV over RT for one mole of a gas as a function pressure.  This quantity is exactly equal to one for an ideal gas at all pressures.</p>
<p>Real gas will depart from ideal behavior because the molecules possess finite volume or because the molecules experience attractive forces from one another upon collision.  The van der Waals equation is an equation of state for gases that attempts to correct the ideal gas equation to take into account the two properties of real gases.</p>
<p>Solutions-solutions are homogenous mixtures of atoms, ions, or molecules.  The relative amounts of solute and solvent in a solution can be described qualitatively-dilute or a concentrated solution, or quantitatively, as in weight percentage; molarity, which is moles per liter; molality, which is moles solute per kilogram solvent; normality, equivalence per liter; or mole fraction.  Mole fraction is the ratio of the number of moles of one component of a solution to the total number of moles of all substances present.</p>
<p>The extent to which a solute will dissolve in a particular solvent depends on the relative magnitudes of solute<sup>-</sup>solute or solute<sup>-</sup>solvent, and solvent<sup>-</sup>solvent attractive forces, as well as the &#8211; it depends on the changes in disorder accompanying the mixing.  The rule, like dissolves like is found to be useful in rationalizing solubilities.  It is possible to chain the solubility of a solute by changing temperature and pressure.  If the solution process is endothermic, an increase in temperature promotes solubility.  With a gas, an increase in pressure promotes solubility.</p>
<h2>Le Chatelier&#8217;s Principle</h2>
<p>These effects can be understood in terms of Le Chatelier&#8217;s principle.  Substances that exist in solution as ions are called electrolytes.  Those substances that are completely ionized in solution are called strong electrolytes.  Reactions occur between electrolytes if an insoluble substance, a gas or a non<sup>-</sup>electrolyte conforms.  Net ionic equations focus attention on the particular species that actually undergo some change during the reaction.</p>
<p>The presence of a solute in a solvent lowers the vapor pressure and the freezing point, and increases the boiling point of the solvent.  These changes are termed colligative properties.  The magnitude of the change depends on the total concentration of solute particles in solution, and not on there characteristics.</p>
<h1>Acids and Bases</h1>
<p>Acids and bases-an acid solution is created when a substance reacts with water in such a way as to increase the concentration of solvated hydrogen ions, which are represented as H<sup>+</sup> or H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>.  The concentration of H<sup>+</sup> is often expressed on the pH scale, where pH equals negative log concentration of hydrogen ions.  Solutions of pH less than seven are acidic.  Those with pH greater than seven are basic.</p>
<h2>Ionization of Water</h2>
<p>Water spontaneously ionizes to a slight degree, forming H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup>.  The extent of ionization is expressed by the ion product constant for water, which is Kw, which is equal to a concentration of a H<sup>+</sup> times the concentration of OH<sup>-</sup>, which is equal to 10 to the minus 14.  This relationship describes not only pure water but aqueous solution as well.  Because the concentration of water is effectively constant in dilute solutions, the concentration of water is omitted from this equilibrium constant expression as well as from others associated with reactions in aqueous solutions.</p>
<h2>Bronsted-Lowry Theory</h2>
<p>One can rely on the Bronsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases.  According to this theory, an acid is a proton donor, or a base is a proton acceptor.  Reaction of an acid with water results in the formation of H<sup>+</sup> and the conjugate base of the acid.  Strong acids have conjugate bases that are weaker than water.  Such acids are strong electrolytes, ionizing completely in solution.  The common strong acids are HCl, HBr, HI, HNO<sub>3</sub>, HClO<sub>4</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.  Weak acids are substances for which the reaction with water is incomplete and equilibrium is established.</p>
<h2>Dissociation Constants</h2>
<p>The extent to which the reaction proceed is expressed by the acid dissociation constant K<sub>a</sub>.  Polyprotic acids are acids such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> that have more than one ionizable proton.  Aside from the ionic hydroxides, such as NaOH, base is produced an increase of OH<sup>-</sup> by reaction with water.  Strong bases have conjugate acids that are no stronger than water.  The common strong bases are the hydroxides and oxides of the alkali metals and alkaline earth.  Weak bases include H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, amines, and the anions of weak acids.  The extent to which a weak base reacts with water to generate OH<sup>-</sup> and a conjugate acid of the base is measured by the base dissociation constant, K<sub>b</sub>.</p>

Conservation of Mass
The Law of Conservation of Mass state that there are no detectable changes in mass in any chemical reaction.  This indicates that there are the same number of atoms of each types present after a chemical reaction as there were before the reaction.  A balanced equation shows equal numbers of each type of atom on each side of the equation and is, thereby, consistent with the Law of Conservation of Mass.
MCAT Equations (download complete list of MCAT equations)
Equations are balanced by placing coefficients in front of the chemical formulas for the substances involved in the reactions.  It is possible to predict the products of simple reactions by analogy to known reactions and by use of the periodic table.  Among the reactions, there are the followings:
One; combustion in oxygen in which an organic compound reacts with oxygen forming carbon dioxide, water and possibly other products depending on the composition of the compound.
Two; neutralization reaction in which an acid plus a base react to form water or another neutral compound and a salt.  There are precipitation reactions in which one of the products over reaction between two substances in solution is insoluble in the solution.  The coefficient in a balanced equation can be interpreted as either the relative number of formula units involved in the reaction or the relative number of moles.

Avagadro's Number
A mole of any substance is Avogadro's number, which is 6.02 x 1023 of formula units of that substance.  The mass of a mole of atoms, molecules or ions is the formula weight expressed in grams.  For example, a single molecule of water, H2O, weighs 18 amu, which are atomic mass units.  A mole of water weighs 18 grams.  The empirical formula, or simplest formula, of a substance expresses the composition in terms of the smallest possible set of whole number subscripts denoting the relative number of atoms.  The mole concept can be used to determine the empirical formula of a compound and calculate the quantities involved in chemical reactions.  In dealing with reactions between substances and solutions, it is convenient to employ the concept of solution concentration.
Molarity
Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.  Molarity serves as a conversion factor for interconverting solution volume and number of moles of solute.
Chemical equations and energy
We will look specifically at the energy and the first law of thermodynamics.  Energy can be measured in terms of the ability to accomplish work or transfer heat.  An object may possess potential energy because of its position relative to another object or because of its composition.  Thus, chemical energy is potential energy which can be released when the object undergoes a chemical change.  An object may possess kinetic energy because if it's relative motion to another object.  The first law of thermodynamics also referred to as the law of conservation of energy states that in any change that occurs in nature, the total energy of the universe remains constant.

It is often convenient to consider one portion of nature called the system as separate from all the rest called the surroundings.  According to the first law of thermodynamics any energy gained by the system in a change must equal the energy lost from the surroundings.  Any process in which heat energy is lost to the surroundings is termed "exothermic".  On the other hand, when heat energy is absorbed by the system from the surroundings, the process is termed "endothermic".

Heat changes occurring at constant pressure are of special interest.  The heat gained or lost by the system in a process occurring at constant pressure is termed the enthalpy change, represented by the symbol delta H.  This quantity is negative for an exothermic proc</itunes:summary>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Classes of Organic Molecules</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Four major classes of organic molecules found in living organisms are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and nucleic acids.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Condensation Reactions</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Though these classes of molecule have different structure and function, they are built up of many similar building block molecules bonded together.<span> </span>In each case, building block molecules are combined by the removal of water, and this is called &#8220;condensation reactions.&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Condensation reactions are reversible.<span> </span>The complex organic molecules can be hydrolyzed into the simpler building blocks molecules with the addition of water.<span> </span>The basic building block molecules of carbohydrates are the simple sugars or monosaccharides.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Disaccharide Bonds</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When two simple sugars are bonded together, a disaccharide is formed.<span> </span>When many simple sugars are bonded together in long chains, a polysaccharide is formed. <span> </span>Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are examples of polysaccharides.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The carbohydrates are an important energy source for all organisms.<span> </span>Lipids, the fats, and fat-like substances tend to be insoluble in water.<span> </span>Fats are made up of two building block molecules – glycerol and fatty acids.<span> </span>Phospholipids are derived from the fats.<span> </span>They are important constituents of cell membranes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Peptide Bonds</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The basic building block molecules of the proteins are amino acids.<span> </span>Amino acids are bonded together to form a protein by condensation reactions.<span> </span>The resulting bond is the peptide bond and the chains produced are polypeptide chains. The primary structure of each protein is the sequence and type of amino acids making up the polypeptide chains.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because hydrogen bonds form between one amino acid and another, the chain assumes a stable regular shape known as the secondary structure.<span> </span>These regular molecules may in turn be folded into complicated globular shapes by weak attractions between the different R groups within the chain, thus forming the tertiary structure of the protein.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Nucleotide Bonds</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some globular proteins are made up of two or more polypeptide chains held together by weak bonds.<span> </span>The way these chains fit together determines the ordinary structure.<span> </span>Because the conformation of a protein depends on weak bonds, it is easily altered causing a change in biological function.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The building block unit of nucleic acids is the nucleotide, which is made up of a five carbon sugar attached to a phosphate group and to a nitrogen-containing base.<span> </span>Nucleotide units are joined together through condensation reactions between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of the next.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are four different nucleotides in each nucleic acid.<span> </span>It is the different sequences of the nucleotides that encode their hereditary information.<span> </span>The two types of nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, differ in their basic make up and in the number of strands in the molecule.<span> </span>We will be discussing this in greater detail later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h1 class="MsoNormal">Free Energy and Enzymes</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chemical reactions that release free energy are exothermic or exergonic.<span> </span>Reactions that require the addition of free energy are endothermic or endergonic.<span> </span>In living systems, an exothermic reaction is usually coupled with an endothermic reaction.<span> </span>Although exothermic reaction proceeds spontaneously, initiating a reaction may require an activation energy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chemical reactions can be speeded up by heat, by increasing the concentrations of the reactants, or by providing the appropriate catalyst.<span> </span>In living systems, the catalysts are enzymes.<span> </span>Most enzymes are highly specific and each can interact only with those reactants or substrates that fit spatially and chemically into the active site of the enzyme.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since the formation of the enzyme, substrate complex requires the enzyme and the substrate to be complementary.<span> </span>Anything that alters the shape of the enzyme will alter its activity.<span> </span>In addition to temperature and pH, many chemical substances can mask, block or alter the shape of the enzyme and its active site.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h1 class="MsoNormal">The Biological Cell</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, let us discuss cells. <span> </span>The fundamental organizational unit of life is the cell.<span> </span>Most cells are very small and have a large ratio of surface area to volume so they can effectively exchange materials like oxygen, nutrients, and waste with the surrounding environment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Plasma Membrane</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cells are bounded by a plasma membrane composed of lipids and proteins with many small pores.<span> </span>According to the fluid mosaic model, the plasma membrane consists of a bi-layer of phospholipids with their hydrophilic heads oriented towards the surfaces of the membrane and their hydrophobic tales toward the interior.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Protein Channels</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The proteins are distributed both on the surfaces and in the interior of the membrane.<span> </span>The pores are thought to be bounded by protein.<span> </span>The distinctive properties of these proteins make the pore selective as to what can move through them.<span> </span>The cell membrane is an active part of the cell.<span> </span>It regulates the movement of materials between the ordered interior of the cell and their outer environment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Passive Transport</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">This type of molecular passage from one side of a membrane to another requires no external energy. This is governed by charge and osmolality balance, which are intrinsic properties of solutions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h3 class="MsoNormal">Diffusion</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The general rule is that the net movement of particles of a particular substance is from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration of that substance.<span> </span>This movement of particles is called &#8220;diffusion.&#8221;<span> </span>The plasma membrane is differentially permeable.<span> </span>It allows particles of some substances to pass through while excluding others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h3 class="MsoNormal">Osmosis</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The movement of water through a plasma membrane is called &#8220;osmosis.&#8221;<span> </span>Cell membranes are relatively permeable to water and to certain simple sugars, amino acids and lipid soluble substances.<span> </span>They are relatively impermeable to polysaccharides, proteins and other very large particles.<span> </span>Their permeability to small particles varies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2>Facilitated Diffusion</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The bilipid layer presents a barrier to substances  insoluble in lipids.<span> </span>For such substances, some protein components of the membrane function as carrier molecules called  &#8220;permeases.&#8221;<span> </span>In facilitated diffusion or passive transport, the substances being carried move with the concentration  gradient and no energy is required.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Active Transport</h2>
<p><!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In active transport, substances are moved against a concentration gradient; hence, the cell must expend energy.<span> </span>Sometimes substances are taken into the cell by an active process called &#8220;endocytosis.&#8221;<span> </span>The reverse sequence is called &#8220;exocytosis.&#8221;<span> </span>The cell membrane cannot completely regulate the exchange of materials.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A cell in a medium that is hypertonic, meaning higher osmotic concentration, relative to it tends to loose water and shrinks.<span> </span>Conversely, a cell in a hypotonic medium lower osmotic concentration relative to it tends to gain water and swell and may even burst.<span> </span>A cell in an isotonic medium, osmotic concentrations in balance neither gains nor looses appreciable water.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h1 class="MsoNormal">Sub-Cellular Components</h1>
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Cell Walls</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fungi and bacteria have cell walls made not of cellulose but of other complex polysaccharide molecules.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Glycocalyx</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Most animal cells have a cell coat of carbohydrates covalently bonded to protein or lipid molecules in the plasma membrane.<span> </span>This coat is called a &#8220;glycocalyx.&#8221;<span> </span>Eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound nucleus; whereas, prokaryotic cells – for example, bacteria – lack a membrane-bound nucleus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Chromosomes</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The nucleus contains the chromosomes which contain the genes.<span> </span>It can therefore direct the cell&#8217;s life processes.<span> </span>Separating the nucleus from the cytoplasm is a double nuclear membrane interrupted by pores.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Endoplasmic Reticulum</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">The nuclear membrane is continuous at places with the endoplasmic reticulum.<span> </span>The endoplasmic reticulum forms a system of interconnected membrane enclosed spaces.<span> </span>Sometimes the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum are rough with ribosomes on their outer surfaces.<span> </span>When no ribosomes are present, the endoplasmic reticulum is smooth.<span> </span>Ribosomes are sites of protein synthesis.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The endoplasmic reticulum functions both as a passageway for intracellular transportation and as a manufacturing surface.<span> </span>The Golgi apparatus consists of stocks of membrane-bound vesicles that function in the storage, modification, and packaging of secretory products.</p>

<h2 class="MsoNormal">Cytoplasm</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h3 class="MsoNormal">Mitochondria</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Located within the cytoplasm are many other organelles.<span> </span>The mitochondria are the power houses of the cell.<span> </span>Chemical reactions within the mitochondria provide energy for the activities of the cell.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h3 class="MsoNormal">Lysosomes</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Lysosomes are membranous sacs that function as storage vesicles for powerful digestive enzymes.<span> </span>They may act as the cell&#8217;s digestive system, hydrolyzing materials taken in by endocytosis.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h3 class="MsoNormal">Microtubules</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Microtubules and microfilaments appear to function in intracellular movement and cell support.<span> </span>Microtubules also form the spindle of dividing cells and are the essential components of centrioles, cilia, and flagella.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<h1 class="MsoNormal">Cellular metabolism<span> </span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Cellular metabolism is a general term embracing the myriad of enzyme-mediated reactions of a living cell.<span> </span>It can be divided into two phases:<span> </span>anabolism – the building up phase – and catabolism – the breaking down phase.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before the potential energy is stored in complex organic compounds, it can be used by the cell to do work.<span> </span>The compounds must be broken down in a series of chemical reactions and the energy transferred to ATP.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Glycolysis</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">The first series of reactions in the degradation of glucose is termed glycolysis.<span> </span>It is the breakdown of glucose to two molecules of Pyruvic acid with the production of two molecules of NADH, a net gain of two ATP molecules.<span> </span>This process common to all living cells is anaerobic, meaning oxygen is not needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Fermentation</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">The fate of the Pyruvic acid depends on the oxygen supply.<span> </span>In the absence of sufficient oxygen, the Pyruvic acid maybe reduced by NADH to form carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol or lactic acid in a process called &#8220;fermentation.&#8221;<span> </span>NAD molecules, thus formed, are available to be reused in glycolysis.<span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Cellular Respiration</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Under aerobic conditions, the Pyruvic acid can be further oxidized with the accompanying synthesis of ATP.<span> </span>This process is called cellular respiration.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<h2 class="MsoNormal">Kreb&#8217;s Cycle</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">The process begins with the breakdown of two Pyruvic acid molecules to form two molecules each of acetyl coenzyme-A, carbon dioxide, and NADH.<span> </span>The acetyl coenzyme-A is fed into the Krebs&#8217; citric acid cycle.<span> </span>In the course of this cycle, two carbons are lost as carbon dioxide, a molecule of ATP is synthesized, and eight hydrogens are removed and picked up by carrier compounds forming three molecules of NADH and one of FADH too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since one molecule of glucose gives rise to two molecule of acetyl coenzyme-A, two turns of the cycle occur for each molecule of glucose oxidized.<span> </span>The final stage of respiration involves the passage of the hydrogen electrons from the carrier molecules down a respiratory chain of electron transport molecules down to oxygen with which the electrons and hydrogen ions from the medium combine to form water.</p>

<h2 class="MsoNormal">Oxidative Phosphorylation</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">As the electrons are lowered step-by-step down the energy grade end, energy is released and some of it is used to make ATP.<span> </span>This process is called &#8220;oxidative phosphorylation.&#8221;<span> </span>The total number of new ATP molecules produced by the complete metabolic breakdown of glucose is usually <strong>36</strong> :</p>

		<itunes:summary>Episode 20: Welcome to the MCAT Podcast series, where Doctor Dan will cover the actual science material required for the MCAT. Starting off with an overview of Biological Sciences topics, we'll get increasingly more specific as time passes.



 
Biology for the MCAT


Classes of Organic Molecules
 
Four major classes of organic molecules found in living organisms are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and nucleic acids.


Condensation Reactions
 
Though these classes of molecule have different structure and function, they are built up of many similar building block molecules bonded together. In each case, building block molecules are combined by the removal of water, and this is called "condensation reactions."
 
Condensation reactions are reversible. The complex organic molecules can be hydrolyzed into the simpler building blocks molecules with the addition of water. The basic building block molecules of carbohydrates are the simple sugars or monosaccharides.


Disaccharide Bonds
 
When two simple sugars are bonded together, a disaccharide is formed. When many simple sugars are bonded together in long chains, a polysaccharide is formed.  Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are examples of polysaccharides.
 
The carbohydrates are an important energy source for all organisms. Lipids, the fats, and fat-like substances tend to be insoluble in water. Fats are made up of two building block molecules – glycerol and fatty acids. Phospholipids are derived from the fats. They are important constituents of cell membranes.


Peptide Bonds
 
The basic building block molecules of the proteins are amino acids. Amino acids are bonded together to form a protein by condensation reactions. The resulting bond is the peptide bond and the chains produced are polypeptide chains. The primary structure of each protein is the sequence and type of amino acids making up the polypeptide chains.
 
Because hydrogen bonds form between one amino acid and another, the chain assumes a stable regular shape known as the secondary structure. These regular molecules may in turn be folded into complicated globular shapes by weak attractions between the different R groups within the chain, thus forming the tertiary structure of the protein.


Nucleotide Bonds
 
Some globular proteins are made up of two or more polypeptide chains held together by weak bonds. The way these chains fit together determines the ordinary structure. Because the conformation of a protein depends on weak bonds, it is easily altered causing a change in biological function.
 
The building block unit of nucleic acids is the nucleotide, which is made up of a five carbon sugar attached to a phosphate group and to a nitrogen-containing base. Nucleotide units are joined together through condensation reactions between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate group of the next.
 
There are four different nucleotides in each nucleic acid. It is the different sequences of the nucleotides that encode their hereditary information. The two types of nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, differ in their basic make up and in the number of strands in the molecule. We will be discussing this in greater detail later.


Free Energy and Enzymes
 
Chemical reactions that release free energy are exothermic or exergonic. Reactions that require the addition of free energy are endothermic or endergonic. In living systems, an exothermic reaction is usually coupled with an endothermic reaction. Although exothermic reaction proceeds spontaneously, initiating a reaction may require an activation energy.
 
Chemical reactions can be speeded up by heat, by increasing the concentrations of the reactants, or by providing the appropriate catalyst. In living systems, the catalysts are enzymes. Most enzymes are highly specific and each can interact only with those reactants or substrates that fit spatially and chemically into the active site of the enzyme.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 19: Would you like to have an entire MP3 series dedicated to the MCAT? Well, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on right now. Listen to this Renal Physiology lecture for a sample of what&#8217;s to come!</p>
<p></p>
<h1><strong>Renal Physiology</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>A. ECF/ICF</strong></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">ECF (1/3)  = extracellular fluid of two compartments – vascular (1/3) and  interstitial (2/3)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">ICF (2/3)  = intracellular fluid compartment</p>
<p>Example: how many liters of isotonic saline do you have to infuse to  get 1 liter into the plasma? 3 Liters (2/3:1/3 relationship); 2 liters  in interstial space, and 1 L would go to the vascular space; it  equilibrates with interstial/vascular compartments.</p>
<h2><strong>B. Osmolality </strong>=</h2>
<p>Measure of solutes in a fluid; due to three things: Na, glucose, and  blood urea nitrogen (BUN) – urea cycle is located in the liver, partly  in the cytosol and partly in the mitochondria; usually multiply Na times  2 (b/c one Na and one Cl). Normal Na is 135-140 range, times that by 2  that 280. For glucose, normal is 100 divide that by 18, let’s say it’s  roughly 5, so that’s not contributing much. BUN:  located in the liver,  part of the cycle is in the cytosol and part of it is in mitochondria.  The urea comes from ammonia, that’s ammonia is gotten rid of, by urea.  B/c the end product of the urea cycle is urea. The normal is about 12;  divide that by 3, so we have 4. Therefore, in a normal person Na is  controlling the plasma osmolality. To measure serum osmolality: double  the serum Na and add 10.</p>
<h2><strong>C. Osmosis =<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Among intracellular, intravascular, and interstitial spaces, 2 of  these 3 are limited to the ECF compartment. One can equilibrate between  ECF and ICF across the cell membranes – urea; therefore, with an  increased urea, it can equilibrate equally on both sides to it will be  equal on both sides; this is due to osmosis.</p>
<p>B/c Na and glucose are limited to the ECF compartment, then changes  in its concentration will result in the movement of WATER from low to  high concentration  (opposite of diffusion – ie in lungs, 100 mmHg in  alveoli of O2, and returning from the tissue is 40 mmHg pO2; 100 vs. 40,  which is bigger, 100 is bigger, so via diffusion, O2 moves through the  interspace into the plasma to increase O2 to about 95mmHb). Therefore,  in diffusion, it goes from high to low, while in osmosis, it goes from  low to high concentration.</p>
<h3>1. Hyponatremia</h3>
<p>Example: In the case with hyponatremia – water goes from ECF into the  ICF, b/c the lower part is in the ECF (hence HYPOnatremia); water goes  into the ICF, and therefore is expanded by osmosis. Now make believe  that the brain is a single cell, what will we see? cerebral edema and  mental status abnormalities via law of osmosis (the intracellular  compartment of all the cells in the brain would be expanded)</p>
<h3>2. Hypernatremia</h3>
<p>Example: hypernatremia – water goes out of the ICF into the ECF,  therefore the ICF will be contracted. So in the brain, it will lead to  contracted cells, therefore mental status abnormalities; therefore, with  hypo and hypernatremia, will get mental status abnormalities of the  brain.</p>
<h3>3. Diabetic ketoacidosis</h3>
<p>Example: DKA – have (1000mg) large amount blood sugar. Remember that  both Na and glucose are limited to the ECF compartment. You would think  that glucose is in the ICF but it’s not. You think that since glycolysis  occurs in the cytosol therefore glucose in the ICF (again its not) b/c  to order to get into the cell (intracellular), glucose must bind to  phosphorus, generating G6P, which is metabolized (it’s the same  with  fructose and galactose, which are also metabolized immediately,  therefore, there is no glucose, fructose, or galactose, per se,  intracellularly). So, with hyperglycemia, there is high glucose in the  ECF, so water will move from ICF to ECF. Therefore, the serum Na  concentration will go down – this is called dilutional hyponatremia  (which is what happens to the serum sodium with hyperglycemia).</p>
<p>Therefore the two things that control water in the ECF are Na and  glucose; but a normal situation, Na controls. Urea does not control  water movements b/c its permeable, and can get through both compartments  to have equal concentrations on both sides.</p>
<h2><strong>D. Tonicity </strong>=</h2>
<p>Isotonic state, hypotonic state, and hypertonic state. We have all  different types of saline: Isotonic saline, hypotonic saline (1/2 normal  saline, ¼ normal saline, 5% dextrose in water), and  hypertonic saline  (3%, 5%); normal saline is 0.9%. We are referring to normal tonicity of  the plasma, which is controlled by the serum Na. These are the three  types of tonicity (iso, hypo, and hyper). Serum Na is a reflection of  total body Na divided by total body H20. For example: hypernatremia is  not just caused by increased total body Na; it can also be caused by  decreasing total body water with a normal total body Na, therefore there  is an increase in serum Na concentration. It is really a ratio of total  body Na to total body H20. To determine serum Na, just look at serum  levels. With different fluid abnormalities, can lose or gain a certain  tonicity of fluid.</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Isotonic loss of fluid </strong></h3>
<p>– look at ratio of total body Na and water; in this case, you are  losing equal amounts of water and Na, hence ISOtonic. This fluid is  mainly lost from the ECF. The serum Na concentration is normal when  losing isotonic fluid. ECF would look contracted. There would be no  osmotic gradient moving into or out of the ECF. Clinical conditions  where there is an isotonic loss of fluid: hemorrhage, diarrhea. If we  have an <strong>isotonic gain</strong>, we have in equal increase in salt and  water; ie someone getting too much isotonic saline; normal serum Na,  excess isotonic Na would be in the ECF, and there would be no osmotic  gradient for water movement.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Hypotonic solutions</strong></h3>
<p>A hypotonic solution, by definition, means hyponatremia. Hypoglycemia  will not produce a hypotonic condition.</p>
<p>MCC of low osmolality in plasma is hyponatremia. How? Lose more salt  than water, therefore, serum Na would be decreased. If losing more salt  than water, kidney is probably the location of where/why it is  happening. Main place to deal with sodium (either to get rid of it or to  get it back) is in  kidney, esp when dealing with diuretics (Furosemide  and HCTZ). The tonicity of solution you lose in your urine is  HYPERtonic, so that’s how you end up with hyponatremia with a hypotonic  condition. ECF concentration is low with hyponatremia, therefore the  water will move into the ICF compartment. (Osmosis-remember low to high)</p>
<h4>Syndrome of Inappropriate Andidiuretic Hormone (SIADH):</h4>
<p>Example: If you gained pure water, and no salt, you have really  lowered your  serum Na:  MCC = SIADH – in small cell carcinoma of the  lung; you gain pure water b/c ADH renders the distal and the collecting  tubule permeable to free water. With ADH present, will be reabsorbing  water back into the ECF compartment, diluting the serum Na, and the ECF  and ICF will be expanded. The ECF is expanded due to water reabsorption,  and the ICF is expanded b/c it has a high concentration levels (its  levels are not diluted). This can lead to mental status abnormalities.  Therefore, the more water you drink, the lower your serum Na levels  would be. The treatment is by restricting water. Don’t want to restrict  Na b/c  the Na levels are normal. When ADH is present, you will  CONCENTRATE your urine b/c taking free water out of urine; with absent  ADH, lose free water and the urine is diluted. Therefore, for with  SIADH, water  stays in the body, goes into the ECF compartment, and then  move into the ICF compartment via osmosis. The lowest serum sodium will  be in SIADH. On the boards, when serum Na is less than 120, the answer  is always SIADH. Example: pt with SIADH, not a smoker (therefore not a  small cell carcinoma), therefore, look at drugs – she was on  chlorpropramide, oral sulfylureas produce SIADH.</p>
<h4>Right Heart Failure and Hepatic Cirrhosis:</h4>
<p>Example: Gain both water and salt, but more water than salt, leading  to hyponatremia – these are the pitting edema states – ie RHF, cirrhosis  of the liver. When total body Na is increased, it always produces   pitting edema. What compartment is the total body Na in? ECF What is the  biggest ECF compartment? Interstial compartment. Therefore, increase in  total body Na will lead to expansion of interstial compartment  f the  ECF, water will follow the Na, therefore you get expansion via  transudate and pitting edema; seen in right HF and cirrhosis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: hypertonic loss of salt (from diuretic) leads to  hyponatremia</li>
<li>Example: SIADH (gaining a lot of water) leads to hyponatremia</li>
<li>Example: gaining more water than salt will lead to hyponatremia:  pitting edema</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
<h3>3. <strong>Hypertonic state </strong></h3>
<p>A hypertonic solution, by definition means too much Na  (hypernatremia) <strong>or</strong> hyperglycemia. Unlike in a hypotonic solution,  you can have glucose contribute to this state. For example, a patient  with DKA has a hypertonic condition, which is more common than  hypernatremia. With hypernatremia,  what does ICF look like? It will  always be contracted or shrunken.</p>
<h4>Primary aldosteronsim</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Gain more  salt and water.</p>
<h4>Diabetes insipidus</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Lose pure  water (vs. gaining pure salt in SIADH). If you lose more water than  salt in the urine, you have osmotic diuresis – mixture. When there is  glucose and mannitol in the urine, you’re losing hypotonic salt solution  in urine.</p>
<h4>Infant diarrhea</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hypotonic  salt solution (adult diarrhea is isotonic), therefore, if baby has no  access to water and has a rotavirus infection, serum sodium should be  high because losing more water than salt, leading to hypernatremia.  However, most moms give the baby water to correct the diarrhea;  therefore the baby will come in with normal serum Na or even  hyponatremia b/c the denominator (H2O) is increased. Treatment is  pedialyte and Gatorade – these are hypotonic salt solution (just give  them back what they lost). What has to be in pedialyte and what has to  be in Gatorade to order to reabsorb the Na in the GI tract? Glucose b/c  of the co-transport. With the co-transport, the Na HAS to be reabsorbed  with glucose or galactose. Example: cholera, in oral replacement, need  glucose to reabsorb Na b/c co-transport pump located in the small  intestine. Gatorade has glucose and sucrose (which is converted to  fructose and glucose).</p>
<h4>Sweat</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hypotonic  salt solution; if you are sweating in a marathon, you will have  hypernatremia.</p>
<h2><strong>E. Volume Compartments</strong></h2>
<h3>Physiologic response to hypovolemia:</h3>
<p>Arterial blood volume is same as stroke volume and CO (cardiac  output). When Cardiac Output decreases, all physiologic processes occur  to restore volume. With decrease CO (ie hypovolemia), oxygenated blood  will not get to tissues, and we can die. Therefore, volume is essential  to our bodies.</p>
<h4>1. Baroreceptors</h4>
<p>We have baroreceptors (low and high pressure ones). The low pressure  ones are on the venous side, while the high pressure ones are on the  arterial side (ie the carotids and arch of aorta). They are usually  innervated by CN 9 and 10 (the high pressure ones). When there is a  decrease in arterial blood volume (decreased SV or CO), it will under  fill the arch vessels and the carotid; instead of 9th or 10th nerve  response, you have a sympathetic NS response, therefore catecholamines  are released. This is good b/c they will constrict the venous system,  which will increase blood returning to the right side of the heart (do  not want venodilation b/c it will pool in your legs).</p>
<h4>2. Catecholamines</h4>
<p>Catecholamines will act on the beta adrenergic receptors on the  heart, which will increase the force of contraction, there will be an  increase in stroke volume (slight) and it will increase heart rate (“+”  chronotropic effect on the heart, increase in systolic BP). Arterioles  on the systemic side: stimulate beta receptors in smooth muscle.  Diastolic pressure is really due to the amount of blood in the arterial  system, while you heart is filling with blood.</p>
<h4>3. Arterioles: The gatekeeper of tissue perfusion</h4>
<p>Who controls the amount of blood in arteriole system, while your  heart is filling in diastole? Your peripheral resistance arterioles –  that maintains your diastolic blood pressure. So, when they are  constricted, very little blood is going to the tissues (bad news); good  news: keep up  diastolic pressure – this is important b/c the coronary  arteries fill in diastoles. This is all done with catecholamines.</p>
<h4>4. Renin-Angiotensin System</h4>
<p>Renin system is activated by catecholamines, too; angiotensin II can  vasoconstrictor the peripheral arterioles (therefore it helps the  catecholamines). AG II stimulates 18 hydroxylase, which converts  corticosterone into aldosterone, and stimulates aldosterone release,  which leads to reabsorption of salt and water to get cardiac output up.  With decreased SV, renal blood flow to the kidney is decreased, and the  RAA can be stimulated by this mechanism, too. Where exactly are the  receptors for the  juxtaglomerlur apparatus? Afferent arteriole. There  are sensors, which are modified smooth muscle cells that sense blood  flow. ADH will be released from a nerve response, and pure water will  increase but that does not help with increasing the cardiac output. Need  salt to increase CO.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Example:  bleeding to death and there is a loss of 3 L’s of fluid – how can you  keep BP up?  Give normal saline is isotonic therefore the saline will  stay in the ECF compartment. Normal saline is plasma without the   protein. Any time you have hypovolemic shock, give normal saline to  increase BP b/c it stays in the ECF compartment. Cannot raise BP with ½  normal saline or 5% dextrose; have to give something that  resembles  plasma and has the same tonicity of plasma. Normal saline is 0.9%.  Peritubular capillary pressures: you reabsorb most of the sodium in the  proximal tubule (60- 80%). Where is the rest absorbed?; in  the distal  and collecting tubule by aldosterone. The Na is reabsorbed into the  peritubular capillaries. Starling forces in the capillaries must be  amenable to it. Two starling forces: oncotic pressure (keeps fluids in   the vessel) and hydrostatic (pushes fluids out of vessel).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Example:  When renal blood flow is decreased (with a decreased SV and CO), what  happens to the peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure? It decreases.  Therefore, the peritubular oncotic pressure is increasing (ie the force  that keeps fluids in the vessel), and that is responsible for  reabsorption of anything into the blood stream from the kidney. This is  why PO (peritubular oncotic pressure) &gt; PH (hydrostatic pressure of  peritubular capillary), allows absorption of salt containing fluid back  into blood stream into the kidney. Tonicity of fluid reabsorbing out of  proximal tubule is isotonic (like giving normal saline). ADH is   reabsorbing isotonic salt solution, but not as much as the proximal  tubule. ADH contributes pure water, therefore, with all this  reabsorption you have an isotonic sol’n add the ADH effect and the pt  becomes  slightly hyponatremic and hypotonic, therefore absorbs into the  ECF compartment when there is a decreased CO.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Opposite  Example: increased SV, and increase arterial volume, will lead to  stretch of baroreceptors (innervated by 9th and 10th nerve), and a  parasympathetic response will be elicited, instead of a sympathetic  response. There will not be any venuloconstriction nor any increase in  the force of contraction of the heart. This is fluid overload; therefore  we need to get rid of all the volume. There is increased renal blood   flow, so the RAA will not be activated. Fluid overload does not ADH be  released. The peritubular hydrostatic pressure is greater than the  oncotic. Even of the pt absorbed salt, it wouldn’t go into the blood  stream, and it would be pee’d out. Therefore pt is losing hypotonic salt  solution with increased in arterial blood volume. Need to know what  happens if there is decreased CO, what happens when ANP is released from  the atria, and give off diuretic effect; it wants to get rid salt. ANP  is only released in volume overloaded states.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Example:  pt given 3% hypertonic saline: what will happen to osmolality? Increase.  What will that do to serum ADH? Increase – increase of osmolality  causes a release of ADH.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Example:  What happens in a pt with SIADH? decreased plasma osmolality, high ADH  levels.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Example:  What happens in a pt with DI? no ADH, therefore, serum Na increases, and  ADH is low How to tell total body Na in the pt: Two pics: – pt with dry  tongue = there is a decrease in total body Na, and the pt with  indentation of the skin, there is an increase in total body Na.  Dehydration: Skin turgur is preformed by pinching the skin, and when the  skin goes down, this tells you that total body Na is normal in  interstial  space. Also look in mouth and at mucous membranes. If you  have dependent pitting edema that means that there is an increase in  total body Na.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SIADH –  gaining pure water, total body sodium is normal, but serum Na is low;  have to restrict water.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Right HF  and dependent pitting edema – fluid kidney reabsorbs is hypotonic salt  solution with a decreased CO (little more water than salt), therefore  serum Na will low. Numerator is increased for total body sodium, but  denominator has larger increase with water.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What is  nonpharmalogical Rx of any edema states? (ie RHF/liver dz) – restrict  salt and water What is the Rx for SIADH = restrict H2O. What is the Rx  for any pitting edema state? Restrict salt and water. Pharmacological Rx  for pitting water – diuretics (also get rid of some salt).</p>

		<itunes:summary>Episode 19: Would you like to have an entire MP3 series dedicated to the MCAT? Well, that's what I'm working on right now. Listen to this Renal Physiology lecture for a sample of what's to come!


Renal Physiology
A. ECF/ICF
ECF (1/3)  = extracellular fluid of two compartments – vascular (1/3) and  interstitial (2/3)
ICF (2/3)  = intracellular fluid compartment

Example: how many liters of isotonic saline do you have to infuse to  get 1 liter into the plasma? 3 Liters (2/3:1/3 relationship); 2 liters  in interstial space, and 1 L would go to the vascular space; it  equilibrates with interstial/vascular compartments.
B. Osmolality =
Measure of solutes in a fluid; due to three things: Na, glucose, and  blood urea nitrogen (BUN) – urea cycle is located in the liver, partly  in the cytosol and partly in the mitochondria; usually multiply Na times  2 (b/c one Na and one Cl). Normal Na is 135-140 range, times that by 2  that 280. For glucose, normal is 100 divide that by 18, let’s say it’s  roughly 5, so that’s not contributing much. BUN:  located in the liver,  part of the cycle is in the cytosol and part of it is in mitochondria.  The urea comes from ammonia, that’s ammonia is gotten rid of, by urea.  B/c the end product of the urea cycle is urea. The normal is about 12;  divide that by 3, so we have 4. Therefore, in a normal person Na is  controlling the plasma osmolality. To measure serum osmolality: double  the serum Na and add 10.
C. Osmosis =

Among intracellular, intravascular, and interstitial spaces, 2 of  these 3 are limited to the ECF compartment. One can equilibrate between  ECF and ICF across the cell membranes – urea; therefore, with an  increased urea, it can equilibrate equally on both sides to it will be  equal on both sides; this is due to osmosis.

B/c Na and glucose are limited to the ECF compartment, then changes  in its concentration will result in the movement of WATER from low to  high concentration  (opposite of diffusion – ie in lungs, 100 mmHg in  alveoli of O2, and returning from the tissue is 40 mmHg pO2; 100 vs. 40,  which is bigger, 100 is bigger, so via diffusion, O2 moves through the  interspace into the plasma to increase O2 to about 95mmHb). Therefore,  in diffusion, it goes from high to low, while in osmosis, it goes from  low to high concentration.
1. Hyponatremia
Example: In the case with hyponatremia – water goes from ECF into the  ICF, b/c the lower part is in the ECF (hence HYPOnatremia); water goes  into the ICF, and therefore is expanded by osmosis. Now make believe  that the brain is a single cell, what will we see? cerebral edema and  mental status abnormalities via law of osmosis (the intracellular  compartment of all the cells in the brain would be expanded)
2. Hypernatremia
Example: hypernatremia – water goes out of the ICF into the ECF,  therefore the ICF will be contracted. So in the brain, it will lead to  contracted cells, therefore mental status abnormalities; therefore, with  hypo and hypernatremia, will get mental status abnormalities of the  brain.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis
Example: DKA – have (1000mg) large amount blood sugar. Remember that  both Na and glucose are limited to the ECF compartment. You would think  that glucose is in the ICF but it’s not. You think that since glycolysis  occurs in the cytosol therefore glucose in the ICF (again its not) b/c  to order to get into the cell (intracellular), glucose must bind to  phosphorus, generating G6P, which is metabolized (it’s the same  with  fructose and galactose, which are also metabolized immediately,  therefore, there is no glucose, fructose, or galactose, per se,  intracellularly). So, with hyperglycemia, there is high glucose in the  ECF, so water will move from ICF to ECF. Therefore, the serum Na  concentration will go down – this is called dilutional hyponatremia  (which is what happens to the serum sodium with hyperglycemia).

Therefore the two things that contro</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Episode 23: Doctor Dan outlines Phase 1 in the Evolution Of A Physician-In-Training, part of his work/life balance initiative that seeks to prevent burnout among medical students and doctors.

SEE THE FULL REPORT HERE: Evolution of a Physician In Training: Effects of the medical education pipeline on personal and professional development.

Daniel M. Williams, MD

The 5 phases of a physician in training are general categories that describe the professional and psychological changes that students can expect to face. These have been organized into a Medical School Mindmap full of 179 peer-reviewed, scientific articles that describe the processes necessary to become the consumate physician.
The Phases are as follows:

	Standing At The Precipice: The Premed Syndrome
	Adaptation
	Assimilation
	The Let-Down
	Reemergence

This area of research is meant to provide the foundation for a Health and Wellness Initiative among physicians. Physician Health is a top priority with Dr. Daniel Williams and each area is broken down inside the Medical Mastermind Community that has grown up around this ideal.

Here is an excerpt from the original draft:
Phase 1: Standing at the Precipice

Premedical students engaged in the early medical education pipeline frequently share similar goals and ambitions. The most commonly described premedical student traits are hard working, competitive, motivated, goal-oriented, altruism, and prestige-seeking (22-24). Fairly early in their premedical experience they begin to learn of the imperfection in the system.

A number of frustrations faced by these bright, enthusiastic students begin before even entering medical school. The challenges face by these future physicians can be categorized as follows:

	Selection Bias. Learning that affirmative action exists without understanding the need for      diversity can be a shock (143,145,156).
	Academic Preparation. Realizing their undergraduate premedical and M.C.A.T. preparation may not actually predict how competent they will be as physicians can be disheartening (46,45,48).
	Premedical Advising. Many students encounter premedical advisers, though wonderful      guidance has been published for decades (11,15,17).
	Admissions Criteria. The paradigm shift being birthed in premedical curriculum, which seeks to broaden one’s humanities background and foster empathetic relationships, is taking a surprisingly long time (4,6,27,28,30,31). The transition period as more medical schools are changing their admissions criteria and interview process can leave the premedical student confused about what is important in their preparation (184).

Because these sytstem-wide messages that contradict their altruistic nature, it is not surprising that the majority of students matriculating into medical school already have a well established ethical framework that is difficult to mold (26).

Further, two of the most historically trusted sources of information flat fail the premedical student attempting to learn about medical education.

		<itunes:summary>Episode 20: MCAT Prep like you've never heard before. Dr. Ferdinand and Dr. Dan discuss the MCAT from a physician's point of view. With both doctors actively coaching premedical students, their synergy on this subject is nothing short of a Mastermind!
 
 
 
Dr. Ferdinand’s tells us about his not-so-secret performance on the MCAT and about his fatal error during planning his MCAT that caused him to not be able to even take the exam!
Listen to ALL of the expert interviews on the Medical School Podcast.
 
[More...]
 
The Association of American Medical Colleges administers the MCAT, accredits allopathic medical schools in the U.S., and manages the medical school application service.
 
 
 
The trend over the past 2 decades has been to emphasize thinking, organizing information, and problem solving rather than rote memorization.
 
 
 
In this episode, we two physicians discuss exactly why that is, what you can do to prepare, and ultimately whom you can trust when it comes to such an important exam – yourself!
 
 
 
Future episodes will cover
 
 * Dr. Ferdinand’s 6 Steps to MCAT Preparation, which is remarkably similar to my 5-Step study method.
 * Dr. Ferdinant’s interview with the "Father of MCAT Books" (Dr. Flowers)
 * How a mastermind community can help premeds AND medical students

<p>Announcements:      * <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/pre-med/cd-of-the-month-club" target="_self">CD of the Month Club</a> is now in it&#8217;s 21st month. The infrastructure for mass production is now in place.</p>
<p>Check out the new <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/category/podcast" target="_self">MCAT podcast interviews </a>with GOLD STANDARD MCAT author, Dr. Brett Ferdinand</p>
<p>The <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/podcast/speed-reading-for-medical-school" target="_self">Medical Mastermind Community</a> is now live! Call me on our next <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/med/med-school-conference-schedule" target="_self">pre-med conference call</a>!</p>
<p>*******************************************************</p>
<p>A future doctor recently told me she made a 16% on a full-length Kaplan Practice MCAT. While that sounds bad, let&#8217;s put that score into perspective and look at how overall core knowledge deepens &#8211; specifically, how that is reflected in practice test scores.  We&#8217;ll also delve into how to predict what score you&#8217;ll make on the actual MCAT.</p>
<p>This was my answer: &#8220;I sincerely understand your frustration and experienced it myself after taking the Kaplan course and my grades averaged out to be the same, having taken the MCAT 3 times. As a premed adviser now, I get this question a lot. You are not alone.&#8221;  You have a multi-part topic, so let me take each item in turn:  1. What do people actually make on the MCAT? What is the MCAT cut-off?</p>
<p>Please give me real numbers!  It&#8217;s on a bell curve so if you&#8217;ve taken statistics you know that they can separate out the elite by keeping people away from the 100% correct end of the spectrum. In fact, 60% raw correct answers can actually be solid and each test is weighted differently. See, each test is drawn from a bank and each question is weighted for it&#8217;s own usefulness.</p>
<p>There are a significant amount of test questions that are being assessed as keepers, but are not part of your grading.  Here is where you can find the most recent REAL MD MCAT scores in Texas, Osteopathic MCAT Scores,  and AMCAS MCAT Scores.</p>
<p>2. Do practice MCAT tests commonly show low scores? [Better yet, do these low practice scores really reflect how well I'll do on the real MCAT?]  ANSWER: A full-length practice MCAT form a reputable source, such as Kaplan, AAMC, or Princeton review are reasonable reflections of how well you&#8217;ll do on the real thing. How to interpret your performance on these tests is actually more useful in real life.  As a rule of thumb, scoring between 60-70% is actually average and approaching a solid score. Let me be clear, I&#8217;m not talking about little quizzes because the sample size of questions does not give you an accurate representation of your body of knowledge. Only pay attention to full-length, timed tests. I recommend you do between 3-7 of them, until you consistently get your overall average over 60% correct. If you expect to ace the MCAT you&#8217;ll want closer to an 80% average.</p>
<p>3. Is there another way to prepare for the MCAT?  ANSWER: The best way I teach people to prepare for the MCAT is to start learning the material from the first day in undergraduate, if possible. Buy a respected review book and take notes in it while in undergrad and taking those classes. Write down revelations and pearls of wisdom as you begin to get insight into the different prerequisite disciplines &#8211; keep the book near you and review it periodically.  Too many people only &#8220;review&#8221; for the MCAT, which often means RELEARNING material form 1.5 years ago or more and this is a tremendous waste of brainpower, not to mention the added stress has been shown to decrease long-term memory (cited resource is a meta-analysis).  *******************************************************</p>
<p>Residency Spotlight: Surgery  After 4 years of medical school, General Surgery takes 5 years. Many people sub-specialize after that and go to fellowships. Fellowships may be in GI Surgery, Pediatric Surgery, Trauma, or transplant.  There are some training programs that are surgical which do not require a General Surgery residency first: Urology, Ob/Gyn, and Neurosurgery.  Cheers, Doctor Dan</p>

<li><a href="http://medical-school-conference.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3rd Annual Medical School LIFE Conference</span></a> will be May 29-30, 2010. The first one was a weekend series for the American Medical Student Association chapter at the University of Houston. Out of those conferences, the Pre-Med DVD Course was build as a sort of basic training. The following year charter members of the Medical Mastermind Community met for a weekend conference in which we led a Service Learning Project. The result was a grant proposal submitted to the National Institutes of Health to enrich students&#8217; medical education journey and encourage service to the medically underserved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All 200 of the peer-reviewed, scientific journal articles were posted inside the web site for members only. They outline every facet of the medical education journey and correspond to the 5 Phases in the Evolution of a Physician in Training, which is my <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/med-students/burnout-prevention"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Physician Wellness Initiative</span></span></a>. The idea is to increase awareness, receive validation, and try suggestions from others to find relief. So, just read the articles as you face the different ups and downs along the way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All of the <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/med-students/usmle-preparation-exams"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">medical school exams</span></span></a> were also uploaded to the website. Previously they were only available as part of the CD of the Month Club, but we found it was inconvenient not knowing which tests covered specific material. The web outline breaks down each block exam by the topics covered on each set of tests. You can check out the navigation without logging in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../facebook"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facebook 30-day challenge</span></a>. If you&#8217;ll make a video about the Medical School Podcast or Speed Reading for Medical School course, I&#8217;ll give you a free, 30-day account tot he Medical Mastermind Community online &#8211; a $27.99 value. This includes our biweekly conference calls, from which <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/video-archives"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">video archives</span></span></a> are now all updated.</li>

		<itunes:summary>3rd Annual Medical School LIFE Conference will be May 29-30, 2010. The first one was a weekend series for the American Medical Student Association chapter at the University of Houston. Out of those conferences, the Pre-Med DVD Course was build as a sort of basic training. The following year charter members of the Medical Mastermind Community met for a weekend conference in which we led a Service Learning Project. The result was a grant proposal submitted to the National Institutes of Health to enrich students' medical education journey and encourage service to the medically underserved.


	All 200 of the peer-reviewed, scientific journal articles were posted inside the web site for members only. They outline every facet of the medical education journey and correspond to the 5 Phases in the Evolution of a Physician in Training, which is my Physician Wellness Initiative. The idea is to increase awareness, receive validation, and try suggestions from others to find relief. So, just read the articles as you face the different ups and downs along the way.


	All of the medical school exams were also uploaded to the website. Previously they were only available as part of the CD of the Month Club, but we found it was inconvenient not knowing which tests covered specific material. The web outline breaks down each block exam by the topics covered on each set of tests. You can check out the navigation without logging in.


	Facebook 30-day challenge. If you'll make a video about the Medical School Podcast or Speed Reading for Medical School course, I'll give you a free, 30-day account tot he Medical Mastermind Community online - a $27.99 value. This includes our biweekly conference calls, from which video archives are now all updated.

<p>Call me, Doctor Dan, in one of our <a href="http://medical-mastermind-community.com/med-students/mastermind-groups" target="_blank">Medical Mastermind Support Groups</a> and discover how to stay true to yourself during rigors of the medical education marathon.</p>

<p>The &#8220;medical education process&#8221; covers the whole gamut from thinking about becoming a doctor, through the prerequisites, MCAT, and application, and never really ends in residency, fellowship and with continuing medical education as a practicing physician.</p>
<p>Do you have what it takes to be a lifelong learner?</p>
<p>Better yet, how many people really encourage you to follow that dream? My guess is that you&#8217;re like the hundreds of students I have coached, and that you&#8217;ve had some degree of discouragement along the way.</p>
<p>While there are many reasons for this, the only thing that matters to the motivated pre-med and medical student is getting through it &#8211; sanely!</p>
<p>Well, that my friend is exactly what the Medical Mastermind Community is all about. This video describes a hint of what the upcoming community is all about. If you want to learn more, sign up at MedicalMastery.com on the Early Notification List and be included.</p>
<p>In the meantime, seek out existing pre-med clubs, medical student organizations, Healer&#8217;s Art courses or hospital volunteer offices for support. If someone brings you down, stresses you out, or discourages you from accomplishing your dreams &#8211; get away from them!</p>
<p>Yes, this may mean friends and family. They&#8217;ll come around later when you&#8217;re successful, believe me. You need new friends. Just like the saying &#8220;you are what you eat&#8221;, you think like those with which you spend your time.</p>
<p>Hope this was an encouragement and sparks some self-care interest. The medical education process is a substantial percentage of your adult life &#8211; don&#8217;t forget to live!</p>

The "medical education process" covers the whole gamut from thinking about becoming a doctor, through the prerequisites, MCAT, and application, and never really ends in residency, fellowship and with continuing medical education as a practicing physician.

Do you have what it takes to be a lifelong learner?

Better yet, how many people really encourage you to follow that dream? My guess is that you're like the hundreds of students I have coached, and that you've had some degree of discouragement along the way.

While there are many reasons for this, the only thing that matters to the motivated pre-med and medical student is getting through it - sanely!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 14: Life after the medical school application? How to preempt the unexpected with a surprising amount of foresight!</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>The medical school application is only one phase of your life. In this podcast and blog, I put this event in to the context of the entire medical school application process, give you some things to look forward to and prepare for, as well as direct you to where you can find an entire archive of tips like these all in one place.</p>
<p>By the time you submit your medical school application, you deserve a pat on the back. After all, you&#8217;ve completed the MCAT (in most cases), most of the medical school prerequisites and college, and overcome a large part of the mind game &#8211; talking yourself out of it. Many people change their mind and a growing trend is for ill informed pre-health advisers, with no qualification to speak on the subject, to discourage attending medical school.</p>
<p>From the time you submit your medical school application to the time you start your first day of medical school, there are a lot of activities that take place.<br />
<span id="more-1127"></span><br />
Interviews, ranking programs for the electronic match, match day, welcome parties, moving, and shopping. Oh yea, and preparing those closest to you that you&#8217;re about the be besieged by books and to prepare for some distance. Let&#8217;s take each of these in turn&#8230;</p>
<p>Getting an interview is often the hardest part to getting into medical school. More specifically, getting an adequate number of interviews. How many medical school interviews is enough? Most people feel ten is a good number. Why so many? Because they interview 7-10 times more students than they have seats for.</p>
<p>After you complete all of your interviews, you log in to the online ranking and matching service and rank the programs in order of your preference (only the ones you interviewed at). If there&#8217;s a school you don&#8217;t want to go to under any circumstances, you don&#8217;t have to rank it in your list even if you interviewed there. An important step is to &#8220;certify your rank order list&#8221;. You can rearrange the list as you decide for weeks, but once you certify it there&#8217;s no turning back. (I certified mine the day before.) If you don&#8217;t certify you&#8217;re not in the match, so don&#8217;t wait too long.</p>
<p>I made a video tutorial on the match application and ranking system. It&#8217;s the only behind-the-scenes look available and I&#8217;ll tell you how to get your hands on it at the end of this podcast.</p>
<p>In November of 2008, I released Episode 9 and we discussed drastic changes in the match system, primarily those in the Texas system. You can visit that episode in iTunes or MedicalMastery.com.</p>
<p>Match day will be memorable no matter what happens. At a certain day and time, usually around February or March, thousands log in to the online ranking service to find out if they&#8217;ve matched and where.</p>
<p>The match also occurs in the 4th year of med school and is very similar, but I thought I&#8217;d discuss the differences here.</p>
<p>This is really similar to a 3-day process, so let&#8217;s take the events in order:</p>
<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Login to see if you matched or not. It tells you YES or NO, not where you matched.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: </strong>Those that didn&#8217;t match are able to view a list of all programs that have unfilled residency positions. Your medical school usually helps you find a program somewhere during a 48 hour period known as</p>
<p>the scramble.</p>
<p><strong>Day 3: </strong>Two days later you meet at your school and usually have some sort of ceremony to find out where you matched.</p>
<p>Included in my archives are a Video on residency considerations and an article on program results by specialty.</p>
<p>Many medical schools have some sort of Welcome Weekend, or event before medical school that allows you to meet people, loosen up, and get psyched for medical school. In my school we did this the weekend right before it started. This is a very fun time and where you&#8217;ll meet many lifelong friends.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 13: Steps you can take NOW for balance in your medical career. You decide what&#8217;s important and implement a plan to keep it that way&#8230;<br />
====================================================</p>
<p>Announcements:<br />
Dropping a hint about my big project&#8230;got a high speed internet connection?</p>
<p>Also, for simplicity all CD&#8217;s will be mailed out during the last week of the month.</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>Podcast topic</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had it to do all over again, what would you do different?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a question I get a lot, in different forms. In fact my new big project I&#8217;m coming out with in the next few months is exactly geared toward answering this question &#8211; in all it&#8217;s detail.</p>
<p>See, feedback from my podcasting has made me realize that my experience with the premed obstacles you face is fodder for you cannon! I get just as excited with you as I coach students and reawaken their dreams of becoming a physician.</p>
<p>The biggest tips I can think of to answer this question with brevity are the following:</p>
<p>1. As an undergrad, write out what my life&#8217;s priorities are. Establish from the beginning and keep the document handy for editing as time passes.</p>
<p><span id="more-1125"></span></p>
<p>2. Identify what you are and are NOT willing to sacrifice in persuit of your goals. The &#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything&#8221; mentality won&#8217;t be reliable forever.</p>
<p>3. The first year of medical school and then test weeks will clearly have to be priority during medical school. It&#8217;s four years, but many students schedule easier months during the last year.</p>
<p>4. Much further down the road, do the same thing when considering which residency specialty interests you. Many people change their minds about this over time so stay flexible as you learn new information.</p>
<p>5. Keep your &#8220;Life Priorities List&#8221; handy as you investigate your career options. Note: you really don&#8217;t have to do this until the end of the third year of medical school, when you schedule your electives for the fourth year.</p>
<p>Biggest tips for residency:</p>
<p>1. Choose something you are passionate about.</p>
<p>2. If possible, don&#8217;t make any BIG life changes. Of course, who can really plan these things? There&#8217;s never a &#8220;perfect&#8221; time to have a family..</p>
<p>3. Outline reservations you&#8217;ll have &#8211; that is, things you WON&#8217;T compromise clearly identified at the outset. As you progress through residency, which can be all-consuming, an indicator that you may need a career change is when you find yourself compromising your life&#8217;s priorities.</p>

<p>Episode 12: Ostopathic Medicine Training: What&#8217;s so special about it?</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>There is more than one way to become a physician: Allopathic and Osteopathic. Today&#8217;s discussion is about the pathway to doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.)</p>
<p>In addition to all of the traditional aspects of physician work that you&#8217;re familiar with, osteopathic physicians theoretically have a few other tenants that they emphasize:</p>
<p>1. The human body systems need to be in correct relationship with one another (really just normal physiology)<br />
<span id="more-1123"></span><br />
2. The musculoskeletal system gets some special attention.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to add a third: the osteopathic physician is taught to take care of the &#8220;whole patient&#8221;. Holistic medicine refers to the taking care of the whole person, i.e., mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health.</p>
<p>Really the only difference is that they can pop your back! They get all the same jobs, direct hospital departments, and go to all the same residency programs.</p>
<p>So, why are we talking about them? Because some people don&#8217;t apply to these programs as a first choice, leaving opportunities on the table for you.</p>
<p>In 2007, the average allopathic applicant had a MCAT score of 28 and a GPA of 3.5. An average osteopathic applicant had a MCAT of 25 and a GPA of 3.5.</p>
<p>Many residency programs accept the COMLEX exam, but some may also require the USMLE.</p>
<p>====================================================<br />
MEDICAL SPECIALTY SPOTLIGHT: Infectious Disease</p>
<p>4 years of medical school<br />
3 years of internal medicine residency<br />
2-3 years of fellowship training in Infectious Disease</p>
<p>Traditionally, Infectious Disease specialists operate as a consult service in the hospital. The main activity is in clinics.</p>
<p>The approach is not that the ID doctor is there when someone has an infection, but they are there to help when the treating physician confronts a complicated patient outside his or her expertise.</p>
<p>They also hold the purse strings for the hospital&#8217;s pharmacy by serving on committees that decide which drugs can be dispensed and which ones the hospital will and will not provide. The newer, expensive antibiotics often need special approval from the committee on an individual basis. They&#8217;re not being mean, their slowing down the evolutionary resistance mechanisms of the microorganisms trying to kill our patients.</p>

====================================================

There is more than one way to become a physician: Allopathic and Osteopathic. Today's discussion is about the pathway to doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.)

In addition to all of the traditional aspects of physician work that you're familiar with, osteopathic physicians theoretically have a few other tenants that they emphasize:

1. The human body systems need to be in correct relationship with one another (really just normal physiology)

2. The musculoskeletal system gets some special attention.

I'd like to add a third: the osteopathic physician is taught to take care of the "whole patient". Holistic medicine refers to the taking care of the whole person, i.e., mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health.

Really the only difference is that they can pop your back! They get all the same jobs, direct hospital departments, and go to all the same residency programs.

So, why are we talking about them? Because some people don't apply to these programs as a first choice, leaving opportunities on the table for you.

In 2007, the average allopathic applicant had a MCAT score of 28 and a GPA of 3.5. An average osteopathic applicant had a MCAT of 25 and a GPA of 3.5.

Many residency programs accept the COMLEX exam, but some may also require the USMLE.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 11: From MCAT to licensing &#8211; Overview of the entire medical education process. MCAT, First Year of Medical School, USMLE &#8211; and beyond&#8230;</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>Announcements:<br />
Happy New Year!<br />
It&#8217;s now been 9 months of podcasting and we have over 21,178 downloads. I&#8217;m very encouraged by your emails and support.</p>
<p>In that short amount of time, hundreds of your questions have been answered and organized into a mindmap. With your help we put together a comprehensive, individualized PreMed coaching program. Visit www.PremedicalUniversity.com for more information.</p>
<p>The PreMed CD of the month club now has a link on the right of MedicalMastery. There is room for 11 more people right now. First come, first serve. That link will only be available intermittently when seats are available.</p>
<p>Live Teleclinics now available. Sign up for the free PreMed eBook on MedicalMastery.com and you&#8217;ll also get email notification of upcoming teleclinics.</p>
<p>Submit topics in the online survey &#8220;Grill the Guru&#8221;. The Ebooks is 16 chapters emailed to you weekly with other, exclusive PreMed strategies and insider</p>
<p>advice also. In total, you&#8217;ll get over 3 months of PreMed email content that you can save, store, and search in your email service for years to come!</p>
<p>DON&#8217;T DELETE the emails.</p>
<p>====================================================<br />
Podcast topic</p>
<p>The first teleclinic we did had a nice video slide that covered all the steps in the medical education process. The new website that will host the free teleclinics.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve mapped out when you&#8217;ll be finished with college and all of the prerequisites for medical school, the next available August would be your first potential entering month and year. Plan to take the Medical College Admissions Test the year before.</p>
<p>You can successfully back-schedule from this date all of the necessary preparations so that you have time to do everything you need.</p>
<p>The first year of medical school is perhaps the hardest of all. You will be forced to adopt different learning styles for different types of information on the fly. The focus is on how the body works normally.</p>
<p><strong>FIRST YEAR CLASSES:</strong><br />
Biochemistry<br />
Cell development and tissue biology<br />
Community health<br />
Epidemiology / biostatistics<br />
Family medicine<br />
Gross anatomy<br />
Growth and development<br />
Health care policy<br />
Hematology<br />
Histology<br />
History of medicine<br />
Immunology<br />
Interviewing<br />
Introduction to clinical skills<br />
Medical ethics<br />
Molecular biology<br />
Physiology<br />
Preclinical electives<br />
Problem-based learning</p>
<p>The second year is when you learn what goes wrong with human physiology.</p>
<p><strong>SECOND YEAR CLASSES:</strong><br />
Addiction medicine<br />
General pathology</p>
<p><span id="more-1119"></span><br />
Infectious disease<br />
Introduction to clinical medicine<br />
Microbiology<br />
Psychopathology<br />
Psychiatry<br />
Nutrition<br />
Neuroscience<br />
Pathophysiology<br />
Pharmacology<br />
Preclinical electives<br />
Problem-based learning<br />
Systemic pathology</p>
<p>At the end of the second year, you take the United States Medical Licensing Exam, Step 1. This is the weightiest of the 4 USMLE exams as it affects which residency specialty you get into.</p>
<p>The third year starts 2 years of clinical rotations. Often one month long, you spend time doing many of the specialties.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD YEAR ROTATIONS:</strong><br />
Surgery<br />
Internal medicine<br />
Pediatrics<br />
Obstetrics and gynecology<br />
Psychiatry<br />
Primary Care</p>
<p>The USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge is taken before the end of medical school, as well as Step 3 Clinical Skills. The former is a computerized exam, the latter is an in-person, all day patient care simulation.</p>
<p>The fourth year is the most relaxed of all. By this time, you already have the letters of recommendations you need for residency application and the 4th year elective grades don&#8217;t matter as much as the USMLE Step 1 and basic science years&#8217; grades. Application for residency begins this year so some people have trouble choosing a specialty at this point because there isn&#8217;t much time between 3rd year and application time.</p>
<p>Internship is the same thing as the first year as residency. Depending on the residency tract, some people do take a separate intern or transitional year and then begin their second year of postdoctoral training.</p>
<p>After the first year of residency training, you are eligible to take the USMLE Step 3 &#8211; the last of them! My, what a good feeling it is to be done with them!!</p>
<p>The major goal comes after residency when you take your board specialization exam.</p>
<p>Fill out the Grill the Guru survey on medicalmastery.com to let me know if you are interested in a Medical Specialty Spotlight as an addition to future podcasts. I need 30 responses to proceed with that decision.</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>QUICK TIP:</p>
<p>Map out the rest of your college classes needed for both graduation and medical school prerequisites. Use a physical calendar, printed out for the next couple of years if needed. Write on it by semester, journal on it, and check off your classes as you complete them.</p>
<p>This will help you even if you already know it by heart.</p>
<p>Be sure you have a signed degree plan by your department chair so there are no surprises when you&#8217;re ready to graduate.</p>

<p>====================================================</p>
<p>This is Part 2 of a telephone interview with Celeste Whisenant, a second year medical student.</p>
<p>She answers all the tough questions about what each year of medical school is like (at least year 1 &amp; 2 that she knows about) and compares them to TV shows in some surprising ways.</p>
<p>This interview is part of the Grill the Guru series, in which I ask questions directly from the survey on medicalmastery.com.</p>
<p>Here is the rough outline of the questions I put together for this interview:</p>
<p>***Tell us about your self. &#8220;What school are you attending? How did you decide to attend that school over the other schools at which you were accepted?&#8221;</p>
<p>(we&#8217;ll have to explain the rank here)</p>
<p>***“What is med school really like? (as an ms1, ms2 etc.)” &#8220;What is the daily workload like? How much sleep do you get?&#8221;</p>
<p>***Is med school similar to what is shown on TV shows? (humor, the dating, drama, characters, hours, stress, family/home life)</p>
<p>***What do you know about D.O. schools, if anything?</p>
<p>Enjoy and email me if you have any questions!</p>

<p>====================================================</p>
<p>Current Strategy For The Medical School Match:</p>
<p>In 2007, a major change occurred in the way Texas medical schools choose their students, more in line with what&#8217;s been done in the rest of the country. Prior to this change, students applied to the recommended 20-30 medical schools and waited for an interview. After interviewing at hopefully several places, students ranked their favorite schools (only those they interviewed at) electronically on a secure website.</p>
<p>Then, the student just waited for &#8220;match&#8221; day in early February.</p>
<p>Well, the game has changed and I want to give you some strategic tips on you should approach this for your best advantage. You still apply to the 20-30 schools and need to get an interview, which I have always felt is the biggest cut-off in the process. However, now it really has become a race to get absolutely the earliest interviews possible, especially if you really have a favorite medical school you want.</p>
<p>See, once the medical schools have met you at the interview they can send you an &#8220;Early Offer&#8221; giving you 2 weeks to go ahead and accept a position at that school. These offers are independent of any other interviews you may have scheduled.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an interview in October (one of the very first of the season) and the rest of yours are in December, the first school could send you an Early Offer. You have 2 weeks to accept it &#8211; before you&#8217;ve even interviewed at the other schools! If you say no and want to interview at the other schools, then that first school will include you in the electronic match (discussed in my Free eBook -sign up in the upper right).</p>
<p>The strategy I want you to realize is that as soon as interviews start in October, seats are filling up all over the country. Students are grabbing up the first opportunity to secure a position.</p>
<p>You should too.</p>
<p>Do absolutely EVERYTHING possible to go to the earliest interview date offered to you.</p>
<p>My recommendation is that the majority of applicants should accept the first offer they are given. The electronic match is now for the leftovers, those people that didn&#8217;t get any offers or refused them. The ones that refused offers are either completely stellar students that had other offers on the table or didn&#8217;t listen to this podcast.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t decline your last Early Offer.</p>
<p>Take what you can get. You&#8217;ll thank me later.</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>QUICK TIP:<br />
So, what can you do about these changes? Here&#8217;s a checklist for you to follow:</p>
<p>__ Ask for letters of recommendation by February or March at the latest.</p>
<p>__ Submit your application to medical school during the FIRST WEEK they start accepting them.</p>
<p>__ Fill out and mail or electronically submit all secondary applications to medical schools that require them. (Check each medical school&#8217;s admissions website to download or read about secondary applications they may require. If there is any doubt, pick up the phone and call them! Are you beginning to fell my emphasis about how proactive you NEED to be?)</p>
<p>__ As soon as your application is submitted, check the website every day to make sure the medical schools have downloaded your application materials.</p>
<p>__ Finally &#8211; and MOST IMPORTANTLY, call each medical school you applied to. Tell them &#8220;Hi I wanted to make sure my application is complete and if there&#8217;s anything else I can provide because I am really interested in your school.&#8221;</p>

<p>====================================================</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m almost finished with my complete, A-Z, PreMedical video tutorial course! If you&#8217;re not already one of the hundreds in the exclusive email list receiving chapters of my FREE PreMed eBook, sign up in the upper right of medicalmastery.com now. Very soon, only people who have signed up will get the details on this video course!</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>This episode is the first in an interview series that was suggested by you &#8211; our listeners! Use the Grill The Guru survey on medicalmastery.com to submit your questions for future medical students and doctors I will interview.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;ll get right to the interview with Tyler Relph &#8211; a former PreMed tells us why he changed his mind. To hear the rest of this interview, join the CD Club online today!</p>
<p><span id="more-1112"></span></p>
<p>Here is what he wrote and what we used as the outline for the interview. That is, until he turned the table at the end&#8230;</p>
<p>“I grew up playing soccer competitively, so the sports emphasis has always drawn me. When I was considering medical school, I was planning on going into orthopedic surgery followed up with a sports medicine fellowship. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned with the schooling I would go through, however the thing that made me call of my medical degree pursuit was the lengthy residency in conjunction with the 80 hour work week.</p>
<p>1. <strong>FAMILY</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m married and have three children (3, 2, and a NB) If I were to go through medical school, I wouldn&#8217;t be an MD for 6-7 years (one year to finish up my bachelors, one year to finish up my prerequisites/ apply for med school, and four years of medical school). At that point my children will be 9, 8 and 6&#8230;then I start into my 80 hour work week as I venture into 3-7 years of residency (surgical specialty of some sort). Therefore, I wouldn&#8217;t be starting my practice until my oldest is 16. Through this possibly 13 year schooling journey, I believe I would miss out on my children&#8217;s lives too much to the point that it would affect them in a negative manner. I also have to consider time to continue to build into my marriage &#8211; to achieve my educational goals at the cost of my family is no success at all!</p>
<p>2. <strong>PAST EXPERIENCE </strong>- I have benefited from chiropractors immensely as I previously twisted my sacrum bad enough that I could barely walk. After seeing a chiropractor for about a year, I was able to join the military (i.e. all of the physical demands put on the body through physical fitness) and have no problems with my sacrum.</p>
<p>3. <strong>LIFESTYLE</strong> &#8211; Once again&#8230;it all boils down to family. I want to be able to be at home every night to ask the kids how their days were without the interruption of having to be called in. I can set my own hours &#8211; providing a two hour lunch break to be able to eat lunch with my wife and continue to build up that relationship. The money has very promising rewards &#8211; you work hard, the money will follow. Being my own boss and, if in a team practice, making the decisions with my fellow practicing chiropractors is &#8220;complete&#8221; freedom.</p>
<p>4. <strong>DURATION</strong> &#8211; The number of years of training &#8211; this brings me back to point one. By the time I am done with chiropractic school (with no residency of 80 hours a week), I will be thirty, at which point my oldest will be 8. This allows me to be entering into my practice when the children are still young, being able to nurture those relationships as the teen years begin to approach.</p>
<p>I will be attending Palmer West where a sports emphasis is available, in which students get to practice on professional athletes (currently the sports council is attending the Ironman competitions in Kona, HI providing chiropractic assistance to the competitors). Through this training, I will have the opportunities to work with professional athletes ensuring a healthy structural alignment to aid in the continuance of their careers.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 7: 50 Listener Questions and Special Requests: The Power Of<br />
Exploiting Your Competition!</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>In this episode:</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENTS<br />
PODCAST UPDATE<br />
Pre-Med E-book now a 17-week FREE course<br />
$0.01 Pre-Med CD lays the groundwork for EVERYTHING Pre-Med!<br />
LISTENER REQUESTS<br />
Q &amp; A</p>
<p><span id="more-1110"></span></p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENTS:</p>
<p>LEVEL 1: PODCASTS: I’ve had a slow pace with podcasts lately due to the pressure<br />
of keeping up with residency. The newsletter has been reorganized to provide<br />
continual email updates every 4 days, however.</p>
<p>LEVEL 2: NEWSLETTER: The FREE Pre-Med E-book had a fatal flaw. The newsletter<br />
was cutting off the 50+ page Diary of a PreMed Student book around page 10 or<br />
so. Thank you Mr. C. from Detroit, Michigan for pointing that out! There are<br />
many other topics that get emailed to you in addition to the E-Book contents,<br />
but it has been repaired to send you one of the chapters per week for a 17-week<br />
course – all FREE!</p>
<p>LEVEL 3: CD OF THE MONTH CLUB: The MINDMAP is progressing nicely. This tool<br />
organizes all of my Pre-Med content, and MANY topics not in the podcasts, using<br />
an outline formatting software. For the first time you can have all of the<br />
medical education websites, files, videos and podcasts all in one place! This is<br />
only available through the CD of the Month Club. Sign up for my FREE Pre-Med<br />
E-book at www.MedicalMastery.com using the attached file you get in my emails.</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>LISTENER REQUESTS:</p>
<p>The survey on medicalmastery.com has sparked many questions, comments, and<br />
suggestions for how to improve this Podcast. The most common request was for<br />
more podcasts at more frequent intervals. Believe me, I’m doing the best I can<br />
as a medical resident. I really enjoy helping Pre-Med students. It’s a passion<br />
of mine and I look forward to staying involved with you guys in the future.</p>
<p>This podcast emphasizes the importance of asking your questions! NO question is<br />
to simple. The only “dumb” question is the one you don’t ask. As you can see<br />
there are all different levels of experience of the Pre-Meds that listen and<br />
there is something here for everyone. Also, by asking your questions you are<br />
helping each other out because you’re not the only one that wants to know. We’re<br />
going to go through over 50 questions.</p>
<p>I am accepting introduction music submissions for an honorable mention. The<br />
music has to be original, so if there are any musicians out there you are<br />
invited to submit short music segments for introduction, special announcement,<br />
and closing segments.</p>
<p>Listeners have also requested that I interview medical students and doctors.<br />
Please submit questions for each. I want to make sure I ask them the things that<br />
YOU most want to know.</p>
<p>If you have any other suggestions, visit medicalmastery.com and complete the<br />
survey. Be sure to sign up for the FREE Pre-Med E-Book Newsletter.</p>
<p>====================================================</p>
<p>LISTENER Q &amp; A&#8217;S</p>
<p>QUESTION 1: There were four similar questions –</p>
<p>Part A:<br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><br />
I am currently doing all basic classes including the basic sciences and my<br />
intended major is Biology/premed and according to the UH NSM requirement I also<br />
have to take a NSM capstone (which is either a double major, a minor, a thesis<br />
or some research). But, after browsing the school website they have another<br />
major that is interesting as well, its called B.S in Biology (medical<br />
Technology) and it seems really interesting and the requirement are same except<br />
their is a few more classes of chem but less math (all you have to do is cal 1)<br />
but the last 30 hours are clinical programs. It sounds really interesting but<br />
she told me that a lot of students that want to go into medicine do not take<br />
this major! Is there a reason behind this? and plus do you think its a good<br />
program? It also says that entry into a medical technology clinical program is<br />
competitive, not a certainty. Although a minimum GPA average of 2.5 or better is<br />
required by most medical technology schools. So, please let me know what you<br />
think of this and let me know!! </span></p>
<p>ANSWER 1A</p>
<p>Congratulations on finishing another semester. By the way, I&#8217;m about to do<br />
my next podcast that will answer your previous questions about which classes<br />
to take and which schools to attend. The short answer is &#8211; choose your own<br />
life! More to follow&#8230;</p>
<p>This is a very interesting question about the med tech curriculum. I say<br />
that because it brings up a big concept in the admissions culture &#8211; program<br />
hopping! See, this same question pops up when people transfer from Ph.D,<br />
masters, nursing, or physician assistant programs and attempt to enter<br />
medical school. The main question you have to answer is &#8220;why?&#8221;</p>
<p>What most advisors don&#8217;t demonstrate at the undergraduate level is a genuine<br />
understanding of the CRITICAL health care provider shortage. If someone<br />
takes up a seat in a competitive medical technology program and then doesn&#8217;t<br />
fill that position in the community, but they change careers, per se, and go<br />
into medicine, then they&#8217;ve wasted community resources.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that state-supported schools (like UT and U of H) are<br />
under a mandate to fill the shortage as efficiently as possible, or face the<br />
threat of losing funding.</p>
<p>BUT HAVE NO FEAR</p>
<p>With the little bit I know about you, I already can see a bullet-proof plan<br />
that will cement your entire application and undergraduate experience (at<br />
least on paper). Are you ready?<br />
1. Do whatever is safest and most convenient for you this summer.<br />
2. Stick with whatever undergraduate major YOU like the most. Do the med<br />
tech program if it sounds interesting enough to finish.<br />
3. In your personal essay, state that you have an interest in pathology and<br />
that is why you chose that major. You&#8217;re not lying, after all. Plus, if you<br />
change your mind later, it&#8217;s a great career.<br />
4. When your grades gain steady improvement, site that semester as the time<br />
in your life when you decided to pursue medicine in all seriousness.<br />
5. When you come back from India, step up your academic game and treat it<br />
like a job.<br />
You can do it.</p>
<p>Part B, C:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Transformation from RN to MD and the reality of it. Please<br />
include experiences from medical school students. What do medical schools think<br />
about nursing majors who are going into medical school?</span></p>
<p>Part D:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I want to learn about the MCAT prep and advice on choosing<br />
a major for a BA or BS degree.</span></p>
<p>QUESTION 2</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I was wondering if you had any references for me in order<br />
to beef up my knowledge of healthcare policy and issues in the US (and maybe<br />
abroad)? I would really appreciate any sources, or if you could point me in the<br />
right direction.</span></p>
<p>ANSWER 2</p>
<p>What are you most interested in learning about? Just basic stuff to be<br />
knowledgeable for interviews or something more serious for career aspirations?</p>
<p>My first thought is to subscribe to newsletters/magazines such as American<br />
Medical News (by the AMA). I get this and that’s what they’re all about. They<br />
represent 25% of US physicians and they’re all about policy.</p>

Pre-Med E-book now a 17-week FREE course
$0.01 Pre-Med CD lays the groundwork for EVERYTHING Pre-Med!
LISTENER REQUESTS
Q &#38; A



====================================================

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

LEVEL 1: PODCASTS: I’ve had a slow pace with podcasts lately due to the pressure
of keeping up with residency. The newsletter has been reorganized to provide
continual email updates every 4 days, however.

LEVEL 2: NEWSLETTER: The FREE Pre-Med E-book had a fatal flaw. The newsletter
was cutting off the 50+ page Diary of a PreMed Student book around page 10 or
so. Thank you Mr. C. from Detroit, Michigan for pointing that out! There are
many other topics that get emailed to you in addition to the E-Book contents,
but it has been repaired to send you one of the chapters per week for a 17-week
course – all FREE!

LEVEL 3: CD OF THE MONTH CLUB: The MINDMAP is progressing nicely. This tool
organizes all of my Pre-Med content, and MANY topics not in the podcasts, using
an outline formatting software. For the first time you can have all of the
medical education websites, files, videos and podcasts all in one place! This is
only available through the CD of the Month Club. Sign up for my FREE Pre-Med
E-book at www.MedicalMastery.com using the attached file you get in my emails.

====================================================

LISTENER REQUESTS:

The survey on medicalmastery.com has sparked many questions, comments, and
suggestions for how to improve this Podcast. The most common request was for
more podcasts at more frequent intervals. Believe me, I’m doing the best I can
as a medical resident. I really enjoy helping Pre-Med students. It’s a passion
of mine and I look forward to staying involved with you guys in the future.

This podcast emphasizes the importance of asking your questions! NO question is
to simple. The only “dumb” question is the one you don’t ask. As you can see
there are all different levels of experience of the Pre-Meds that listen and
there is something here for everyone. Also, by asking your questions you are
helping each other out because you’re not the only one that wants to know. We’re
going to go through over 50 questions.

I am accepting introduction music submissions for an honorable mention. The
music has to be original, so if there are any musicians out there you are
invited to submit short music segments for introduction, special announcement,
and closing segments.

Listeners have also requested that I interview medical students and doctors.
Please submit questions for each. I want to make sure I ask them the things that
YOU most want to know.

If you have any other suggestions, visit medicalmastery.com and complete the
survey. Be sure to sign up for the FREE Pre-Med E-Book Newsletter.

LISTENER Q &#38; A'S

QUESTION 1: There were four similar questions –

Part A:

I am currently doing all basic classes including the basic sciences and my
intended major is Biology/premed and according to the UH NSM requirement I also
have to take a NSM capstone (which is either a double major, a minor, a thesis
or some research). But, after browsing the school website they have another
major that is interesting as well, its called B.S in Biology (medical
Technology) and it seems really interesting and the requirement are same except
their is a few more classes of chem but less math (all you have to do is cal 1)
but the last 30 hours are clinical programs. It sounds really interesting but
she told me that a lot of students that want to go into medicine do not take
this major! Is there a reason behind this? and plus do you think its a good
program? It also says that ent</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 6: Medical school scholarships, tuition-for-hire, and military exchange programs. Get real quotes and understand the financial burdens of getting a medical education in the United States.  ====================================================  In this episode,  ANNOUNCEMENTS  AVERAGE DEBTS AND INTEREST SCENARIOS  THE RULE OF THUMB FOR MED SCHOOL MONEY  MINORITY SCHOLARSHIPS  UNDERSERVED AREA &amp; SPECIALTY SCHOLARSHIPS  PAYING DOWN YOUR DEBT EARLY  BENEFITS FOR JOINING THE MILITARY  BENEFITS FOR PRIOR MILITARY  QUICK REFERENCES: Vanderbilt, AAMC, NSLDS, Dave Ramsey  ====================================================  Announcements:      * I have been getting requests to provide critical appraisals and feedback        on personal statements by multiple people outside of the CD of the Month        Club. While had originally not planned to do this, some of them are making        attractive offers &#8211; paying even more than would cost them through the $17 CD        Club. Therefore, I&#8217;m temporarily agreeing to do this on an individual basis.        The reason for the discretion is the volume of questions I receive and sheer        number of listeners that only a few months of podcasting has brought. The        demand on a resident&#8217;s time makes it impossible to help everyone. I hope you        understand.  Financial Assistance For Medical School: An Oxymoron?    Nothing in life is free. Most people want to know if there is a scholarship available for medical school. Let’s discuss an overriding principle first, before we get into the details of money-saving strategies.   Society doesn’t feel sorry enough for the medical student’s plight to pay for their education. A lot of people perceive physicians as making a lot of money so they feel like medical students will eventually be able to pay their loan debts. The loan companies make a fortune off of us and love to give us as many loans as possible, though it’s not always enough. Remember this rule of thumb as you read further about tuition help that does exist.   At the time of this writing, the average cost of medical school at state-supported institutions is $12,000 &#8211; $20,000 per year and $35,000 &#8211; $42,000 for private schools. You can do the math and see that after you calculate living expenses the average debt at the end of 4 years of medical school is $120,000 &#8211; $200,000. If you’re carrying over undergraduate debt, it’s possible to max out at $250,000. Unfortunately, that’s not all. Compounding interest during residency, while you can only afford the minimum payments or the loan is on deferment, can add more than $50,000.   Have I gotten your attention?   There are a number of ways to mitigate this debt. Let’s take some of the most common ways and discuss them each in turn. The most common way to get financial help        * Minority Scholarships. Very few of these exist but I        found a few when I was searching diligently online as a PreMed.       * Underserved Area Contracts. Some states offer tuition        payments for an agreement that you’ll work as a physician in their        underserved areas for some length of time. Commonly, they’ll pay you        competitively while you work there and trade one year of tuition for one        year of service. Sometimes there are specialty-specific offers, such as        Texas’ Family Practice program that is heavily promoted. This, then,        specifies the specialty and location you have to work in to pay back the        “debt”. Watch for the fine print. You may have to pay back the money if you        don’t fulfill the contract. This is also true of military monies, but are        easier to back out of.       * International bank of dad. You’re fortunate if you can        have family help. If so, use it. The key is to get your debt down early        after your education or you’ll wind up paying 200-300% more than you        borrowed!        * Benefits for joining the military:        *             o Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP):               This is the premier military scholarship program for doctorate programs.               They offer both stipends and full tuition payment! Specifics vary among               military branches.       *             o Sign-on bonuses. Joining any military branch these               days will nearly guarantee you some form of a sign-on bonus. There is a               catch, though, because you get it in installments and often after some               amount of service (usually 1 year before the full payment).       *             o Debt repayment. Another attractive offer the               Defense Department uses is a college loan repayment program. If you sign               up for a military commitment, college loans that you already have can be               eligible for repayment by the military. In recent years they have               offered $40,000 &#8211; $50,000 with, of course, payout timeline catches.       *             o Residency stipends. If you join the military               during residency, you don’t have to go to any training, can get monthly               payments (stipends) upwards of $1,400 per month. Like most military               commitments, there will be a specific amount of years that you have to               repay with military service for each year you receive the stipend.               Commonly this relationship is one year of receiving monthly payments               requiring 2 years of military commitment.        * Benefits for prior military:       *             o GI bill. This is an older, classic form of               education financial assistance for persons who have served in the               military. Usually you prove you’re in school half- or full-time and they               send you money. I believe it’s possible for the funds to be released               directly to your school. There is a limit on how many credit hours you               can use. For example, I maximized this benefit after one year in medical               school, having used it all the way through college. For me it was capped               at 150 semester hours or 1,500 contact hours (calculated differently).               Of note, one semester of medical school was rated at an equivalent of 64               college credit hours. That’s right, 64!       *             o Military (Army) College fund. This is an add-on               benefit to the GI bill that is really indistinguishable. I think the               original GI bill benefit was for approximately $15,000. “College funds”               are the mechanism by which the Defense Department offers the larger               amounts of money for college. Lately, the amounts have been $40,000 &#8211;               $60,000 (including the GI bill amount). Of course, they bank on the               majority that never use it up.

These usually favor state-supported schools with tuition               exemption in graduate (i.e., medical) school.   ====================================================  QUICK REFERENCE:  Vanderbilt&#8217;s Financial Aid Website (explore this site for great summaries of types of financial aid):  http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/medschool/finaid/finaid_for_med.php  American Association of Medical Colleges:  http://www.aamc.org/students/considering/financial.htm  National Student Loan Data System for Students: http://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA/  Dave Ramsey&#8217;s Live Debt Free site: http://www.daveramsey.com/  ====================================================  Charity of the Month for June 2008: Widows Harvest Ministries (http://www.widows.org/) will receive all donations made in the upper left hand corner of www.MedicalMastery.com.

Get real quotes and understand the financial burdens of getting a medical education in the United States.  ====================================================  In this episode,  ANNOUNCEMENTS  AVERAGE DEBTS AND INTEREST SCENARIOS  THE RULE OF THUMB FOR MED SCHOOL MONEY  MINORITY SCHOLARSHIPS  UNDERSERVED AREA &#38; SPECIALTY SCHOLARSHIPS  PAYING DOWN YOUR DEBT EARLY  BENEFITS FOR JOINING THE MILITARY  BENEFITS FOR PRIOR MILITARY  QUICK REFERENCES: Vanderbilt, AAMC, NSLDS, Dave Ramsey  ====================================================  Announcements:      * I have been getting requests to provide critical appraisals and feedback        on personal statements by multiple people outside of the CD of the Month        Club. While had originally not planned to do this, some of them are making        attractive offers - paying even more than would cost them through the $17 CD        Club. Therefore, I'm temporarily agreeing to do this on an individual basis.        The reason for the discretion is the volume of questions I receive and sheer        number of listeners that only a few months of podcasting has brought. The        demand on a resident's time makes it impossible to help everyone. I hope you        understand.  Financial Assistance For Medical School: An Oxymoron?    Nothing in life is free. Most people want to know if there is a scholarship available for medical school. Let’s discuss an overriding principle first, before we get into the details of money-saving strategies.   Society doesn’t feel sorry enough for the medical student’s plight to pay for their education. A lot of people perceive physicians as making a lot of money so they feel like medical students will eventually be able to pay their loan debts. The loan companies make a fortune off of us and love to give us as many loans as possible, though it’s not always enough. Remember this rule of thumb as you read further about tuition help that does exist.   At the time of this writing, the average cost of medical school at state-supported institutions is $12,000 - $20,000 per year and $35,000 - $42,000 for private schools. You can do the math and see that after you calculate living expenses the average debt at the end of 4 years of medical school is $120,000 - $200,000. If you’re carrying over undergraduate debt, it’s possible to max out at $250,000. Unfortunately, that’s not all. Compounding interest during residency, while you can only afford the minimum payments or the loan is on deferment, can add more than $50,000.   Have I gotten your attention?   There are a number of ways to mitigate this debt. Let’s take some of the most common ways and discuss them each in turn. The most common way to get financial help        * Minority Scholarships. Very few of these exist but I        found a few when I was searching diligently online as a PreMed.       * Underserved Area Contracts. Some states offer tuition        payments for an agreement that you’ll work as a physician in their        underserved areas for some length of time. Commonly, they’ll pay you        competitively while you work there and trade one year of tuition for one        year of service. Sometimes there are specialty-specific offers, such as        Texas’ Family Practice program that is heavily promoted. This, then,        specifies the specialty and location you have to work in to pay back the        “debt”. Watch for the fine print. You may have to pay back the money if you        don’t fulfill the contract. This is also true of military monies, but are        easier to back out of.       * International bank of dad. You’re fortunate if you can        have family help. If so, use it. The key is to get your debt down early        after your education or you’ll wind up paying 200-300% more than you        borrowed!        * Benefits for joining the military:        *          </itunes:summary>
