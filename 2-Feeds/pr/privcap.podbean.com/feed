<p>Brazil’s life-sciences ecosystem is underdeveloped, and this spells both challenge and opportunity, according to <strong>João Paulo Poiares Baptista</strong>, Managing Director for life-sciences venture capital firm<strong>Burrill &amp; Company</strong>.</p>
<p>Having just raised a $125 million venture fund targeting Brazilian life-sciences investements, Baptista says he is excited by the opportunities but also is fatigued by the “trauma” of tough sell. In an exclusive interview with Privcap, Baptista describes the lay of the venture landscape in Brazil, the dearth of biotech opportunities, the “huge opportunities” in healthcare services, the need for more applied research, the small population of management talent that has experience building and selling a company, and the need for better IP management at Brazilian universities.</p>

<p class="p2">The emerging markets topic in private equity has mostly been one of Western capital supporting developing-economy GPs. But now yet the rise of very well capitalized investing institutions across the emerging markets is beginning to shake up the status quo of the global private capital industry.</p>
<p class="p2">This important video panel discussion includes David Marchick, Managing Director with <strong>The Carlyle Group</strong>, Maureen Downey, Principal with <strong>Pantheon Ventures</strong>, and Peter Furci, a Partner with<strong>Debevoise &amp; Plimpton</strong>. The segment also includes an expert Q&amp;A with <strong>Ernst &amp; Young</strong> Global Private Equity Markets Leader Philip Bass. (This is the third in a three-segment series about emerging markets private equity in the institutional portfolio. The first segment was “<a href="http://www.privcap.com/programs/99-emerging-in-the-portfolio">Emerging in the Portfolio</a>” and the second was “<a href="http://www.privcap.com/programs/109-assessing-the-gp-team">Assessing the GP Team</a>.”</p>
<p class="p2">Topics discussed include: the rise of RMB funds in China, the interest that emerging-markets LPs have in investing in other emerging markets, Carlyle’s IR staff being mostly outside the US, the $700 billion in Latin American pension capital that is expected to double, why fund managers are flocking to Colombia, and why China’s rank below Denmark as an exporter of capital is about to dramatically change. Also discussed is the evolving role of development agencies in the emerging markets.</p>

<p>All developing nations want to have ecosystems for innovation in which entrepreneurs, fund managers and local institutional investors partner to build companies and create jobs. But building out that infrastructure is no easy task, especially for a small, emerging economy.</p>
<p><strong>Maria Susana Garcia-Robles</strong> of the <strong>Multilateral Investment Fund</strong> is here to help.

<p>In an exclusive interview with Privcap, which took place at the most recent Congresso ABVCAP in Sao Paulo, Garcia-Robles discusses the mission of MIF, why Brazil’s private equity market is seen as a “laboratory,” the importance of GPs working together to promote the industry, the uniqueness of Brazil’s LPs, and how governments across Latin America are eager for guidance from market experts in Brazil and the United States.</p>

<p class="p2">Assessing the skills of a GP team is the hardest and most critical task in alternative investing – making these judgments across borders and cultures, and in developing economies without long histories of private equity performance, is even more challenging.</p>
<p class="p2">In this must-watch video panel discussion for serious participants in emerging markets private equity, three veterans discuss the importance and the process of choosing the right managers. The discussion includes David Marchick, Managing Director with <strong>The Carlyle Group</strong>, Maureen Downey, Principal with<strong>Pantheon Ventures</strong>, and Peter Furci, a Partner with <strong>Debevoise &amp; Plimpton</strong>. The segment also includes an expert Q&amp;A with <strong>Ernst &amp; Young</strong> Global Private Equity Markets Leader Philip Bass. This is the second in a three-segment series about emerging markets private equity in the institutional portfolio. The first segment was “<a href="http://www.privcap.com/programs/99-emerging-in-the-portfolio">Emerging in the Portfolio</a>.”</p>
<p class="p2">Topics of discussion include separating the ability to add value from the luck of benefiting from a rising economic tide; Carlyle’s “evolution” in China with regard to the makeup of its investment professionals, the importance of both a local network and global-standard business knowhow, and the worry that some investors have over currency fluctuations.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Facebook and Carlyle may be grabbing the headlines, but an uptick in the IPO market - especially in the US - is big news for hundreds of private equity firms that need to find exits for their portfolio companies. Privcap's David Snow speaks with Jeff Bunder, Global Private Equity Leader at Ernst &#x38; Young, about the most important trends. The interview begins with Bunder discussing the state of the IPO market and in particular, the specific geographies that account for most of the IPO excitement.

Topics of discussion include:

	Why have favored IPO destinations shifted?
	Why are more investors putting their money into IPOs?
	Are private equity firms more aligned with IPO investors today?
	What effect does the Facebook IPO have on the market?

<p>Morgan Creek Capital Management vets some 2,500 investment managers per year, which allows the firm to enjoy “pattern recognition” across the alternative asset classes, according to the firm’s founder, Mark Yusko.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with Privcap, the former CIO of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill’s endowment, seeks to dispel inaccurate notions about private capital investing.</p>
<p>The interview includes Yusko’s strong arguments that alternatives performed comparatively well through the downturn, that alpha comes from proper allocation and manager selection, that the return on a zero-risk strategy is zero, that an allocation to alternatives requires greater awareness of liquidity constrains in the broader portfolio, that separate accounts too often involve an “illusion of control,” and that LPs must look through their alternative-allocation “buckets” to the “underlying exposures.” Yusko also explains his investment thesis that the world population is going to “eat a lot of soybeans” in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Spencer Fleischer</strong>, President of private equity firm <strong>FFL</strong> (Friedman, Fleischer &amp; Lowe) says one of his key jobs is to make “fine judgments about people.” In an exclusive interview with Privcap, Fleischer describes the attention that FFL pays to the people it hires, the operating partners it deploys and the portfolio-company executives it works with.</p>
<p>The conversation touches on how the private equity industry has morphed over the past 15 years, how FFL has added operating partners, how FFL’s internal meetings are a good indicator of the firm’s culture, why the firm – with a $1.5 billion fund – operates out of only one office in San Francisco, and why there are so many athletes at the firm.</p>

<p>It is hard to find investors in today’s market who do not want increased exposure to the emerging markets. But what is the right way to allocate to emerging markets private equity? What are the real risks and the expected drivers of growth?</p>
<p>The Privcap program “Emerging in the Portfolio” is the first of three expert discussions that takes a deep dive into the ways that institutional investors are assessing emerging markets private capital opportunities and structuring programs to capture expected growth in these economies. The discussion includes David Marchick, Managing Director with <strong>The Carlyle Group</strong>, Maureen Downey, Principal with<strong>Pantheon Ventures</strong>, and Peter Furci, a Partner with <strong>Debevoise &amp; Plimpton</strong>. The segment also includes an expert Q&amp;A with <strong>Ernst &amp; Young</strong> Global Private Equity Markets Leader Philip Bass.</p>
<p>The conversation includes an analysis of the trend toward greater and greater LP allocations to emerging markets funds, the importance of rising middle-class consumption in these investment theses, new views on risk in the emerging markets, the right allocation size within the broader portfolio, and due diligence practices specific to emerging markets GPs.</p>
<p>This same group of experts appears in a brief analysis of 2011 emerging markets fundraising statistics called “<a href="http://www.privcap.com/programs/94-emerging-markets-surge-in-2011">Emerging Markets Surge in 2011</a>.”</p>
