			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My heart goes out to all the families of the victims of the recent tornadoes.  It is a sad thing.  This is the deadliest tornado season in the last 50 years.  I am so sorry for all the devastation and loss.  The sadness is overwhelming.</p>
<p>I want to take a second to direct you to a <a title="Black Clouds of Destruction" href="http://www.conradrocks.net/2011/05/unusual-vision-i-had-during-worship.html" target="_blank">vision God gave me</a> on May 11th about the storms.  During worship God showed me a rider with a lance coming forth from black clouds warning that a storm was coming.  This was so shaking in my spirit that i shared it immediately on my main blog (<a title="Clouds and Lance" href="http://www.conradrocks.net/2011/05/unusual-vision-i-had-during-worship.html" target="_blank">here</a>), whereas God&#8217;s warning concerning March 11th i only shared with my email subscribers.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, I found out yesterday that Glynda Lomax posted this to her blog on May 7th 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was outside and glanced north/slightly northeast from the town where I live in Texas just north of the Dallas area. Suddenly a feeling of black mass destruction coming somewhere to the north or northeast stopped me in my tracks. It was so massive and so deadly all I could do was stand and stare in that direction. It felt like a huge black cloud of death hovering unseen above its intended target.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black clouds of destruction to the North and East is exactly what happened after these visions.</p>
<p>Glynda&#8217;s blog article can be found <a title="God shows Glynda coming storms" href="http://wingsofprophecy.blogspot.com/2011/05/destruction-is-coming-to-america.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The question we are faced with is &#8220;Why is this happening&#8221;?</p>
<p>Glynda called me 30 minutes before her <a title="Will God Judge America?" href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/glyndalomax/2011/05/27/straight-talk-with-glynda-lomax" target="_blank">Blog Talk Radio show</a> and asked me to join in.  In this show we discussed God&#8217;s call for America to repent and what Christians can do for those things that are coming ahead.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this podcast I casually talk about the power of words and the spirit realm.  </p>
<p>I comment on the following scriptures.</p>
<p>2Ki 6:17-18  And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.  (18)  And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</p>
<p>2Ki 6:12  And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</p>
<p>Luk 16:22-31  And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham&#8217;s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.  (23)  And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.  (24)  And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.  (25)  But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish.  (26)  And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.  (27)  And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father&#8217;s house;  (28)  for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.  (29)  But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.  (30)  And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.  (31)  And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.</p>
<p>Mat 17:20  And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</p>
<p>Dan 10:12-13  Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words&#8217; sake.  (13)  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p>
<p>Eph 6:12-18  For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.  (13)  Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.  (14)  Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,  (15)  and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;  (16)  withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.  (17)  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:  (18)  with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,</p>
<p>Col 4:2  Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;</p>

<h2>The Nicodemus Reference.</h2>
<p>Joh 3:1-6  Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:  (2)  the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.  (3)  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  (4)  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother&#8217;s womb, and be born?  (5)  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!  (6)  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
<p><a title="Not again!" href="http://www.crosswalk.com/1240810/" target="_blank">Barna research study</a> on conflicting doctrines by preachers</p>
<h2>WE CANNOT DEDUCE THE TRUTH</h2>
<h4>Spirit versus natural man.</h4>
<p>1Co 2:13-16  Which things also we speak, not in words which man&#8217;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual words.  (14)  Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.  (15)  But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.  (16)  For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>
<h4>The Spirit of Truth guides us into all truth. Not carnal man.</h4>
<p>Joh 16:13  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.</p>
<p>1 John 2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</p>
<h4>Paul wrote this after he had a relationship with Jesus, and not just the scripture alone.</h4>
<p>1Th 1:5  For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</p>
<h2>HOW DO WE EXPERIENCE THE AUTHOR?</h2>
<h4>Seven Sons of Sceva - a bad example!</h4>
<p>Act 19:13-17  But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.  (14)  And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.  (15)  And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?  (16)  And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  (17)  And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p>
<h4>Appolos - a god example!</h4>
<p>Act 18:24-28  Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.  (25)  This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:  (26)  and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.  (27)  And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;  (28)  for he powerfully confuted the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</p>
<h4>Zacchaeus - a good example!</h4>
<p>Luke 19:1-10 1Then Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. 2Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. 3And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature. 4So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way. 5And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, “Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.” 6So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully. 7But when they saw it, they all complained, saying, “He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.” 8Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.” 9And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham; 10“for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.”</p>
<h4><a title="A video " href="http://conradsconcerns.com/2010/01/31/believe-the-author.aspx" target="_blank">Believe the Author</a>!</h4>
<p>A video that compliments this teaching!

Joh 16:13  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.

1 John 2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
Paul wrote this after he had a relationship with Jesus, and not just the scripture alone.
1Th 1:5  For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

Seven Sons of Sceva - a bad example!

Appolos - a god example!
Act 18:24-28  Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.  (25)  This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:  (26)  and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.  (27)  And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disc</itunes:summary>
