In this episode Lawton Grinter (Disco) and Felicia Hermosillo (P.O.D.) share what it was like to backpack as a couple for over 5,000 miles.</p>

<p>In recent years, the couple hiked both the Continental Divide Trail (see <a href="http://www.practicalbackpacking.com/blog/featured-links/Walkumentary.php" target="_blank">Walkumentary</a>) and the Pacific Crest Trail, living on love, patience, trial and error, and whatever they could fit into their modest backpacks.</p>

<p>Having spent nearly every minute and mile after mile with mere paces between them, the two learned a lot about each other, themselves, and even how to yogi a thing or two.  Listen in to laugh, learn, and dream as this adventurous duo shares their memorable journey.</p>

<p>These young men are carrying traditional, durable gear with pack weights that have been as high as 65 pounds. They've managed to cut the weight in half along the way, as they've become more familiar with their needs and comfort requirements.  It didn't take them long, for example, to send a 12 pound tent home.</p>

<p>Joe and Bryan's AT thru-hike is also raising awareness and support for the Make a Wish Foundation.</p>

<p>I'm sure you'll find both of these hikers and what they have to say about their gear and journey both interesting and inspiring.</p>

<p><br />
That's right, Maverick is 80 years old and going strong. When he's not hiking he's lifting weights. How many 80 year olds do you know who hike the Grand Canyon and pump iron?</p>

Today I met with Justin Lichter, also known by his trail-name <a href="http://www.practicalbackpacking.com/blog/featured-links/trauma.php" target="_blank">Trauma</a>, and his dog Yoni on the Eagle Creek Trail in Oregon. The Eagle Creek Trail is a PCT alternate route that thru-hikers often take because of its amazing scenery - including several spectacular waterfalls.</p>

<p>Trauma and Yoni have been hiking the last 7 months or so as part of a 10,000 mile journey. Their entire trip consists of the Eastern Continental Trail (including the Appalachian Trail), the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail.</p>

<p>There are no phones in the wilderness, so I packed up and did the podcast on the trail. You'll hear the constant flow of the water of Eagle Creek in the background and other occasional sounds. If you listen closely, you'll even hear from Yoni.</p>

In this episode, you'll hear the conversation that I had with endurance hiker, <a href="http://www.practicalbackpacking.com/blog/featured-links/matt-hazley.php" target="_blank">Matt Hazley</a> - also known by his trailname: Squeeky.</p>

<p>Matt got his start in backpacking just a few years ago, and has already thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail (in 2003) and the Pacific Crest Trail (in 2004).</p>

<p>In 2005, Matt completed a straight-through (end-to-end), hike of the AT, CDT, and PCT ( otherwise known as a Triple Crown) in a single calendar year.*</p>

<p>In June 2006, Matt will set out to speed hike the Appalachian Trail in 40 days or less. He will do so with the help of a talented team that has been assembled to help ensure his success.</p>

<p>He's also sporting some great gear from a few generous sponsors, and will be followed by a documentary crew (which Matt shares will help to motivate him to do his best).</p>

<p>You'll also get a sneak-peak at some of the other challenges that Matt is setting for himself, including a future 21,000 mile hike with two of his friends.</p>

<p>Matt seems to be more concerned with shattering limitations than breaking records. He's both inspirational and amazing. He's certainly made his Mum proud.</p>

<p><em>*Note: Brian Robinson was the first to complete a Calendar Triple Crown in 2001.</em></p>
