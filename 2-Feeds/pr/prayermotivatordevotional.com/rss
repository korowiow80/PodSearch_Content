<p>This is Daniel Whyte III, president of Gospel Light Society International. It is good to be with you today. </p>
<p>We praise the Lord for allowing us to reach Day 6 of the ten day fast which began on June 1st and will last through June 10th. Please be reminded that we are asking everyone who is not on an extended fast already to join us today on this Wednesday for the weekly 24 hour fast. We look forward also to everyone who is able to join us on July 1st through the 10th, August 1st through the 10th, and October 1st through the 10th as this will complete 40 days of fasting during this season. We also praise the Lord for all of you who are fasting for 40 days and 40 nights during this time with such fine Christian leaders as Dr. Jim Garlow, Bishop Harry Jackson, Jr., Bishop Joseph Mattera, and Tony Perkins. We praise the Lord also that Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference which consists of over 40,000 churches, commenced fasting for 40 days and nights on June 1 as well. And Dr. Rick Scarborough with Vision America has called for 40 days of fasting and prayer to save America beginning September 28th through November 6th. We praise the Lord for the thousands who have joined these leaders as well. Miraculously, by the grace of God, with our 4 ten day fasts, our called 40 day fast starting August 1st, our every Wednesday fast, our special three day Esther fast in September during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), and our 7 day fast from October 31st through Election Day on November 6, we now have, by the grace of God, a complete wall-to-wall fasting movement made up of all races of people for the glory of God, for the salvation of the lost, for the revival of the church, and for the healing of the nation, among other things. </p>
<p>As you fast, please continue to pray for the following among other things: </p>
<p>1. For God to revive the church<br />
2. For God to heal the nation<br />
3. For 3 million or more people to come to Christ<br />
4. And if the Lord is going to tarry His coming, for God to give us the godly leadership that this nation needs going forward.<br />
5. For God to heal Christian families</p>
<p>Allow me to share with you a verse that I read which I believe is appropriate for this time of fasting and prayer. Psalm 119:126 says, &#8220;It is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law.&#8221; Indeed, this country has turned its back on God and it is time for Him to do something. What we think we can do is nothing close to what God can do. So, pray that God will do a mighty work in this country for His glory.</p>
<p>Our Scripture reading for today is Isaiah 58:1-14 from the New King James Version which reads: </p>
<p>1 “Cry aloud, spare not; Lift up your voice like a trumpet; Tell My people their transgression, And the house of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p>2 Yet they seek Me daily, And delight to know My ways, As a nation that did righteousness, And did not forsake the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me the ordinances of justice; They take delight in approaching God.</p>
<p>3 ‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and You have not seen? Why have we afflicted our souls, and You take no notice?’<br />
“In fact, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, And exploit all your laborers.</p>
<p>4 Indeed you fast for strife and debate, And to strike with the fist of wickedness. You will not fast as you do this day,<br />
To make your voice heard on high.</p>
<p>5 Is it a fast that I have chosen, A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, And to spread out sackcloth and ashes? Would you call this a fast, And an acceptable day to the Lord?</p>
<p>6 “Is this not the fast that I have chosen: To loose the bonds of wickedness, To undo the heavy burdens, To let the oppressed go free, And that you break every yoke?</p>
<p>7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, And that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out; When you see the naked, that you cover him, And not hide yourself from your own flesh?</p>
<p>8 Then your light shall break forth like the morning, Your healing shall spring forth speedily, And your righteousness shall go before you; The glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.</p>
<p>9 Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; You shall cry, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’ “If you take away the yoke from your midst, The pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness, </p>
<p>10 If you extend your soul to the hungry And satisfy the afflicted soul, Then your light shall dawn in the darkness,<br />
And your darkness shall be as the noonday.</p>
<p>11 The Lord will guide you continually, And satisfy your soul in drought, And strengthen your bones; You shall be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.</p>
<p>12 Those from among you Shall build the old waste places; You shall raise up the foundations of many generations;<br />
And you shall be called the Repairer of the Breach, The Restorer of Streets to Dwell In.</p>
<p>13 “If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, From doing your pleasure on My holy day, And call the Sabbath a delight, The holy day of the Lord honorable, And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, Nor finding your own pleasure, Nor speaking your own words,</p>
<p>14 Then you shall delight yourself in the Lord; And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth, And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. The mouth of the Lord has spoken.”</p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this passage from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>Here we notice in this passage that it concerns us therefore to enquire, on a fast-day, what it is that will be acceptable to God, and afflictive to our corrupt nature, and tending to its mortification. We are here told negatively what is not the fast that God has chosen, and which does not amount to the afflicting of the soul. It is not enough to look demure, to put on a grave and melancholy aspect, to bow down the head like a bulrush that is withered and broken: as the hypocrites, that were of a sad countenance, and disfigured their faces, that they might appear unto men to fast. Hanging down the head did indeed well enough become the publican, whose heart was truly humbled and broken for sin, and who therefore, in token of that, would not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven; but when it was only mimicked, as here, it was justly ridiculed: it is but hanging down the head like a bulrush, which nobody regards or takes any notice of. As the hypocrite’s humiliations are but like the hanging down of a bulrush, so his elevations in his hopes are but like the flourishing of a bulrush, which, while it is yet in its greenness, withers before any other herb.</p>
<p>We will continue discussing this passage in our next broadcast. </p>
<p>Our fasting quote of encouragement today is from Martin Luther. He said: &#8220;Of fasting I say this: It is right to fast frequently in order to subdue and control the body. For when the stomach is full, the body does not serve for preaching, for praying, or studying, or for doing anything else that is good. Under such circumstances God&#8217;s Word cannot remain. But one should not fast with a view to meriting something by it as by a good work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our fasting devotional today is part 5 of our series titled &#8220;THE PURPOSE OF FASTING&#8221; from Richard J. Foster in his book &#8220;Celebration of Discipline&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fasting helps us keep our balance in life. How easily we begin to allow nonessentials to take precedence in our lives. How quickly we crave things we do not need until we are enslaved by them. Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 6:12, &#8220;&#8216;All things are lawful for me,&#8217; but I will not be enslaved by anything.&#8221; Our human cravings and desires are like rivers that tend to overflow their banks; fasting helps keep them in their proper channels. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9:27, &#8220;I pommel my body and subdue it.&#8221; Likewise, David writes in Psalm 35:13, &#8220;I afflicted myself with fasting.&#8221; This is not excessive asceticism; it is discipline and discipline brings freedom. In the fourth century Asterius said that fasting ensured that the stomach would not make the body boil like a kettle to the hindering of the soul.</p>
<p>Numerous people have written on the many other values of fasting such as increased effectiveness in intercessory prayer, guidance in decisions, increased concentration, deliverance for those in bondage, physical well-being, revelations, and so on. In this, as in all matters, we can expect God to reward those who diligently seek Him. </p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take this moment to break up the fallow ground in our lives. Hosea 10:12 states, &#8220;Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great evangelist Charles G. Finney preached a message titled &#8220;Breaking Up the Fallow Ground &#8211; An Outline for Repentance&#8221;. In this sermon, he listed 26 sins that we as Christians should confess and repent of. The eighteenth sin he lists is: Bitterness. He urges us to confess this sin in our lives by saying: &#8220;Recall all the instances in which you have harbored a grudge or a bitter spirit toward someone, or have spoken of Christians in a manner completely devoid of charity and love. Love &#8220;hopes all things,&#8221; but you have given no benefit of doubt, and have suspected the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to the Lord in prayer right now and confess this sin and others before God. </p>
<p>GENERAL PRAYER</p>
<p>Dear friend, if you are listening to this broadcast and you do not know the Lord Jesus Christ as your Saviour, John 3:16 states, &#8220;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#8221; The Bible also says in Romans 10:9 and 13: &#8220;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved&#8230;. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear friend, if you are willing to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation, please pray with me this simple prayer: Heavenly Father, I realize that I am a sinner and that I have done some bad things in my life. For Jesus Christ sake, please forgive me of my sins. I now believe with all of my heart that Jesus Christ died for me, was buried, and rose again. Lord Jesus, please come into my heart and save my soul and change my life today and forever. Amen.</p>
<p>Congratulations on doing the most important thing in life and that is accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour! We&#8217;re here to help you, feel free to contact us at GospelLightSociety.com</p>
<p>Until next time, continue to fast and pray. God Bless You!</p>

<p>Our prayer motivator verse from the Word of God today is Proverbs 15:8 which reads: &#8220;The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.&#8221; </p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this verse from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>God so hates wicked people, whose hearts are malicious and their lives mischievous, that even their sacrifices are an abomination to him. God has sacrifices brought him even by wicked men, to stop the mouth of conscience and to keep up their reputation in the world, as malefactors come to a sanctuary, not because it is a holy place, but because it shelters them from justice; but their sacrifices, though ever so costly, are not accepted of God, because not offered in sincerity nor from a good principle; they dissemble with God, and in their conversations give the lie to their devotions, and for that reason they are an abomination to him, because they are made a cloak for sin. God has such a love for upright good people that, though they are not at the expense of a sacrifice (he himself has provided that), their prayer is a delight to him. Praying graces are his own gift, and the work of his own Spirit in them, with which he is well pleased. He not only answers their prayers, but delights in their addresses to him, and in doing them good.</p>
<p>My personal encouragement to you today is that you should make it your business to pray in the morning to get your day started. As a couple, make a concrete decision to pray together in the morning before you go your separate ways. I do not care how busy you are. I do not care what you have on your agenda, take the time to pray together in the mornings before you part ways. Don’t let it slip by you. Don’t let the devil take that away from you. You must pray together! The devil is constantly working, and after you have been asleep all night, if you don’t quickly get in communication with God, I guarantee you the devil will try to get something in between you. I have learned over the years that the days I slip up in prayer or try to get some other things done before I pray with my family, the devil tries to get in between my wife and me over absolutely nothing. You need to pray in the mornings together as soon as possible after waking up.</p>
<p>Our prayer motivator quote today is from an Andrew Murray. He said: &#8220;Unless we are willing to pay the price, and sacrifice time and attention and what appear legitimate or necessary duties, for the sake of the heavenly gifts we need not look for a large experience of the power of the heavenly world in our work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our prayer motivator devotional today is part 1 of a new series titled &#8220;WHY FASTING AND PRAY IS IMPORTANT&#8221; from Dr. John R. Rice.</p>
<p>Why Christians should sometimes leave off food, sleep, nice clothes, family life or other comforts to do nothing but pray. </p>
<p>The greatest saints of God throughout the Bible often fasted. Fasting is often connected with wholehearted prayer, with mourning, with repentance, with seeking deliverance from enemies or wisdom from above. Moses fasted forty days on Mount Sinai, and our Saviour fasted forty days in the wilderness. Joshua, David, Ezra, Nehemiah, Daniel, the disciples of John the Baptist, Anna, the apostles, Paul and Barnabas, and others fasted and prayed. Saints of God got their prayers answered when they waited on God in fastings and prayer. Since Bible times, the greatest men of prayer have oftentimes fasted as well as prayed. A Christian is in good company when he fasts and prays. </p>
<p>During the earthly ministry of Christ, the disciples of John the Baptist fasted, the Pharisees fasted, and naturally inquiries were made concerning the disciples of our Saviour. Jesus answered in Luke 5:34-35: &#8220;And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the Saviour not only fasted, but He taught His disciples to fast. They did fast after He was taken away.</p>
<p>The only restriction that our Saviour put upon fasting is that it was to be sincere. Men should not disfigure their faces to appear unto men to fast. A boastful, self-righteous flaunting of religious ceremonies such as that practiced by the Pharisees, hypocrites in the days of our Lord, is offensive to God, to be sure. But hypocrisy in anything else is a sin as truly as in the case of fasting. Christians should not fast as hypocrites, but they certainly should fast as Jesus fasted, as Paul fasted, as Barnabas and many others fasted.</p>

<p>This is Daniel Whyte III, president of Gospel Light Society International. It is good to be with you today. </p>
<p>We praise the Lord for all of you who are joining us on the ten day fast which began on June 1st and will last through June 10th. We look forward to you joining us on July 1st through the 10th, August 1st through the 10th, and October 1st through the 10th as this will complete 40 days of fasting during this season.

<p>1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p>2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.</p>
<p>3 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.</p>
<p>4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.</p>
<p>5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?</p>
<p>6 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</p>
<p>7 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</p>
<p>8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward.</p>
<p>9 Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;</p>
<p>10 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:</p>
<p>11 And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</p>
<p>12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</p>
<p>13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:</p>
<p>14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this passage from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>Here we notice in verse 5 that God would not allow them the use of such solemnities: &#8220;You shall not fast at all if you fast as you do this day, causing your voice to be heard on high, in the heat of your clamours one against another, or in your devotions, which you perform so as to make them to be taken notice of for ostentation. Bring me no more of these empty, noisy, vain oblations.&#8221; Note, Those are justly forbidden the honour of a profession of religion that will not submit to the power of it. He would not accept of them in the use of them: &#8220;You shall not fast, that is, it shall not be looked upon as a fast, nor shall the voice of your prayers on those days be heard on high in heaven.’’ Note, Those that fast and pray, and yet go on in their wicked ways, do but mock God and deceive themselves. Plain instructions are given concerning the true nature of a religious fast. In general, a fast is intended, For the honouring and pleasing of God. It must be such a performance as he has chosen; it must be an acceptable day to the Lord, in the duties of which we must study to approve ourselves to him and obtain his favour, else it is not a fast, else there is nothing done to any purpose. a fast is intended also, For the humbling and abasing of ourselves. A fast is a day to afflict the soul; if it do not express a genuine sorrow for sin, and do not promote a real mortification of sin, it is not a fast; the law of the day of atonement was that on that day they should afflict their souls. That must be done on a fast-day which is a real affliction to the soul, as far as it is yet unregenerate and unsanctified, though a real pleasure and advantage to the soul as far as it is itself.</p>
<p>We will continue discussing this verse in our next broadcast. </p>
<p>Our fasting quote of encouragement today is from John Calvin. He said: &#8220;Let us say something about fasting, because many, for want of knowing its usefulness, undervalue its necessity, and some reject it as almost superfluous; while, on the other hand where the use of it is not well understood, it easily degenerates into superstition. Holy and legitimate fasting is directed to three ends; for we practice it either as a restraint on the flesh, to preserve it from licentiousness, or as a preparation for prayers and pious meditations, or as a testimony of our humiliation in the presence of God when we are desirous of confessing our guilt before him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our fasting devotional today is part 4 of a new series titled &#8220;THE PURPOSE OF FASTING&#8221; from Richard J. Foster in his book &#8220;Celebration of Discipline&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fasting reminds us that we are sustained &#8220;by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God&#8221;. Food does not sustain us; God sustains us. In Christ, Colossians 1:17 says, &#8220;All things hold together.&#8221; Therefore, in experiences of fasting we are not so much abstaining from food as we are feasting on the word of God. Fasting is feasting! When the disciples brought lunch to Jesus, assuming that he would be starving, he declared in John 4:32 and 34, &#8220;I have food to eat of which you do not know&#8230;.My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.&#8221; This was not a clever metaphor, but a genuine reality. Jesus was, in fact, being nourished and sustained by the power of God. That is the reason for his counsel on fasting in Matthew 6. We are told not to act miserable when fasting because, in point of fact, we are not miserable. We are feeding on God and, just like the Israelites who were sustained in the wilderness by the miraculous manna from Heaven, so we are sustained by the Word of God. </p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take this moment to break up the fallow ground in our lives. Hosea 10:12 states, &#8220;Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great evangelist Charles G. Finney preached a message titled &#8220;Breaking Up the Fallow Ground &#8211; An Outline for Repentance&#8221;. In this sermon, he listed 26 sins that we as Christians should confess and repent of. The seventeenth sin he lists is: Envy. He urges us to confess this sin in our lives by saying: &#8220;Look at the cases in which you were envious of those whom you thought were above you in any respect. Or perhaps you have envied those who have been more talented or more useful than yourself. Have you not so envied some, that you have been pained to bear them praised? It has been more pleasant for to you to dwell upon their faults than upon their virtues, upon their failures than upon their success. Be honest with yourself; and if you have harbored this spirit of hell, repent deeply before God, or He will never forgive you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to the Lord in prayer right now and confess this sin and others before God. </p>

<p>Our prayer motivator verse from the Word of God today is Jonah 4:2-3 which reads: &#8220;And he prayed unto the Lord, and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.&#8221; </p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this verse from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>In verse 3, Jonah being now in the midst of his usefulness, and therefore fit to live. He was one whose ministry God wonderfully owned and prospered. The conversion of Nineveh might give him hopes of being instrumental to convert the whole kingdom of Assyria; it was therefore very absurd for him to wish he might die when he had a prospect of living to so good a purpose and could be so ill spared. Jonah being now so much out of temper and therefore unfit to die. How durst he think of dying, and going to appear before God’s judgment-seat, when he was actually quarrelling with him? Was this a frame of spirit proper for a man to go out of the world in? But those who passionately desire death commonly have least reason to do it, as being very much unprepared for it. Our business is to get ready to die by doing the work of life, and then to refer ourselves to God to take away our life when and how he pleases.</p>
<p>My personal encouragement to you today is that you’ll will not get genuine happiness from your spouse or from other people, but you will get it from obeying the Lord, and prayer will help you to be consistent in obeying God and hence have continual happiness in your life.</p>
<p>Our prayer motivator quote today is from an A.C. Dixon. He said: &#8220;When we depend upon organizations, we get what organizations can do; when we depend upon education, we get what education can do; when we depend upon man, we get what man can do; but when we depend upon prayer, we get what God can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our prayer motivator devotional today is part 25 of our series titled &#8220;PRAYING THROUGH&#8221; from Dr. John R. Rice.</p>
<p>Jesus taught importunate prayer in Luke 18:1-8: &#8220;And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that the sole end of the parable is praying through. Jesus spoke this parable &#8220;to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even a poor widow can plead with a judge to hear her cause and deliver her from her adversaries and give her justice. And shall not God&#8217;s own children cry unto Him day and night? &#8220;And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?&#8221; </p>
<p>Verse 8 above hints that when the Saviour comes, He will find little faith on the earth. People do not believe in prayer. People do not pray through. People do not pay the price in heart-searching, in long hours, in fasting, in confession, in restitution. But when God&#8217;s people really pray through, then they can have revival, protection, provision, anointing of the Holy Spirit and anything else God has for His people. Pray through!</p>
<p>The unconverted sinner needs simply to trust in Christ and instantly accept salvation. But one who is already a child of God has a right to camp on God&#8217;s doorstep and persistently, insistently plead the promises of God and refuse to take a denial, until that which is needed, that which is imperative to win souls and have revivals, is received from God. </p>
<p>Oh, may God&#8217;s people be encouraged to pray, pray, pray &#8212; may they be encouraged to PRAY THROUGH!</p>
<p>Keep on praying till you pray it through<br />
Keep on praying till you pray it through<br />
God&#8217;s great promises are always true<br />
Keep on praying till you pray it through.</p>

<p>This is Daniel Whyte III, president of Gospel Light Society International. It is good to be with you today. </p>
<p>We praise the Lord for all of you who are joining us on the ten day fast which began on June 1st and will last through June 10th. We look forward to you joining us on July 1st through the 10th, August 1st through the 10th, and October 1st through the 10th as this will complete 40 days of fasting during this season. We also praise the Lord for all of you who are fasting for 40 days and 40 nights during this time with such fine Christian leaders as Dr. Jim Garlow, Bishop Harry Jackson, Jr., Bishop Joseph Mattera, and Tony Perkins. We praise the Lord also that we were informed this morning that Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference which consists of over 40,000 churches, commenced fasting for 40 days and nights on June 1 as well. And Dr. Rick Scarborough with Vision America has called for 40 days of fasting and prayer to save America beginning September 28th through November 6th. We praise the Lord for the thousands who have joined these leaders as well. Miraculously, by the grace of God, with our 4 ten day fasts, our called 40 day fast starting August 1st, our every Wednesday fast, and our special three day Esther fast in September during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) we now have, by the grace of God, a complete wall-to-wall fasting movement made up of all races of people for the glory of God, for the salvation of the lost, for the revival of the church, and for the healing of the nation, among other things. </p>
<p>As you fast, please continue to pray for the following among other things: </p>
<p>1. For God to revive the church<br />
2. For God to heal the nation<br />
3. For 3 million or more people to come to Christ<br />
4. And if the Lord is going to tarry His coming, for God to give us the godly leadership that this nation needs going forward.<br />
5. For God to heal Christian families</p>
<p>For those of you who started fasting with us on June 1st, you may not be feeling that great the first few days, especially since it started on a weekend. If you follow the instructions I gave you and if you stick with it, however, you should be feeling much better today or tomorrow and you will be ready to fast on. If you are feeling a little bit weak or uncomfortable, get your blender out and mix you up a good vegetable and/or fruit smoothie. This will help you get through it. Don&#8217;t worry about what the super saints might say to you. God called you to fast, not to kill yourself. </p>
<p>Our Scripture reading for today is Isaiah 58:1-14 from the King James Version which reads: </p>
<p>1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p>2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.</p>
<p>3 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.</p>
<p>4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.</p>
<p>5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?</p>
<p>6 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</p>
<p>7 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</p>
<p>8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward.</p>
<p>9 Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;</p>
<p>10 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:</p>
<p>11 And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</p>
<p>12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</p>
<p>13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:</p>
<p>14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this passage from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>Here we notice in verse 4 that they were as covetous and unmerciful as ever: &#8220;You exact all your labours from your servants, and will neither release them according to the law nor relax the rigour of their servitude.’’ This was their fault before the captivity. It was no less their fault after their captivity, notwithstanding all their solemn fasts. &#8220;You exact all your dues, your debts’’ (so some read it); &#8220;you are as rigorous and severe in extorting what you demand from those that are poor as ever you were, though it was at the close of the yearly fast that the release was proclaimed.’’ We notice also that they were contentious and spiteful: Behold, you fast for strife and debate. When they proclaimed a fast to deprecate God’s judgments, they pretended to search for those sins which provoked God to threaten them with his judgments, and under that pretence perhaps particular persons were falsely accused, as Naboth in the day of Jezebel’s fast. Or the contending parties among them upon those occasions were bitter and severe in their reflections one upon another, one side crying out, &#8220;It is owing to you,’’ and the other, &#8220;It is owing to you, that our deliverance is not wrought.’’ Thus, instead of judging themselves, which is the proper work of a fast-day, they condemned one another. They fasted for strife, with emulation which should make the most plausible appearance on a fast-day and humour the matter best. Nor was it only tongue-quarrels that were fomented in the times of their fasting, but they came to blows too: You smite with the fist of wickedness. The cruel task-masters beat their servants, and the creditors their insolvent debtors, whom they delivered to the tormentors; they abused poor innocents with wicked hands. Now while they thus continued in sin, in those very sins which were directly contrary to the intention of a fasting day.</p>
<p>We will discuss verse 5 in tomorrow&#8217;s broadcast.</p>
<p>Our fasting quote of encouragement today is from Wesley Duewel. He said: &#8220;Fasting in the biblical sense is choosing not to partake of food because your spiritual hunger is so deep, your determination in intercession so intense, or your spiritual warfare so demanding that you have temporarily set aside even fleshly needs to give yourself to prayer and meditation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our fasting devotional today is part 3 of a new series titled &#8220;THE PURPOSE OF FASTING&#8221; from Richard J. Foster in his book &#8220;Celebration of Discipline&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once the primary purpose of fasting is firmly fixed in our hearts, we are at liberty to understand that there are also secondary purposes in fasting. More than any other Discipline, fasting reveals the things that control us. This is a wonderful benefit to the true disciple who longs to be transformed into the image of Jesus Christ. We cover up what is inside us with food and other good things, but in fasting these things surface. If pride controls us, it will be revealed almost immediately. David writes in Psalm 69:10, &#8220;I humbled my soul with fasting.&#8221; Anger, bitterness, jealousy, strife, fear &#8212; if they are within us, they will surface during fasting. At first we will rationalize that our anger is due to our hunger; then we will realize that we are angry because the spirit of anger is within us. We can rejoice in this knowledge because we know that healing is available through the power of Christ.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take this moment to break up the fallow ground in our lives. Hosea 10:12 states, &#8220;Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great evangelist Charles G. Finney preached a message titled &#8220;Breaking Up the Fallow Ground &#8211; An Outline for Repentance&#8221;. In this sermon, he listed 26 sins that we as Christians should confess and repent of. The sixteenth sin he lists is: Pride. He urges us to confess this sin in our lives by saying: &#8220;Recall all the times you can, in which you have detected yourself in the exercise of pride. Vanity is a particular form of pride. How many times have you detected yourself in consulting vanity about your dress and appearance? How many times have you thought more, and taken more pains, and spent more time about decorating your body to go to Church, than you have about preparing your mind for the worship of God?&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to the Lord in prayer right now and confess this sin and others before God. </p>
<p>GENERAL PRAYER</p>
<p>Dear friend, if you are listening to this broadcast and you do not know the Lord Jesus Christ as your Saviour, John 3:16 states, &#8220;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#8221; The Bible also says in Romans 10:9 and 13: &#8220;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved&#8230;. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear friend, if you are willing to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation, please pray with me this simple prayer: Heavenly Father, I realize that I am a sinner and that I have done some bad things in my life. For Jesus Christ sake, please forgive me of my sins. I now believe with all of my heart that Jesus Christ died for me, was buried, and rose again. Lord Jesus, please come into my heart and save my soul and change my life today and forever. Amen.</p>
<p>Congratulations on doing the most important thing in life and that is accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour! We&#8217;re here to help you, feel free to contact us at GospelLightSociety.com</p>
<p>Until next time, continue to fast and pray. God Bless You!</p>

Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.&#8221; </p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this verse from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>In a passion, verse 3 tells us that Jonah wishes for death, a strange expression of his causeless passion! “Now, O Lord! take, I beseech thee, my life from me. If Nineveh must live, let me die, rather than see thy word and mine disproved, rather than see the glory of Israel transferred to the Gentiles,” as if there were not grace enough in God both for Jews and Gentiles, or as if his countrymen were the further off from mercy for the Ninevites being taken into favour. When the prophet Elijah had laboured in vain, he wished he might die, and it was his infirmity. But Jonah labours to good purpose, saves a great city from ruin, and yet wishes he may die, as if, having done much good, he were afraid of living to do more; he sees of the travail of his soul, and is dissatisfied. What a perverse spirit is mingled with every word he says! When Jonah was brought alive out of the whale’s belly, he thought life a very valuable mercy, and was thankful to that God who brought up his life from corruption, and a great blessing his life had been to Nineveh; yet now, for that very reason, it became a burden to himself and he begs to be eased of it, pleading, It is better for me to die than to live. Such a word as this may be the language of grace, as it was in Paul, who desired to depart and be with Christ, which is far better; but here it was the language of folly, and passion, and strong corruption; and so much the worse.</p>
<p>We will discuss this verse further in the next broadcast.</p>
<p>My personal encouragement to you today is that I believe it is a crime for husbands to leave home each morning and not pray with your family. Why? Because as far as I am concerned, you leave your family unprotected against the attacks of the devil. I thank God for good Godly women. But I have found out that many Christian women will not pray as much as they should if that man is not leading in prayer. Why? Because God has put something in that woman to really want to follow her husband. The Christ in her wants to follow her husband. And so, husbands, you have to lead in the spiritual discipline of prayer. Husbands, you not only have to pray for your family, you also have to pray with your family. Wives, you need to pray for your husband and you both must pray with and for your children.</p>
<p>Our prayer motivator quote today is from an Author Unknown. He said: &#8220;There are three degrees in prayer. The lowest is that spoken only by the lips. The next is when, by a resolute effort, we succeed in fixing our thoughts on Divine things. The third is when the soul finds it hard to turn away from God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our prayer motivator devotional today is part 24 of our series titled &#8220;PRAYING THROUGH&#8221; from Dr. John R. Rice.</p>
<p>In Luke 11:5-8, Jesus gave the following story: &#8220;And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice the key word in verse 8: &#8220;Because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.&#8221; Importunity is the way to get things from God. That passage evidently refers to a child of God wanting power to win others. A Christian has a right to go to God and beg for the bread of life to give to others. Go, Christians, confess to God that &#8220;a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.&#8221; Concerning this matter of Holy Spirit power to win souls, do not take a denial. Bread for sinners is only given to those who learn the secret of &#8220;importunity&#8221;. The sinner need never pray through to be saved, but a Christian who wants the supernatural, miracle-working power of the Holy Spirit has a right to wait on God, yea, is taught to do so by the plain Word of our Saviour Himself. </p>

<p>This is Daniel Whyte III, president of Gospel Light Society International. It is good to be with you today. </p>
<p>We praise the Lord for all of you who are joining us on the ten day fast which began on June 1st and will last through June 10th. We also praise the Lord for all of you who are fasting for 40 days and 40 nights during this time. Some of you will find that after 10 days, you will want to go on for more days, maybe even 40 days with these great Christian leaders: Dr. Jim Garlow, Bishop Harry Jackson, Jr., Bishop Joseph Mattera, and Tony Perkins, as well as others. As you fast, please pray for the following: </p>
<p>1. For God to revive the church<br />
2. For God to heal the nation<br />
3. For 3 million or more people to come to Christ<br />
4. And if the Lord is going to tarry His coming, for God to give us the godly leadership that this nation needs going forward. </p>
<p>For those of you who started fasting with us on June 1st, you may not be feeling that great the first few days, especially since it started on a weekend. If you follow the instructions I gave you and if you stick with it, however, you should be feeling much better by Monday or Tuesday of this upcoming week and you will be ready to fast on. If you are feeling a little bit weak or uncomfortable, get your blender out and mix you up a good vegetable and/or fruit smoothie. This will help you get through it. Don&#8217;t worry about what the super saints might say to you. God called you to fast, not to kill yourself. </p>
<p>I want you to know that I love the King James Version of the Bible and I use it in all of my preaching and teaching. But since I am reading so many verses everyday, and some of you may get bored with reading the Word of God, I promised you that I would spice things up a little bit by using other versions of the Bible to encourage you to keep listening to the Word of God. I am committed to reading this passage everyday throughout our journey of fasting and prayer because it is very important for us to understand this passage as it serves as a guide for fasting. The Bible is king and it always trumps the rest of the words I will share with you. Right now, the farthest I am going to go is with the New King James version of the Bible.</p>
<p>With that said, our Scripture reading for today is Isaiah 58:1-14 from the New King James Version which reads: </p>
<p>1 “Cry aloud, spare not; Lift up your voice like a trumpet; Tell My people their transgression, And the house of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p>2 Yet they seek Me daily, And delight to know My ways, As a nation that did righteousness, And did not forsake the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me the ordinances of justice; They take delight in approaching God.</p>
<p>3 ‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and You have not seen? Why have we afflicted our souls, and You take no notice?’<br />
“In fact, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, And exploit all your laborers.</p>
<p>4 Indeed you fast for strife and debate, And to strike with the fist of wickedness. You will not fast as you do this day,<br />
To make your voice heard on high.</p>
<p>5 Is it a fast that I have chosen, A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, And to spread out sackcloth and ashes? Would you call this a fast, And an acceptable day to the Lord?</p>
<p>6 “Is this not the fast that I have chosen: To loose the bonds of wickedness, To undo the heavy burdens, To let the oppressed go free, And that you break every yoke?</p>
<p>7 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, And that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out; When you see the naked, that you cover him, And not hide yourself from your own flesh?</p>
<p>8 Then your light shall break forth like the morning, Your healing shall spring forth speedily, And your righteousness shall go before you; The glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.</p>
<p>9 Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; You shall cry, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’ “If you take away the yoke from your midst, The pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness, </p>
<p>10 If you extend your soul to the hungry And satisfy the afflicted soul, Then your light shall dawn in the darkness,<br />
And your darkness shall be as the noonday.</p>
<p>11 The Lord will guide you continually, And satisfy your soul in drought, And strengthen your bones; You shall be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.</p>
<p>12 Those from among you Shall build the old waste places; You shall raise up the foundations of many generations;<br />
And you shall be called the Repairer of the Breach, The Restorer of Streets to Dwell In.</p>
<p>13 “If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, From doing your pleasure on My holy day, And call the Sabbath a delight, The holy day of the Lord honorable, And shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, Nor finding your own pleasure, Nor speaking your own words,</p>
<p>14 Then you shall delight yourself in the Lord; And I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth, And feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. The mouth of the Lord has spoken.”</p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this passage from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>Here we notice in verse 4 that reigning hypocrisy often breaks out in daring impiety and an open contempt and reproach of God and religion for that which the hypocrisy itself must bear all the blame of. Sinners reflect upon religion as a hard and melancholy service, and on which there is nothing to be got by, when really it is owing to themselves that it seems so to them, because they are not sincere in it. The true reason assigned why God did not accept their fastings, nor answer the prayers they made on their fast-days; it was because they did not fast aright—to God, even to him. They fasted indeed, but they persisted in their sins, and did not, as the Ninevites, turn every one from his evil way; but in the day of their fast, notwithstanding the professed humiliations and covenants of that day, they went on to find pleasure, that is, to do whatsoever seemed right in their own eyes, lawful or unlawful—making their inclinations their law; though they seemed to afflict their souls, they still gratified their lusts as much as ever.</p>
<p>We will continue discussing this verse in our next broadcast. </p>
<p>Our fasting quote of encouragement today is from Jonathan Edwards. He said: &#8220;David Brainerd prayed with fasting for the Lord’s leadership regarding his entry into ministry. He said of his experience during that day, “I felt the power of intercession for precious, immortal souls; for the advancement of the kingdom of my dear Lord and Saviour in the world; and withal, a most sweet resignation and even consolation and joy in the thoughts of suffering hardships, distresses, and even death itself, in the promotion of it… My soul was drawn out very much for the world, for multitudes of souls. I think I had more enlargement for sinners than for the children of God, though I felt as if I could spend my life in cries for both. I enjoyed great sweetness in communion with my dear Saviour.  I think I never in my life felt such an entire weanedness from this world and so much resigned to God in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our fasting devotional today is part 2 of a new series titled &#8220;THE PURPOSE OF FASTING&#8221; from Richard J. Foster in his book &#8220;Celebration of Discipline&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fasting must forever center on God. It must be God-initiated and God-ordained. Like the prophetess Anna, we need to be &#8220;worshiping with fasting.&#8221; Every other purpose must be subservient to God. Like that apostolic band at Antioch, &#8220;fasting&#8221; and &#8220;worshiping the Lord&#8221; must be said in the same breath. Charles Spurgeon writes, &#8220;Our seasons of fasting and prayer at the Tabernacle have been high days indeed; never has Heaven&#8217;s gate stood wider; never have our hearts been nearer to the central Glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>God questioned the people n Zechariah&#8217;s day in Zechariah 7:5, &#8220;When ye fasted&#8230;did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?&#8221; If our fasting is not unto God, we have failed. Physical benefits, success in prayer, the enduing with power, spiritual insights &#8212; these must never replace God as the center of our fasting. John Wesley declares, &#8220;First, let it [fasting] be done unto the Lord with our eye singly fixed on Him. Let our intention herein be this, and this alone, to glorify our Father which is in heaven&#8230;.&#8221; That is the only way we will be saved from loving the blessing more than the Blesser. </p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take this moment to break up the fallow ground in our lives. Hosea 10:12 states, &#8220;Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great evangelist Charles G. Finney preached a message titled &#8220;Breaking Up the Fallow Ground &#8211; An Outline for Repentance&#8221;. In this sermon, he listed 26 sins that we as Christians should confess and repent of. The fifteenth sin he lists is: Wordily mindedness. He urges us to confess this sin in our lives by saying: &#8220;What has been the state of your heart in regard to your worldly possessions? Have you looked at them as really yours-as if you had a right to dispose of them as your own, according to your own will? If you have, write that down. If you have loved property, and sought after it for its own sake, or to gratify lust or ambition, or a worldly spirit or to lay it up for your families, you have sinned, and must repent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to the Lord in prayer right now and confess this sin and others before God. </p>
<p>GENERAL PRAYER</p>
<p>Dear friend, if you are listening to this broadcast and you do not know the Lord Jesus Christ as your Saviour, John 3:16 states, &#8220;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#8221; The Bible also says in Romans 10:9 and 13: &#8220;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved&#8230;. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear friend, if you are willing to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation, please pray with me this simple prayer: Heavenly Father, I realize that I am a sinner and that I have done some bad things in my life. For Jesus Christ sake, please forgive me of my sins. I now believe with all of my heart that Jesus Christ died for me, was buried, and rose again. Lord Jesus, please come into my heart and save my soul and change my life today and forever. Amen.</p>
<p>Congratulations on doing the most important thing in life and that is accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour! We&#8217;re here to help you, feel free to contact us at GospelLightSociety.com</p>
<p>Until next time, continue to fast and pray. God Bless You!</p>

<p>This is Daniel Whyte III, president of Gospel Light Society International. It is good to be with you today.<br />
We want to thank all of you who are joining us on the ten day fast which began yesterday, June 1st and lasts until June 10th. Please be reminded to listen to or read my special messages from Monday and Tuesday, especially the one from Tuesday titled &#8220;Special Update Message on Fasting from Daniel Whyte III&#8221;. You may listen and/or read them at www.gospellightsociety.com. They will be of great benefit and encouragement to you during this time. </p>
<p>Our Scripture reading for today is Isaiah 58:1-14 which reads: &#8220;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day: And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this verse from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>Here we notice what they expected from their performances. They thought God should take great notice of them, and own himself a debtor to them for their services. Note, It is a common thing for hypocrites, while they perform the external services of religion, to promise themselves that acceptance with God which he has promised only to the sincere; as if they must be accepted of course, or for a compliment. How heinously they take it that God had not put some particular marks of his favour upon them, that he had not immediately delivered them out of their troubles and advanced them to honour and prosperity. They charge God with injustice and partiality, and seem resolved to throw up their religion, and justify themselves in doing so with this, that they had found no profit in praying to God.</p>
<p>We will continue discussing this verse in our next broadcast. </p>
<p>Our fasting quote of encouragement today is from Andrew Murray. He said: &#8220;Fasting helps express, deepens, confirms the resolution that we are ready to sacrifice anything, even ourselves, to attain what we seek for the kingdom of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our fasting devotional today is part 1 of a new series titled &#8220;THE PURPOSE OF FASTING&#8221; from Richard J. Foster in his book &#8220;Celebration of Discipline&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is sobering to realize that the very first statement Jesus made about fasting dealt with the question of motive. Matthew 6:16-18 states, &#8220;Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.&#8221; </p>
<p>To use good things to our own ends is always the sign of false religion. How easy it is to take something like fasting and try to use it to get God to do what we want. At times there is such stress upon the blessings and benefits of fasting that we would be tempted to believe that with a little fast we could have the world, including God, eating out of our hand. </p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take this moment to break up the fallow ground in our lives. Hosea 10:12 states, &#8220;Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great evangelist Charles G. Finney preached a message titled &#8220;Breaking Up the Fallow Ground &#8211; An Outline for Repentance&#8221;. In this sermon, he listed 26 sins that we as Christians should confess and repent of. The fourteenth sin he lists is: a Neglect of self-denial. He urges us to confess this sin in our lives by saying: &#8220;There are many professors who are willing to do almost anything in religion, that does not require self-denial. But when they are required to do anything that requires them to deny themselves-oh, that is too much. They think they are doing a great deal for God, and doing about as much as He ought in reason to ask, if they only doing what they do just as well as not; but they are not willing to deny themselves any comfort or convenience whatever for the sake of serving the Lord. They will not willingly suffer reproach for the name of Christ. Nor will they deny themselves the luxuries of life, to save a world from hell. So far are they from remembering that self-denial is a condition of discipleship that they do not know what self-denial is. They never have really denied themselves a ribbon or a pin for Christ and the Gospel. Oh, how soon such people will be in hell! Some are giving of their abundance and are giving much, and are ready to complain that others do not give more; when, in truth, they do not themselves give anything that they need, anything that they could enjoy if they kept it. They only give of their surplus wealth; and perhaps that poor woman who puts in her mite, has exercised more self-denial than they have in giving thousands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to the Lord in prayer right now and confess this sin and others before God. </p>
<p>GENERAL PRAYER</p>

<p>An Open Letter to Otis Moss III</p>
<p>Bro. Moss:</p>
<p>I do not know you and you do not know me. However, I have admired from afar the humility, dignity and class of your father and what he has meant to our community for years. I am happy that God has blessed you with the pedigree that you have. Obviously, I do not have the blessing of that kind of notable pedigree, especially among traditional black preachers. In fact, there are greater men of God than myself who can respond to you and who will probably do so in the coming days if they find the time and if the Lord would so lead them &#8212; such men as: Rev. Dwight McKissic, Dr. Tony Evans, Bishop Harry Jackson, Jr., Bishop T.D. Jakes, Pastor Fred Luter, president-elect of the Southern Baptist Convention, Dr. Albert Mohler, Bishop Charles Blake, Rev. Julius Scruggs, Pastor Bryant Wright and many other notable black and white pastors across the country. I am not in your league and I am not in the league of these great men of God that I have just mentioned. Who knows, you may even hear from some of our more liberal brethren from the United Methodist Church who have recently taken a firm stand on this matter, making it clear that marriage ought to be between a man and a woman.<br />
<span id="more-1543"></span><br />
So that you will know a little bit about me, God saved my wretched soul on December 19, 1979. Before getting saved, I hated preachers and church with a passion. I swore to my friends that I would never be a preacher as my dad was who was well-known in the states of North Carolina and Florida. He was one of the first black preachers in America to have his own television broadcast many years ago. I have been preaching the Gospel as an evangelist (which is my calling) and a few years as a pastor (which is not my calling) for over 32 years now. I am the president of Gospel Light Society International which is a worldwide evangelistic ministry that reaches thousands with the Gospel each week. God has given me the priviledge to preach in over 23 countries and in nearly every state in the Union. I have written over 20 books including the Essence magazine national bestseller &#8220;Letters to Young Black Men&#8221; and the national bestseller &#8220;Letters to Young Black Women&#8221;. My wife and I are the authors of the runaway bestselling novels &#8220;&#8230;And Family Drama Just Won&#8217;t Stop (which was inspired by a sermon by I am sure a preacher you hold in high regard, Dr. Frederick Haynes III) as well as &#8220;No Time For Evil&#8221;. I mention these latter two books because both of these novels touch on the problem of homosexuality in the black community and the black church. My latest project which will be coming out soon is The Prayer Motivator Bible. By the grace of God, I am heard by thousands each week on my radio broadcasts, The Prayer Motivator Devotional and the Prayer Motivator Minute, as well as Gospel Light Minute X, the Gospel Light Minute, the Sunday Evening Evangelistic Message, The Prophet Daniel&#8217;s Report, and the Second Coming Watch News Update. I am also the CEO of GLM Omnimedia Group LLC, which is a multimedia corporation which among other things has over 85 news, magazine, and Christian communication sites. Our network receives over one million visits and 6 million pageviews each month. We also have over 500 websites that we use to spread the gospel and keep people informed regarding the news and current events in every country and nearly every major city in the world.</p>
<p>With that said, since we have not heard from anyone else regarding your misguided comments, I will share this open letter with you.</p>
<p>Dear Rev. Moss:</p>
<p>Recently, I read the letter and watched the video of you reading a portion of the letter to your congregation, which you wrote to another pastor expressing your concern about Black pastors who say they cannot support President Obama because he has come out and endorsed homosexual marriage. I found it to be troubling in light of God&#8217;s Word. Allow me to offer the following response since your letter was obviously an open letter:</p>
<p>First, you accuse these preachers who say they cannot support President Obama of hiding &#8220;from true dialogue with quick dismissive claims devised from poor biblical scholarship&#8221;. First of all, no &#8220;dialogue&#8221; is really necessary on this matter. As you know, and as many Bible scholars and seminary professors will tell you, the best way of studying and understanding Scripture is through plain, literal interpretation of the text. There is no need to have any &#8220;dialogue&#8221; about the plain, clear teaching of what God said. There is no need to complicate something that the Bible makes plain. Yes, there are some prophetic passages in the Bible that are clearly meant to be taken symbolically, but the issue at hand is not one of those. The issue of homosexuality, not to mention homosexual marriage, is something on which the Bible speaks very clearly.</p>
<p>Leviticus 18:22 says, &#8220;Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.&#8221; There is nothing mysterious or hard to understand about this verse. In fact, this verse is included close to the end of a chapter which discusses other sexual prohibitions. For example, Leviticus 18 also expresses God&#8217;s prohibitions against adultery, incest, inbreeding, and bestiality. &#8220;Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind&#8221; is just as plain as &#8220;Thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour&#8217;s wife.&#8221; If you want to twist God&#8217;s word to say that it is not condemning homosexual activity, then you are opening the door for others to twist God&#8217;s word to say that it is not condemning adultery, fornication, or incest. Even though we are now under grace and not under the law, and the punishment that was meted out for these sins and abominations would not be used today, we all would agree that adultery is still wrong, incest is still wrong, inbreeding is still wrong, bestiality is still wrong, and homosexuality is still wrong. In fact, Bro. Moss, if a man attempted to commit adultery with your wife and he wanted to come and have a &#8220;dialogue&#8221; with you about the matter, I do not believe you would be as cerebral as you were when you were reading the letter to your congregation. You would say like most husbands would say, &#8220;there is no need for any dialogue; and if you come over here again messing with my wife, you will never be able to &#8220;dialogue&#8221; with anyone else again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your indirect and condescending attack on those whom you call &#8220;narrow-minded ministers&#8221; and &#8216;poor biblical scholars&#8217; &#8212; basically all Black pastors who disagree with Obama&#8217;s decision to endorse same-sex marriage and will not vote for him because of it &#8212; is wrong. You are on the borderline of committing what is known in logic as the ad hominem fallacy, that is, attacking the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself. (You sarcastically stated that these pastors who disagreed with Obama were &#8220;mostly Black&#8221;. This is wrong as well. Many pastors &#8212; White, Black, and Hispanic &#8212; have spoken out against Obama&#8217;s endorsement of homosexual marriage. This is not just a &#8220;Black issue&#8221;. This is a Biblical issue.) Furthermore you equated those who embrace the doctrines of Christ and the doctrines of the Bible with those who embraced the twisted &#8220;doctrine&#8221; of the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists who killed Medgar Evers and those four little girls in Alabama. That is simply heinous.  Instead of attacking these men personally, why not simply &#8220;search the Scriptures&#8221; and seek out what the Bible says on the issues at hand.</p>
<p>(As a side note, I found it interesting to hear this week Louis Farrakhan, the head of the Nation of Islam, a Muslim, not only rebuking the president, but rebuking Christian pastors, preachers, and rabbis who have refused to speak out against Obama and his endorsement of homosexual marriage. He called out pastors and Christian leaders who believe that &#8216;what society says is more important than what God says&#8217; and are &#8216;backing down from the Bible&#8217; because they are afraid people will get offended. It is a shame to have a Muslim standing up for Biblical Judeo-Christian truth when Christian pastors and preachers such as yourself will not.)</p>
<p>Second, throughout your article you claimed that it is &#8220;love&#8221; that should drive our decisions regarding the issue of homosexual marriage which you strangely call &#8220;marriage equality.&#8221; Your letter states, &#8220;We serve in ministry this day because of a man who believed in love over doctrine&#8230;&#8221; Unfortunately, here you are misguided as well. Love does not trump doctrine. Jesus Christ loved the woman caught in adultery, but He told her &#8220;Go and sin no more.&#8221; Jesus Christ loved Matthew, the dishonest tax collector, but He pulled him from his trade and set him on a better course for his life. Jesus Christ loved Mary Magdalene, the demoniac and prostitute, but He did not allow her to stay in her sin. Jesus Christ never turned his back on doctrine or law. He condemned the religious power structure of his day, not because He was rejecting the law, but because He wanted to stop them from twisting the law to oppress the people He loved.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ said in Matthew 5:17-20, &#8220;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.&#8221; </p>
<p>If Jesus Christ was okay with our sin, He would not have gone to the cross to suffer, bleed, and die to save us from our sins. Abiding by biblical principles and encouraging others to do the same, does not mean that we are not expressing love. In fact, even the muslim Farrakhan stated to the crowd he was speaking to, &#8220;if I didn&#8217;t love you, I would go along with you. But because I love you, I must tell you the truth.&#8221; And the truth will set you free. We love our children, but we still lay down rules for them to live by and rebuke and chastise them when they are wrong. In the same vein, we love all people who are engaged in any sin including the abomination of homosexuality, but we do not abandon God&#8217;s word and endorse their sin. The presence of love does not necessitate the absence of law.</p>
<p>Third, you argued that Obama &#8220;is President of the United States of America not the President of the Baptist convention or Bishop of the Sanctified or Holiness Church&#8221; and that he is called to &#8220;protect the rights&#8221; of all, thus justifying his support of homosexual marriage. I suppose, then, that by your criteria, George W. Bush was not being president of all the people when he told the United Nations that the United States would not go along with their global homosexual rights agenda. And I suppose that Bill Clinton was not being president of all the people when he signed &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; into law in 1993 (which Obama has repealed) or when he signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996 (which Obama is trying to repeal).</p>
<p>Allow me to remind you that even the President of the United States is subject to God. Romans 13:1,3 says: &#8220;Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God&#8230;For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.&#8221; God gives governmental leaders their power to rule, and expects them to rule righteously not wickedly. Proverbs 29:2 says, &#8220;When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.&#8221; God blesses a people who have a righteous ruler. Also, Proverbs 16:12 says, &#8220;It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.&#8221; If a governmental leader rules wickedly, God will eventually cast him aside. But if he rules righteously, God will uphold his rule and reward him and the country accordingly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rev. Moss, you seem to contradict yourself in this point. You stated that Obama was president of all the people, yet in your address to the church congregation you stated three times that &#8220;November is incredibly important to OUR community.&#8221; Which is it? Is it important for Obama to be president of all the people? Or is it just important for us to elect a black president for the next four years &#8212; regardless of his ungodly and immoral views? Should not our community decide who to vote for based on God&#8217;s principles &#8212; regardless of skin color? (I am not suggesting that we vote for Romney either. By the way, I, for one, will not be voting for Romney or Obama; and I am thankful to God that it is not a sin not to vote. Christians do not have to choose the lesser of two evils or the lesser of two liars when they know voting is a waste of time when you look at the grand scheme of things. It is a waste of time because neither one of these men can deliver us from the trouble we&#8217;re in or the trouble to come, and when they know that only God can.)</p>
<p>Fourth, you came to the wrong conclusion in your paragraph discussing the difference between the authority of the religious structure and the authority of the civil structure. You stated that there is &#8220;the arena of civic debate where the Constitution is the document of authority&#8221; and that there is &#8220;the realm of ecclesiastical councils where theology, conscience and biblical mandates are the guiding ethos.&#8221; We must not forget that marriage began long before there was either the Constitution or ecclesiastical councils. God created marriage at the beginning of history in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve &#8212; a man and a woman.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:27 says, &#8220;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.&#8221; This is further reiterated in Genesis 2 when Adam said, &#8220;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.&#8221; Jesus Christ backed this up in the New Testament when He said, &#8220;Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?&#8221; Romans 1:26-27 says, &#8220;For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.&#8221; Now, Reverend, let me ask you a question: is the Constitution equal to the Bible or is the Constitution based upon the Bible? Which one is your final authority?</p>
<p>God&#8217;s Word is above both Constitutions and ecclesiastical councils. Both structures should be based on His word. His laws are perfect and man&#8217;s laws should be subject to His laws. It is the job of the Christian community to apply God&#8217;s laws to our personal lives in the physical, temporal realm no matter what our government may say. While the civil and religious structures may have jurisdiction over people, God is over the civil structure, the religious structure, and the people. As the Apostles said in Acts 5:29, &#8220;We ought to obey God rather than men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifth, you failed to consider the proper role of the prophet/preacher in the political arena. A prophet&#8217;s job is not to bow down to any political leader. In fact, the prophet because he is God&#8217;s messenger has authority over the king or the president. The prophet tells the president what to do. The president doesn&#8217;t ever tell the prophet what to do. Your desire for Black pastors and churches to continue supporting Obama is not biblically based. A preacher&#8217;s first and only allegiance is to God and His word. He is to speak &#8220;thus saith the Lord&#8221; no matter what situation he is faced with. The prophet takes God&#8217;s side in any argument. Your predecessor at Trinity United Church of Christ seemed to understand this. In a recently published book, it is reported that the following exchange (told by Jeremiah Wright) took place between then-presidential candidate Barack Obama and his pastor:</p>
<p>&#8220;Barack said, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry you don&#8217;t see it the way I do. Do you know what your problem is?&#8217; And I said, &#8216;No, what&#8217;s my problem?&#8217; And he said, &#8216;You have to tell the truth.&#8217; I said, &#8216;That&#8217;s a good problem to have. That&#8217;s a good problem for all preachers to have. That&#8217;s why I could never be a politician.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>A prophet&#8217;s job is to tell the truth. He is to stand against the wrongs of the king (president in this case), the government, the people, and even misguided pastors, as you appear to be. The Bible shows us this with Nathan confronting David, Isaiah bringing God&#8217;s word to King Hezekiah, Moses demanding that Pharaoh let God&#8217;s people go, and Elijah standing up to Jezebel and the priests of Baal. The preacher&#8217;s role is not to side with one party or the other, but to stick to the truth laid out in God&#8217;s word.</p>
<p>God told Ezekiel in Ezekiel 3:17, &#8220;Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.&#8221; That is the simple job of the prophet &#8212; to hear God&#8217;s Word and then deliver it to the people and any other intended audience.</p>
<p>In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, preachers nearly always get burned when they try to side with politicians. Barack Obama lied to the church and the nation three times during the 2008 campaign saying that he believed marriage was between a man and a woman. He even went further and described it as a &#8220;sacred union&#8221;. Of course, everyone now knows that he believes the complete opposite and preachers across America, both Black, White, and Hispanic, have publicly expressed their shock and disappointment. If the President wins another term, what will stop him from pushing the homosexual marriage agenda in Congress, before the Supreme Court, or even (God forbid) proposing an amendment that would enshrine homosexual marriage in the Constitution?</p>
<p>Sixth, in your letter, you broke the laws of logic again, when you made red herring attempts to divert attention from the issue at hand &#8212; homosexual marriage. In one paragraph you stated that the &#8220;institution of marriage is not under attack as a result of the President&#8217;s words&#8221; and then went on to say that &#8220;Marriage was under attack years ago by men who viewed women as property and children as trophies of sexual prowess. Marriage is under attack by low wages, high incarceration, unfair tax policy, unemployment, and lack of education.&#8221; While each of the things you named are negative and should be addressed for the betterment of our society, none of these things actually affect the issue at hand.  Traditional marriage stands independent of all of these issues. The things you mentioned have nothing to do with whether or not we as preachers and followers of Christ will stand up for the Biblical definition of marriage. (Perhaps, you can write a series of far less controversial letters to black ministers telling them how they can help their church members find better paying jobs, keep their sons out of jail, treat their wives with respect, and obtain a college education. But for now, let&#8217;s stay focused on the marriage issue.)</p>
<p>In this series of issues you listed, you also mentioned clergy &#8220;who proclaim monogamy yet think nothing of stepping outside the bonds of marriage to have multiple affairs with &#8216;preaching groupies.&#8217;&#8221; This, too, takes away from the issue at hand. While I will not say that this is not going on in some churches, I would like to know how you know about it. Oftentimes, Reverend, as you know, when we preach against sin, we are preaching to ourselves first because we either have temptations in those areas ourselves or we have had some experience with that sin. As far as I know, the sins of adultery are kept under wraps and nobody knows about it unless God exposes it. So, the question again is, how do you know that preachers have groupies? Be careful about trying to expose others lest you expose yourself.</p>
<p>You again made an attempt to divert from the issue at hand near the end of your letter where you state, &#8220;November is fast approaching, and the spirits of Ella Baker, Septima Clarke, Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, A. Phillip Randolph, James Orange, Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King, Jr. stand in the balcony of heaven raising the question, &#8216;Will you do justice, live [sic] mercy and walk humbly with our God?&#8217;&#8230;&#8221; Please do not contaminate the legacy of such prominent civil rights figures by attempting to identify them with the &#8220;homosexual rights&#8221; movement when they are not here to defend themselves. By the way, I doubt very seriously if any of the people you mentioned would be for homosexual marriage. The civil rights movement was a movement for fair and equal treatment of a people who had been maligned and abused because of their skin color which they had no control over. If you would allow me to borrow some terminology from a speech then-candidate Obama made at the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church in Selma, Alabama, I think I can explain it a little better.</p>
<p>The civil rights figures you mentioned were a part of the &#8220;Moses generation&#8221;. They have accomplished the task that they were sent here to do and they have gone home to be with the Lord. We (in Obama&#8217;s words) are the &#8220;Joshua generation.&#8221; It is our time to fight. And it just so happens that our fight is not civil rights, but the fight for traditional marriage. Just as Moses did not enter the Promised Land to fight in Canaan, let us not try to use the sainted memories of African-American heroes as swords in the fight for or against traditional marriage. (If you wish to know my opinion, I believe it is most likely these men and women are turning over in their graves because of black ministers who have betrayed the Bible to support homosexual marriage.) Again, let us stay focused on the issue at hand.</p>
<p>Seventh, despite arguments to the contrary, homosexual marriage will only lead to family break-down, community break-down and national destruction in our country. The reason is simple &#8212; when you have homosexual marriage, you have no future because you have no children.</p>
<p>A former Republican presidential candidate stated that if he were elected he would create a colony on the moon. Suppose we were to create a colony on the moon and 100 homosexuals were sent there to cultivate the colony and start a new society. If we went back in 70 years, what would we find? Nothing. God specifically commanded Adam and Eve to &#8220;Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.&#8221; Common sense tells us that if we put &#8220;Adam and Steve&#8221; on the moon, there would be no fruitfulness, multiplying or replenishing.</p>
<p>Now, I am not going to allow you to accuse me of being homophobic. A phobia is a fear. I am not afraid of homosexuals. In fact, just the other day, God touched my heart and gave me a message to share with homosexuals titled Born Again This Way showing them how they can accept Christ as their Saviour and be delivered from their sin. Our job as ministers of the Gospel is to show people how they can be saved and to teach them the whole council of God and that is as far as we should go. We do not have to marry homosexuals and we do not have to sanction homosexual marriage by supporting a president who does.</p>
<p>In fact, here is a poem titled &#8220;Born Again This Way&#8221; which was written by my daughter for the message:</p>
<p>I gave my heart to Jesus<br />
On a blustery, winter day.<br />
A man showed me Jesus loved me<br />
And I was born again this way. </p>
<p>I used to have no need for God<br />
Never minded what preachers say.<br />
But through the Bible, I saw the light<br />
And I was born again this way. </p>
<p>I could&#8217;ve continued on my sinful path<br />
And if I did, I&#8217;d have to pay.<br />
But God&#8217;s light shone down into my soul<br />
And I was born again this way.</p>
<p>You can give your heart to Jesus too<br />
No matter if you&#8217;re a liar, fornicator, or gay.<br />
All you must do is believe on Him<br />
And you can be born again this way. </p>
<p>We must be concerned about our future &#8212; our children and our grandchildren. The president and the preachers who support him in this matter are corrupting, confusing, and destroying our children. We are sitting in a slow cooker and the heat is slowly being turned up. It is the prophet/preacher&#8217;s job to stand up and &#8220;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.&#8221; and in this case, show the danger that we are facing in America. The Bible gives us repeated examples of God punishing and/or destroying a nation or people because of their sin. (Remember Sodom and Gomorrah? Remember the nations of Israel and Judah? Remember Babylon?) If our government sanctions the abomination of homosexuality, it is certain that God is going to judge this nation as well.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that our President did not exercise good judgment when he endorsed homosexual marriage. His daughters, Malia and Sasha, have been blessed to have a father and a mother who love them and care for them. Your children, Elijah and Makayla, have been blessed to have both a father and a mother who love them and care for them. Tell me this: which parent was unnecessary in the birth of your children?</p>
<p>God made mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, males and females for a reason. Far be it from us to try to change the natural order that God has formed &#8212; or to encourage and support those who do. The road of homosexual marriage is a dead-end. By the way, if your father, Otis Moss Jr., was not a red-blooded heterosexual alpha masculine male who loved a woman and not another ugly stinking man, you, Otis Moss III, would not even be here to express your sad, unfortunate and misguided view.</p>
<p>Your brother in Christ,</p>
<p>Daniel Whyte III</p>
<p>A NOTE TO ALL BLACK PASTORS AND MINISTERS</p>
<p>Dear Preacher:</p>
<p>If you are reading this, I want to encourage you to continue standing for God&#8217;s Word. (If you are not standing for God&#8217;s Word, please start now.) The Bible is clear on the issue of homosexuality. Frankly, I believe that if you cannot stand against homosexual marriage as a pastor, you will not stand against anything. Do not allow society, popular opinion, the President&#8217;s words, misguided ministers, or your desire to be friends with the President and hopefully get an invitation to the White House to sway you from clear Scriptural truth. Unfortunately, in this day and time, you will be criticized, maligned and ostracized for speaking the truth. Paul warns us in II Timothy 4:3, that &#8220;the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears.&#8221; I believe we are living in those days that Paul spoke of.</p>
<p>Do not allow the ever-present lure of praise, plaudits, or popularity to drown out your holy calling as a bearer of God&#8217;s truth. You may never get an invitation to the White House Prayer Breakfast, you may lose members, and you may lose the friendship of other pastors. Just remember that Jesus Christ rebuked the Pharisees for receiving their praise from men rather than from God. John 12:43 talks about those people who would not follow Jesus Christ because &#8220;they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do not compromise God&#8217;s word for temporal praise or for the sake of convenience. It is more important for us to hear Christ say when we get to heaven, &#8220;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your brother in Christ,</p>

<p>I trust that you have listened to or read my special messages from Monday and Tuesday, especially the one from Tuesday titled &#8220;Special Update Message on Fasting from Daniel Whyte III&#8221;. If not, you may do so at www.gospellightsociety.com. We want to thank all of you who joined us for the one day fast on the past three Wednesdays and for those of you who will be joining us for the ten day fast which begins today, June 1st and lasts until June 10th. We praise the Lord also for all of you who will be going on this journey with us throughout the remainder of this time. </p>
<p>Our Scripture reading for today is Isaiah 58:1-14 which reads: &#8220;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God. Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day: And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allow me to share with you some important points regarding this verse from Matthew Henry&#8217;s Commentary:</p>
<p>Here we have, beginning in verse 3, the displeasure which these hypocrites conceived against God for not accepting the services which they themselves had a mighty opinion of: &#8216;Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?&#8217; Thus they went in the way of Cain, who was angry at God, and resented it as a gross affront that his offering was not accepted. Having gone about to put a cheat upon God by their external services, here they go about to pick a quarrel with God for not being pleased with their services, as if he had not done fairly or justly by them. Observe, How they boast of themselves, and magnify their own performances: &#8220;We have fasted, and afflicted our souls; we have not only sought God daily, but have kept some certain times of more solemn devotion.’’ Some think this refers to the yearly fast (which was called the day of atonement), others to their arbitrary occasional fasts. Note, It is common for unhumbled hearts to be proud of their professions of humiliation, as the Pharisee said in Luke 18:12, &#8220;I fast twice in the week.&#8221;</p>
<p>We will continue discussing this verse in our next broadcast. </p>
<p>Our fasting quote of encouragement today is from an Unknown Author. He said: &#8220;Fasting is a way to demonstrate to God, and to yourself, that you are serious about your relationship with Him. Fasting helps you to gain a new perspective and a renewed reliance upon God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our fasting devotional today is part 4 of our series titled &#8220;IS FASTING A COMMANDMENT?&#8221; from Richard J. Foster in his book &#8220;Celebration of Discipline&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is best to avoid the term &#8220;command&#8221; since in the strictest sense Jesus did not command fasting. But it is obvious that he proceeded on the principle that the children of the kingdom of God would fast. For the person longing for a more intimate walk with God, these statements of Jesus are drawing words.</p>
<p>Where are the people today who will respond to the call of Christ? Have we become so accustomed to &#8220;cheap grace&#8221; that we instinctively shy away from more demanding calls to obedience? &#8220;Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross.&#8221; Why has the giving of money, for example, been questionably recognized as an element in Christian devotion and fasting so disputed? Certainly we have much, if not more, evidence from the Bible for fasting as we have for giving. Perhaps in our affluent society fasting involves a far larger sacrifice than the giving of money.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take this moment to break up the fallow ground in our lives. Hosea 10:12 states, &#8220;Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great evangelist Charles G. Finney preached a message titled &#8220;Breaking Up the Fallow Ground &#8211; An Outline for Repentance&#8221;. In this sermon, he listed 26 sins that we as Christians should confess and repent of. The thirteenth sin he lists is: a Neglect to watch over your brethren. He urges us to confess this sin in our lives by saying: &#8220;How often have you broken your covenant that you would watch over them in the Lord ! How little do you know or care about the state of their souls! And yet you are under a solemn oath to watch over them. What have you done to make yourself acquainted with them? In how many of them have you interested yourself to know their spiritual state? Go over the list, and wherever you find there has been a neglect, write it down. How many times have you seen your brethren growing cold in religion, and have not spoken to them about it? You have seen them beginning to neglect one duty after another, and you did not reprove them, in a brotherly way. You have seen them falling into sin, and you let them go on. And yet you pretend to love them. What a hypocrite I Would you see your wife or child going into disgrace, or into the fire, and hold your peace? No, you would not. What do you think of yourself, then, to pretend to love Christians, and to love Christ, while you can see them going into disgrace, and say nothing to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to the Lord in prayer right now and confess this sin and others before God. </p>
