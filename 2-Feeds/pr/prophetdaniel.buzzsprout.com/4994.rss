    <title>Netanyahu says Iran is giving Assad personnel to kill his own people (Second Coming Watch Update #125)</title>
    <description>Netanyahu says Iran is giving Assad personnel to kill his own people. According to the Jerusalem Post, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran is providing Syrian President Bashar Assad with both arms and personnel to butcher his people. In an interview with German newspaper, Bild, he urged the International community to &quot;understand who is supporting this brutality, this butchery - it is Iran and Hezbollah. Killers supporting killers, giving them weapons, personnel to actually do the killing. This is what we are facing: Iran, which brutally murdered its people on the streets, Syria which has perfected the technique of shelling its own civilian population with artillery.&quot; Netanyahu also bewailed that despite all the international pressure, &quot;the Iranian nuclear program has not slowed down by one millimeter.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Volcano in the South Pacific begins erupting. According to ABC Radio Australia, a new series of eruptions have begun on Manam Island off Madang in Papua New Guinea prompting officials to give warnings to residents to take precautions. The volcano is one of the most active in Papua New Guinea claiming several lives over the last decade. Vents on the volcano are glowing at nights and explosions in the craters can be heard more than 15 kilometres away. Ima It-a-ka-rai, the assistant director of the Rabaul Volcanology Observatory says the possibility of a major explosion cannot be ruled out, but it is not imminent.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Russia has world's largest nuclear arsenal. According to Israel National News, Russia, which is helping Iran develop nuclear power, has more nuclear warheads than any country in the world. Worldwide, there are an estimated 19,000 nuclear warheads held by eight countries. The list of countries includes Israel, which the Institute estimates has 80 nuclear warheads. Israel officially has a policy of &quot;nuclear ambiguity&quot; but is assumed by most everyone to have manufactured nuclear warheads. Russia has close to 10,000 nuclear warheads.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>South Korean president approves major missile buildup (Second Coming Watch Update #124)</title>
    <description>South Korean president approves major missile buildup. According to World News Tribune, Seoul has approved an ambitious missile upgrade plan for an additional 500-600 cruise and ballistic missiles during the next five years. The South Korean government said, &quot;Given the mounting threat of provocations from the North since Kim Jong-Un took power, the  Defense Ministry reported to President Lee Myung-Bak last month a plan to increase missile capabilities in response to asymmetric threats from the North.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kansas doomsday shelters sold out. According to the Daily Mail, It has been billed as the most luxurious way to sit out the apocalypse -- and now all the $1 million apartments in an abandoned missile silo in Kansas have sold out. The condominiums, deep below the Kansas prairie in the shaft of an abandoned missile silo, are meant to withstand everything from economic collapse and solar flares to terrorist attacks and pandemics. Developer Larry Hall said, &quot;These 'doomsday preppers', as they are called, want a safe place to go to in case of catastrophe. Hall is also installing an indoor farm to grow enough fish and vegetables to feed 70 people for as long as they need to stay inside and also stockpiling enough dry goods to feed them for five years.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Strong earthquake strikes south of Panama. According to CNN,  the U.S. Geological Survey said a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coast of Panama. The center of the quake was roughly 215 miles south of David, Panama, and almost 330 miles southwest of the capital, Panama City. It was an estimated six miles deep. There was no tsunami threat, and there were also no immediate reports of injuries or damage.</description>

    <title>The United States will send more warships to Asia (Second Coming Watch Update #123)</title>
    <description>The United States will send more warships to Asia. According to Reuters, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave the first details of a new U.S. military strategy saying that the United States will shift a majority of its warships to the Asia-Pacific region by 2020. Fleshing out details of a strategic pivot to Asia announced in January, Panetta said the United States would reposition its Navy fleet so 60 percent of its battleships would be assigned there, up from about 50 percent now, while maintaining six aircraft carriers in the region. The U.S. defense secretary, speaking at an annual security forum in Singapore, also sought to dispel the notion that the shift was designed to contain China's emergence as a global power.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Arab believers risk death to share their faith. According to CBN News, many Muslims throughout the Middle East are coming to Christ through signs and wonders like those performed by Paul and Barnabas in the Book of Acts. One evangelist named Rasim shares his faith in mosques, handing out Bibles and praying with those who are sick. He says that it is hard to be a Christian in a Muslim-dominated society, especially in Egypt where Christians were murdered in the streets earlier this year near the city of Luxor. Despite the risks, some bold Middle Eastern Christians feel compelled to share their faith with Muslims and other people. One evangelist stated, &quot;Of course living for Christ in Iraq is not easy for anybody. But despite this difficult situation the salvation of souls is taking place in big numbers among masses in Iraq.&quot;
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
New report says that President Obama has ordered cyberattacks on Iran. According to the AFP, U.S. President Barack Obama accelerated cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear program and expanded the assault even after the Stuxnet virus accidentally escaped in 2010. The operation, begun under president George W. Bush and codenamed &quot;Olympic Games,&quot; is the first known sustained US cyberattack ever launched on another country, and used malicious code developed with Israel. The cyberattack, aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons and keeping Israel from launching a preventive military strike, sowed widespread confusion in Iran's Natanz nuclear plant.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot;
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Israel retaliates after deadly kidnapping attempt and mortar fire (Second Coming Watch Update #122)</title>
    <description>Israel retaliates after deadly kidnapping attempt and mortar fire. According to Israel National News, shortly after noon on Friday, the IDF identified a terror squad in Gaza preparing to fire rockets into Israel and scored a direct hit. The Bethlehem-based Maan News Agency said four people were killed and four were wounded in the attack. The strike came less than an hour after terrorists, also operating in northern Gaza, fired several mortar shells into Israel's Eshkol Regional Council. The escalation comes on the heels of a pre-dawn gunfight at the Gaza security fence with a terrorist believed to have been sent to abduct a soldier, which left one soldier and the terrorist dead.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran threatens to target U.S. bases if attacked. According to Reuters, Iran has warned the United States not to resort to military action against it, saying U.S. bases in the region were vulnerable to the Islamic Republic's missiles. The comments by a senior Iranian military commander were an apparent response to U.S. officials who have said Washington was ready to use military force to stop what it suspects is Iran's goal to develop a nuclear weapons capability.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Japan says China's military spending is a 'threat'. According to the AFP, Japan expressed concern over what it called a lack of transparency in China's massive defence spending, saying the secrecy posed a &quot;threat&quot; to Tokyo. China's military budget jumped 11.2 percent to $106 billion in 2012, a rise that has caused unease around the region and especially in Tokyo. Japan's Parliamentary Senior Vice-Minister of Defense Shu Wa-ta-na-be said, &quot;There is expansion of the military budget and that is not transparent.&quot; China's growing military presence and assertive stance, especially in the South China Sea, where it has overlapping territorial claims with other Asian nations, have rattled nerves in the region as well as in Washington.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Israeli commander says Israel is conducting 'a daily war with Iran' and its proxies (Second Coming Watch Update #121) </title>
    <description>Israeli commander says Israel is conducting 'a daily war with Iran' and its proxies. According to the World News Tribune, a senior Israeli commander said all arms of the military were engaged with Iran and its proxies on a daily basis. The commander cited Iran's presence in Lebanon, Syria and the Gaza Strip. Maj. Gen. Yair Golan said, &quot;We are indirectly waging a daily war with Iran.&quot; He also said that Iran was bolstering such proxies as Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and other regional forces. The general said Iran and Hezbollah could turn Syria into another launching pad for attacks on the Jewish state.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Human barcodes&quot; could be on the way. According to the New York Daily News, author Elizabeth Moon last week rekindled the debate on whether it's a good idea to &quot;barcode&quot; infants at birth in an interview on a BBC radio program. On a weekly show that features &quot;a global thinker&quot; discussing a &quot;radical, inspiring or controversial idea&quot; for 60 seconds, Moon said, &quot;I would insist on every individual having a unique ID permanently attached -- a barcode if you will -- an implanted chip to provide an easy, fast inexpensive way to identify individuals.&quot; She believes the tools most commonly used for surveillance and identification -- like video cameras and DNA testing -- are slow, costly and often ineffective. The proposal isn't too far-fetched -- it is already technically possible to &quot;barcode&quot; a human -- but civil liberties advocates say it would violate our rights to privacy.
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The head of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood calls Israel's creation the 'worst catastrophe to hit world'. According to the Jerusalem Post, the head of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has called on Arab forces to confront Israel and for the international community to pressure the &quot;Zionist government to withdraw from the land of Palestine.&quot; The comments by Brotherhood General Guide Mohammed Badie came in a written statement to commemorate Nakba Day, when Palestinians and other Arabs mourn Israel's creation in 1948. The statement - the existence of which was revealed Wednesday - reminds Brotherhood followers of the movement's decades-long &quot;sacrifices&quot; in efforts to destroy the Jewish state.

    <title>Iran's Revolutionary Guard admits they are involved in Syria (Second Coming Watch Update #120)</title>
    <description>Iran's Revolutionary Guards admit they are involved in Syria. According to The Jerusalem Post, The deputy commander of Iran's elite Quds Force militia admitted for the first time that the Revolutionary Guard's special unit has participated in military operations in Syria in support of president Bashar Assad's regime. Es-mail Gha-ni said the Quds ('Jerusalem') Force had played a &quot;physical and nonphysical&quot; role in Syria. Ghani made his comments in a short interview with Iran's semiofficial ISNA news agency, which removed the text from its website shortly after posting it.

North Korea proclaims itself a nuclear state in new constitution. According to CNN, North Korea proclaimed itself a &quot;nuclear state&quot; this week following a revision of its constitution earlier this year. The country's portal website stated that Kim Jong-Il has &quot;transferred the country into an undefeated country with strong political ideology, a nuclear power state, and invincible military power.&quot; The website posted the revised constitution on Wednesday. The communist state carried out nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The US sees window for Iran nuclear talks closing. According to the AFP,  the US ambassador to Israel said on Wednesday that the window for dialogue over Iran's nuclear programme is closing and insisted that Washington is under no illusions about Tehran's agenda in the talks. Speaking at Tel Aviv University a week after world powers held a second round of largely fruitless talks with Iran, Ambassador Dan Shapiro insisted Washington would not continue such dialogue forever. He said, &quot;We have no illusions that Iran may be using this to buy time. It is up to Iran to follow through. The burden falls on Iran to prove it is serious.&quot;

    <title>Pastor and prophecy author, R. Loren Sandford, says, despite the outcome of the 2012 election, America is heading towards &quot;collapse&quot; (Second Coming Watch Update #119)</title>
    <description>Pastor and prophecy author, R. Loren Sandford, says, despite the outcome of the 2012 election, America is heading towards &quot;collapse&quot;. He warned Christians in an article for Charisma News, &quot;Know that the outcome of the 2012 election will have a significant effect on how much or how little time we in the body of Christ yet have to prepare for the very difficult days that must inevitably come. No matter who wins, America and the world are in serious trouble. The church must awaken spiritually, morally and biblically and we have a limited amount of time in which to do it. We must grow in numbers, in grace, in righteousness and in love in order to be ready to minister to those made desperate by the coming collapse. Neither presidential candidate has the power or the wisdom to prevent this. We are witnessing and will soon see the catastrophic collapse of a once great culture. The effect in human suffering will be enormous.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Back-to-back asteroids fly close to Earth. According to the Associated Press, a newly discovered small asteroid has harmlessly zipped close to Earth -- just as scientists expected. The 16-foot-long space rock, discovered on Memorial Day, passed by early Tuesday at a distance of 8,950 miles from the Earth's surface. It was the second asteroid encounter this week. On Monday, another asteroid, measuring 69 feet across, flew by at a distance of 32,000 miles. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anti-Christian violence continues in Nigeria. According to Compass Direct News, in Nigeria's Plateau state, Christian leaders said more Christians have died at the hands of Muslim extremists than the 35 that the military reported thus far in May. A Compass reporter was among a group of journalists that came under attack from Islamic extremists this month. In three local government areas in Plateau state, armed Fulani herdsmen attacked 15 Christian villages, killing and maiming Christians, destroying homes and leaving more than 1,000 villagers displaced.

    <title>US military warns Syria of military action (Second Coming Watch Update #118) </title>
    <description>US military warns Syria of military action. According to British newspaper, The Guardian, America's top military officer has warned Syria it could face armed intervention as international outrage grows over the massacre of women and children by tanks and artillery in Houla. General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said that following the UN security council's condemnation of the slaughter - in which more than 100 people were killed, many of them children - there needed to be increased diplomatic pressure on Damascus. But he added that the US would be prepared to act militarily if it was &quot;asked to do so&quot;.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel's vice-prime minister hints that Israel was behind &quot;Flame&quot; cyber attack on Iran. According to Haaretz, Vice Prime Minister and Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon hinted on Monday at possible Israeli involvement in the Flame virus, which was revealed to have targeted computers in Iran and the West Bank. He said in an interview with Army Radio, &quot;Anyone who sees the Iranian threat as a significant threat - it's reasonable [to assume] that he will take various steps, including these, to harm it. Israel is blessed as being a country rich with high-tech; these tools that we take pride in open up all kinds of opportunities for us.&quot;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel's exploration of untapped gas in the Mediterranean place its Navy in troubled water. According to Reuters, when Israeli economists contemplate their country's untapped natural gas finds far out in the Mediterranean, they dream of energy independence and lucrative export deals. Those charged with Israel's defense, however, worry that the navy -- small and long a middling priority in budgets -- may be hard put to protect the multinational drilling platforms and rigs out at sea. A senior military planner said, &quot;We will do our best, but without a major boost to our capabilities, our best will not be enough.&quot; Military leaders spoke on condition of anonymity indicating concern that such doubts over security might scare off investors and, perhaps, even encourage sea-borne attacks by Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla movement hostile to Israel and to its exploration of gas fields also claimed by Beirut.

    <title>Britain warns of 'all-out civil war' in Syria (Second Coming Watch Update #117)</title>
    <description>Britain warns of 'all-out civil war' in Syria. According to the AFP, Britain warned that failure by the two sides in Syria to implement UN envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan could lead to &quot;all-out civil war and collapse&quot; in the violence-torn country. Foreign Minister William Hague said &quot;It is not as if the alternatives in Syria are the Annan plan or the Assad regime retaking control of the country. The alternatives are the Annan plan or ever increasing chaos in Syria and the descent closer and closer to all-out civil war and collapse.&quot;
 &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taiwan 'deploys anti-China missiles'. According to the AFP, Taiwan has for the first time deployed cruise missiles capable of striking key military bases along the southeast coast of the Chinese mainland. Mass production of the Taiwan-made Brave Wind missiles, which have a range of 300 miles, has been completed and the missiles have come into service.  Taiwanese experts estimate that China's military, the People's Liberation Army, has more than 1,600 missiles aimed at the island. Kevin Cheng, editor-in-chief of the Asia-Pacific Defense Magazine, said &quot;To some extent, the weaponry can serve as a deterrent. In case of war in the Taiwan Strait, the missiles could be used to attack the airports and other military bases of the People's Liberation Army.&quot;
  &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Strong earthquake strikes northern Argentina. According to Reuters, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck northern Argentina early on Monday. The quake occurred at 2:07 a.m. local time and was centered 72 miles east-southeast of San-ti-ago del Es-ter-o. Police in the town said there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the quake, which was upgraded from an initial 6.3.

    <title>Egyptian Christians prepared to persevere whatever the outcome of the election (Second Coming Watch Update #116)</title>
    <description>Egyptian Christians prepared to persevere whatever the outcome of the election. According to Mission News Network, votes have been cast, and polls have closed in Egypt's first-ever truly democratic presidential elections. Currently, Egypt is ranked as the fifteenth worst nation in the world in which to be a Christian, according to the Open Doors World Watch List. Harassment, imprisonment, and even death are not uncommon fates for believers who are vocal about their faith. Now, many believers speculate that the outcome of this week's presidential elections will cause more trouble for Christ-followers. Open Doors president Carl Moeller said, &quot;With the parliamentary elections of last year, 75% of those elected were from the extremist or ultra-extremist views of Islam. And that is a very strong concern for the Christian community: if the president is elected along the same lines, that could spell a lot of additional pressure on the Egyptian Christian church.&quot;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Experts say Iran has enough uranium for 5 nuclear bombs. According to Reuters, Iran has significantly stepped up its output of low-enriched uranium and total production in the last five years would be enough for at least five nuclear weapons if refined much further. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a think-tank which tracks Iran's nuclear program closely, based the analysis on data in the latest report by the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which was issued on Friday. Progress in Iran's nuclear activities is closely watched by the West and Israel as it could determine how long it could take Tehran to build atomic bombs, if it decided to do so. Iran denies any plan to and says its aims are entirely peaceful.
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Christian broadcasting group says 'new media' may try to limit Christian speech. According to CBN News, &quot;New media&quot; communications like Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Google are extremely popular these days. But Christian advocates, like the National Religious Broadcasters, say some of those companies could limit the American tradition of free speech. The NRB and the American Center for Law and Justice conducted a study on anti-Christian censorship on new-media platforms. They discovered that Apple twice removed applications that included Christian content from its iTunes app store because it considered the viewpoints expressed to be &quot;offensive.&quot; The search engine giant Google refused to accept a pro-life advertisement from a Christian organization, which prompted a lawsuit in England. And the social networking site Facebook has partnered with homosexual rights advocates to prevent content they consider &quot;anti-homosexual.&quot; Christian leaders are calling on these social media companies to voluntarily recognize free speech values.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which was issued on Friday. Progress in Iran's nuclear activities is closely watched by the West and Israel as it could determine how long it could take Tehran to build atomic bombs, if it decided to do so. Iran denies any plan to and says its aims are entirely peaceful.

Christian broadcasting group says 'new media' may try to limit Christian speech. According to CBN News, &quot;New media&quot; communications like Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Google are extremely popular these days. But Christian advocates, like the National Religious Broadcasters, say some of those companies could limit the American tradition of free speech. The NRB and the American Center for Law and Justice conducted a study on anti-Christian censorship on new-media platforms. They discovered that Apple twice removed applications that included Christian content from its iTunes app store because it considered the viewpoints expressed to be &quot;offensive.&quot; The search engine giant Google refused to accept a pro-life advertisement from a Christian organization, which prompted a lawsuit in England. And the social networking site Facebook has partnered with homosexual rights advocates to prevent content they consider &quot;anti-homosexual.&quot; Christian leaders are calling on these social media companies to voluntarily recognize free speech values.

    <title>U.N. inspectors find high-grade uranium traces in Iran (Second Coming Watch Update #115)</title>
    <description>U.N. inspectors find high-grade uranium traces in Iran. According to Reuters, United Nations nuclear inspectors have found uranium particles refined to a higher-than-expected level at an underground site where Iran has installed more than 50 percent more enrichment centrifuges. The inspectors report said Tehran had told the U.N. agency that the presence of traces of highly refined uranium - still well below potential nuclear weapons-grade material - &quot;may happen for technical reasons beyond the operator's control&quot;. Iran started enriching to a fissile concentration of 20 percent in 2010 and has since sharply expanded the activity, saying the material will serve as fuel for a medical reactor. But a suspicious West is alarmed since such enhanced enrichment accomplishes much of the technical leap towards 90 percent -- or weapons-grade -- uranium.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel is working to improve the range of the Iron Dome system. According to the Jerusalem Post, the IDF is working to increase the range of the Iron Dome counter rocket defense system, with the aim of enabling it to intercept longer-range rockets. To achieve the improved performance, the IDF is focusing on two tracks - technological upgrades to the system as well as modifications to the Israel Air Force's operational doctrine. The IDF currently operates four Iron Dome batteries and plans to deploy an additional two within the coming year. Last week, the United States announced that it will provide Israel with $70 million in immediate aid for the purchase of additional Iron Dome batteries.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Large American cities are decaying. According to The Economic Collapse Blog, cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, Baltimore, Memphis, New Orleans, St. Louis and Oakland were all once places where middle class American workers thrived and raised their families. Today, all of those cities are rapidly being transformed into cesspools of filth, decay and wretchedness. Millions of good jobs have left our major cities in recent decades and poverty has absolutely exploded. Economist Michael T. Snyder said, &quot;Basically, you can turn out the lights because the party is over.&quot; In fact, some major U.S. cities are literally turning out the lights.  In Detroit, about 40 percent of the streetlights are already broken and the city cannot afford to repair them.  So the mayor has come up with a plan to cut the number of operating streetlights almost in half and leave vast sections of the city totally in the dark at night. Snyder says, &quot;Don't look down on Detroit too much, because what is happening in Detroit will be happening where you live soon enough.&quot;

    <title>Ahmadinejad says there is no need for war to 'destroy' Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #114)</title>
    <description>Ahmadinejad says there is no need for war to 'destroy' Israel. According to the AFP, Iran's state news agency  reported that President Mah-moud Ah-ma-din-e-jad said, &quot;The destruction of the Zionist regime does not necessitate making war.&quot; During a tour of northeast Iran, the hardline leader stated, &quot;If countries of the region cut ties with the Zionists and give them dirty looks, it will spell the end of this puppet regime.&quot; The president on Saturday also mocked Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab states of the Gulf over their huge oil contracts with the West, especially Israel's US ally.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5.3 Magnitude Earthquake Rocks Israel. According to Israel National News, an earthquake rocked Israel this weekend and was felt in areas from northern Israel to central Israel. According to a Channel 10 News report, the police in the Northern, Central and Tel Aviv Districts said they received hundreds of phone calls from citizens who felt the earthquake. Local residents reported feeling objects and buildings move for about 15 to 20 seconds. There were no reports of injuries or damages.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Three teenagers arrested for burning Bibles and using satanic symbols to defile churches in India. According to Christian Persecution Update, three boys confessed to burning Bibles and using Satanic symbols in a series of church defilements. Sources said the kids, aged 14, 15 and 18, sneaked out of a hostel at night and committed the sinister activities. They collected Bibles and hymn books from different churches and burnt them on the dance floor on top of a Satanic sign. The youths have defiled at least three churches of different denominations recently.

    <title>Abbas renews threat to take Palestinian statehood bid to UN (Second Coming Watch Update #113)</title>
    <description>Abbas renews threat to take Palestinian statehood bid to UN. According to the Jerusalem Post, Palestinian officials have expressed disappointment with Netanyahu's response to Abbas's indictment of Israeli actions over the last 20 years. They called the response &quot;vague&quot; and said it did not include &quot;clear answers&quot; to Abbas's letter. The PA prime minister renewed his threat on Thursday to unilaterally seek UN recognition of a Palestinian state in response to Israel's refusal to accept his conditions for resuming talks. His threat was made during an interview published Thursday with the Lebanese daily An-Nah-har.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
South Korea warns against another nuclear test from North Korea. According to UPI, South Korean officials said  North Korea would face &quot;grave consequences&quot; if it attempted a third nuclear test. Foreign Ministry spokesman Sho Byung-jae said, &quot;If North Korea goes ahead with a nuclear test, it will be a clear breach of the April 19 presidential statement by the U.N. Security Council and therefore the Security Council will have to take new actions.&quot; Yonhap News Agency reported officials believe the North is preparing to set off another nuclear device.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christian activists are on trial in Vietnam. According to Asia News, four young Catholics have been charged with distributing anti-government leaflets in Vietnam. They face a sentence ranging from three to 20 years in prison. The young people were involved in social work, promoting church programs, and activities against abortion. Human Rights Watch is calling for their release, noting that religious and social persecution is at the basis of their arrest. The Human Rights Watch director said, their prosecution is a &quot;clear signal that Vietnam does not respect freedom of religion or expression.&quot;

    <title>The U.S. Senate is considering giving unprecedented aid to Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #112)</title>
    <description>The U.S. Senate is considering giving unprecedented aid to Israel. According to YNet News, The US Senate is currently reviewing the US-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 which passed the House of Representatives earlier this month. The bill proposes shared satellite intelligence, aerial refueling tankers, specialized munitions and surplus drawdown gear from Iraq. A Senate aide said the bill has already amassed nearly 50 co-sponsors and is expected to pass &quot;by a lopsided margin or even unanimous vote&quot; once it reaches the Senate floor, the Defense News weekly reported. Sen. Johnny Isakson said &quot;There should not be one scintilla of light between the positions of Republicans and Democrats on the issue of the security of Israel.&quot;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
British leaders hold meeting on their country's role in Iran-Israel conflict. According to the AFP, Britain's leaders are discussing how to respond to any military confrontation between Israel and Iran, including the possible involvement of its navy. As six world powers began talks in Baghdad with Iran on its nuclear programme, the BBC said the National Security Council, which is chaired by Prime Minister David Cameron, had met last week to discuss the issue. Government lawyers have been examining the legality of any British involvement, &quot;ranging from British diplomatic support for Israel through to the possible involvement of the Royal Navy in the region.&quot;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iranian government tightens the noose on Christians. According to Mohabat News, reports from Tehran indicate that leaders of the central Assemblies of God church of Tehran asked their congregation in Sunday services to voluntarily present them with a list of their names and National ID numbers so that they could submit the list to the officials. This reveals the identity of Christian converts and enables security authorities to record detailed information about the Christians. With the government demanding their names and ID numbers, Christians will now be even easier to track and arrest or persecute later on bogus charges. This move is most likely an attempt at emptying church buildings, however, the Christians will end up going to house churches.

In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Israel slams Western powers for 'bowing down' to Iran on nuclear program (Second Coming Watch Update #111)</title>
    <description>Israel slams Western powers for 'bowing down' to Iran on nuclear program. According to Haaretz, two days before the second round of nuclear talks between Iran and world powers in Baghdad, senior Israeli officials criticized the diplomats in charge of negotiations with the Islamic Republic. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the upcoming talks, saying that &quot;the Western powers must not reveal any weakness while dealing with Iran, and must not cave in on any aspect of its nuclear program.&quot; Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said &quot;The west is bowing down to Iran, and at the same time the chief of staff of Iranian military chief is revealing Iran's true intentions, as he calls for the destruction of Israel.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Euro crisis has global economy in peril. According to the Los Angeles Times, most major economies are enjoying growth and recovery after four years of turmoil but the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that the improvements are uneven and the Eurozone crisis could spill outside Europe &quot;with very serious consequences for the global economy.&quot; The report by the chief economist for the bloc of developed nations urged its member countries that use the euro currency to consolidate lending and spread the pain of tight and expensive credit in nations like Greece, where austerity measures have forced deep cuts in jobs and government services and tapped out banks.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Japan's Fu-ku-shi-ma reactor poses a global risk &quot;beyond where science has gone before&quot;. According to CTV News, more than a year after a devastating earthquake and tsunami triggered a massive nuclear disaster, experts are warning that Japan isn't out of the woods yet and the worst nuclear storm the world has ever seen could be just one earthquake away from reality. The troubled Reactor 4 at the Fu-ku-shi-ma nuclear plant is at the centre of this potential catastrophe. Arnie Gundersen, a nuclear engineer with Fairewinds Energy Education said that a magnitude 7 or 7.5 earthquake would likely fracture the reactor's concrete pool, and disaster would ensue, with fumes and radioactive gases possibly traveling around the world.

    <title>Egypt's Christians fear increased persecution if an Islamist is elected as president (Second Coming Watch Update #110)</title>
    <description>Egypt's Christians fear increased persecution if an Islamist is elected as president. According to Reuters, Egypt's Coptic Christians complained of discrimination under Hos-ni Mu-ba-rak but fear it may get worse if an Islamist takes his place in this week's presidential election. Long-suppressed Islamists already dominate parliament. Islamist contenders for the presidency say Christians, who form about a tenth of Egypt's 82 million mostly Muslim people, will not be sidelined, but mistrustful Copts will not vote for them. The single biggest Coptic grievance and the source of most sectarian violence in Egypt is legislation that makes it easy to build a mosque but hard to construct or even repair a church. A new mosque needs only a permit from the local district. A church needs extra paper work and the president himself must sign off.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Russia says the West is still considering military action on Iran. According to Reuters, Russia's deputy foreign minister said that military action against Iran over its nuclear program was being considered in some Western countries. Deputy Foreign Minister Ser-gei Ryab-kov was speaking to reporters on a plane on his way back from the G8 summit in Camp David, where the G8 leaders signaled their readiness to tap into emergency oil stockpiles quickly this summer if tougher new sanctions on Iran threatened to strain supplies. He stated that the Russian government was &quot;receiving signals, both through public and intelligence channels, that this option is now being reviewed in some capitals as more applicable in this situation.&quot;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wheat climbs to highest prices since September. According to the Associated Press, wheat futures soared again as more concerns about dry weather hit the market. Wheat scheduled for delivery in July rose 37.5 cents, a gain of 5.7 percent, to settle at $6.95. The price of wheat has jumped 16 percent this week on worries that dry, hot weather in growing regions in the U.S. could hurt crop yields. A drought in Russia has also affected the crop there.
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says that one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse represents worldwide famine in which basic food items will be hard to come by. Revelation 6:5-6 says, &quot;And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.&quot;

    <title>Top commander in the Iranian military reiterates the country's committment to the full annihilation of Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #109)</title>
    <description>Top commander in the Iranian military reiterates the country's committment to the full annihilation of Israel. According to Fars News Agency, chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Major General Has-san Fi-rou-za-ba-di, said threats and pressures cannot deter Iran from its revolutionary causes and ideals, and stressed that the Iranian nation will remain committed to the full annihilation of the Zionist regime of Israel. Addressing a defense gathering in Tehran on Sunday, General Fi-rou-za-ba-di said that nations should realize the 'threats and dangers posed by the Zionist regime of Israel.' He also reiterated the Iranian nation and Supreme Leader's emphasis on the necessity of support for Palestinian nation and its causes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Netanyahu says there is no evidence that Iran intends to halt its nuclear program. According to the Associated Press, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is skeptical that Iran will agree to halt its nuclear program, accusing Tehran of playing a &quot;chess game&quot; with the international community. Just days ahead of a crucial round of nuclear talks with Tehran, Netanyahu said &quot;nothing would be better than to just see this issue solved diplomatically. But I have to say I see no evidence whatsoever that Iran is serious about ending its nuclear program.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The U.S. is considering adding Nigeria's Boko Haram to terror watch list. According to Yahoo News, the Nigerian militant group Boko Haram has killed more than 1,000 people in a three-year insurgency, and may have ties with Al Qaeda. Now, the US government is considering putting the Nigerian militant group Boko Haram on its terrorist watch list. The measure, pushed by the US Justice Department, would give US law enforcement agencies the power to prevent known members of Boko Haram to travel, and for any American company to conduct business or money transactions with the militant group. Boko Haram has attacked Christian churches, state universities, state police installations and even international aid organizations.

    <title>Italy earthquake kills at least 4 (Second Coming Watch Update #108)</title>
    <description>Italy earthquake kills at least 4. According to the AP, One of the strongest earthquakes to shake northern Italy rattled the region around Bologna early Sunday, a magnitude-6.0 temblor that killed at least four people, toppled buildings and sent residents running into the streets, emergency services and news reports said. The quake struck at 4:04 a.m. local time Sunday between Modena and Mantova, about 35 kilometres north-northwest of Bologna at a relatively shallow depth of 5 kilometres, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was one of the strongest quakes to shake the region, seismologists said, and initial television footage indicated that older buildings had suffered damage: roofs collapsed, church towers showed cracks and the bricks of some stone walls tumbled into the street. News reports, citing emergency services, said three people were killed in Sant'Agostino di Ferrara when a ceramics factory collapsed. Another person was killed in Ponte Rodoni do Bondeno, ANSA said.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
U.S. Envoy to Israel Says Nation Is Ready on Iran. According to the New York Times, Dan Shapiro, the American ambassador to Israel said this week that not only was America willing to use military force to  stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but that preparations had already been made for a possible attack. “It would be preferable to resolve this diplomatically and through the use of pressure than to use military force,” the ambassador said Tuesday at a meeting of the Israeli bar association. “But that doesn’t mean that option is not fully available. And not just available, but it’s ready. The necessary planning has been done to ensure that it’s ready.”
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'Lost Tribe' Of Israel Returning Home. According to World Net Daily, After a five-year immigration halt, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has given permission to a community of Indian citizens who believe they are one of the “lost tribes” of Israel to move to the Jewish state. “We had a major breakthrough, and thank God, the Aliya [immigration to Israel] is set to resume this summer, and we hope and pray to bring the first batch of 50 families, or about 250-300 Bnei Menashe immigrants, to Israel by the end of August,” said Michael Freund, chairman of Shavei Israel, which is behind the initiative. Shavei, based in Jerusalem, hopes to bring to the Jewish state the remaining 7,000 Indian citizens who believe they are the Bnei Menashe, the descendants of Manasseh, one of biblical patriarch Joseph’s two sons and a grandson of Jacob. Freund sees the Bnei Menashe immigration as biblical, quoting from Isaiah 43:5, which states, “Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west.” “Those words,” Freund says, “are coming to life before our eyes.” “I think this is a very historic project,” he added. “It is the closing of an historical circle. It is the return of a lost tribe of Israel after 27 centuries of exile, and it is a fulfillment of biblical prophecy.”

    <title>Top U.S. official warns Russia that the world as we know it may be about to end (Second Coming Watch Update #107) </title>
    <description>Top U.S. official warns Russia that the world as we know it may be about to end. According to the European Union Times, a new report prepared by the Foreign Intelligence Service circulating in the Kremlin says that the United States top National Security Advisor to President Obama, Thomas Donilon, was granted a “rushed meeting” with President Putin this past Friday wherein he warned the Russian leader that the world as we know it may be about to end. According to this report, the Obama administration became alarmed last week after Russia’s top military official, Chief of the General Staff Nik-o-lai Mak-a-rov, threatened to carry out a pre-emptive strike if Washington goes ahead with its plan to build a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Russia says action on Syria and Iran may lead to a nuclear war. According to Reuters, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned that military action against sovereign states could lead to a regional nuclear war, starkly voicing Moscow's opposition to Western intervention ahead of a G8 summit at which Syria and Iran will be discussed. He said, &quot;Hasty military operations in foreign states usually bring radicals to power. At some point such actions which undermine state sovereignty may lead to a full-scale regional war. Although I do not want to frighten anyone, with the use of nuclear weapons, everyone should bear this in mind.&quot;
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
U.S. warns that Iran and Hezbollah may have the ability to attack the U.S. According to Israel National News, House Homeland Security Committee chief Peter King voiced the belief that there may be hundreds, if not thousands, of Hezbollah operatives inside the United States, capable of launching a major attack on US soil. Now, warnings from lawmakers on Capitol Hill suggest that Iran and its terror proxy, Hezbollah, may have the ability of staging an attack on New York City comparable to the terror that was unleashed on the World Trade Centers on 9/11. According to one NYPD official, there have been at least five other instances of what he called &quot;hostile reconnaissance&quot; against New York City by Iranian agents.

    <title>Ehud Barak says Syrian leader is 'doomed' (Second Coming Watch Update #106)</title>
    <description>Ehud Barak says Syrian leader is 'doomed'. According to the AFP, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is &quot;doomed&quot;, urging the international community to increase pressure on his embattled regime. He said Assad's departure would be a &quot;major blow&quot; to Iran as well as Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad while stressing the importance of Russia's role in finding a way out of the current crisis. He also warned that only Assad and the elites around him need to go, and not other structures of the Syrian regime including the army.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Iran vows to never renounce nuclear 'rights'. According to the AFP, Tehran's chief nuclear negotiator said Iran rejects Western pressures over its nuclear activities and will never give up its rights. Sa-eed Ja-li-li said in a speech broadcast on local television, &quot;If we participate in the negotiations... it is because of our resistance (to Western powers). Thanks to our resistance, we have defended the rights of the Iranian people. The Iranian people will never give up even an iota of their rights.&quot; The West suspects that the Islamic republic's nuclear drive is masking a weapons programme. Tehran vehemently denies the charge.

According to Compass Direct News, the election of a hard-line Islamic governor in Indonesia's Aceh Province last month appears to have opened the way for a crack-down on the minority Christian community, which saw 17 churches sealed shut in early May. Emboldened by the April 9 election of Zai-ni Ab-dull-ah of the militant Aceh Party, hundreds of Islamists demonstrated in front of the office of regency on April 30, demanding area church buildings be not only sealed but demolished. Christian leaders told Compass that, besides the usual pretext of lack of church permits, the demands were based on a controversial agreement that Christians were reportedly forced to sign in 2001 stipulating that there be only one church and four chapels in the regency.

    <itunes:summary>Ehud Barak says Syrian leader is 'doomed'. According to the AFP, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is &quot;doomed&quot;, urging the international community to increase pressure on his embattled regime. He said Assad's departure would be a &quot;major blow&quot; to Iran as well as Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad while stressing the importance of Russia's role in finding a way out of the current crisis. He also warned that only Assad and the elites around him need to go, and not other structures of the Syrian regime including the army.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Iran vows to never renounce nuclear 'rights'. According to the AFP, Tehran's chief nuclear negotiator said Iran rejects Western pressures over its nuclear activities and will never give up its rights. Sa-eed Ja-li-li said in a speech broadcast on local television, &quot;If we participate in the negotiations... it is because of our resistance (to Western powers). Thanks to our resistance, we have defended the rights of the Iranian people. The Iranian people will never give up even an iota of their rights.&quot; The West suspects that the Islamic republic's nuclear drive is masking a weapons programme. Tehran vehemently denies the charge.

    <title>Iran is disregarding U.N. sanctions and is sending arms to Syria (Second Coming Watch Update #105)</title>
    <description>Iran is disregarding U.N. sanctions and is sending arms to Syria. According to Reuters, Syria remains the top destination for Iranian arms shipments in violation of a U.N. Security Council ban on weapons exports by the Islamic Republic. Iran, like Russia, is one of Syria's few allies as it presses ahead with a 14-month old assault on opposition forces determined to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A confidential report on Iran's activities came as Tehran and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency are trying to narrow their differences on how to tackle concerns over Iran's atomic program, and as Iran prepares for talks with the five permanent council members and Germany in Iraq next week
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood want to elect an Islamic caliphate. According to Israel National News, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood is hoping that when the polls open in nine days, voters will bring in the era of the Islamic Caliphate. Muslim cleric Saf-wat Hi-ga-zy declared that Egypt was &quot;seeing the dream of the Islamic Caliphate coming true&quot;. Muslim Brotherhood candidate, Mohammed Morsi, said at a rally at Cairo University, &quot;We will not accept any alternative to Shari'ah law... The Qu'ran is our constitution and it will always be so.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christian Neighborhood In Indonesia Attacked. According to Asia News, for the third straight day there have been attacks in Moluccas in Indonesia where a group of unidentified persons set fire to houses and motorbikes in a predominantly Christian neighborhood. AsiaNews sources say that dozens of families have fled their homes for fear of attacks. Many fear the involvement of Islamic extremist groups. Between 1999 and 2001 a bloody war between Christians and Muslims was fought in the Moluccas. There were thousands of victims, hundreds of churches and mosques destroyed, thousands of homes destroyed, and almost half a million refugees.

    <title>Crackdown on churches is &quot;spreading&quot; in Southern Laos (Second Coming Watch Update #104)</title>
    <description>Crackdown on churches is &quot;spreading&quot; in Southern Laos. According to Worthy News, a government crackdown on churches in southern Laos is spreading to a new district with the brief detention of two &quot;prominent pastors&quot; for alleged unauthorized worship and their involvement in evangelism and an order to take down crosses. Officials reportedly said they suspect the leaders are holding illegal church services with outside support. Additionally, police and district officials accused the two men of &quot;proselytizing&quot; and ordered them to stop spreading the Christian message to the Lao people &quot;because due to their witness a large number of people have come to believe in the Christian faith.&quot;

Iran begins new round of talks with IAEA. According to the Associated Press, a senior U.N. nuclear agency official urged Iran to allow access to sites, people and documents it seeks in its probe of suspicions that Tehran conducted secret research into nuclear weapons development. The appeal came as International Atomic Energy Agency officials renewed talks with Iranian envoys aimed at persuading Tehran to allow IAEA experts to visit a suspect site at the Parchin military complex. The agency believes that site was used by Iran to test multipoint explosives of the type used to set off a nuclear charge. Iran denies such experiments and insists it has no plans to turn its civilian nuclear program to making weapons.

Sudanese authorities close down Christian offices in South Darfur. According to Compass Direct News, security agents in Sudan's South Darfur state have closed down the Nyala offices of the Sudan Council of Churches (SCC) and relief group Sudan Aid. Three staff members from Sudan Aid were arrested in the course of the closure and were taken to an undisclosed location. The actions came as Christianity is increasingly regarded as a foreign faith to be excised from Sudan, which has begun transporting ethnic South Sudanese to South Sudan following the latter's secession last year.

    <title>Nigerian churches are still under attack by suspected militants (Second Coming Watch Update #103)</title>
    <description>Nigerian churches are still under attack by suspected militants. According to Persecution.org, at least two churches were attacked by suspected Islamic militants in northern Nigeria in recent days, following several other incidents that killed some 20 Christians. Evangelist Paul Jongas was returning from a tour in Niger when he found out that an Evangelical Church of West Africa in Yobe state was attacked and burned to ashes. He said, &quot;No deaths were reported. However, last night some armed men attacked St. Michael's Catholic church in Borno state. There was no immediate known claim of responsibility, but the Nigerian Islamic group Boko Haram was suspected to be behind the attacks.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Romans 8:37-38: &quot;As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran may have conducted nuclear explosives testing . According to The Inquisitr, an image has emerged and found itself into the hands of the Associated Press that shows Iran may have already conducted explosives testing to develop nuclear weapons.  The drawing of the explosives chamber was given to the AP by an insider to the IAEA inspections program.  The explosives testing chamber is supposedly located at the military site at Parchin Military complex, deep within Iran. IAEA officials have acknowledged that the drawing was given to them by someone within the Iranian nuclear program and that is why they have failed to elaborate on any other details about the drawing or its specifics for fear it could endanger the informant's life
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Italy boosts security amid fears of anarchy. According to the AFP, Italy's government has raised the alert level at sensitive sites nationwide after an anarchist group shot and wounded the head of a nuclear energy company. Interior minister, Anna Maria Can-cell-ieri told Italian newspapers, &quot;The risk of an escalation of anarchist terrorism is real,&quot; adding that soldiers could be deployed to guard some sites. Relevant agencies had been ordered &quot;to raise the alert level around sensitive targets throughout the country.&quot;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Israel aims to become the region's undisputed naval power (Second Coming Watch Update #102)</title>
    <description>Israel aims to become the region's undisputed naval power. According to Gulf News, with the acquisition this month of a sixth German-made submarine, Israel is seeking to position itself as the region's undisputed naval powerhouse. From spying on enemies to intercepting illegal arms shipments to blockading the Gaza Strip, Israel's naval capabilities are playing a more prominent role in the nation's security. The latest advanced German sub, with a price tag of more than $500 million, is Israel's most expensive piece of military equipment. Defence Minister Ehud Barak recently said the subs could also play a role in attacking Iranian nuclear development facilities.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Egyptian presidential candidate threatens Israel with Iranian alliance. According to Israel National News, Israel may face a new Iranian-Egyptian threat if presidential candidate Hish-am El-Bas-ta-wi-si wins his bid to succeed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Backed by the left-wing Ta-gam-mu party, El-Bas-ta-wi-si said on Saturday that building good relations with Iran would be one of his highest priorities. Israel already faces a northern &quot;axis of evil&quot; by the alliance between Iran, Syria and Lebanon. El-Bas-ta-wi-si also promised to revise the Camp David Accords to allow the army to increase an armed presence in the Sinai Peninsula.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thousands of people march against economic gloom in Spain and the UK. According to Reuters, thousands of Spaniards fed up with economic misery and waving banners against bankers marched on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of the grassroots &quot;Indignados&quot; movement that has sparked similar protests around the world. Up to 600 people denouncing the Bank of England rallied in London and a Reuters witness said scuffles broke out between some demonstrators and police, with at least 12 arrests. The Indignados and the offshoot Occupy and Take the Square movements had called for a global day of action against anti-debt austerity policies and the widening gap between rich and poor.

    <title>Ahmadinejad says there is no need for war to 'destroy' Israel (Second Coming Herald #101)</title>
    <description>Ahmadinejad says there is no need for war to 'destroy' Israel. According to the AFP, Iran's state news agency  reported that President Mah-moud Ah-ma-din-e-jad said, &quot;The destruction of the Zionist regime does not necessitate making war.&quot; During a tour of northeast Iran, the hardline leader stated, &quot;If countries of the region cut ties with the Zionists and give them dirty looks, it will spell the end of this puppet regime.&quot; The president on Saturday also mocked Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab states of the Gulf over their huge oil contracts with the West, especially Israel's US ally.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5.3 Magnitude Earthquake Rocks Israel. According to Israel National News, an earthquake rocked Israel this weekend and was felt in areas from northern Israel to central Israel. According to a Channel 10 News report, the police in the Northern, Central and Tel Aviv Districts said they received hundreds of phone calls from citizens who felt the earthquake. Local residents reported feeling objects and buildings move for about 15 to 20 seconds. There were no reports of injuries or damages.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Three teenagers arrested for burning Bibles and using satanic symbols to defile churches in India. According to Christian Persecution Update, three boys confessed to burning Bibles and using Satanic symbols in a series of church defilements. Sources said the kids, aged 14, 15 and 18, sneaked out of a hostel at night and committed the sinister activities. They collected Bibles and hymn books from different churches and burnt them on the dance floor on top of a Satanic sign. The youths have defiled at least three churches of different denominations recently.

    <title>The U.S. is concerned that Israel may attack Iran at any given moment (Second Coming Watch Update #100)</title>
    <description>The U.S. is concerned that Israel may attack Iran at any given moment. According to Israel National News, the United States is worried that Shaul Mofaz and his Kadima party joining a unity government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could result in an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities at any given moment. U.S. government officials told Channel 10 News that they believe a Likud-Kadima joint government could make a decision about an Israeli attack on Iran at any moment and perhaps even before the U.S. presidential elections in November. The report said that when the Americans believed early elections would be held in Israel in September, they thought it meant an attack on Iran would be postponed at least until after the election. Now, with the stabilization of Israeli politics and the current government likely to end its term on schedule, the situation has changed and the Americans are concerned.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hamas says it will not go to war for Iran. According to Reuters, the Islamist movement Hamas will not let itself be dragged into a war against Israel if it attacks the nuclear facilities of Hamas' ally Iran. Gaza leader Is-ma-il Ha-ni-yeh said, &quot;Hamas is a Palestinian movement that acts within the Palestinian arena and it carries out its political and field actions in a way that suits the interests of the Palestinian people. Iran did not ask anything from us and we think Iran is not in need of us.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ahmadinejad says Iran will continue its current path despite pressure. According to the Fars News Agency, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lashed out at western states for using threatening language against Iran, but at the same time underscored that the Iranian nation would continue its move towards progress regardless of the pressures. Speaking in Iran's Northeastern city of Rasht-khar, Ahmadinejad said pressures on Iran are futile and cannot discourage the Iranian nation from pursuing what they want. Washington and its Western allies accuse Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian nuclear program.

    <itunes:summary>The U.S. is concerned that Israel may attack Iran at any given moment. According to Israel National News, the United States is worried that Shaul Mofaz and his Kadima party joining a unity government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could result in an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities at any given moment. U.S. government officials told Channel 10 News that they believe a Likud-Kadima joint government could make a decision about an Israeli attack on Iran at any moment and perhaps even before the U.S. presidential elections in November. The report said that when the Americans believed early elections would be held in Israel in September, they thought it meant an attack on Iran would be postponed at least until after the election. Now, with the stabilization of Israeli politics and the current government likely to end its term on schedule, the situation has changed and the Americans are concerned.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hamas says it will not go to war for Iran. According to Reuters, the Islamist movement Hamas will not let itself be dragged into a war against Israel if it attacks the nuclear facilities of Hamas' ally Iran. Gaza leader Is-ma-il Ha-ni-yeh said, &quot;Hamas is a Palestinian movement that acts within the Palestinian arena and it carries out its political and field actions in a way that suits the interests of the Palestinian people. Iran did not ask anything from us and we think Iran is not in need of us.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ahmadinejad says Iran will continue its current path despite pressure. According to the Fars News Agency, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lashed out at western states for using threatening language against Iran, but at the same time underscored that the Iranian nation would continue its move towards progress regardless of the pressures. Speaking in Iran's Northeastern city of Rasht-khar, Ahmadinejad said pressures on Iran are futile and cannot discourage the Iranian nation from pursuing what they want. Washington and its Western allies accuse Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian nuclear program.

    <title>Israel's ambassador to the U.S. indicates war clouds are gathering over Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #99) </title>
    <description>Israel's ambassador to the U.S. indicates war clouds are gathering over Israel. According to Breitbart, Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, briefed Christian supporters of the Jewish state last week. He told an audience crowded into his Embassy's Jerusalem Auditorium of a recent visit by U.S. intelligence specialists who had asked Dr. Oren to compare Israel's situation today with other critical periods in the nation's past. Without hesitation, he answered: 'In the best case scenario, it's May 1967. In the worst case, it's May 1948.' In May 1967, Israel had to prepare to attack Egypt, Jordan, and Syria before these neighboring states could &quot;drive the Jews into the sea,&quot; as Egypt's left-leaning dictator Ga-mal Ab-del Nas-ser was then exhorting Arabs to do. The worst case, as the Ambassador described, would be May 1948. That's when the UN-ordered partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states occurred. And seven Arab states--Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia--sent troops to exterminate the Jews. They all immediately declared their intention of wiping out the infant Jewish state.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Iran is turning mosques around the world into terrorism command centers. According to the Christian Post, the Revolutionary Guards and its Quds Forces, which run Iran's terror networks worldwide, have created two special units to undermine the regimes in the Persian Gulf and push America out of the region. The Guards are using Imam Ali mosques around the globe, including some in the U.S., as terror command centers. Sources report that Unit 110 and Unit of Madinah were established to remove the U.S from the Gulf. According to a former intelligence officer who served in that specific region, their orders are twofold: Incite uprisings within the Shiite minorities in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other countries in the region, and prepare for military operations against those countries' governmental facilities.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
More and more churches being attacked by criminals. According to Fox News, a growing tide of burglaries at houses of worship are signs of both a reeling economy and the end of a social taboo that once protected the money collected to help the poor and the valuables displayed to honor a higher power. In the latest example, police in Longmont, Colo., have formed a task force to investigate 10 break-ins and attempted burglaries at six churches in less than two weeks. And all around the nation, the faithful are finding criminals unfazed by the prospect of burglarizing a sanctuary. Jeffrey Hawkins, a security consultant who works with churches, said &quot;From a historical standpoint, the sacredness of the church has changed, so to speak, in our society,&quot;

    <title>Israel demands that Iran commit to stopping all enrichment (Second Coming Watch Update #98)</title>
    <description>Israel demands that Iran commit to stopping all enrichment. According to the Associated Press, Israel on Wednesday accused Iran of stalling in negotiations over its nuclear program with the international community, and said an upcoming round of talks can succeed only if the Iranians agree to halt all uranium enrichment. Israel is staking out a hardline stance ahead of the May 23 talks in Baghdad, where six world powers will sit down with Iranian officials in hopes of resolving the standoff. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who considers a nuclear-armed Tehran to be a mortal threat, has hinted he would order an attack on Iran if he concludes that international diplomacy and sanctions have failed.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nuclear experts say Japan's Fukushima is a dangerous time bomb. According to Alternet, nuclear waste experts say the Japanese are literally playing with fire in the way nuclear spent fuel continues to be stored onsite, especially in reactor 4, which contains the most irradiated fuel -- 10 times the deadly fuel released during the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. These experts also charge that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is letting this threat fester because acknowledging it would call into question safety at dozens of identically designed nuclear power plants around the U.S. A catastrophic worst-case scenario would release an amount of cesium-137 equaling a doomsday-like load, roughly 85 times more than the release at Chernobyl. It's a scenario that would literally threaten Japan's annihilation and civilization at large, with widespread worldwide environmental radioactive contamination.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Muslim lawyer threatens a 'bloodbath' if Islamic law is not allowed in Russian courts. According to ASSIST News Service, a Muslim lawyer has called for the introduction of sharia courts in Russia, threatening a &quot;bloodbath&quot; if the demand is opposed. Che-chen Khas-a-vov, the founder of an organization that defends the rights of Muslims, said in an interview broadcast by the independent channel Ren-TV: &quot;Muslims do not want to get involved in the multi-layered court system, it is alien to them. You think that we come here to Russia like to some alien place. But we think that we are at home. Maybe you are alien, and we are at home. And we will set the rules, the rules that suit us, whether you want it or not. Any attempts to change it will end in blood, it will be the second Dead Sea. We will flood the city with blood.&quot;

    <title>Egypt's Islamists vow to create a global caliphate with its capital in Jerusalem (Second Coming Watch Update #97)</title>
    <description>Egypt's Islamists vow to create a global caliphate with its capital in Jerusalem. According to the Jerusalem Post, a radical Muslim preacher told thousands of Muslim Brotherhood supporters that Egypt's Islamists aim to install a global Islamic caliphate with its capital in Jerusalem. Saf-wat Hi-ga-zi told thousands of Brotherhood supporters at a Cairo soccer stadium, &quot;We can see how the dream of the Islamic caliphate is being realized, God willing, by Dr. Mohamed Mursi.&quot; Mursi - the movement's presidential candidate - and other Brotherhood officials nodded in agreement. &quot;The capital of the caliphate - the capital of the United States of the Arabs - will be Jerusalem, God willing,&quot; Higazi said. &quot;Our capital shall not be in Cairo, Mecca or Medina,&quot; he said, before leading the crowd in chants of &quot;Millions of martyrs march toward Jerusalem.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hundreds of dead dolphins and birds are causing alarm in Peru. According to The New York Times, late last year, fishermen began finding dead dolphins, hundreds of them, washed up on Peru's northern coast. Now, seabirds have begun dying, too, and the government has yet to conclusively pinpoint a cause. Officials insist that the two die-offs are unrelated. The dolphins are succumbing to a virus, they suggest, and the seabirds are dying of starvation because anchovies are in short supply.  But even three months after officials began testing the dolphins, the government has not released definitive results, and there is growing suspicion among the public and scientists that there might be more to the story. Some argue that offshore oil exploration could be disturbing wildlife, for example, and others fear that biotoxins or pesticides might be working their way up the food chain.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran says nuclear deal is still a 'long way' off. According to the AFP, a top Iranian politician expressed optimism over upcoming nuclear talks with world powers in Baghdad, but said there was still a &quot;long way&quot; to go in resolving Tehran's atomic issue. Mohsen Rezai, secretary of the Expediency Council which is tasked with advising Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said &quot;I am optimistic about the outcome of the talks in Baghdad, but I believe there is still a long way&quot; He also admitted that &quot;the lifting of sanctions (imposed on Iran by the international community) is a long way&quot; from happening.

    <itunes:summary>Egypt's Islamists vow to create a global caliphate with its capital in Jerusalem. According to the Jerusalem Post, a radical Muslim preacher told thousands of Muslim Brotherhood supporters that Egypt's Islamists aim to install a global Islamic caliphate with its capital in Jerusalem. Saf-wat Hi-ga-zi told thousands of Brotherhood supporters at a Cairo soccer stadium, &quot;We can see how the dream of the Islamic caliphate is being realized, God willing, by Dr. Mohamed Mursi.&quot; Mursi - the movement's presidential candidate - and other Brotherhood officials nodded in agreement. &quot;The capital of the caliphate - the capital of the United States of the Arabs - will be Jerusalem, God willing,&quot; Higazi said. &quot;Our capital shall not be in Cairo, Mecca or Medina,&quot; he said, before leading the crowd in chants of &quot;Millions of martyrs march toward Jerusalem.&quot;

Hundreds of dead dolphins and birds are causing alarm in Peru. According to The New York Times, late last year, fishermen began finding dead dolphins, hundreds of them, washed up on Peru's northern coast. Now, seabirds have begun dying, too, and the government has yet to conclusively pinpoint a cause. Officials insist that the two die-offs are unrelated. The dolphins are succumbing to a virus, they suggest, and the seabirds are dying of starvation because anchovies are in short supply.  But even three months after officials began testing the dolphins, the government has not released definitive results, and there is growing suspicion among the public and scientists that there might be more to the story. Some argue that offshore oil exploration could be disturbing wildlife, for example, and others fear that biotoxins or pesticides might be working their way up the food chain.

Iran says nuclear deal is still a 'long way' off. According to the AFP, a top Iranian politician expressed optimism over upcoming nuclear talks with world powers in Baghdad, but said there was still a &quot;long way&quot; to go in resolving Tehran's atomic issue. Mohsen Rezai, secretary of the Expediency Council which is tasked with advising Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said &quot;I am optimistic about the outcome of the talks in Baghdad, but I believe there is still a long way&quot; He also admitted that &quot;the lifting of sanctions (imposed on Iran by the international community) is a long way&quot; from happening.

    <title>Israel issues stark warning to Hezbollah over Iran (Second Coming Watch Update #96)</title>
    <description>Israel issues stark warning to Hezbollah over Iran. According to British newspaper The Telegraph, a senior Israeli military officer has warned that any Hizbollah retaliation to an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities would prompt Israel to launch a war in Lebanon so ferocious that it would take a decade to rebuild the villages it destroys. Despite the inevitable international outcry, Israel would be left with no choice but to lay waste to swathes of southern Lebanon because Hizbollah has entrenched itself so deeply within the civilian population. The unusually stark warning comes after months of heightened speculation that the Israeli government is considering unilateral military action against Iran's nuclear installations despite opposition from the United States.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
U.S. wants &quot;urgent&quot; steps from Iran in nuclear talks. According to Reuters, the United States called on Iran on Monday to take &quot;urgent practical steps&quot; to build confidence during nuclear talks with world powers, and the European Union said Tehran must suspend sensitive atomic activities. Iran and the six powers resumed discussions in mid-April in Istanbul after a gap of more than a year - a chance to ease escalating tension and help to avert the threat of a new Middle East war. The major powers - the United States, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany - and Iran are to meet again on May 23 in Baghdad.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
US to conduct 'largest ever' missile defense test . According to Space Daily, the director of the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency Gen. Patrick O'Reilly, said the US plans to conduct 'the largest ever test launch' of its missile defense program elements to intercept and destroy five 'enemy' missiles. The US has been working with other NATO countries to place such defense systems in the Asia-Pacific region and in Eastern Europe.

    <title>Christians are the 'most persecuted' religious group in the world (Second Coming Watch Update #95)</title>
    <description>Christians are the 'most persecuted' religious group in the world. According to the Christian Post, the head of a California-based evangelical religious liberty group stated that Christianity is presently the most persecuted religion on earth based on evidence gathered. Dr. Carl Moeller of Open Doors USA said that, &quot;In terms of sheer numbers, the large size of the Christian populations around the world, where they're repressed or restricted… Whether you count martyrs, those killed, or you count those living in regimes, sizable Christian populations live under extreme restrictions in places like China, Indonesia, and of course the Middle East.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Russia says Iran, Pakistan and N. Korea could pose a nuclear threat to the country. According to the Russian News and Information Agency, the former director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, Vya-ches-lav Trub-ni-kov, said a nuclear-armed Iran, Pakistan and North Korea could potentially trigger regional chain reactions that ultimately threaten Russia's security. He said, &quot;Even if Iran, Pakistan and North Korea are not Russian adversaries, their current and projected nuclear potential could destabilize the regional situation. It could trigger a chain reaction of proliferation that gives rise to a new missile threat for Russia.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Israelis reportedly believe the best time to bomb Iran is during the U.S. election campaign. According to Newsmax, a sense of inevitable war with Iran seized Israel as its two principal leaders -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak -- concluded that Iran is about to produce a nuclear bomb and is planning to use it to wipe out Israel. Some say they also have concluded that the time for Israel to bomb Iran's nuclear production sites is now (at the height of the U.S. presidential campaign when neither candidate would risk losing by criticizing Israel). Ehud Barak said that he was skeptical the pressures thus far had persuaded Tehran to change intentions about nuclear weapons.

    <title>Jordanians protest and call for an end to peace with Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #94)</title>
    <description>Jordanians protest and call for an end to peace with Israel. According to Israel National News, thousands of Jordanians took to the streets on Friday demanding an end to the country's 18-year-old peace treaty with Israel. According to a report by the DPA news agency, in a series of nationwide protests, demonstrators urged Amman to cut ties with the Jewish State. The protesters burned Israeli flags and chanted &quot;death, death to Israel&quot;. The protests took place in seven cities across the country, and the protesters urged authorities to expel the Israeli ambassador from Amman, chanting &quot;no to a Zionist embassy on our land.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Former Israeli intelligence chief says a nuclear Iran is more dangerous than an Israeli military strike. According to Haaretz, Former Military Intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Amos Yad-lin said that a nuclear Iran would be more dangerous than carrying out a military strike on Iran.  Speaking in respone to a panel discussion at the Washington Institute's 2012 Weinberg Founders Conference in Virginia, Yadlin said Iran has a &quot;sophisticated&quot; strategy to pursue nuclear weapons and added his assessment that this strategy is &quot;unfortunately&quot; working. Yadlin said he favored exhausting all other options before striking Iran's nuclear facilities but stressed that a &quot;nuclear Iran is more dangerous than attacking Iran.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Economic gloom builds for Europe and the United States. According to Reuters, the euro zone economy worsened markedly last month and U.S. employers cut back on hiring, according to two reports that dampened hopes for gradual recovery on either side of the Atlantic. In Europe, the purchasing managers indexes, which primarily cover services, suggested a recession across the continent's currency union could now extend to mid-year and be deeper than previously thought. In the United States, a government report showed employers added a disappointing 115,000 workers to payrolls last month and, critically, many Americans stopped looking for work

    <itunes:summary>Jordanians protest and call for an end to peace with Israel. According to Israel National News, thousands of Jordanians took to the streets on Friday demanding an end to the country's 18-year-old peace treaty with Israel. According to a report by the DPA news agency, in a series of nationwide protests, demonstrators urged Amman to cut ties with the Jewish State. The protesters burned Israeli flags and chanted &quot;death, death to Israel&quot;. The protests took place in seven cities across the country, and the protesters urged authorities to expel the Israeli ambassador from Amman, chanting &quot;no to a Zionist embassy on our land.&quot;

Former Israeli intelligence chief says a nuclear Iran is more dangerous than an Israeli military strike. According to Haaretz, Former Military Intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Amos Yad-lin said that a nuclear Iran would be more dangerous than carrying out a military strike on Iran.  Speaking in respone to a panel discussion at the Washington Institute's 2012 Weinberg Founders Conference in Virginia, Yadlin said Iran has a &quot;sophisticated&quot; strategy to pursue nuclear weapons and added his assessment that this strategy is &quot;unfortunately&quot; working. Yadlin said he favored exhausting all other options before striking Iran's nuclear facilities but stressed that a &quot;nuclear Iran is more dangerous than attacking Iran.&quot;

Economic gloom builds for Europe and the United States. According to Reuters, the euro zone economy worsened markedly last month and U.S. employers cut back on hiring, according to two reports that dampened hopes for gradual recovery on either side of the Atlantic. In Europe, the purchasing managers indexes, which primarily cover services, suggested a recession across the continent's currency union could now extend to mid-year and be deeper than previously thought. In the United States, a government report showed employers added a disappointing 115,000 workers to payrolls last month and, critically, many Americans stopped looking for work

    <title>There may be a plot underway to create a super-powerful EU president (Second Coming Watch Update #93)</title>
    <description>There may be a plot underway to create a super-powerful EU president. According to British newspaper, the Daily Express, a covert group of EU foreign ministers has drawn up plans for merging the jobs currently done by Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, and Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission. The new bureaucrat, who would not be directly elected by voters, is set to get sweeping control over the entire EU and force member countries into even greater political and economic union. Opponents fear the plan could create a modern-day equivalent of the European emperor envisaged by Napoleon Bonaparte or a return to the Holy Roman Empire of Charlemagne that dominated Europe in the Dark Ages. The secret talks were uncovered by Independent Labour peer Lord Stoddart of Swindon. He said, &quot;This is a plot by people who want to abolish nation states and create a United States of Europe.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The British military is preparing for a 9/11-type attack. According to the AFP, British military commanders said they were training to deal with a &quot;9/11-type attack&quot; as they launched a major exercise to test their readiness for the 2012 London Olympics. As jet fighters took to the sky with nine weeks to go to the opening ceremony, the Olympic Park was getting its biggest try-out as the final wave of sporting test events got under way.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
New restrictions placed on churches in Kuwait as insulting Islam becomes a capital offense. According to Persecution.org, Kuwait's 50-member National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to impose the death penalty for blasphemy in an April 12 legal amendment. And in March, the newly formed Justice Bloc pushed legislation to limit Christian churches and non-Muslim places of worship in Kuwait and proposed constitutional amendments to impose Islamic law, or Shariah. If enforced, the amendment will bring Kuwait, whose 350,000 Christians make up 6 percent of the population, into line with Pakistan and neighboring Saudi Arabia. The amendment was condemned by human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which said it was concerned about a rise in criminal prosecutions for blasphemy. The organization said the crackdown could have serious consequences for followers of non-Muslim faiths.

    <title>Russia threatens to carry out preemptive missile defense strike (Second Coming Watch Update #92)</title>
    <description>Russia threatens to carry out preemptive missile defense strike. According to the Associated Press, Russia's top military officer has threatened to carry out a pre-emptive strike on U.S.-led NATO missile defense facilities in Eastern Europe if Washington goes ahead with its controversial plan to build a missile shield. President Dmitry Med-ved-ev said last year that Russia will retaliate militarily if it does not reach an agreement with the United States and NATO on the missile defense system. Chief of General Staff Nik-o-lai Mak-a-rov went even further on Thursday, saying, &quot;a decision to use destructive force pre-emptively will be taken if the situation worsens.&quot;
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Christian leader warns that restraint is ending in Nigeria. According to the Associated Press, a top Christian leader in Nigeria warned that worshippers would abandon their restraint if a campaign of suicide car bombings and gun assaults by a radical Islamist sect doesn't stop. The comments by Ayo O-rit-se-ja-for, the president of an umbrella group known as the Christian Association of Nigeria, come as attacks by the sect known as Boko Haram grow in size and complexity. Speaking to journalists in Nigeria's capital A-bu-ja, O-rit-se-ja-for said his comments should be taken as a &quot;final call&quot; to the government to take action. He said, &quot;The church leadership has hitherto put great restraint on the restive and aggrieved millions of Nigerians, but can no longer guarantee such cooperation if this trend of terror is not halted immediately.&quot;
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Saudi Arabia warns Iran over Gulf islands and Bahrain. According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia reiterated that it would not tolerate threats to the Gulf Arab states' sovereignty. This was the latest warning to Iran after President Ma-moud Ah-ma-din-e-jad's visit to an island claimed by both Tehran and the United Arab Emirates. The warning, the third in as many weeks by a member of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, comes amid increased nervousness in the region over Iran. Shi'ite-led unrest is resurgent in Bahrain a year after the ruling Al Kha-li-fa family brought in Saudi and United Arab Emirates troops to help suppress an uprising seen by Sunni Muslim Gulf rulers as sectarian in nature and driven by Shi'ite giant Iran. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Nayef said &quot;Any harm that comes across any of our countries is harm that touches us all,&quot;

    <title>Iran may accelerate nuclear program if Israel attacks (Second Coming Watch Update #91)</title>
    <description>Iran may accelerate nuclear program if Israel attacks. According to the Jerusalem Post, former IDF Intelligence head Sh-lo-mo Ga-zit said that Iran would possibly accelerate its nuclear weapons program after a future Israeli military strike. Gazit, a senior research fellow at Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies, made the comments in response to a question put to him by the Post over recent views aired by former Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) director Yuval Diskin, who questioned the effectiveness of an Israeli strike. He said he agreed with Diskin that an Israeli attack would not destroy the program, and could even accelerate it, while enabling Iran to legitimize its efforts diplomatically. He added that a US or international strike, by contrast, could certainly lead to the destruction of the Iranian program.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lunar eclipses and solar eclipses to occur on Jewish Holy Days in 2014 and 2015. According to Triumph Prophetic Ministries, it has been discovered that in the years 2014 and 2015 there will be two solar eclipses and four lunar eclipses, all of them occurring on Jewish Holy Days.  The Lunar eclipses will appear on April 15, 2014 and April 4, 2015 which are the days of the Jewish Passover as well as on October 8, 2014 and September 28, 2015 which are the dates for the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles. The two solar eclipses will occur on March 20, 2015 which is the Jewish New Year and September 13, 2015 which is the date of the Feast of Trumpets. J. R. Church, head of the Prophecy in the News Ministry wrote that &quot;Four lunar eclipses occurring on the Feast of Tabernacles and Passover in two successive years are phenomenal.  But add to them two solar eclipses on the two days that open the Jewish year.  On each of these six Jewish Holy Days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give her light.  Will this happen again in the 21st century?  No.  Did it happen in the 20th century?  Yes, in 1949/1950, the year following Israel's statehood, and 1967/1968, the year Jerusalem was liberated in the Six-Day War!&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21: 25: &quot;And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
N. Korea is reportedly 'ready for a third nuclear test'. According to the AFP, a South Korean nuclear expert said  that North Korea has apparently finished preparations for a third nuclear test and is awaiting a political decision to go ahead. The expert also said the communist state is likely to use highly enriched uranium for any test, and may have produced enough of it to make between three and six bombs in addition to its plutonium stockpile. There has been widespread speculation the North will stage a test following its failed launch of a long-range rocket last month.

    <title>U.S. signals major shift on Iran nuclear program (Second Coming Watch Update #90)</title>
    <description>U.S. signals major shift on Iran nuclear program. According to the Los Angeles Times, in what would be a significant concession, Obama administration officials say they could support allowing Iran to maintain a crucial element of its disputed nuclear program if Tehran took other major steps to curb its ability to develop a nuclear bomb. U.S. officials said they might agree to let Iran continue enriching uranium up to 5% purity, which is the upper end of the range for most civilian uses, if its government agrees to the unrestricted inspections, strict oversight and numerous safeguards that the United Nations has long demanded.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Former Israeli Mossad chief says conflict between Israel and Iran is the entire world's problem . According to Haaretz, Former Mossad chief Meir Dagan said that Iran's leadership is using &quot;smart&quot; diplomacy to advance its nuclear program, and that the Iranian threat is not a &quot;quarrel&quot; between Israel and Iran, but an international issue.  Speaking at a conference sponsored by the Jerusalem Post in New York, Dagan described President Ahmadinejad's regime as &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;a master of diplomacy that heads forward consistently to achieve its nuclear objectives.&quot;
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iranian naval exercise follows on Israel's northern border drill. According to DEBKA file, Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak offered the view this week that the next round of Six-Power talks with Iran taking place on May 23 in Baghdad would lead nowhere, throwing cold water on the current optimism. As for US media reports of a lessening in war tensions over Iran because of the internal debate in Israel over an independent attack,  they were soon overtaken by significant military steps embarked on Tuesday, May 1, by the US, Israel and Iran. The large-scale Israel Defense Forces war game on the borders of Syria (Golan) and Lebanon was quickly followed by naval drills along Iran's southern Persian Gulf coast by its border guards. Tehran was making good on the policy agreed with Syrian and Hizballah allies in early 2011 to counter any Western or Israel military movement in the region with a comparable response.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6-7: &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.&quot;

    <title>Arab States hold war games as tensions with Iran mount (Second Coming Watch Update #89)</title>
    <description>Arab States hold war games as tensions with Iran mount. According to Voice of America, Gulf Arab states are beginning two days of joint military exercises, as fears of an armed conflict with Iran continue to grow. The drills, dubbed &quot;Islands of Loyalty,&quot; come amid an escalating territorial dispute between the United Arab Emirates and Iran over three strategic islands in the Persian Gulf. Earlier this month, Iranian President Mah-moud Ah-ma-din-e-jad visited one of the islands, Abu Musa, sparking a war of words between Abu Dhabi and Tehran. The UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said his nation was &quot;fed up&quot; with the Iranians' &quot;occupation&quot; of the land.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Gaza terrorist group, Islamic Jihad, calls for abductions of more Israelis. According to Reuters, Islamic leaders in the Gaza Strip called for militants to kidnap Israelis and use them as bargaining chips to secure the freedom of thousands of Palestinians prisoners held in Israeli jails. Human rights groups say up to 2,000 prisoners have joined an open-ended hunger strike to protest against jail conditions and thousands of Palestinians staged a rally in the Gaza Strip to support their cause.  Khaled Al-Batsh, a senior member of the Islamic Jihad, told the crowd, &quot;We should work hard to get Israeli prisoners in our hands in order to secure the freedom of our prisoners.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Israel's defense minister says as long as Iran is a threat, all options are on the table. According to the Associated Press, Israel's defense minister warned Monday that as long as Iran poses a threat to Israel with its nuclear program, all options are on the table. Ehud Barak was speaking before The Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists covering Israel and the Palestinian territories. Barak said, &quot;I believe it is well understood in Washington, D.C., as well as in Jerusalem that as long as there is an existential threat to our people, all options to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons should remain on the table.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;

    <title>Attack on Christians in Nigeria kills at least 15 (Second Coming Watch Update #88)</title>
    <description>Attack on Christians in Nigeria kills at least 15. According to Reuters, gunmen killed at least 15 people and wounded many more on Sunday in an attack on a university theatre being used by Christian worshippers in Kano, a northern Nigerian city where hundreds have died in Islamist attacks this year. Security sources said gunmen arrived on motorbikes and threw small homemade bombs into the theatre before shooting fleeing worshippers. There was sporadic gunfire in other parts of the city later on from attackers driven from the university by the army, the sources said.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 5:11-12: &quot;Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.&quot;

Iranian lawmaker calls fighter planes in the United Arab Emirates a US-Israeli plot. According to the Associated Press, a prominent Iranian lawmaker says the reported basing of America's most sophisticated stealth jet fighters in the United Arab Emirates is a U.S.-Israel plot to create regional instability. Ka-zem Ja-la-li was reacting to media reports of the recent deployment of F-22 Raptors at the United Arab Emirates's Al Dafra Air Base, which has long hosted U.S. warplanes. The deployment was first reported in the journal Aviation Week, but U.S. and UAE officials have not publicly commented.

Proposed Kansas law would force some churches to host homosexual weddings.

Security sources said gunmen arrived on motorbikes and threw small homemade bombs into the theatre before shooting fleeing worshippers. There was sporadic gunfire in other parts of the city later on from attackers driven from the university by the army, the sources said.

The Bible says in Matthew 5:11-12: &quot;Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.&quot;

Iranian lawmaker calls fighter planes in the United Arab Emirates a US-Israeli plot. According to the Associated Press, a prominent Iranian lawmaker says the reported basing of America's most sophisticated stealth jet fighters in the United Arab Emirates is a U.S.-Israel plot to create regional instability. Ka-zem Ja-la-li was reacting to media reports of the recent deployment of F-22 Raptors at the United Arab Emirates's Al Dafra Air Base, which has long hosted U.S. warplanes. The deployment was first reported in the journal Aviation Week, but U.S. and UAE officials have not publicly commented.

    <title>Iranian naval admiral says Iran can move its Navy within 3 miles of the East Coast (Second Coming Watch Update #87)</title>
    <description>Iranian naval admiral says Iran can move its Navy within 3 miles of the East Coast. According to the Daily Caller, the Islamic Republic of Iran said that it has the ability to position a naval vessel within three miles of the East Coast of the United States. During a speech to the students of the University of Yazd in Iran, Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi said &quot;The power of our naval forces is such that we have a presence in all the waters of the world and, if needed, we can move to within three miles of New York.&quot; This naval saber rattling represents a stark escalation in Iran's war rhetoric, as the West weighs the question of whether to impose new economic sanctions or directly attack the Islamic regime's illicit nuclear facilities.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Saudi Arabian official urges the Gulf States to unite to confront Iran. According to the Associated Press, Saudi Arabia's deputy foreign minister says Gulf Arab states must seek full integration of key affairs such as diplomacy and defense to counter perceived threats including Iran's nuclear ambitions and Arab Spring spillover. Prince Abdul-az-iz bin Ab-dul-lah's comments highlight strong Saudi support for unity efforts among the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. The Western-allied bloc has increasingly discussed closer coordination to battle Arab Spring-inspired opposition and confront regional rival Iran. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
New American stealth fighters are stationed at Iran's back door. According to ABC News, America's most sophisticated stealth jet fighters have been quietly deployed to an allied base less than 200 miles from Iran's mainland. The Air Force, however, adamantly denied the jets' presence is a threat to the Middle East nation.  Multiple stealth F-22 Raptors, which have never been combat-tested, are in hangars at the United Arab Emirates' Al Daf-ra Air Base, just a short hop over the Persian Gulf from Iran's southern border. Air Force spokesperson Lt. Col. John Dorrian stressed that the F-22s were simply taking part in a scheduled deployment and are &quot;not a threat to Iran.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6: &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.&quot;

    <title>A Muslim Brotherhood official says Egypt's peace deal with Israel must be changed (Second Coming Watch Update #86)</title>
    <description>A Muslim Brotherhood official says Egypt's peace deal with Israel must be changed. According to Haaretz, a top Muslim Brotherhood official said Egypt's peace treaty with Israel is not set in stone and is susceptible to change. Cairo has indicated that it would seek to allow more security forces in the Sinai than current agreements with Jerusalem permit. The comment, made by Wa-leed al-Had-dad, a member of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party's Foreign Relations Committee during an official visit to Poland, came amid growing concerns of security in the desert peninsula.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel's army chief says other nations could strike Iran. According to the Associated Press, Israel's military chief said that other countries have readied their armed forces for a potential strike against Iran's nuclear sites to keep Tehran from acquiring atomic weapons. Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz did not specify which nations might be willing to support or take direct action against Iran. Still, his comments were one of the strongest hints yet that Israel may have the backing of other countries to strike the Islamic Republic to prevent it from developing nuclear arms. Gantz told the Associated Press, &quot;The military force is ready. Not only our forces, but other forces as well. We all hope that there will be no necessity to use this force, but we are absolutely sure of its existence.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Specialists say Iran is preparing cyber attacks on U.S. infrastructure. According to the Washington Times, Iran is recruiting a hacker army to target the U.S. power grid, water systems and other vital infrastructure for cyberattack in a future confrontation with the United States. Frank J. Cill-uff-o, director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University said, &quot;Elements of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps have openly sought to pull hackers into the fold&quot; of a religiously motivated cyberarmy.&quot;

    <title>Bombers attack TV center in Christian area of Jos, Nigeria (Second Coming Watch Update #85)</title>
    <description>Bombers attack TV center in Christian area of Jos, Nigeria. According to Compass Direct News, one person was killed and nine others were injured after suspected Islamic extremists attacked a TV viewing center in a Christian area of Jos where a crowd had gathered to watch soccer. Eyewitnesses said that at about 10:15 p.m. at the viewing center, one of many such establishments popular in Nigeria for watching soccer matches, the attackers drove past the site and threw an explosive device at hundreds of Christians watching the match.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

UK slides back into recession in first double dip since the 1970s. According to CNBC, Britain's economy slid into its second recession since the financial crisis after official data unexpectedly showed a fall in output in the first three months of 2012, piling pressure on Prime Minister David Cameron's embattled coalition government. The Office for National Statistics said Britain's gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2012 after contracting by 0.3 percent at the end of 2011, confounding forecasts for 0.1 percent growth. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
London's mayor faces legal action over banning anti-homosexual ads paid for by Christians. According to British newspaper, the Guardian, Boris Johnson is facing legal action after cancelling bus advertisements paid for by evangelical Christian groups stating that homosexuals can be converted from homosexuality. The groups behind the &quot;Not gay … and proud&quot; advertisements, which were pulled by the London mayor earlier this month, said they were likely to seek a judicial review of the mayor's decision on the grounds that it breached their rights to freedom of religion and freedom of expression as guaranteed under the European convention on human rights.

    <title>Some in Iran are preparing for the so-called &quot;Last Six Months&quot; (Second Coming Watch Update #84)</title>
    <description>Some in Iran are preparing for the so-called &quot;Last Six Months&quot;. According to World Net Daily, an arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard published a book nine-years ago titled &quot;The Last Six Months&quot;. Relying on the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, the book described the conditions needed in the six months prior to the reappearance of the Islamic messiah or &quot;mahdi&quot;. Two of the significant signs mentioned in the book were an attack on Syria and then an attack on Iran. Both of those events are looking increasingly likely as Syria's Bashar al-Assad continues to murder his own people and Iran continues its quest for nuclear weapons. Many Iranians also believe that the supreme leader, Ay-a-tol-lah Ali Kha-men-ei, is the historical figure as claimed by Muhammad who will rise up against the infidels and pass the flag of Islam to the last Islamic messiah.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Netanyahu reminds Israel that the Jews have overcome all their enemies. According to the Jerusalem Post, following a two-minute siren honoring those who have fallen in defense of Israel, Netanyahu addressed bereaved families and dignitaries at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem where wreaths are laid for the fallen. The prime minister spoke of Israel's contemporary enemies. He said, &quot;They want to wipe Israel off the map. They will not succeed. We are here in Jerusalem, and will stay in Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jewish nation for generations to come.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Joel 3:19-20: &quot;Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Pakistan test fires nuclear-capable ballistic missile. According to the BBC, military officials said that Pakistan has test fired a nuclear-capable ballistic missile less than a week after India also test-launched a long-range missile. The military said the test of the Shaheen 1-A, an intermediate-range missile capable of reaching targets in India, was successful. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947. They conduct regular missile tests and inform each other in advance.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>North Korea says its nuclear test will be ready &quot;soon&quot; (Second Coming Watch Update #83)</title>
    <description>North Korea says its nuclear test will be ready &quot;soon&quot;. According to Reuters, a senior source with close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing says North Korea has almost completed preparations for a third nuclear test which will draw further international condemnation following a failed rocket launch if it goes ahead. The North appears to be about to carry out a third nuclear test after two in 2006 and 2009. This is the first time a senior official has confirmed the planned test. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran claims it has full control over all operations in the Persian Gulf. According to the Fars News Agency, the Commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Ali Fadavi, stressed that his forces have domination and control over the US Navy ships in the Persian Gulf, and said that the American naval forces need Iran's permission for any move in the regional waters. Fadavi said, &quot;Today, Americans admit and acknowledge that the Persian Gulf is under the tight control of the Iranian Navy. This doesn't mean inspection (of their ships), but controlling (them). That is to say, they have to receive our permission and account to us for any move they want to make.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Mark 13:8: &quot;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hindu radicals are using the law to persecute Christians. According to Asia News, even without anti-conversion laws, ultranationalist Hindus have a legal tool to persecute Christians. Sajan George, president of the Global Council of Indian Christians (GCIC) said the Worship or Prayer Prohibition Ordinance of 2007 empowers the State to prohibit propagation of other religions in particular places of worship or prayer than the religion traditionally practiced there. Recently, a group of activists used this law to demand the arrest of Rev. Ahron, a Pentecostal pastor accused of trying to convert Hindus near the Hindu temple in the city of Dhar-ma-pu-ri. The GCIC president stated that these ordinances &quot;violate rights protected by the Indian constitution&quot; and is calling on the government to have them changed.

    <title>Palestine says they are one step away from pursuing statehood with international bodies (Second Coming Watch Update #82)</title>
    <description>Palestine says they are one step away from pursuing statehood with international bodies. According to the Jerusalem Post, the Palestinian Authority is one step away from approaching international organizations unilaterally, should Israel fail to respond positively to a letter sent by President Mahmoud Abbas to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Foreign Affairs Minister Ri-ad al-Mal-ki said that the Palestinians will seek consultation from other Arab nations before deciding the next step towards achieving an independent Palestinian state.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
US unveils new sanctions against Iran and Syria. According to the AFP, US President Barack Obama ordered new sanctions on Syria and Iran and the &quot;digital guns for hire&quot; who help them oppress their people with surveillance software and monitoring technology. At a speech at the US Holocaust Museum, Obama announced additions to the pile of US sanctions already faced by the two governments as part of a wider effort to crack down on human rights abuses, atrocities and genocide. The measures will hit the two governments but also companies that help create systems that track or monitor their people for killing, torture or other abuses and prevent individuals involved from entering the United States.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christians in India stopped from building new church. According to Christian Today, Christians in a village in India have been prevented from building a new church on recently purchased land. Pastor Say-am Chan-dran, who is supported by Gospel for Asia, bought the land in order to build a larger church to house his growing congregation. His current church in the village, both of which cannot be named for security reasons, has room for up to 90 people during service time. Gospel for Asia said that anti-Christian residents in the village had stopped the construction of the church from going ahead.

    <title>Russia warns that Syria is on the brink of civil war (Second Coming Watch Update #81)</title>
    <description>Russia warns that Syria is on the brink of civil war. According to the Russian Information Agency, the country's foreign ministry has said that Syria faces a catastrophic civil war if both sides in the crisis fail to take advantage of the current ceasefire. The statement on its website read, &quot;A very important event in the developments in the country has come about. The issue in Syria now is the choice between a transition towards peaceful, nationwide talks or a descent into civil war.&quot; UN envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan for Syria stipulated the start of a ceasefire April 12 in a bid to stop the violence that has so far claimed around 9,000 lives.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
China and Russia are holding navy exercises. According to the AFP, China and Russia launched their first joint naval exercises Sunday, with war games in the Yellow Sea that come amid tensions between China and its Asian neighbours over territorial claims. The six days of drills -- the first dedicated exercises involving navies of the two countries -- are taking place off China's east coast. Although China has said the military exercises are designed to improve regional stability, they come at a time when Beijing is boosting military spending and more forcefully stating its case in territorial disputes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iranian Christian given a six year prison term. According to Mohabat News, Far-shid Fa-thi, a Christian prisoner who had been held in the notorious Evin prison for 15 months without being granted any leave permission, has been sentenced to 6 years in prison by a Revolutionary Court in Iran. Although the details of his court session have not been published, a knowledgeable source said the issued verdict announced his accusations as, &quot;action against the regime's security, being in contact with foreign organizations and religious propaganda&quot;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in 1 Thessalonians 3:4: &quot;For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.&quot;

If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Israeli Forces Are 'Ready to Hit Iran if Ordered' (Second Coming Watch Update #80)</title>
    <description>Israeli forces are 'ready to hit Iran if ordered'. According to the AFP, Israeli forces are carrying out more special operations beyond the country's borders and will be ready to attack Iran's nuclear sites if ordered. In an extract from an interview with the top-selling Ye-di-ot Ah-ar-an-ot newspaper, Lieutenant General Benny Gantz said that 2012 would be a critical year in efforts to halt what Israel and much of the international community believe is an Iranian nuclear arms programme. He said, &quot;We think that a nuclear Iran is a very bad thing, which the world needs to stop and which Israel needs to stop -- and we are planning accordingly.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Muslim mob burned a Catholic church in the Sudanese capital. According to the Associated Press, a Muslim mob set ablaze a Catholic church frequented by Southern Sudanese in the capital city of Khartoum.  The church was built on a disputed plot of land, but the Saturday night incident appeared to be part of the fallout from ongoing hostilities between Sudan and South Sudan over control of an oil town on their ill-defined border. Sudan and South Sudan have been drawing closer to a full-scale war in recent months over the unresolved issues of sharing oil revenues and the disputed border.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
China's military warns of confrontation over seas. According to Reuters, China's military warned the United States that U.S.-Philippine military exercises have raised risks of armed confrontation over the disputed South China Sea in the toughest high-level warning yet after weeks of tensions. China's official Liberation Army Daily warned that recent jostling with the Philippines over disputed seas where both countries have sent ships could boil over into outright conflict, and laid much of the blame at Washington's door. This week American and Filipino troops launched a fortnight of annual naval drills amid the stand-off between Beijing and Manila. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6-8: &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.&quot;

    <title>European Union ministers ponder the creation of an EU 'super-president' (Second Coming Watch Update #79)</title>
    <description>European Union ministers ponder the creation of an EU 'super-president'. According to the EU Observer, one idea under consideration by a reflection group of select EU foreign ministers is the merging of the roles of the EU Council and European Commission presidents. A senior EU source stated that the new 'super-president' would have more power than either Herman Van Rompuy (current president of the European Council) or Jose Manuel Barroso (current president of the European Commission) do today but also more &quot;democratic legitimacy&quot; because he or she would be elected by members of the European parliament.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Countries debate the formation of a global parliament. According to the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly Campaign, the creation of a global parliament was a hotly debated issue at an expert panel that occurred this week as a side event of the Lund Earth System Governance conference in Sweden. While there was agreement that strengthening global democracy was desirable, the participants in the discussion had divided opinions as to whether the creation of a global parliament was the right approach. The international conference brought together over two hundred researchers from 30 countries and various disciplines to explore ways in which a more legitimate, democratic and accountable earth system governance might be achieved.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A world ruled by one central government is one of the key elements of the end times. The Bible says of the Antichrist in Revelation 13:7 that &quot;power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Norwegian church is banned from using a public market stall after distributing leaflet criticizing Islam. According to the Norwich Evening News, the Norwich Reformed Church held a weekly outreach bookstall from a Norwich City Council-owned site, but has been informed it is no longer allowed to use the stall after the council received a complaint about literature on it. The complaint prompted a review of the materials produced by Reverend Alan Clifford, pastor of the church, and the council contacted police as materials, particularly the leaflet entitled &quot;Why not Islam&quot;, were considered to be hate-motivated.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6: &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.&quot;

    <title>Israel is developing new weapons for a future war (Second Coming Watch #78)</title>
    <description>Israel is developing new weapons for a future war. According to United Press International, amid a flurry of warnings that Lebanon and Hezbollah will be hammered in any new conflict, the Israeli military unveiled a new 120mm tank shell said to be able to penetrate reinforced targets, including in populated areas. The Jerusalem Post reported that &quot;Such a capability is believed to be crucial for the army as it faces future conflicts with Hezbollah and Hamas, both terrorist groups which embed themselves within civilian infrastructure.&quot; Israel is also putting a much greater emphasis on cyberwarfare, not just for conventional enemies like Iran and Syria but for irregular forces like Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and others.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran is preparing for action against the United Arab Emirates. According to the Associated Press, Iran's ground forces commander warned that should diplomacy fail, the military is ready for action over a disputed Gulf island controlled by Iran but also claimed by the United Arab Emirates. Gen. Pour-das-tan said Iranian forces are capable of confronting any offender against Iran's sovereignty over the strategic Abu Musa island in the Persian Gulf.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
N. Korea threatens war as S. Korea unveils new missile. According to the Associated Press, North Korea demanded Thursday that South Korea apologise for what it called insults during major anniversary festivities, or face a &quot;sacred war&quot;, as Seoul unveiled a new missile to deter its neighbour. South Korea announced Thursday it has deployed new cruise missiles capable of destroying targets such as missile and nuclear bases anywhere in the North.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran is preparing for action against the United Arab Emirates. According to the Associated Press, Iran's ground forces commander warned that should diplomacy fail, the military is ready for action over a disputed Gulf island controlled by Iran but also claimed by the United Arab Emirates. Gen. Pour-das-tan said Iranian forces are capable of confronting any offender against Iran's sovereignty over the strategic Abu Musa island in the Persian Gulf.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
N. Korea threatens war as S. Korea unveils new missile. According to the Associated Press, North Korea demanded Thursday that South Korea apologise for what it called insults during major anniversary festivities, or face a &quot;sacred war&quot;, as Seoul unveiled a new missile to deter its neighbour. South Korea announced Thursday it has deployed new cruise missiles capable of destroying targets such as missile and nuclear bases anywhere in the North.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6: &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.&quot;

    <title>Christians in Turkey experience increased persecution (Second Coming Watch #77)</title>
    <description>Christians in Turkey experience increased persecution. According to CBN News, the Protestant churches of Turkey documented 12 attacks in 2011. This included the beating of Christians for sharing their faith with Muslims. No one has been prosecuted for any of these crimes, putting Turkey on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom's list of &quot;countries of particular concern&quot; for the first time. Nina Shea, one of the commissioners supporting that move, said the Turkish government is suppressing Christian worship, and as a result Christian numbers are dwindling.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 5:10: &quot;Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

India will test a new long-range missile that can reach Beijing. According to the AFP, India hopes this week to join a select group of countries with intercontinental missiles by holding the first test flight of a new long-range nuclear-capable rocket. The Defence Research and Development Organisation said it plans the maiden launch of the Agni-V missile, which has a range of more than 3,100 miles, between Wednesday and Friday. Though China is considered India's chief rival, a spokesman said the weapons system was not developed to threaten any particular country.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ahmadinejad says any country which strikes Iran will be destroyed. According to Haaretz, President Mah-moud Ah-ma-din-e-jad said Iran's armed forces will make its enemies regret any act of aggression against the Islamic Republic. He spoke as the country marked National Army Day with a military parade near the capital Tehran. Although Ah-ma-din-e-jad did not specify any countries, such language used by Iranian officials is a common reference to the West, especially the United States and Israel.

    <title>UN Warns N. Korea on Nuclear Test (Second Coming Watch #76)</title>
    <description>UN warns N. Korea on nuclear test. According to Reuters, the U.N. Security Council strongly condemned North Korea's rocket launch, urged tightening of existing U.N. sanctions and warned Pyongyang of further consequences if it carries out another missile launch or nuclear test. China, a permanent veto-wielding council member and North Korea's protector on the 15-nation panel, backed the council's &quot;presidential statement,&quot; which was adopted unanimously. The council declaration that North Korea &quot;abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Vietnam sentences pastor to 11 years imprisonment. According to Bos News Life, despite international condemnation a Mennonite pastor remained behind bars after a Vietnamese court sentenced him to 11 years imprisonment for allegedly creating division between the Communist government and its people. State controlled media claimed that Ngu-yen Cong Chinh had been writing and spreading materials that slandered authorities, communicated with &quot;reactionary groups&quot; and incited ethnic minorities to commit wrongdoing.  Human Rights Watch and other rights groups have linked the sentence to the pastor's Christian activities and his fight for religious freedom.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Head of Israeli military says country can handle all of its enemies. According to Ynet News, IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz said the Holocaust &quot;was the darkest period in the history of mankind and Judaism. But we mustn't forget that even before (the Holocaust) and after it there were those who sought to erase Jacob's descendents from the face of the planet.&quot; Speaking at Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial ahead of Holocaust Remembrance Day, Gantz stressed that &quot;today the situation is completely different. We are facing these threats with an army that can handle everything.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
The Bible says in Isaiah 62:6-7: &quot;I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,  And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.&quot;

    <title>Japanese bank to implement technology that will allow people to scan their hand in order to get cash (Second Coming Watch #75)</title>
    <description>A Japanese bank will implement technology that will allow people to scan their hand in order to get cash. According to Discovery News, a Japanese bank announced it will be installing about a dozen automated teller machines that can read customers' palms to identify them. O-ga-ki Kyor-it-su Bank will be the country's first to introduce the system. First, customers will register their biometric information at a branch. Then they will be able to go to one of the new ATMs and get cash simply by scanning a hand, typing in their birthdate and a four-digit PIN.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
The Bible says in Revelation 13:16-17 that the Antichrist will cause &quot;all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Iran claims nuclear dispute can be solved 'quickly'. According to the Associated Press, Iran is ready to resolve all of its nuclear disputes &quot;quickly and easily&quot; in a second round of talks with world powers planned for next month in Baghdad. The country's foreign minister, Ali Ak-bar Sa-le-hi was quoted by the semiofficial ISNA news agency as saying that Iran might be more flexible if it could be guaranteed an external supply of enriched uranium -- an apparent endorsement of a U.S. compromise proposal.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
The U.S. says it will veto any Palestinian statehood bid at the UN. According to the Jerusalem Post, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro, said on Monday that the United States will continue to act against Palestinian attempts to gain recognition through the United Nations, and if necessary will use its veto to that end. Speaking at the Netanya Academic College, Shapiro said that there are no shortcuts to peace in the Middle East, and the Palestinians must return to direct negotiations with Israel without preconditions, on the basis of what was outlined by President Barack Obama.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Iran claims nuclear dispute can be solved 'quickly'. According to the Associated Press, Iran is ready to resolve all of its nuclear disputes &quot;quickly and easily&quot; in a second round of talks with world powers planned for next month in Baghdad. The country's foreign minister, Ali Ak-bar Sa-le-hi was quoted by the semiofficial ISNA news agency as saying that Iran might be more flexible if it could be guaranteed an external supply of enriched uranium -- an apparent endorsement of a U.S. compromise proposal.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
The U.S. says it will veto any Palestinian statehood bid at the UN. According to the Jerusalem Post, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro, said on Monday that the United States will continue to act against Palestinian attempts to gain recognition through the United Nations, and if necessary will use its veto to that end. Speaking at the Netanya Academic College, Shapiro said that there are no shortcuts to peace in the Middle East, and the Palestinians must return to direct negotiations with Israel without preconditions, on the basis of what was outlined by President Barack Obama.

    <title>Islamic Terror Group Wants Somalia Rid of Christians (Second Coming Watch #74)</title>
    <description>Islamic Terror Group Wants Somalia Rid of Christians. According to CBN, Somalia's Islamist terror group al-Shabab wants to rid the Muslim country of all Christians and is specifically targeting Christian converts from Islam. Al Shabab recently joined with al Qaeda and wants Sharia law implemented in the country. Somali Christian leaders estimate fewer than 200 Christians exist in this country of 10 million. Secret believers often suffer punishment and humiliation for refusing to conform to Islamic law.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:9: &quot;Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel moves to thwart pro-Palestinian &quot;fly-in&quot;. According to Reuters, more than 40 pro-Palestinian activists reached Tel Aviv's international airport on Sunday as part of an attempted &quot;fly-in&quot; only to be detained as Israel denied them entry and scrambled to stop other campaigners boarding flights in Europe. Israel's decision to distribute &quot;no-fly&quot; lists to European carriers and deploy of hundreds of police at Ben Gurion airport underlined its deep concern over international campaigns against its treatment of the Palestinians.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Egypt's military may have put a stop to an Islamist takeover. According to CNN, Ten of the 23 nominees running for president in Egypt -- including Muslim Brotherhood candidate Khai-rat el-Sha-ter and former Vice President Omar Su-lei-man -- have been disqualified and cannot run for the nation's top job. Ha-tem Ba-ga-to, the head of Egypt's executive election committee, said that el-Shater and Ay-man Nour, the head of the Al Ghad party, were disqualified for issues surrounding their unresolved pardons for time in prison. If the disqualifications stand, this would leave only moderates in the race for Egypt's presidency.

    <title>Tornadoes pound the midwestern United States leaving at least five dead (Second Coming Watch #73)</title>
    <description>Tornadoes pound the midwestern United States leaving at least five dead. According to Reuters, dozens of tornadoes tore through parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa overnight and one twister killed at least five people early on Sunday as storm sirens failed to sound in an Oklahoma town and caught people unaware. Storms skipped across what is often called &quot;Tornado Alley&quot; in the U.S. Central and Southern Plains and more were forecast. But casualties appeared limited because many of the twisters hit sparsely populated areas, and during daylight hours or evening when people were still awake.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran and world powers agree to keep talking. According to Reuters, after a year of sanctions and sabre-rattling over Iran's nuclear programme, negotiators from Tehran and six world powers finally resumed talks and found at least enough common ground to agree to meet again next month. With threats of war hanging over an already unsettled Middle East, U.S. and other Western diplomats welcomed an Iranian willingness in Istanbul on Saturday to discuss their nuclear activities -- something they had refused since early last year.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Strong earthquake hits western Indonesia. According to the Associated Press, officials say a strong earthquake measuring magnitude 6.2 has struck off the coast of western Indonesia but there is no danger of a tsunami. The U.S. Geological Survey says Sunday's quake was centred about 400 miles southwest of Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh province, at a depth of 9 miles. Indonesian meteorological officials says there is no threat of a tsunami. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Mark 13:8: &quot;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.&quot;

    <title>High-stakes nuclear talks between Iran and world powers are set to start today (Second Coming Watch #72)</title>
    <description>High-stakes nuclear talks between Iran and world powers are set to start today. According to Reuters, Iran and six world powers prepared on Friday for rare talks aimed at easing fears that a deepening dispute over the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme could plunge the Middle East into a new war. Senior officials from Iran and the big powers arrived in Istanbul ahead of Saturday's bid to restart stalled diplomacy after months of soaring tension and persistent speculation that Israel might bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The meeting is widely seen as a chance for the countries involved to halt a downward diplomatic spiral and to seek ways out of years of deadlock. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Ring of Fire is growing more active which could mean more earthquakes for the West Coast. According to  CBS News, four large earthquakes struck around the Pacific Rim this week with one setting a record as the most powerful strike-slip quake ever recorded. Geologists have nicknamed the Pacific Rim the &quot;ring of fire&quot; because of frequent volcanic and seismic activity. The rash of earthquakes sent shock waves of concern across the globe. Scientists said that the seismic activity was unusual and that the two quakes in Indonesia were on strike-slip faults which are the same type of faults located in California. Though the quakes did not do serious damage, experts said that it was a reminder to always be prepared.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Drought expands throughout the United States. According to USA Today, the nation is enduring more unusually parched weather as it is still reeling from a devastating drought that led to at least $10 billion in agricultural losses across Texas and the South in 2011. A mostly dry, mild winter has put nearly 61% of the lower 48 states in &quot;abnormally dry&quot; or drought conditions according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Only two states -- Ohio and Alaska -- are entirely free of abnormally dry or drought conditions.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Mark 13:8: &quot;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.&quot;

    <title>Embarrassed by failed rocket crash, North Korea may try a nuclear test (Second Coming Watch #71)</title>
    <description>Embarrassed by failed rocket crash, North Korea may try a nuclear test. According to Reuters, North Korea said its much hyped long-range rocket launch failed on Friday, in a very rare and embarrassing public admission of failure by the hermit state and a blow for its new young leader who faces international outrage over the attempt. The isolated North is now widely expected to press ahead with its third nuclear test to show its military strength. A senior South Korean defense ministry official said &quot;The possibility of an additional long-range rocket launch or a nuclear test, as well as a military provocation to strengthen internal solidarity is very high.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Thousands of homes are flooded across Russia. According to the Russian International News Agency, spring floods have submerged 2,477 homes in Russia, up from 903 in the past 24 hours. A total of 5,223 residents have been affected and over 1,000 people, including 150 children, had to be evacuated.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Iran vows to never retreat on atomic development. According to the AFP, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Thursday that Iran &quot;will not retreat an iota&quot; from its nuclear rights. He said, &quot;The Iranian nation is standing firm on its fundamental rights and under the harshest pressure will not retreat an iota from its undeniable right. On behalf of the Iranian nation, I advise the enemies and the arrogance (the United States) to change their behaviour towards our nation, and they should know that the Iranians are standing firm in defending their rights.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
The Bible says in Mark 13:7: &quot;And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;You can read these stories in-depth and get more prophecy-related news at www.secondcomingherald.com.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Indonesia church members forced to worship in secret (Second Coming Watch #70)</title>
    <description>Indonesia church members forced to worship in secret. According to the Jakarta Globe, After years of holding Sunday services on the roadside in front of its sealed church, amid intimidation by hard-line Islamic groups, the congregation of the Yasmin GKI church in Bogor celebrated Easter mass at the home of one of its members. A Yasmin spokesman said, &quot;We are constantly having to change our location because our existence appears to be unwanted, and we have to hide so that we are not intimidated by intolerant groups. Before that, we had hoped for help from the police, but after the many attacks on members of the congregation, we see that the police are also involved in this.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Indonesia church members forced to worship in secret. According to the Associated Press, Iran's official Press TV said the country has halted oil exports to Germany, a day after Tehran stopped crude exports to Spain and Greece, in an apparent move to strengthen its position ahead of crucial talks with world powers later this week. Iran's official Press TV also reported on Wednesday that the country plans to ban imports from 100 European companies as part of Tehran's pre-emptive retaliation against the EU embargo which foes into effect this July.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Rising World Food Prices Spark Fears Of Unrest. According to the Financial Post, global food prices rose in March for a third straight month with more hikes to come. The UN's food agency said on Thursday that this will add to fears of hunger and a new wave of social unrest in poor countries. Record high prices for staple foods last year were one of the main factors that contributed to the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as bread riots in other parts of the world. The cost of food has risen again this year after coming down from a February 2011 record peak.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
The Bible speaks of food shortages in the end times in Revelation 6:5-6 which reads: &quot;And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.&quot;

    <title>Syrian opposition says 1,000 people have been killed in the last 8 days (Second Coming Watch #69)</title>
    <description>Syrian opposition says 1,000 people have been killed in the last 8 days. According to the Associated Press, Syria's main opposition group says 1,000 people have been killed by government forces in the last eight days. A spokeswoman for the Syrian National Council says troops loyal to President Bashar Assad have intensified their onslaught in opposition areas despite saying it would accept a U.N. peace plan. Bass-ma Kod-man-i says 160 people were killed in Syria on Monday alone.
&lt;Br/ &gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
National Debt Matches Entire Yearly Economic Output. According to many analysts, the United States now faces a debt as big as the nation's entire economic output for a year. That means it would take every American dollar produced in an entire year to just barely pay off the current debt. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said, &quot;The consequences are grave moving forward because not only is the debt high, but according to the Congressional Budget Office and all the experts who are looking at it, there's no plan in place to change that any time in the near future.&quot; A recent report from the Senate Republican Budget Committee states that by 2019, under President Barack Obama's budget the government will be spending more money to pay down interest on the national debt than it will be spending on national defense.
&lt;Br/ &gt;&lt;Br /&gt;
Ahmadinejad claims Iran can survive a 2-3 year oil blockade. According to Reuters,  Iranian media quoted President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying that Iran has enough funds to withstand a total embargo on its oil sales for two to three years. His words came days before the resumption of talks with world powers on Tehran's nuclear programme. The European Union is set to impose a total embargo on Iranian crude oil from July following similar measures imposed by the United States to try to force Iran to abandon uranium enrichment.

    <title>Israeli Opposition Leader Shaul Mofaz says Iran's 'nuclear program must be stopped completely' (Second Coming Watch #68)</title>
    <description>Israeli Opposition Leader Sha-ul Mo-faz says Iran's 'nuclear program must be stopped completely'. According to the Jerusalem Post, opposition leader Shaul Mofaz told the visiting Italian prime minister that the international community must work towards stopping Iran's nuclear program completely, and said anyone who believes Iran is pursuing a peaceful nuclear program is &quot;deluding himself.&quot; He made the comments days before nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers were set to commence.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
US Navy deploys 2nd aircraft carrier to Persian Gulf amid Iran tensions. According to the Associated Press, The U.S. Navy says it has deployed a second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf amid rising tensions with Iran over its nuclear program. Commander Amy Derrick-Frost of the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said that the deployment of the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise alongside the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group marks only the fourth time in the past decade that the Navy has had two aircraft carriers operating at the same time in the region. The two carriers will support the American military operations in Afghanistan and anti-piracy efforts off Somalia's coast and in the Gulf of Aden.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lao Officials Confiscate Church Building and Warn Of Future Church Closings. According to Compass Direct News and advocacy group Human Rights Watch for Lao Religious Freedom, Lao officials confiscated and sealed a church building in southern Laos after holding a two-day seminar warning against religious belief. Besides sealing the church building in Kham-non-sung village, they also warned that other unrecognized churches in the district would soon be shut down. There are a total of 30 church buildings scattered throughout the province, but only seven are approved by the government.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 12:10: &quot;Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.&quot;

&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>North Korea Threatens 'Merciless Punishment' as it Prepares Rocket for Launch (Second Coming Watch #67)</title>
    <description>North Korea threatens 'merciless punishment' as it prepares rocket for launch. According to British newspaper, the Telegraph, North Korea has threatened retaliation and &quot;merciless punishment&quot; against any country that shoots down the long-range rocket it is preparing to launch this coming week. Japan and South Korea have put their armed forces on standby in response to North Korea's plans, prepared to shoot down the missile if it passes over their territory.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Doomsday shelters are being built in Kansas. According to the Associated Press, tucked deep beneath the Kansas prairie, luxury condos that can withstand an atomic blast are being built into the shaft of an abandoned missile silo to service anxious -- and wealthy -- people preparing for doomsday. So far, four buyers have plopped down a total of about $7 million for havens to flee to when disaster happens or the end is nigh. Developer Larry Hall says the buyers &quot;worry about events ranging from solar flares, to economic collapse, to pandemics to terrorism to food shortages.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In Matthew 24:21-22, Jesus Christ said that in the last days, there &quot;shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel accepts diplomatic focus on curbing Iran's purer atomic fuel. According to Reuters, Israel has signaled it would accept, as a first priority, world powers focusing on persuading Iran to stop higher-level uranium enrichment when they resume stalled nuclear negotiations this week with Tehran. Israel, which has threatened last-resort attacks on its arch-foe's nuclear facilities if diplomacy fails, demanded last month that any negotiated resolution should end all uranium enrichment, high and low level, and remove all fuel already stockpiled by Iran.

    <title>Iranian Lawmaker say Iran Can Produce nuclear Weapons (Second Coming Watch #66)</title>
    <description>Iranian lawmaker say Iran can produce nuclear weapons. According to the Associated Press, a prominent Iranian lawmaker says Iran has the knowledge and scientific capability to produce nuclear weapons but will never do so. Ghol-am-re-za Mogh-a-dam says Iran can easily produce the highly enriched uranium that is used to build atomic bombs but it is not Tehran's policy to go that route.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israeli Defense Minister says Iran must open nuclear facilities to IAEA. According to the Jerusalem Post, Ehud Barak said on Sunday that Iran must open all of its nuclear facilities to the IAEA, and disclose its entire history of activity related to the allegation of developing a nuclear weapon. Barak added this new stipulation to previous conditions he laid out last week, which he reiterated in light of a New York Times report that laid out the United States' list of demands for Iran over its nuclear program.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
U.S. and UK warn citizens in Nigeria about possible Easter attacks from Boko Haram. According to the Washington Post, Nigeria is facing a &quot;high risk&quot; of a terrorist attack over the Easter holiday. The United Kingdom warned its citizens and the U.S. issued a similar warning to those living in the West African nation that sees near-daily attacks by a radical Islamist sect. The U.K. Foreign Office and the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria's capital Abuja issued the updated travel warnings, noting that Boko Haram carried out attacks on Christmas Day. A car bombing at a Catholic church outside of Abuja that day killed at least 44 people.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in I Peter 4:12-13: &quot;Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.&quot;

    <title>Israeli Defense Forces have Recently 'Thwarted 10 Terror Plots from Sinai' (Second Coming Watch #65)</title>
    <description>Israeli Defense Forces have recently 'thwarted 10 terror plots from Sinai'. According to the Jerusalem Post, head of Israeli Military Intelligence Maj.-Gen. Aviv Ko-cha-vi revealed that the IDF has thwarted 10 different terrorist plots to attack Israel from the Sinai Peninsula in the past two months. Speaking at a graduation ceremony for new Military Intelligence officers, Kochavi said that the firing of a Kat-yu-sha rocket into Eilat from the Sinai late Wednesday night was a demonstration of the changes that are sweeping through the Middle East. Kochavi said that &quot;as a result, we will need to prepare for new challenges and fronts, for an increase in the threats and for more instability throughout the region in the coming years.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gaza militants vow to continue 'struggle' as Israel seals borders for the Passover. According to the Associated Press, a Palestinian militant leader said that his group's &quot;struggle&quot; against Israel will continue despite a cease-fire that stopped an exchange of fire between the Gaza Strip and Israel last month. The statement by Sheik Na-fez Az-zam of Islamic Jihad at a Gaza rally came as Israel vowed to strike against the yet-unidentified militants who launched a rocket into the southern Israeli town of Eilat. Gaza regularly sees days- or weeks-long outbreaks of violence, in which rockets are fired into Israel and airstrikes launched at militant targets in the territory, followed by months-long cease-fires.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Joel 3:16, &quot;The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
American heartland being ripped apart by gigantic, powerful tornadoes. According to the Michael T.

    <itunes:summary>Israeli Defense Forces have recently 'thwarted 10 terror plots from Sinai'. According to the Jerusalem Post, head of Israeli Military Intelligence Maj.-Gen. Aviv Ko-cha-vi revealed that the IDF has thwarted 10 different terrorist plots to attack Israel from the Sinai Peninsula in the past two months. Speaking at a graduation ceremony for new Military Intelligence officers, Kochavi said that the firing of a Kat-yu-sha rocket into Eilat from the Sinai late Wednesday night was a demonstration of the changes that are sweeping through the Middle East. Kochavi said that &quot;as a result, we will need to prepare for new challenges and fronts, for an increase in the threats and for more instability throughout the region in the coming years.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gaza militants vow to continue 'struggle' as Israel seals borders for the Passover. According to the Associated Press, a Palestinian militant leader said that his group's &quot;struggle&quot; against Israel will continue despite a cease-fire that stopped an exchange of fire between the Gaza Strip and Israel last month. The statement by Sheik Na-fez Az-zam of Islamic Jihad at a Gaza rally came as Israel vowed to strike against the yet-unidentified militants who launched a rocket into the southern Israeli town of Eilat. Gaza regularly sees days- or weeks-long outbreaks of violence, in which rockets are fired into Israel and airstrikes launched at militant targets in the territory, followed by months-long cease-fires.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Joel 3:16, &quot;The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.&quot;

    <title>Authorities are Checking 'Al-Qaeda' Threats in New York and Berlin (Second Coming Watch #64)</title>
    <description>Authorities are Checking 'Al-Qaeda' Threats in New York and Berlin. According to Israel National News, authorities in New York and Berlin are investigating threats made on websites associated with Islamist radicals promising to conduct attacks in both cities. Officials in New York said that it was possible that the threats were genuine, although they were also investigating the possibility that the threats were a prank. Meanwhile, In Berlin, officials said that the threats probably did emanate from Al-Qaeda associated groups, who are demanding the release of a terrorist being held in a German prison.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Netanyahu speaks on rocket fired from Egypt. According to the Jerusalem Post, Netanyahu vowed to strike at those who attack Israel and said the Jewish state can never stop fighting terrorism. He also stated that the Sinai had become a 'terror zone' which is something that Israel is &quot;dealing with.&quot; Meanwhile, Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Israeli Defense Forces were &quot;studying the incident and will strike the people who fired on Eilat and attempted to harm Israeli citizens. There will be no compromises.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Zechariah 2:8, &quot;For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nigeria is on alert for Potential Easter Attacks. According to the Daily Star, Nigerian authorities have boosted security for this weekend's Easter commemorations, fearing extremists will use the Christian holiday to carry out further attacks.

Boko Haram has previously targeted Christians in attacks, including a Christmas bombing at a church outside the capital which killed at least 44 people.

    <title>Iran Ducks Away from Nuclear Talks as Moscow says the Mid East is at a Boiling Point (Second Coming Watch #63)</title>
    <description>Iran ducks away from nuclear talks as Moscow says the Mid East is at a boiling point. According to DEBKAfile, Iranian spokesmen are maneuvering for a postponement of the nuclear negotiations with world powers set to take place on April 13-14 in Istanbul. It is feared in Washington and Jerusalem that Tehran is working toward two goals: To have the venue removed from Istanbul and to buy a couple more months before the diplomatic crunch, considering that the US and Israel are treating the April talks as the last chance for diplomacy to reverse Iran's drive for a nuclear weapon. A postponement would therefore delay any military option that Israel or possibly America would choose to exercise.

Floods in Fiji leave thousands homeless. According to the AFP, flooding and landslides in the South Pacific nation of Fiji killed seven people and left thousands homeless on Viti Levu, the country's largest island. More than 3,500 people were forced to flee their homes last week to 74 makeshift evacuation centres established in schools, military bases and government buildings. Water levels reached between four and six feet in the western city of Nadi, a popular tourist destination, and along parts the island's north coast. The northern towns of Tavua and Ba were reportedly the hardest hit.

Muslim extremists attack Christian revival meeting in Kenya. According to Compass Direct News,  Kenyan Internal Security Minister George Sai-to-ti said Islamic extremists from the rebel al-Shabaab militia in Somalia were suspected of carrying out the deadly blast, although the group has not claimed responsibility. The government, which began military operations against al-Shabaab in Somalia last October, today issued a warning of a possible attack by al-Shabaab during Easter celebrations in Kenya this weekend.

    <title>Russian Warships Launch Drill From Tartus versus US-Israeli-Greek Naval Exercise (Second Coming Watch #62)</title>
    <description>Russian Warships Launch Drill From Tartus versus US-Israeli-Greek Naval Exercise. According to DEBKAfile, not 24 hours after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that a pre-emptive strike against Iran would violate international law, Moscow put muscle into its warning. A Russian guided missile destroyer arrived in the Syrian port of Tartus from its Black Sea base for a naval exercise. The warship's support group is on the way. Israeli warships and air force jets may therefore find themselves not just operating alongside US naval vessels and aircraft but confronted suddenly by one of the largest destroyers in the Russian fleet, whose decks are the launching base for anti-air, anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles.

Typhoon-strength storm kills two in Japan, and brings chaos to travel routes. According to the AFP, a typhoon-strength storm brought travel chaos to Japan on Tuesday, as violent winds and rain killed at least two people and left tens of thousands of people stranded. Gusts of up to 93 miles per hour have been recorded in western Japan, with coastal areas likely seeing even stronger winds. At least 163 people suffered injuries across the country, knocked over by sudden gusts or hit by flying debris.

Minneapolis bans man from passing out Bibles during homosexual event. According to World Net Daily, for over a decade, Brian Johnson has peacefully passed out Bibles during Minneapolis' Twin Cities Pride Festival, but if he tries it again this year, he fears he could be arrested. Through some clever legal wrangling, the organizers of the annual festival celebrating homosexuality, have convinced the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board to allow them to exile anyone attempting to distribute Bibles or communicate unapproved messages at the event to a &quot;no pride zone&quot; far away from the festivities. Now Johnson is filing a federal lawsuit against the Board, claiming it can't banish First Amendment free speech rights to a 10′ x 10′ square off the beaten path, especially during a major public event.

Israeli warships and air force jets may therefore find themselves not just operating alongside US naval vessels and aircraft but confronted suddenly by one of the largest destroyers in the Russian fleet, whose decks are the launching base for anti-air, anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles.

Typhoon-strength storm kills two in Japan, and brings chaos to travel routes. According to the AFP, a typhoon-strength storm brought travel chaos to Japan on Tuesday, as violent winds and rain killed at least two people and left tens of thousands of people stranded. Gusts of up to 93 miles per hour have been recorded in western Japan, with coastal areas likely seeing even stronger winds. At least 163 people suffered injuries across the country, knocked over by sudden gusts or hit by flying debris.

Minneapolis bans man from passing out Bibles during homosexual event. According to World Net Daily, for over a decade, Brian Johnson has peacefully passed out Bibles during Minneapolis' Twin Cities Pride Festival, but if he tries it again this year, he fears he could be arrested. Through some clever legal wrangling, the organizers of the annual festival celebrating homosexuality, have convinced the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board to allow them to exile anyone attempting to distribute Bibles or communicate unapproved messages at the event to a &quot;no pride zone&quot; far away from the festivities. Now Johnson is filing a federal lawsuit against the Board, claiming it can't banish First Amendment free speech rights to a 10′ x 10′ square off the beaten path, especially during a major public event.

In Isaiah 30:10-11, the Bible talks about people &quot;which say to the seers [prophets], See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.&quot;

    <title>Fearing a War in Syria, Israeli Defense Forces Hold Surprise Drills (Second Coming Watch #61)</title>
    <description>Fearing a war in Syria, Israeli Defense Forces hold surprise drills. According to the Jerusalem Post, Fearing a future war with Syria, IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz held a surprise drill inspection of two key military bases in the North to ensure that they will be able to continue operating in the event of significant missile attacks. Commanders at the bases - one a critical ammunition depot and the other a key maintenance base for IDF armored vehicles - were surprised when Gantz and other senior officers arrived at the gates of their bases to review operations there. A senior IDF officer who participated in the inspections said that they were aimed at ensuring the military's readiness for a wide range of scenarios including a possible war with Syria.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christians in Syria struggle amid violent clashes. According to Persecution.org, Christians in Syria are in a difficult spot because if they support the protestors, they could be targeted by Assad's government forces, and if they support Assad, and his regime falls, they could be retaliated against by a new Islamist regime. Reports say that the regime is still providing protection to the Christian communities in almost all places where the regime is still controlling the ground. But problems occurred especially in Homs after the protestors and the Islamic groups had controlled a part of the city where around 200 Christians were killed.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Plight of Christians in the Middle East is Getting Worse. According to The Toronto Star, Christians who have remained under Muslim rule are often exposed to state-sponsored discrimination and worse. In recent years, their plight has reached dramatic proportions. Since it's almost impossible to fathom this issue, we tend to concentrate on stories of individuals. That's why lately the media has focused on You-sef Na-dar-khan-i, a Christian pastor who was sentenced to death in 2010 by the Iranian regime because of his religion. So far, Tehran hasn't heeded appeals by President Barack Obama and other western leaders to release him.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in John 15:18-19, &quot;If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.&quot;

    <title>Israel Downplays Muslim Brotherhood Decision to Run for Presidency in Egypt (Second Coming Watch #60)</title>
    <description>Israel downplays Muslim Brotherhood decision to run for presidency in Egypt. According to The Associated Press, Israel's vice prime minister is playing down the Muslim Brotherhood's decision to seek the presidency in neighboring Egypt. Vice Premier Moshe Yaalon says maintaining peace with Israel is in any Egyptian leader's interest, and that Cairo's relationship with Washington is linked to the peace deal. He told Israel Radio on Sunday that &quot;as long as the Muslim Brotherhood president understands Egypt's commitments and its interests, that will preserve the peace deal.''

'Massive Wealth Destruction' Is About to Hit Investors. According to CNBC, runaway government debts have triggered uncontrolled money printing that in turn will lead to inflation that will decimate portfolios. Marc Faber, the author of the Gloom Boom &amp; Doom Report, says investors, particularly those in the &quot;well-to-do&quot; category, could lose about half their total wealth in the next few years as the consequences pile up from global government debt problems. &quot;Somewhere down the line we will have a massive wealth destruction that usually happens either through very high inflation or through social unrest or through war or credit market collapse.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
James 5:3 says, &quot;Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.&quot;

    <title>Obama says the World has Enough Oil to Crack Down on Iran (Second Coming Watch #59)</title>
    <description>Obama says the world has enough oil to crack down on Iran. According to Reuters, President Barack Obama vowed to forge ahead with tough sanctions on Iran, saying there was enough oil in the world market -- including emergency stockpiles -- to allow countries to cut Iranian imports. In his decision, required by a sanctions law he signed in December, Obama said increased production by some countries as well as &quot;the existence of strategic reserves&quot; helped him come to the conclusion that sanctions can advance.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Reports say North Korea has Launched Two Short-Range Missiles According to Voice of America News, two South Korean newspapers say North Korea has test fired two short-range missiles off its west coast. The Chosun Ilbo [ILL-BO] says the two missiles launched Thursday were surface-to-ship missiles.  The newspaper says it learned from an unnamed military official the launch was aimed at improving the missile's performance, and was unrelated to next month's scheduled rocket launch.  The JoongAng Ilbo newspaper carried a similar report.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sudan's Aerial Bombing Aims At Churches In Nuba Mountains. According to Compass Direct News, after Khartoum denied that it had bombed civilians earlier this month, Sudanese aerial strikes last week were aimed at church buildings and schools in Ka-u-da. An-to-nov airplanes dropped bombs destroying some houses and cattle near the church buildings and schools but causing no casualties. Humanitarian agencies consider the Islamic government's targeting of civilians in the Nuba Mountains, which has a large Christian population, an &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; against non-Arab peoples in the multi-ethnic state, with the added incentive of ridding the area of Christians.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in II Corinthians 4:8-10: &quot;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. &quot;

    <title>1 Dead, Dozens Hurt as Arabs March on Israeli Borders (Second Coming Watch #58)</title>
    <description>1 Dead, Dozens Hurt as Arabs March on Israeli Borders. According to Ynet News, dozens of Palestinians have been hurt in the West Bank and Gaza Strip while marking Land Day protests with fierce riots and clashes with Israeli soldiers on Friday. Palestinian sources reported that one man was killed and 13 others were injured by IDF fire in Gaza after attempting to breach the border fence and infiltrate Israel near the Erez Crossing. The army confirmed that several Palestinians were hurt in the clashes. Meanwhile, Hamas security forces attempted to force protestors away from the border fence, using clubs to beat up the rioters.     
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Zechariah 12:3: &quot;And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some are Accusing the U.S. of Hindering Israel's Staging Ground in Azerbaijan (AH-ZUR-BY-JAHN). According to Yahoo News, the three-way tension between the United States, Israel, and Iran became tenser this week with a widely cited report that Israel is developing a &quot;secret staging ground&quot; in Iran's neighbor to the north - Azerbaijan - for a possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Quoting unnamed senior US diplomats and military intelligence officials, a lengthy article in Foreign Policy magazine asserts that &quot;Israel has recently been granted access to airbases on Iran's northern border.&quot; US diplomat John Bolton said, &quot;I think this leak is part of the administration's campaign against an Israeli attack. It's just unprecedented to reveal this kind of information about one of your own allies.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Coins, paper money, and plastic cards may soon be historic relics. According to Coin World, the timeline that futurists have predicted for the arrival of a cashless society came into sharp focus on March 22 when financial industry experts briefed members of Congress on the rapid development and public adoption of mobile payment devices. Amazingly, the experts said that within the next five years smart phones are likely to become the primary way most Americans pay for goods and services, no matter the size of transactions.

    <title>U.S. State Department Won't Say Jerusalem is the Capital of Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #57)</title>
    <description>U.S. State Department Won't Say Jerusalem is the Capital of Israel. According to The Weekly Standard, there was an amazing exchange yesterday at the State Department press briefing when the press secretary refused to say that Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Israel. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said in response to a question, &quot;We are not going to prejudge the outcome of those negotiations, including the final status of Jerusalem.&quot; When pressed further, Nuland stood her ground. She said, &quot;Our policy with regard to Jerusalem is that it has to be solved through negotiations. That's all I have to say on this issue.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Isaiah 2:3, &quot;And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.&quot;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Independent Panel to review Wycliffe and SIL Bible translations. According to Christian Today, a panel has been formed to carry out an independent review of Wycliffe and SIL International's translation of &quot;God the Father&quot; and the &quot;Son of God&quot;. The World Evangelical Alliance, which works in 129 countries, was asked to establish the panel in light of the controversy surrounding the translation of &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; for Muslim contexts. In Arabic and Turkish translations of the Bible, &quot;Father&quot; is replaced with &quot;Allah&quot;, while &quot;Messiah&quot; is used where &quot;Son&quot; would appear in standard translations. Critics of the changes, including John Piper and Vern Poyth-ress, argue that the translations blur the nature of the Trinity.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Proverbs 30:5-6: &quot;Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Report says Iranian nuclear facilities could 'recover from an attack in six months'. According to the Jerusalem Post,  Iran's &quot;workshops&quot; for making nuclear centrifuges and components for the devices are widely dispersed and hidden, adding to the difficulties of a potential military strike by Israel. A senior official surmised that Iran could recover from a military strike on its centrifuge facilities within six months. Analysts for the Congressional Research Service wrote that neither Israel nor the US is certain of the locations of all such facilities.

    <title>Arab Uprisings Bring Islamist Regional Vision Closer to Reality (Second Coming Watch Update #56)</title>
    <description>Arab uprisings bring Islamist regional vision closer to reality. According to Reuters, the Muslim Brotherhood has quietly spread its influence far beyond Egypt in its 84-year history, but Arab revolts have opened broad new political horizons the group hopes will reflect its founder's vision for the Arab and Islamic world. Mah-moud Ghoz-lan, a member of the Brotherhood's executive bureau, said &quot;There is no doubt that Hassan al-Banna believed in Islamic unity and not just Arab unity. But with such a vision we must consider reality and what is possible. The Brotherhood, banned and repressed under President Hosni Mubarak, did not instigate the uprising against him, but like Islamist parties elsewhere it has been the main beneficiary, using free elections to sweep to the brink of power.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Palestinian president to Pitch New Bid for Statehood at Arab League Summit. According to Russian newspaper, Ria Novosti, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will make his case for a repeat attempt to win full UN membership for Palestine at the Arab League summit in Baghdad. Abbas submitted Palestine's official application for recognition as an independent state in the UN in September 2011. That bid foundered after the U.S. vowed to veto it in the Security Council. A top Abbas aide said, &quot;We understand that the priority for the summit is the Syrian issue and the difficult situation in that country, but it's impossible to leave the Palestinian issue aside due to the failure of the peace process and Israel's refusal to halt settlement activity in our territory,&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iranian Pastor Nadarkhani is Still Alive Despite False Execution Rumors. According to Religion Today, The American Center for Law and Justice has confirmed that imprisoned Iranian pastor You-cef Na-dar-khan-i was still alive as of March 26. New false reports about Pastor Nadarkhani's execution continue to surface, but it is unknown whether those reports are originating from a misinformation campaign initiated by Iran or simply from uninformed sources. Many of the incorrect reports are being posted on blogs and social media sites along with an image of an Iranian man standing in front of a gallows with two armed, masked guards, but the image is not of Pastor Nadarkhani and has been circulating since at least July 2011.

    <title>Organizers say Two Million People are Set to 'March on Jerusalem' this Friday (Second Coming Watch #55)</title>
    <description>Organizers say two million people are set to 'March on Jerusalem' this Friday. According to The Times of Israel, the March on Jerusalem organizer says two million Arab and international protesters will march toward the borders of Israel and take part in activities designed to highlight Jerusalem's Arab character on Friday. Rib-hi Hal-oum, general coordinator of the &quot;Global March to Jerusalem,&quot; said in a press statement that volunteers from 80 countries will take part in the march. Jordan and Lebanon will send protesters to the border, whereas Egypt will organize a solidarity marathon from Cairo University to the pyramids in Giza and a large rally at Al-Azhar University.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kofi Annan says Syria accepts peace plan, but fighting spreads into Lebanon. According to Reuters, international envoy Kofi Annan said on Tuesday that Syria has accepted a U.N.-sponsored peace plan, even as troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad raided rebel forces who have taken refuge across the border in Lebanon. The United States reacted skeptically to Annan's announcement, saying it would judge Assad's sincerity in agreeing to the peace plan by what he did and not by what he said, given his record of &quot;over-promising and under-delivering.&quot; Syrian troops advanced into north Lebanon, destroying farm buildings in pursuit of Syrian rebels.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Next escalation between Israel and Gaza will be more violent. According to the Jerusalem Post, Public Security Minister Yit-zhak Ah-a-ron-o-vitch warned that the next confrontation between Israel and Palestinian terror organizations in Gaza will be &quot;more violent&quot; than previous rounds. The minister made the comments during a visit to the police's southern district, which dealt with five consecutive days of rocket fire on regional cities, towns and villages earlier this month.
&lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in 1 Thessalonians 5:3: &quot;For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.&quot;

    <title>Israel Deploys Iron Dome Battery to Protect Tel Aviv (Second Coming Watch #54)</title>
    <description>Israel deploys Iron Dome battery to protect Tel Aviv. According to the Jerusalem Post, The army recently stationed a battery of the Iron Dome system in the Dan region, as part of an aerial defense exercise against a simulated rocket attack on greater Tel Aviv. The IDF emphasized that the drill is not operational and does not involve the firing of interception rockets, but is merely a technical test planned in advance, aimed at practicing rapid deployment of the system. Nevertheless, the exercise is an indication of preparations by the military for additional confrontations with Gazan terrorist organizations.
&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Egypt designates Israel as its 'top enemy'. According to Front Page Magazine, Egypt's parliament, which is dominated by two pro-Sharia Islamic supremacist groups, the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafists, voted unanimously last week to expel Israel's ambassador to Egypt. They also signaled that the Camp David Accords would soon be a thing of the past. The parliamentarians declared that Egypt would &quot;never&quot; be Israel's ally and designated the country as Egypt's &quot;number one enemy.&quot;
&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus Christ said in Matthew 24:11 and 13: &quot;Take heed that no man deceive you...many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many...But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&quot;
&lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Syrian church fears 'ethnic cleansing' of Christians in Homs. According to the Los Angeles Times, The Syrian Orthodox Church is worried about &quot;an ongoing ethnic cleansing of Christians&quot; in the embattled city of Homs. A Vatican report said that anti-government militants have expelled 90% of Christians in Homs and confiscated their residences by force. Syrian militants went door to door in Homs, &quot;forcing Christians to flee, without giving them the chance to take their belongings.&quot;
 &lt;br  /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 12:10: &quot;Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.&quot;

    <title>Israel Braces for Arab Marches to its Borders (Second Coming Watch #53)</title>
    <description>Israel braces for Arab marches to its borders. According to the Associated Press, An Israeli official says senior Cabinet ministers are holding a special session to discuss how to respond to marches toward Israel's borders announced by pro-Palestinian activists. He spoke on condition of anonymity Sunday because the meeting's agenda was confidential. Activists in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt have planned March 30 marches near Israel's borders. Last year, thousands of Arab protesters marched on Israel's frontiers, sparking clashes that killed at least 15.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thousands of people are heading to a mountain in France where they believe they will be saved from the end of the world. According to British newspaper, The Independent, a mountain looming over a French commune is being touted as a modern Noah's Ark when doomsday arrives - supposedly less than nine months from now. A rapidly increasing stream of New Age believers have descended on the usually picturesque and tranquil village of Bu-ga-rach. They believe that when apocalypse strikes on December 21st this year, aliens waiting in their spacecraft inside Pic de Bu-ga-rach will save all the humans near by and beam them off to the next age. Estimates say over 100,000 people will move to the mountain in the coming months.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus Christ said in Matthew 24:11 and 13: &quot;Take heed that no man deceive you...many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many...But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&quot;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israeli teams are monitoring Iran's nuclear program on the ground. According to Haaretz, the Sunday Times reported that Israel has been operating special forces teams on the ground in Iran in an attempt to collect evidence on the Islamic Republic's contentious nuclear program. Western intelligence sources indicated to the Sunday Times that Israel was actively searching for &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence that would point at the Iranian program's military dimensions.

    <title>Iran May Activate Hezbollah Cells in U.S. After Possible Strike (Second Coming Watch #52)</title>
    <description>Iran may activate Hezbollah cells in U.S. after possible strike. According to The Jerusalem Post, a congressional report finds that Hezbollah fundraising cells are rampant across the United States and that the Lebanese organization could activate these cells to carry out lethal terrorist attacks. The report, compiled by the US House Committee on Homeland Security, estimates that there are several thousand sympathetic Hezbollah donors in the country, with operatives probably in the hundreds. Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy, and should Iran want to carry out terrorism in the US, it could then do so through these operatives.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in II Timothy 3:1, &quot;This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.&quot;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel's vice-premier describes Iran as the world's number one threat. According to Israel National News, Vice Premier and Minister of Strategic Affairs Mo-she Ya-a-lon said that Iran's nuclear program is the leading global security threat. Speaking at a high school in Israel, he said &quot;The main threat to regional and world stability comes from Tehran and the Iranian regime. Imagine what it would do upon achieving such capability. The nuclear umbrella will not just open against us, but against the United States.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Local authorities have occupied and demolished 'government approved' churches in China. According to ChinaAid, Government-approved churches in two coastal Chinese provinces have had their church property occupied or demolished by local authorities, who also detained or beat church members, demonstrating once again that even official churches are not safe from government persecution. In Shandong (SHAYN-dong) province, the Three-Self church in the town of Gucheng (GU-cheng), was forcibly occupied by government officials, with the support of the government. The church repeatedly called for the return of its property, but the government arrested those who went to the government to plead their case.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:9, &quot;Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.&quot;

    <title>Israel warns its Arab neighbors not to march to Jerusalem (Second Coming Watch #51)</title>
    <description>Israel warns its Arab neighbors not to march to Jerusalem. According to Ynet News, Following the deadly clashes last year during the marches to its northern border, Israel issued a stern warning to Arab countries and Palestinians to refrain from approaching the border. A London based newspaper reported  that the warning was issued in reference to the &quot;Universal Jerusalem March&quot; planned for next Friday to commemorate &quot;Land Day.&quot; According to sources, Israel reiterated it would treat anyone who approaches the border as an infiltrator, and will act against them decisively.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Open Doors USA says the Growth of Christianity in Iran is 'Explosive'. According to the Christian Post, Despite the Iranian government's ongoing crackdown of Christians living in the primarily Islamic country, the number of Muslims converting to become Christians is growing at an explosive rate. A house church movement within Iran is part of that revival and has triggered &quot;many secret meetings.&quot; The growth in the number of Christians is happening in all regions, but mostly in larger cities.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus Christ said in John 12:32, &quot;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tensions between Israel and Egypt are expected to grow as Islamists take power soon. According to the Jewish Press, Those who are, or will soon be, governing Egypt view themselves as being at war with Israel for all practical purposes. It matters relatively little that there is still a peace treaty. In Cairo, there are no thoughts of peace. The Egyptian parliament voted unanimously to demand the expulsion of Israel’s ambassador and the halt of all natural gas exports to Israel. Egypt's Arab Affairs Committee stated, &quot;Revolutionary Egypt will never be a friend, partner or ally of the Zionist entity (Israel), which we consider to be the number one enemy of Egypt and the Arab nation.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Egypt thwarts Iranian attack on Israeli vessels in the Suez canal. According to Ynet News, Egyptian security forces were able to foil a terror attack on Israeli vessels in the Suez Canal. The report said that the Egyptian investigation into the matter concluded that the potential attacks were orchestrated by Iran. Egyptian authorities have two suspects in custody and are looking for a third who was offered 50 million Egyptian pounds to carry out the attack.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Australia has been hit by its biggest earthquake in 15 years. According to the AFP, Australia has been hit by its biggest earthquake in 15 years, rattling a remote part of the desert with local Aboriginals reporting strong shaking but no major damage. The 6.1-magnitude earthquake had its epicentre near Ernabella, in the middle of Australia, at a shallow depth of 1.8 miles. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Mark 13:8, &quot;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.&quot;

    <title>Israel says the threat of a strike on Iran is working (Second Coming Watch #50)</title>
    <description>Israel says the threat of a strike on Iran is working. According to the AFP, Ehud Barak says the threat of a military strike on Iran is preventing the Islamic republic from taking the final steps towards developing a nuclear bomb. The defense minister said on radio, &quot;We are seeing with our own eyes the reason why Iran, which really wants to achieve a military nuclear capability, is not taking some of the steps defined by the IAEA as breaking the rules. One of the reasons is the fear of what will happen if, God forbid, the United States or maybe someone else acts against them.&quot;
 &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
U.S. Intelligence says Water Shortages Threaten Stability of Regions Around the World. According to Bloomberg, a U.S. intelligence report said that competition for increasingly scarce water in the next decade will fuel instability in regions such as South Asia and the Middle East that are important to U.S. national security. An all-out water war is unlikely in the next 10 years, as nations will be more likely to use water as a bargaining chip with each other. But as shortages become more acute, water in shared basins will increasingly be used as leverage, and the adoption of water as a weapon by states or terrorists will become more likely after 10 years.
 &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6-7 that in the last days, &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.&quot;
 &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Police Raid a House Church In China and Detain 70 Christians. According to ChinaAid, a house church in far west China's region of Xinjiang that has been meeting for nearly two decades was raided by police, who took more than 70 Christians into custody. Announcing that the meeting was an &quot;unapproved, illegal meeting,&quot; the police &quot;ordered an immediate end to the meeting.&quot; They forced each Christian there to be photographed, and then took them to their local police stations for questioning. Some were not released for two days.
 &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 5:10: &quot;Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&quot;

    <title>Israelis Grow Confident that Strike on Iran's Nuclear Facilities Will Not Lead to Widespread War (Second Coming Watch #49)</title>
    <description>Israelis Grow Confident that Strike on Iran's Nuclear Facilities Will Not Lead to Widespread War. According to Bloomberg, one conclusion that key Israeli officials have reached is that a strike on six to eight Iranian nuclear facilities will not lead, as is generally assumed, to all-out war. This argument holds that the Iranians might choose to cover up an attack, in the manner of the Syrian government when its nuclear facility was destroyed by the Israeli air force in 2007. An Israeli strike would not focus on densely populated cities, so the Iranian government might be able to control, to some degree, the flow of information about it. Some Israeli officials believe that Iran's leaders might choose to play down the insult of a raid and launch a handful of rockets at Tel Aviv as an angry gesture, rather than declare all-out war.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Russia says Iran will produce nuclear weapons if attacked. According to the AFP, Russia warned  that Iran would have no option but to develop nuclear weapons if it came under attack from either the United States or Israel over its contested atomic program. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, &quot;The CIA and other US officials admit they now have no information about the Iranian leadership taking the political decision to produce nuclear weapons. But I am almost certain that such a decision will surely be taken after (any) strikes on Iran.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6-7 that in the last days, &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
52 People have been Killed in a String of Bombings in Iraq, Including one at a Church in Baghdad. According to the Christian Post, the Syrian Orthodox Church of St. Matthew in Baghdad was one of the targets in a string of bombings Tuesday, as Iraqi extremists conducted a series of attacks in several cities and towns across the country that killed at least 52 people in total. Over 30 bombs were detonated and wounded an estimated 250 people. The attacks are believed to be a challenge extremists wanted to throw at security forces on the ninth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of the country on March 20, 2003.

    <title>Major Earthquake Hits Mexico (Second Coming Watch #48)</title>
    <description>Major earthquake hits Mexico. According to Reuters, a major earthquake struck Mexico on Tuesday, unleashing panic as it damaged hundreds of buildings and caused homes in the capital to bounce like &quot;trampolines&quot;. Office workers fled into the street when the 7.4-magnitude quake shook Mexico City for more than a minute. Cell phone lines went down, buildings were evacuated, traffic snarled and the stock exchange had to suspend trading early. The tremor was one of the strongest since the devastating 8.1-magnitude earthquake of 1985, which killed thousands in Mexico City.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:7 that in the last days, &quot;nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kuwait says Iran has assured it will not shut down Hormuz. According to Reuters, after threats by Iran that it could shut down the most important oil transit channel in the world, if Western governments stop it from selling crude, Kuwait's emir and other Gulf leaders have sought assurances that Tehran will not follow through with the threats. During a visit to Japan, the emir said, &quot;We have received assurances from Iran that it will not take this step.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sweden is moving towards a cashless economy. According to the Associated Press, Sweden was the first European country to introduce bank notes in 1661. Now it's come farther than most on the path toward getting rid of them. Bjoern Ulvaeus (JORN UL-VAY-US), former member of 1970's pop group ABBA, and a vocal proponent for a world without cash said, &quot;I can't see why we should be printing bank notes at all anymore&quot;. In most Swedish cities, public buses don't accept cash; tickets are prepaid or purchased with a cell phone text message. A small but growing number of businesses only take cards, and some bank offices -- which make money on electronic transactions -- have stopped handling cash altogether.

    <title>Israel says Iran's Nuclear Program Will Soon be Strike-proof (Second Coming Watch #47)</title>
    <description>Israel says Iran's nuclear program will soon be strike-proof. According to the Associated Press, Israel views the threat posed by a nuclear-armed Iran with greater urgency than the rest of the world. Israel's defense minister Ehud Barak reiterated recent Israeli assessments that Iran's nuclear program is on the verge of becoming immune to disruptions by a possible military strike. The remarks are likely to fuel already rampant speculation that Israel is preparing for a strike before Iran moves most of its nuclear facilities underground and beyond the reach of a precision attack.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a &quot;rapidly rising&quot; disease among both the rich and poor. According to Reuters, rapidly rising rates of drug-resistant Tuberculosis in some of the wealthiest cities in the world, as well as across Africa and Asia, are again making history. London has been dubbed the &quot;tuberculosis capital of Europe&quot;, and a startling recent study documenting new cases of so-called &quot;totally drug resistant&quot; tuberculosis in India suggests the modern-day tale of this disease could get a lot worse. Ruth McNerney, an expert on tuberculosis at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said &quot;We can't afford this genie to get out of the bag. Because once it has, I don't know how we'll control tuberculosis.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:7 that in the last days, &quot;nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israeli Prime Minister speaks at Christians United for Israel event in Jerusalem. According to Haaretz, Netanyahu stated that he was proud that Muslims and Christians could practice their faith freely in Israel. He went on to say that &quot;when Iran is funding terror and violence all over the world and is calling for our annihilation, I don't have to explain to you why that regime can't have nuclear weapons. Our enemies don't hate us because of what we do, but because of who we are.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Psalm 122:6: &quot;Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.&quot;

    <title>Israel's Foreign Minister says a War With Iran Would be a Global Nightmare (Second Coming Watch #46)</title>
    <description>Israel's foreign minister says a war with Iran would be a global nightmare. According to Ynet news, during a visit to China, Avigdor Lieberman said, &quot;If, God forbid, a war breaks out with Iran, it will be a nightmare. Everyone will be involved, including the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia. We must make every effort so that the international community will take responsibility and stop Iran.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran again threatens to close Strait of Hormuz after being cut off from international bank system. According to DEBKAfile, Intelligence Minister Ali Fa-la-hi-an, Iran's senior spokesman on sanctions, said that if the US and Europe think they can ignore international law to promote their interests, they should know that Iran will respond in kind everywhere it can. He said, &quot;I suggest that the West take seriously our threat to close the Strait of Hormuz.&quot; A large fleet of 4 US and French nuclear aircraft carriers and a dozen or more minesweepers and mine-hunting helicopters are currently deployed on both sides of the Strait of Hormuz.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
America's recent weather is a story of unusual extremes. According to The Associated Press, nearly 11 feet of snow has fallen on Anchorage, Alaska, this winter, and the city has been forced to haul away at least 250,000 tons of snow. The first three months of 2012 have seen twice the normal number of tornadoes. And 36 states set daily high temperature records last week. So far this month, the U.S. has set 1,757 daily high temperature records. Jake Crouch, a climate scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that this was similar to the number during last summer's heat wave.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6-7: &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.&quot;

    <title>The Iran-Israel Conflict Could Cause Another Global Recession (Second Coming Watch #45)</title>
    <description>The Iran-Israel conflict could cause another global recession. According to Slate Magazine, Today's fragile global economy faces many risks: But no risk is more serious than that posed by a further spike in oil prices. And the risk that Israel's threat to attack Iran's nuclear installations will, in fact, lead to an outright military conflict may still be low, but it is growing. If the drums of war grow louder this summer, oil prices could rise in a way that will most likely cause a U,S, and global growth slowdown, and even an outright recession if a military conflict erupts and sends oil prices soaring.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hindu nationalists attack three Christian communities in India. According to Asia News, the Global Council of Indian Christians (GCIC) reported three anti-Christian attacks in West Bengal, Delhi and Madh-ya Pra-desh just in the past week. Like Advent and Christmas, Lent is a time when Hindu ultranationalists tend to intensify their harassment and terrorising of minority Christians. For GCIC president Sajan George, the situation shows the &quot;total lack of justice towards Christians who are increasingly vulnerable.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in John 15:18-19: &quot;If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
N. Korea says it will launch rocket next month. According to The Associated Press, North Korea says it will go ahead with plans to launch an observation satellite into space and that criticism of it is provocative. North Korea said it would launch the satellite on a rocket next month. The U.S., South Korea and Japan condemn the plan as a disguised test of military missiles because the same type of rocket is used to launch long-range missiles.

    <title>Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti Calls for the Destruction of All Churches (Second Coming Watch #44)</title>
    <description>Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti Calls for the Destruction of All Churches. According to Israel National News, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia (an Islamic scholar) declared that it is &quot;necessary to destroy all the churches of the region.&quot; Jihad Watch explained that &quot;The Sheikh based his proclamation on the famous tradition wherein the prophet of Islam declared on his deathbed that 'There are not to be two religions in the Arabian Peninsula,' which has always been interpreted to mean that only Islam can be practiced in the region.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:9: &quot;Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran says an Israeli strike would lead to its demise. According to Ynet News, Iran's Foreign Minister  says an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities would lead to the Jewish state's demise within a week. During an interview with Danish television, Ali Ak-bhar Sa-le-hi said Iran would respond forcefully to any attack and said that Israel &quot;is so small that it wouldn't last one week in a real war.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel warns Gaza against escalation of attacks. According to Israel National News, security officials threatened on Friday that an escalation of rocket fire by terrorists in Gaza will result in a &quot;super escalation&quot; by Israeli Defense Forces. Stating that they &quot;cannot tolerate this fire over time,&quot; the official added that &quot;the enemy understands that Israel has the Iron Dome and in the next round he will look for a different Achilles' heel.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
God says in Zechariah 12:9: &quot;And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. &quot;

    <title>UK Government says the Church Will be Powerless to Stop Homosexual Marriage (Second Coming Watch #43)</title>
    <description>UK government says that the church will be powerless to stop homosexual marriage. According to The Telegraph, a long-awaited official paper on same-sex marriage makes clear that the Church will be powerless to stop the change even if it mobilises hundreds of thousands of objections. The Government's national consultation document, asks the public whether they &quot;agree or disagree&quot; with allowing homosexual couples to have civil weddings. But it makes clear that, while the question is posed in principle, it is a matter of &quot;how not whether&quot; the change is introduced. Opponents of the move immediately accused the Government of holding a &quot;sham&quot; consultation&quot; in which opposition would be &quot;ignored.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in 2 Timothy 4:4, &quot;And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran says Israel isn't powerful enough to fulfill military threats. According to Haaretz, during a visit to southern Lebanon, Ahmadinejad's press adviser said Israel is too weak to fulfill its threats against Iran. He also stated that a possible Iranian counterstrike would reach beyond the 'Zionist regime' and include U.S. bases.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most Israelis don't want Israel to strike Iran alone. According to Haaretz, polls published last week show that most of the Israeli public supports a U.S. strike on Iran, but is wary of sending Israeli Defense Forces to do the task without the backing of the friendly superpower. However, in his speech before the Knesset on Wednesday, Netanyahu urged his colleagues to reject claims that Israel is too weak to go it alone in a war against a regional power such as Iran and therefore needs to rely on the United States, which has much greater military capabilities, to do the job and remove the threat.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Mark 13:7: &quot;And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.&quot;

    <itunes:summary>UK government says that the church will be powerless to stop homosexual marriage. According to The Telegraph, a long-awaited official paper on same-sex marriage makes clear that the Church will be powerless to stop the change even if it mobilises hundreds of thousands of objections. The Government's national consultation document, asks the public whether they &quot;agree or disagree&quot; with allowing homosexual couples to have civil weddings. But it makes clear that, while the question is posed in principle, it is a matter of &quot;how not whether&quot; the change is introduced. Opponents of the move immediately accused the Government of holding a &quot;sham&quot; consultation&quot; in which opposition would be &quot;ignored.&quot;

    <title>A Series of Earthquakes Shake Up the Globe (Second Coming Watch #42)</title>
    <description>A series of earthquakes shake up the globe. The US Geological Survey reported that a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Papua New Guinea today, but a tsunami warning was not issued and seismologists said &quot;no major human impact is expected.&quot; Also, over the past two days, a series of earthquakes -- with the strongest being a magnitude 6.8 -- rattled Tokyo and northeastern Japan. A magnitude 3.1 earthquake was reported in northwest Sacramento, California; and a magnitude 4.4 quake hit central Peru. No deaths or significant property damage was reported.

The Bible says Mark 13:8: &quot;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In a rare event, Hawaii was hit by supercell thunderstorms with three inch hail and tornadic signatures. According to The Weather Space, a true supercell thunderstorm struck Hawaii bringing three inch hail to Eastern Oahu Island last week. Meteorologist Kevin Martin stated, &quot;This is very rare for Hawaii to have this type of supercell.&quot; Supercells normally happen across the Great Plains and Mid-west of the United States, where cold, dry Canadian air meets with warm, moist air off the Gulf of Mexico. This setup produces supercells with violent tornadoes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21:25, &quot;And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel has developed its own bunker-buster bomb. According to DEBKAfile, Israel has developed an improved precision, bunker-burrowing weapon which Israeli Military Industries recently unveiled. The 500-pound weapon is a laser-guided bomb that can penetrate double-reinforced concrete walls or floors without breaking apart. Its manufacturers say, &quot;The lethality, precision, and relatively low weight of the new weapon enable its use against multiple targets in a single pass.&quot;

    <title>A Christian Scientist Sues NASA for Allegedly Firing him for his 'Belief in Intelligent Design' (Second Coming Watch Update #41)</title>
    <description>A Christian scientist sues NASA for Allegedly firing him for his 'belief in intelligent design'. According to The Telegraph, David Coppedge, who worked for 15 years on a mission to explore Saturn and its moons, is suing the space agency for religious discrimination. Believers in intelligent design say that a higher power must have had a hand in creation because life is too complex to have developed through evolution alone. Mr Coppedge was a &quot;team leader&quot; on the Cassini project and he used to talk to his co-workers about intelligent design while at work. He claims that led to him being demoted in 2009 and fired last year.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says Matthew 24:9: &quot;Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran denies claims that it is cleaning up a suspected military site. According to the Telegraph, Iran dismissed claims it was clearing away traces of suspected nuclear weapons research activities from a closed military site, saying the allegations were &quot;propaganda&quot;. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Yu-ki-ya A-man-o, said early last week that satellite images suggested there were unspecified &quot;ongoing&quot; activities at the Parchin base. Western diplomats said they suspected Iran was removing nuclear evidence from the site.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Russia says it will keep selling weapons to Syria. According to The Associated Press, Russia has no intention of curtailing military cooperation with Syria despite calls from the West to stop arming President Bashar Assad's regime. Deputy Defense Minister A-na-to-ly An-to-nov said Russia will abide by existing contracts to deliver weapons to Syria despite Assad's yearlong crackdown on the opposition, during which the U.N. says over 7,500 people have been killed.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Mark 13:7: &quot;And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.&quot;

    <title>Venus and Jupiter to Appear Close Together in Night Sky This Week (Second Coming Watch Update #40)</title>
    <description>Venus and Jupiter to appear close together in night sky this week. According to Fox News, Venus and Jupiter have been dancing toward each other in the night sky for months, and they'll finally come together this week in a dazzling show for skywatchers. Beginning on March 12, the two brightest planets in the sky will be so close together that you'll be able to block both of them out with a few fingers held at arm's length. The celestial action peaks on Thursday, March 15, when Venus and Jupiter line up in what's known as a planetary conjunction. Venus-Jupiter conjunctions are fairly special events, occurring roughly every 13 months. And this one should be the best conjunction for several years to come for viewers in the Northern Hemisphere, experts say, because the two planets will be visible for so long in the evening sky.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Solar storm sparks unusually active Northern lights. According to MSNBC, The solar storm that sparked so much debate last week got its second wind, rewarding aurora aficionados from the Arctic to the Lower 48 to Australia. The sunspot region that sent the big outburst our way appears to be growing and was sending out fresh blasts late last week. SpaceWeather.com reports that this activity &quot;is expected to &quot;add to the geomagnetic unrest already under way.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21:25: &quot;And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran states it has 11,000 missiles ready to launch at Israeli and U.S. Targets. According to The Daily Caller, The Iranian newspaper Kayhan reported that in the first minutes of any American conflict with Iran, &quot;Israel and all U.S. interests around the world will be targeted.&quot; The newspaper, which is under the supervision of Iranian supreme leader Ay-a-toll-ah Ali Kha-men-ei, ran the story under the headline &quot;11,000 Missiles Ready to Launch.&quot; Tehran's ambassador to Lebanon also confirmed during a public event that the Islamic regime is prepared to attack both Israeli and U.S. bases in the region if its nuclear facilities are attacked.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21:9-10: &quot;But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by. Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.&quot;

In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Israel's Iron Dome Foils 90 Percent of Missiles from Gaza (Second Coming Watch Update #39)</title>
    <description>Israel's Iron Dome Foils 90 Percent of Missiles from Gaza. According to Israel National News, the Iron Dome system has intercepted 90 percent of missile attacks on urban centers during the latest rocket bombardment from Gaza. The expensive systems were inaugurated last year amid controversy over its worth. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated, &quot;We will continue to improve home front defense including by means of additional Iron Dome systems, the effectiveness of which was shown again over the weekend.&quot;

 &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Suicide bomber attacks Nigerian church leaving 10 people dead. According to The Associated Press, a suicide car bomber attacked a Catholic church Sunday in the middle of Mass, killing at least 10 people in the blast and the retaliatory violence that followed the latest assault targeting a church in a central Nigerian city plagued by unrest. The blast damaged the church's roof, blew out its windows and destroyed a portion of the fence surrounding the church's compound.

  &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Jesus Christ said in John 15:20: &quot;Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. &quot;

 
 &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel issues stern warning to Palestine over firing of Iranian missiles. According to DEBKAfile, Israel has passed a stern warning to the Palestinian Jihad Islamists who are shooting missiles from Gaza to expect Israeli punishment on a different scale from the current surgical air strikes if they dare fire the Fajr surface missiles supplied them by Iran. The Iranian-made missiles bring into range Israel's urban, commercial and population hub cities between Tel Aviv and Rehovoth. The warning was relayed Sunday through Egyptian Intelligence Chief Gen. Mu-rad Mu-waf-i who is working with Washington to halt the Gaza violence.

 
 &lt;Br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in 2 Timothy 3:1 that &quot;in the last days perilous times shall come.&quot;

    <title>Over 110 Rockets from Gaza Fired into Southern Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #38)</title>
    <description>Over 110 rockets from Gaza fired into southern Israel. According to Haaretz, school was canceled for hundreds of thousands of students in Israel's south on Sunday, after over 110 rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza since Friday. Israeli air strikes against Gaza militants have left 16 dead. Israel's Iron Dome system intercepted 28 of the 31 rockets it targeted. The missile defense system is designed to only intercept rockets identified as heading toward populated areas. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christians in Sudan face deadline to leave the north. According to ENI News, Sudanese Christians have barely a month to leave the Muslim-majority north or risk being treated as foreigners. Bishop Daniel Adwok says, &quot;We are very concerned. Moving is not easy. People have children in school. They have homes. It is almost impossible.&quot; Iin February, Sudan announced the deadline for the former citizens it had stripped of nationality after South Sudan's vote to secede. The ultimatum will affect an estimated 500,000-700,000 people, who are mainly Christians of southern origin that still live in the north. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in John 15:18-19: &quot;If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
US faces increasing threat of cyberattacks by terrorists. According to Fox News, a former senior intelligence official says an eventual full-scale cyberattack on the U.S. by a terrorist organization is &quot;a certitude,&quot; and &quot;cyberterrorists&quot; are already making criminal use of the technology to steal money and move it around to finance their operations. Tech-based terror threats are increasingly raising concerns in Washington, and FBI Director Robert Mueller testified this week that such threats are among the most serious facing the U.S. -- including on the battlefield.

    <title>Israel Asks U.S. for Arms That Could Aid Iran Strike (Second Coming Watch Update #37)</title>
    <description>Israel asks U.S. for arms that could aid Iran strike. According to Reuters, Israel has asked the United States for advanced &quot;bunker-buster&quot; bombs and refueling planes that could improve its ability to attack Iran's underground nuclear sites. An Israeli official said &quot;such a request was made&quot; around the time of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington. But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, played down as &quot;unrealistic&quot; Israeli reports that the United States would condition supplying the hardware on Israel promising not to attack Iran this year.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With tensions high in the Mideast, evangelical Christians tighten embrace of Israel. According to MSNBC, Pro-Israel rhetoric — fueled in part by increasing tensions in the Middle East over Iran's nuclear program and the threat it might pose to the Jewish state  — is a staple of many U.S. evangelical leaders' speeches and sermons. Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said such staunch support for Israel is fundamental to the evangelical movement. He said, &quot;American evangelicals have it in their DNA. We want God to bless America and if America doesn't support Israel we don't have his blessing. It doesn't mean Israel is always right, it doesn't mean we don't remonstrate Israel, but we are going to have their back.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
God said to Abraham in Genesis 12:3: &quot;I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christians are being rounded up across Iran. According to Christian Today, the Barnabas Fund is reporting that Iranian authorities have initiated a wave of arrests across the country, targeting ordinary church members and leaders. Security agencies have swept house churches in Ahwaz, Shiraz, Esfahan and Tehran. The arrests have taken place inside homes and workplaces, and even some members of officially registered churches have been seized.

According to Reuters, Israel has asked the United States for advanced &quot;bunker-buster&quot; bombs and refueling planes that could improve its ability to attack Iran's underground nuclear sites.

    <title>Back in Israel, Netanyahu says he Will Not Allow Iran to get Nuclear Bombs (Second Coming Watch Update #36)</title>
    <description>Back in Israel, Netanyahu says he Will Not Allow Iran to get Nuclear Bombs. According to the Associated Press, Israel's prime minister said Israel will not allow Iran to obtain atomic bombs but prefers a peaceful solution to the issue. Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Israeli TV stations a day after returning from talks with President Barack Obama and other American officials. Both leaders said they would not permit Iran to obtain nuclear bombs, with Netanyahu adding that this is a matter of life or death for Israel.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Clash with Iran could see the use of a huge, new U.S. bomb. According to Reuters, a 30,000-pound bunker buster bomb designed to smash through some 200 feet of concrete before exploding is a &quot;great weapon&quot; that could be used by U.S. forces in a clash with Iran over its nuclear program. Lieutenant General Herbert Carlisle, Air Force deputy chief of staff for operations, said the massive ordnance penetrator, which the military began receiving only last year, is part of the U.S. arsenal available for strikes against countries like Iran, which has some buried nuclear facilities.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6, &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Biggest Solar Storm in Years Is Bombarding Earth Now. According to Space.com, the biggest solar storm in five years is battering our planet right now, and may cause disruptions to satellites, power grids and communications networks. Two strong solar flares erupted from the surface of the sun, blasting a wave of plasma and charged particles toward Earth. After speeding through space at 4 million mph, this eruption of material -- called a coronal mass ejection (CME) -- should be hitting Earth now. The storm is expected to create strong disruptions due to an odd combination of intense magnetic, radio and radiation emissions, making it the strongest overall solar storm since December 2006.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21:25, &quot;And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations...&quot;

    <title>Satellite Images Show Iran Cleaning Up Evidence from Nuclear Work (Second Coming Watch Update #35)</title>
    <description>Satellite images show Iran cleaning up evidence from nuclear work. According to the Associated Press, satellite images of an Iranian military facility appear to show trucks and earth-moving vehicles at the site, indicating an attempted cleanup of radioactive traces possibly left by tests of a nuclear-weapon trigger. The assertions from diplomats, all nuclear experts accredited to the International Atomic Energy Agency, could add to the growing international pressure on Iran over its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
UN Proposes Global Governance Over How Earth Is Managed. According to Fox News, an environmental report issued by an agency of the United Nations has some critics sounding the alarm, saying it is a clarion call for &quot;global governance&quot; over how the Earth is managed. The report titled &quot;21 Issues for the 21st Century,&quot; from the United Nations Environment Program Foresight Process, is the culmination of a two-year deliberative process involving 22 core scientists. Its critics see an agenda lurking in its 60 pages, which call for a complete overhaul of how the world's food and water are created and distributed -- something the report says is &quot;urgently needed&quot; for the human race to keep feeding and hydrating itself safely.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible talks about a shortage of food in the last days in Revelation 6:5-6: &quot;And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Electronic Passports Spread To Half The Globe. According to Contactless News, nearly half of all United Nations member states are now issuing biometric e-passports, according to the newest data from the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. agency that oversees international air travel. ICAO reports that 93 out of 193 U.N. member states now issue e-passports, with 21 additional countries ready to deploy the technology in the next 12 to 48 months. Each of these documents contains a contactless integrated circuit chip that stores biometric data-i.e. facial, fingerprint or iris-of the passport holder as well as other encrypted identification data.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Revelation 13:16-17 that the antichrist will cause &quot;all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
US will give bunker-busters and aerial refueling to Israel alongside diplomacy for Iran. According to DEBKAfile, American sources disclosed that President Barack Obama had decided to let Israel have weapons systems suitable for long-range military operations and strikes against fortified underground targets. They include four KC-35 aerial refueling aircraft, doubling the number already in the Israeli Air Force's inventory, and Direct Attack Munition bombs of the type which serve US bombers especially those based on aircraft carriers.

According to The Guardian, senior figures within the militant Islamic group say Hamas will not do Iran's bidding in any war with Israel. Sa-lah Bar-da-wil, a member of the organisation's political bureau in Gaza City, told The Guardian, &quot;If there is a war between two powers, Hamas will not be part of such a war.&quot; He denied the group would launch rockets into Israel at Tehran's request in response to a strike on its nuclear sites. He went on to say, &quot;Hamas is not part of military alliances in the region. Our strategy is to defend our rights.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Zechariah 2:8, &quot;For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you [Israel] toucheth the apple of his eye.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran will grant UN watchdog access to suspected nuclear site. According to Reuters, Iran said it will give the UN nuclear watchdog access to its Parchin military complex, a site where the agency believes Tehran pursued high explosives research relevant to nuclear weapons. An International Atomic Energy Agency report last year said that Iran had built a large containment chamber at Parchin, southeast of Tehran, to conduct explosives tests that are &quot;strong indicators&quot; of efforts to develop an atom bomb. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The UN says 2011 disasters were the costliest ever. According to the Associated Press, a U.N. envoy said the economic cost of disasters in 2011 was the highest in history -- with a pricetag of at least $380 billion, mainly due to earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand. Margareta Wahlstrom, the secretary-general's special representative for disaster risk reduction, said the figure was two-thirds higher than the previous record in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina struck the southern United States. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21:11 that in the last days: &quot;great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. &quot;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Obama Pledges to Back Israel as Netanyahu says Israel Will Control its Destiny (Second Coming Watch Update #33)</title>
    <description>In Washington talks, Obama pledges to back Israel as Netanyahu says Israel will control its destiny. According to Fox News, As allies closely monitor Iran's movements toward becoming a member of the nuclear club, President Obama assured Israel's leader on Monday that the United States &quot;will always have Israel's back&quot; even while pursuing a &quot;window that allows for a diplomatic resolution.&quot; Meeting at the White House, the two agreed that diplomacy is the best route for now although Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that his nation reserves the right to defend itself.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
God says of Israel in Zechariah 2:8: &quot;For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
German Newspaper says Iran 'May have Tested Nukes in North Korea in 2010'. According to Israel National News, the Sunday morning edition of Germany's &quot;Die Welt&quot;, reports that Western intelligence agencies detected two nuclear weapons tests in North Korea in 2010, and that one or both of them might have been conducted for Iran. The author is the respected German analyst and former top official Hans Rühle, who quotes new documentation showing that the Iranian regime began its drive for nuclear weapons as early as 1984, under the direct orders of Ay-a-toll-ah Kho-mein-i.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Northern Nigerians Live in Constant Threat of Attack from Boko Haram. According to Persecution.org, Boko Haram continues to devastate Christians in Northern Nigeria through bombings and attacks that either wound or kill many in the area. A spokesman for the radical Muslim group said, &quot;I enjoy killing anyone that God commands me to kill the way I enjoy killing chickens and rams.&quot; Over 250 people were killed by Boko Haram in the month of January alone.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in I Peter 4:12-13: &quot;Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.&quot;

    <title>President Obama Assures Israel that Using Force is an Option on Iran (Second Coming Watch Update #32)</title>
    <description>President Obama Assures Israel that Using Force is an Option on Iran. According to The Associated Press,  President Barack Obama says he doesn't want war but insists he would attack Iran if that was the only option left to stop that nation from getting a nuclear weapon. Obama also said in his address to AIPAC that &quot;Loose talk of war&quot; only plays into Iran's hands. Today, he will try to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to slow down the quickening pressure to attack Iran's disputed nuclear development sites. Obama is trying to avert an Israeli strike that could come this spring, and which the United States sees as dangerously premature.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hezbollah leader calls on Muslims and Christians to 'liberate' Jerusalem. According to the Jerusalem Post, Hezbollah Secretary-General Has-san Nas-rall-ah said on Monday that Israeli-Palestinian negotiations were doomed to fail, and called on Muslims and Christians to take Jerusalem from Israel. He said, &quot;Every Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and Christian has a national, popular, and ethical responsibility towards Al-Quds [al-Kudz] (Jerusalem). It demands seriousness and action from all of us.&quot; He went on to say that Israeli settlers were &quot;Judaizing&quot; and &quot;desecrating&quot; Jerusalem.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Zechariah 12:8: &quot;In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Over 3,000 cases of Typhoid fever have been reported in Zimbabwe. According to the AFP, some 3,000 cases of typhoid fever have been reported in Zimbabwe's capital of Harare since the first case was detected in a working-class suburb in January. Health authorities banned open-air food vending to try to curb the spread of the disease. However, Health Minister Henry Mad-zo-re-ra said in an interview with state television that the government had no money to deal with the typhoid outbreak which has since spread to other provinces.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21:11: &quot;And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences [diseases and epidemics]; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. &quot;

    <title>Iran is Top Issue as Obama and Netanyahu Meet (Second Coming Watch Update #31)</title>
    <description>Iran is top issue as Obama and Netanyahu meet. According to The Associated Press, peace talks with the Palestinians dominated President Barack Obama's meeting last year with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but will barely warrant a mention at their White House session on Monday or in speeches to a powerful pro-Israeli lobby. Iran is now the issue commanding urgent attention. The United States, Israel and much of the world are trying to figure out how to deal with Iran and its nuclear program. While all sides insist a resolution to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical to Israel's security, the Israelis have come to believe that Iran may be on the threshold of developing atomic weapons and is the primary existential threat to the Jewish state. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
38 people dead as storms and tornadoes strike American south and midwest. According to the Associated Press, across the South and Midwest, survivors emerged to find blue sky and splinters where homes once stood, cars flung into buildings and communications crippled after dozens of tornadoes chainsawed through a region of millions, leveling small towns along the way. At least 38 people were killed in five states, but a 2-year-old girl was somehow found alive and alone in a field near her Indiana home. Her family did not survive. A couple that fled their home for the safety of a restaurant basement made it, even after the storms threw a school bus into their makeshift shelter. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Isaiah 29:6: &quot;Thou shalt be visited of the Lord of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Palestinians to present conditions for return to peace talks with Israel. According to Haaretz, The Palestinian Authority has set a number of conditions for the resumption of peace talks with Israel. The conditions reportedly include the acceptance by Israel of a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, with the possibility of a limited land swap, and a complete halt of settlement construction, including in East Jerusalem. The conditions are also said to include the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Psalm 122:6: &quot;Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.&quot;

In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot; 

If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Some Saying Unusual Weather in Israel Points to the End of the World (Second Coming Watch Update #30)</title>
    <description>Some are saying that unusual weather in Israel points to the end of the world. According to the Washington Post, big snowflakes fell in Jerusalem on Friday, blanketing the holy city in white for the first time in four years. The snow then turned to rain, sleet, and hail for the fourth straight day. And more cold and stormy weather is predicted for the Holy Land this weekend. Temperatures in Jerusalem are expected to drop to freezing which is highly unusual in this sunny Mediterranean climate. Winds have exceeded 65 miles an hour in some parts of the country. Trees were uprooted in the coastal city of Tel Aviv. And flooding was expected in the south of the country. One reporter stated, that this kind of weather is &quot;just not normal here. Israel is a place known for its sunshine --- 300 days a year -- not this persistent, insistent rain, sleet, wind and storms...Hail and snow feature high on the type of weather that apocalyptic believers say is likely to come with any end of our age. Floods and storms ravaging the land also play big roles in eschatology.&quot; 

The Bible says in Luke 21:25: &quot;And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring.&quot; 

Job 38:22-23 says, &quot;Have you entered the storehouses of snow or seen the storehouses of hail, which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle.&quot; 

Israel confirms plans to test missile system as meeting with Obama nears. According to The Guardian, Israel is to test an advanced anti-ballistic missile system in the coming weeks, inevitably fuelling speculation about preparations for a possible military confrontation with Iran. The announcement that the first test of the Arrow 3 interceptor system would be performed &quot;in the near future&quot; was made as the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, flew to the US ahead of a crucial meeting with President Barack Obama at which Iran will top the agenda. 

President Obama cautions against &quot;a premature attack&quot; on Iran. According to DEBKAfile, in a widely reported interview to The Atlantic, US President Barack Obama held to the line which he claimed &quot;the Israelis share&quot; that &quot;Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon and is not yet in a position to obtain a nuclear weapon without us having a pretty long lead time…&quot; He went on to reiterate the effectiveness of diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions on Iran's regime. 

The Bible says in Deuteronomy 33:29: &quot;O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and the sword of thy excellency! Thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.&quot;

    <title>Pentagon Prepares &quot;Aerial Refueling&quot; for Israeli Planes Striking Iran (Second Coming Watch Update #29)</title>
    <description>The Pentagon is preparing &quot;aerial refueling&quot; for Israeli planes striking Iran. According to DEBKAfile, in a dramatic U-turn to show Israel that Washington is serious about its military option against Iran's nuclear program, Pentagon officials disclosed on March 1 that military options being prepared &quot;start with providing refueling for Israeli planes and include attacking the pillars of the clerical regime. They include the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its elite Quds (Kudz) Force, regular Iranian military bases and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security.&quot; The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in Washington's first public reference to possible joint military action with Israel against Iran.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tel Aviv prepares bomb shelters amid Iranian tensions. According to the Associated Press, underneath the plaza outside Israel's Ha-bi-ma national theater, Israel has put the finishing touches on a new gathering place that it hopes will never host a crowd: the country's most advanced public underground bomb shelter. The shelter, four stories underground and with space for 1,600 people, is part of Tel Aviv's elaborate civil defense infrastructure. City officials have been beefing up shelters and emergency services in recent months at a time of rising tensions with Iran and militant groups in the Gaza Strip.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Benjamin Netanyahu is on his way to the U.S. to talk about Iran. According to the Associated Press, Israel's prime minister sets off this week on a U.S. visit clouded by a deepening rift with Washington, which is pressing Israel to hold off on any attack against Iran's suspected nuclear program. These differences have created tension ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's arrival at the White House on Monday. Aides to the Israeli leader would not say what he plans to tell President Barack Obama. Israel's Vice Premier said, &quot;The meeting will be a good opportunity to clarify both sides' stands on how to act against the Iranian nuclear threat, which both sides agree is grave.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Deuteronomy 33:29: &quot;O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and the sword of thy excellency! Thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.&quot;

    <title>More than 30 Christians in China Detained and Fined (Second Coming Watch Update #28)</title>
    <description>More Than 30 Christians In China Detained and Fined. According to ChinaAid, local authorities in far western China raided a house church Bible study group and detained more than 30 Christians, four of whom remain in custody. They also fined each person 5000 yuan (about $795 U.S. dollars). The raid occurred in Wusu in the far western region of Xin-jiang, as more than 30 house church staff were having a Bible study with some Christians visiting from coastal Shan-dong province.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Paul says in 2 Corinthians 12:10: &quot;Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
U.S. has military plan in place should conflict erupt with Iran. According to Haaretz, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz said Wednesday that Washington has prepared military options to strike Iran's nuclear sites should conflict erupt. Just four days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's scheduled meeting with President Barack Obama in Washington, Schwartz told reporters that military options are being prepared in the event of a conflict.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran says its enemies will face 'rainy day' weapons in case of attack. According to Haaretz, Iran is prepared with hidden &quot;rainy day&quot; military capabilities it is saving for when it is attacked. Iranian Defense Minister Ah-mad Va-hi-di warned potential enemies of a &quot;new environment&quot; created by Iran's developing arms industry.

According to ChinaAid, local authorities in far western China raided a house church Bible study group and detained more than 30 Christians, four of whom remain in custody. They also fined each person 5000 yuan (about $795 U.S. dollars).

    <title>Hezbollah Says Israeli Attack on Iran Would Set Middle East Ablaze (Second Coming Watch Update #27)</title>
    <description>Hezbollah says an Israeli attack on Iran would set the Middle East ablaze. Acording to Haaretz, the deputy head of Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement said An Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program would set the Middle East ablaze, possibly drag in the United States and unleash a conflict beyond Israel's control. The United States and Israel have not ruled out a military strike on Iran to halt its nuclear program, which Israel believes is intended to build atomic weapons and Tehran says is for producing energy.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel says it can defend itself against barrages from Iran. According to the Jerusalem Post, A-ri-eh Her-zog, who recently stepped down as head of the Defense Ministry's Homa Missile Defense Agency, says Israel's Arrow missile defense system could intercept barrages of Iranian long-range missiles. He spoke as there is an increasing chance that Israel is planning to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran denies any atomic activity at suspected military site. According to the AFP, Iran said on Wednesday that &quot;no nuclear activity whatsoever&quot; has taken place at its military site of Parchin, which UN nuclear watchdog inspectors demanded last week to visit but were refused. The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week it &quot;continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme&quot;  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 24:6, &quot;And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.&quot;

    <title>Israel Will Not Warn the U.S. Before a Strike on Iran (Second Coming Watch Update #26)</title>
    <description>Israel will not warn the U.S. before a strike on Iran. Acording to the Associated Press and one U.S. intelligence official familiar with the discussions, Israeli officials say they won't warn the U.S. if they decide to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities. The pronouncement, delivered in a series of private, top-level conversations, sets a tense tone ahead of meetings in the coming days at the White House and Capitol Hill.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Netanyahu slams Palestinian leader's speech about Jerusalem. According to the Associated Press, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for making an &quot;inflammatory speech&quot; about Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, saying his words undermine peace efforts. Speaking during a visit to Qatar, Abbas charged that Israel was intending to destroy Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, which sits atop the remains of the two biblical Jewish temples. It is the most sacred site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Russia upgrades systems to give Iran early warning of U.S. or Israeli strike. According to DEBKAfile, the Russians have upgraded their electronic and surveillance station south of Damascus and opposite Israel's Sea of Galilee, adding resources especially tailored to give Tehran early warning of an oncoming US or Israeli attack. The station was boosted by advanced technology and manpower, which cover military movements across all parts of Israel and Jordan, the Gulf of Aqaba and northern Saudi Arabia.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
God promises Israel in Isaiah 54:17, &quot;No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.&quot;

    <title>Iran and Lebanon Strengthen Defence Ties and Criticize Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #25)</title>
    <description>Iran and Lebanon strengthen defence ties and criticize Israel. According to the AFP, Iran and Lebanon talked up their defence ties and warned Israel against any aggression, during a visit to Tehran by Lebanese Defence Minister Fayez Ghosn. Iran's defence minister, Ahmad Vahdi, said &quot;reinforcing the Lebanese army is in the strategic policies of the Islamic republic&quot; and that Lebanon's security was &quot;an important part of stability in the region.&quot;  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Netanyahu wants Israeli ministers to keep quiet on Iran. According to Ynet news, Netanyahu instructed all government ministers to refrain from submitting to interviews on the Iran issue, unless they receive a special permit in advance. Netanyahu instructed all government ministers to refrain from submitting to interviews on the Iran issue, unless they receive a special permit in advance.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21:9, &quot;But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Imprisoned Iranian pastor is still alive, but execution is imminent. According to International Christian Concern and the American Center for Law &amp; Justice, sources in Iran have confirmed that  Youcef Nadarkhani is still alive. While his execution has been ordered, it is clear that renewed international pressure on Iran for Pastor Youcef's release is having an impact. The ACLJ said, &quot;It is this immense pressure that continues to keep Pastor Youcef alive.&quot;  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I Peter 4:16 says, &quot;If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.&quot;

Imprisoned Iranian pastor is still alive, but execution is imminent. According to International Christian Concern and the American Center for Law &amp; Justice, sources in Iran have confirmed that  Youcef Nadarkhani is still alive. While his execution has been ordered, it is clear that renewed international pressure on Iran for Pastor Youcef's release is having an impact. The ACLJ said, &quot;It is this immense pressure that continues to keep Pastor Youcef alive.&quot;

    <title>Iran says it is 'ready to wipe Israel off the map' (Second Coming Watch Update #24)</title>
    <description>Iran says a Pre-emptive Attack will Lead to the Destruction of Israel. According to The Associated Press,  Iran's defense minister warned that an Israeli attack on Iran will lead to the collapse of the Jewish state. In one of the strongest statements from Iran, Gen. Ah-mad Va-hi-di indicated Tehran would punish Israel should it attack Iran's nuclear facilities. His comments on Press TV come as Israel has recently stepped up its verbal threats that it may attack Iran's nuclear facilities.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An Israeli attack on Iran might pull the U.S. into a new war. According to The Associated Press, an Israeli pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear sites could draw the U.S. into a new Mideast conflict, a prospect dreaded by a war-weary Pentagon wary of new entanglements. That could mean pressing into service the top tier of American firepower -- warplanes, warships, special operations forces and possibly airborne infantry -- with unpredictable outcomes in one of the world's most volatile regions. Ka-rim Sad-jad-pour, a Middle East specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said &quot;Israel can commence a war with Iran, but it may well take U.S. involvement to conclude it.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
God promised Israel in Deuteronomy 20:1: &quot;When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
West Virginia Officials Ask Government to Provide Christians with an Exemption from the Proposed Real ID Act. According to the Register-Herald, Sen. Clark Barnes and Philip Hudok spoke in support of a bill which seeks to extend an exemption to the Real ID on religious grounds. Hudok told the Senate Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, &quot;If we as Christians comply with the Real ID act, we would be enrolled into a global system of identification that directly links our body through biometrics to our ability to buy or sell.&quot;  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Revelation 13:16 and 17 that during the Tribulation, the Antichrist &quot;causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.&quot;

    <title>Slain Iranian Nuclear Scientist's ‘Ultimate Goal Was Annihilation of Israel’ (Second Coming Watch #22)</title>
    <description>The Wife of a Slain Iranian Nuclear Scientist Admits his ‘Ultimate Goal Was the Annihilation of Israel’. According to The Blaze, the wife of slain nuclear scientist Mostafa Roshan told the Iranian Fars News Agency that her husband wholeheartedly sought Israel’s destruction. Mostafa Roshan, a chemistry expert and a director of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, was killed during morning rush hour in Tehran in January after a magnetic bomb was attached to his car. His wife, Fatemeh, stated &quot;Mostafa’s ultimate goal was the annihilation of Israel&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An Iranian Court Sentences a Christian Pastor to Death. According to FOX News, a trial court in Iran has issued its final verdict, ordering a Christian pastor to be put to death for leaving Islam and converting to Christianity. Supporters fear Youcef Nadarkhani, a 34-year-old father of two who was arrested over two years ago on charges of apostasy, may now be executed at any time without prior warning, as death sentences in Iran may be carried out immediately or dragged out for years.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Matthew 5:10: &quot;Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israeli President says a Nuclear Iran Would be a Catastrophe. According to Haaretz, President Shimon Peres said Thursday that an Iranian regime with nuclear weapons would be a “catastrophe”, and stressed that Israel has the right to defend itself. He also stated that if Iran attained a nuclear weapon it would be impossible to prevent it from exporting terror freely or stop it from controlling the world economy.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Psalm 122:6 that we should, &quot;Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.&quot;

    <title>Iran Remains Defiant as Nuclear Talks Fail Once Again (Second Coming Watch Update #21)</title>
    <description>Iran remains defiant as nuclear talks fail once again. According to Reuters, the U.N. nuclear watchdog ended its latest mission to Iran after talks on Tehran's suspected secret atomic weapons research failed, a setback likely to increase the risk of confrontation with the West. The United States criticized Iran over the failure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's latest mission, saying it again showed Tehran's refusal to abide by its international obligations over its nuclear program. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Russia Again Warns Israel Against a Strike on Iran. According to Reuters, Russia warned Israel that attacking Iran would be disastrous. Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov told a news conference, &quot;Of course any possible military scenario against Iran will be catastrophic for the region and for the whole system of international relations.&quot; It was one of Russia's starkest warnings yet against resorting to force to deal with Iran. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel says Iran will have a U.S.-range missile in 2-3 years. According to Reuters, an Israeli minister said Israel believes that within 2-3 years Iran will have intercontinental missiles able to hit the United States. His remarks were aimed at raising awareness of the threat it believes a nuclear Iran would pose to the world. Analysts now estimate the longest range of an Iranian missile to be about 1,500 miles, capable of reaching Tehran's arch-enemy, Israel, as well as Europe. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Bible says in Luke 21:9, &quot;But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In closing, remember the words of the Lord in Matthew 24:42: &quot;Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.&quot; Matthew 24:44 says, &quot;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are not ready, John 3:16 says &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; May I encourage you to accept Jesus Christ as your Saviour today so that you can be ready for Jesus Christ's return.</description>

    <title>Tehran Says it Will Take Pre-emptive Action if Iran Feels Endangered (Second Coming Watch Update #20)</title>
    <description>Tehran says it will take pre-emptive action if Iran feels endangered. According to Haaretz, the deputy head of the Islamic Republic's armed forces said Iran would take pre-emptive action against its enemies if it felt its national interests were endangered. Mohammad He-ja-zi told Fars news agency, &quot;Our strategy now is that if we feel our enemies want to endanger Iran's national interests, and want to decide to do that, we will act without waiting for their actions.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israeli Defence Forces find powerful explosive device on Israeli-Egyptian border. According to Haaretz, IDF soldiers found an explosive device on the Israeli-Egyptian border, which according to the IDF spokesperson thwarted an attempted terror attack. The IDF said in a statement that soldiers identified a man who smuggled a bag across the border and then fled the scene. Soldiers carried out a search, found the bag, which contained a powerful explosive device, and then detonated the bomb. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Turkey and China are reportedly 'helping Iran evade UN sanctions'. According to British newspaper, The Telegraph, Iran's central bank is using a number of financial institutions in China and Turkey to fund the purchase of vital goods to keep the Iranian economy afloat in an attempt to escape the effects of the wide-ranging sanctions imposed over Iran's illegal nuclear program. According to Western security officials, China, which is Iran's largest oil trading partner, is playing a major role in helping Iran to avoid the sanctions

    <title>China Rebukes Iran for Stopping Oil Sales to Britain and France (Second Coming Watch Update #19)</title>
    <description>China rebukes Iran for stopping oil sales to Britain and France. According to Reuters, China rebuked Iran for stopping oil sales to British and French companies, calling for renewed efforts at dialogue over an escalating stand-off over Tehran's controversial nuclear program. China has repeatedly called for talks over Tehran's efforts to enrich its own uranium, which Western countries suspect is aimed at obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran has said the enrichment is for power generation 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Vladimir Putin says Russia needs a stronger military. According to the BBC, Putin has backed the modernisation of his country's military, less than a fortnight before a presidential vote. He wrote in a Russian newspaper, &quot;We must not tempt anyone with our weakness.&quot; The leading presidential candidate said Russia was planning to spend $772 billion over the next decade on 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles and more than 600 warplanes as well as nuclear submarines and S-400 missile defence systems. Mr Putin said Russia would never give away its potential of strategic deterrence and had to look ahead to the next 30-50 years.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
S. Korea ignores a threat from N. Korea to retaliate for military drill. According to Voice of America News, South Korea went ahead with an artillery drill Monday near a disputed maritime border despite an unusually explicit threat by North Korea to retaliate by shelling inhabited islands in the Yellow Sea. Officials in Seoul say the morning exercise was routine and included the firing of self-propelled howitzers and mortars. Attack helicopters also joined the exercise on the western frontier islands. North Korean had said that if South Korea fires recklessly, then it &quot;will not escape punishment thousands-fold more severe than the shelling of Yeonpyeong (YON-pyong) island.&quot;

    <title>US Military Chief, Martin Dempsey, Cautions Against Israeli Attack on Iran (Second Coming Watch Update #18)</title>
    <description>US military chief, Martin Dempsey, cautions against an Israeli attack on Iran. According to the Guardian, the United States is stepping up efforts to dissuade Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, with a strong public warning by the US military's most senior figure and the dispatch of two high-ranking officials to Jerusalem. General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said in a television interview that it was &quot;not prudent at this point&quot; to attack Iran, and &quot;a strike at this time would be destabilising&quot;. But in a comment likely to fuel speculation about Israel's military plans, he added: &quot;I wouldn't suggest we've persuaded them that our view is the correct view.&quot;  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Iran Foreign Minister says his country is ready to face a 'worst-case scenario' to defend its nuclear program. According to Haaretz, Iran is determined to pursue the advancement of its nuclear program, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said, adding that Tehran was prepared for any &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; in an attempt to defend its nuclear aspirations. Salehi's comments came after U.S. National Adviser Tom Donilon arrived in Israel to discuss Iran's nuclear standoff with the West with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran has cut oil exports to Britain and France. According to the Associated Press, Iran's Oil Ministry  has halted oil shipments to Britain and France, in an apparent pre-emptive blow against the European Union after the bloc imposed sanctions on Iran's crucial fuel exports. The EU imposed tough sanctions against Iran last month, which included a freeze of the country's central bank assets and an oil embargo set to begin in July. The 27-nation EU accounts for about 18 percent of Iran's oil exports.

    <title>Iranian Warships Sailed Into the Mediterranean (Second Coming Watch Update #17)</title>
    <description>Iranian warships have sailed into the Mediterranean. According to CNN, Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency reported on Saturday that two Iranian warships sailed through Egypt's Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea amid heightened tensions in the region. The move represents only the second time such ships have crossed the Suez Canal since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution. The first time took place in February 2011, just days after Egypt's post-Hosni Mubarak government gave the green light to the passage -- putting Egypt's new military leaders in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor. It is reported that the two vessels, a destroyer and a supply ship, went to Syria.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hamas is basing surface-to-air missiles in Sinai for attacks on Israel. According to World News Tribune, Islamic insurgents have deployed surface-to-air missiles in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula for  attacks on Israel The Washington Institute for Near East Policy said Hamas has joined with Bedouin insurgents to establish Sinai as a venue for SAM attacks on Israeli civilian and military aircraft. In a report, the institute said the insurgency network was believed to have acquired a range of Russian-origin air defense systems. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel seeks tighter sanctions against Iran. According to the AFP, Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak called on the world to tighten sanctions on Iran before the country enters a &quot;zone of immunity&quot; against a physical attack to stop its nuclear programme. He told a news conference in Tokyo, &quot;We have to accelerate the pace of imposing sanctions. The world should ratchet up the sanctions before the Iranians fully enter this immunity zone.&quot; Barak has often used the phrase &quot;zone of immunity&quot; to mean a point where Tehran's nuclear programme becomes invulnerable to physical attack.

    <title>Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt Threatens to Review Peace Treaty with Israel (Second Coming Watch Update #16)</title>
    <description>The Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt has threatened to review its peace treaty with Israel. According to The New York Times, the Islamist party that leads the new Egyptian Parliament is threatening to review the 1979 peace treaty with Israel if the United States cuts off aid to the country over a crackdown on American-backed nonprofit groups here. The pact is considered a linchpin of regional stability, and the statements, from at least two senior leaders of the party, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, represent the first time that Egyptians have explicitly raised it during an escalating standoff over the crackdown.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Japanese prime minister has warned Israel against a strike on Iran. According to the AFP, Japan's prime minister Yo-shi-hi-ko No-da urged Israel to refrain from military action against Iran. In a meeting in Tokyo with Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak, Noda warned that military action could be &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; as it risks &quot;escalating&quot; the current situation. Barak, who is on a five-day visit to Japan, declined to comment on whether Israel will retaliate against Iran, but urged the world to &quot;join hands&quot; in monitoring sanctions against the country. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran continues to arrest and persecute Christians. According to Persecution.org, Iranian Christians have requested our prayers following further pressure in recent days on officially registered churches and on house churches. Recently, an elder of the Assemblies of God church in Tehran, was arrested at his workplace. Two other churches in Tehran, Emmanuel Protestant Church and St Peter Evangelical Church, have been ordered to cease holding Farsi language services on Fridays. These churches are among the small number of officially registered churches that principally serve the Armenian and Assyrian communities of Iran. House churches, which have no official recognition and principally serve believers from Muslim backgrounds, continue to be under great pressure.

    <title>Netanyahu says International Sanctions Against Iran are Not Working (Second Coming Watch Update #15)</title>
    <description>Netanyahu says International sanctions against Iran are not working. According to Haaretz, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that sanctions against Iran had not yet worked, adding that Tehran's nuclear pursuits made it the most &quot;irresponsible&quot; country in the world. During a one-day visit to Cyprus, Netanyahu said &quot;Iran is the most irresponsible country in the world and it is breaking all the rules. The United States -- and any other country -- should be concerned because we have information of ongoing efforts and attempts by Iran to conduct terrorism in many parts of the world. Fortunately until now there has been no loss of life.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An Attack on Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has Been Thwarted. According to CBN News, Security forces in Singapore thwarted a potential terror attack against Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Barak was in Singapore to attend an international aviation exhibit. According to the report, the Mossad (Israel's secret service) provided a heads-up on three Iranian nationals, working with Hezbollah, who had accessed Barak's itinerary in Singapore and planned a possible assassination. Security personnel in Singapore took the three men into custody before the defense minister arrived. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The U.S. is Heightening Security Over the Iranian Threat. According to ABC News, with Iran allegedly striking out at Israeli citizens and Jewish targets around the world, Israeli and American security officials in the U.S. are on high alert. Federal officials told ABC News that there is so far no specific intelligence of any threat to Israeli interests in the U.S. They also noted that in cities like New York and Washington, D.C., &quot;the targets are much harder&quot; than in countries like India, Georgia and Thailand, where Iran has allegedly attacked or attempted to attack in the past two days.

    <itunes:summary>Netanyahu says International sanctions against Iran are not working. According to Haaretz, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that sanctions against Iran had not yet worked, adding that Tehran's nuclear pursuits made it the most &quot;irresponsible&quot; country in the world. During a one-day visit to Cyprus, Netanyahu said &quot;Iran is the most irresponsible country in the world and it is breaking all the rules. The United States -- and any other country -- should be concerned because we have information of ongoing efforts and attempts by Iran to conduct terrorism in many parts of the world. Fortunately until now there has been no loss of life.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An Attack on Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has Been Thwarted. According to CBN News, Security forces in Singapore thwarted a potential terror attack against Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Barak was in Singapore to attend an international aviation exhibit. According to the report, the Mossad (Israel's secret service) provided a heads-up on three Iranian nationals, working with Hezbollah, who had accessed Barak's itinerary in Singapore and planned a possible assassination. Security personnel in Singapore took the three men into custody before the defense minister arrived. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The U.S. is Heightening Security Over the Iranian Threat. According to ABC News, with Iran allegedly striking out at Israeli citizens and Jewish targets around the world, Israeli and American security officials in the U.S. are on high alert. Federal officials told ABC News that there is so far no specific intelligence of any threat to Israeli interests in the U.S. They also noted that in cities like New York and Washington, D.C., &quot;the targets are much harder&quot; than in countries like India, Georgia and Thailand, where Iran has allegedly attacked or attempted to attack in the past two days. However, they agreed that the recent incidents in India, Georgia, Thailand and Azerbaijan have &quot;all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign&quot; that could extend to U.S. soil.

    <title>Iran Trumpets its Nuclear Advances and Deepens Standoff with the West (Second Coming Watch Update #14)</title>
    <description>Iran trumpets its nuclear advances and deepens standoff with the West. According to Reuters, Iran proclaimed advances in nuclear know-how on Wednesday, including new centrifuges able to enrich uranium much faster, a move that may hasten a drift towards confrontation with the West over suspicions it is seeking the means to make atomic bombs. Tehran's resolve to pursue a nuclear program showed no sign of wavering despite Western sanctions inflicting increasing damage on its oil-based economy. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a live television broadcast, &quot;The era of bullying nations has passed. The arrogant powers cannot monopolize nuclear technology. They tried to prevent us by issuing sanctions and resolutions but failed. Our nuclear path will continue.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Russia Would Use Nuclear Weapons to Stave Off Threats. According to Russian news agency RIA Novosti,  Russian Gen. Nikolai Makarov said Russia would use nuclear weapons in response to any imminent threat to its national security. In a radio interview, he said, &quot;We are certainly not planning to fight against the whole of NATO, but if there is a threat to the integrity of the Russian Federation, we have the right to use nuclear weapons, and we will.&quot; The general said Russia's nuclear deterrent is the cornerstone of strategic stability and serious efforts are being taken by the Russian government to modernize the country's nuclear triad. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thailand says Arrested Iranians Were Indeed Planning to Attack Israeli Diplomats. According to The Associated Press, Thailand's top policeman said three Iranians detained after accidentally setting off explosives in Bangkok were planning to attack Israeli diplomats. The allegation came after days of strong accusations by Israel that Iran was behind the botched plot as well as two others in India and the former Soviet republic of Georgia this week. Iran has denied the charges. Citing the similarity of bombs used in New Delhi and Tblisi, national police chief Gen. Prewpan Dhamapong said that Thai authorities now &quot;know for certain that (the target) was Israeli diplomats.&quot;

    <title>Iran Expected to Unveil Nuclear 'Achievements' Today (Second Coming Watch Update #13)</title>
    <description>Iran is expected to unveil nuclear 'achievements' today. According to the AFP, an Iranian government website said President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is set to unveil several unspecified nuclear &quot;achievements&quot; on Wednesday. The official website stated that &quot;Several completed nuclear projects will be unveiled in the presence of the president...Experts believe these achievements will show the world the extraordinary capability and knowledge of Iranians.&quot; It added that the progress will underline Iran's scientific adherence to &quot;nuclear power for all and nuclear weapons for none.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israeli Minister says Iran Wants to Revive the Persian Empire. According to The Associated Press, Israel’s deputy prime minister said Tuesday that Iran wants to revive the Persian Empire and once again become a major superpower with a nuclear bomb. Silvan Shalom told reporters after meeting U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that Iran would like to change the types of regimes in the Middle East and take control of all the oil fields in the region as part of its quest for power. The ancient Persian Empire encompassed millions of miles (kilometers) in Asia, Africa and Europe. Shalom said if Iranians can change regimes in the Mideast, control its oil wealth and produce a nuclear bomb, “they believe that they will be once again a major superpower in the world.”

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Israel says Bangkok bombing is another Iranian terror attempt. According to the Associated Press, Israel said an explosion in Bangkok Tuesday that blew the legs off an Iranian man carrying grenades was an attempted terrorist attack sponsored by Tehran. Defense Minister Ehud Barak stopped short of saying the man was trying to target Israelis. However, it came a day after Israel blamed Iran for attacks targeting Israeli diplomats in India and Georgia. Barak stated that &quot;The attempted terrorist attack in Bangkok proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to perpetrate terror...Iran and Hezbollah are unrelenting terror elements endangering the stability of the region, and endangering the stability of the world.&quot;

    <title>Iran says its Nuclear Facilities are Immune to Cyber Attack (Second Coming Watch Update #12)</title>
    <description>Iran says its Nuclear Facilities are Immune to Cyber Attack. According to the Associated Press, a senior Iranian military official has claimed the country's nuclear facilities are immune to cyber attack. Gholam Reza Jalali, who heads an Iranian military unit in charge of combating sabotage, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that Iran and its nuclear facilities possess the technology and knowledge to deal with malicious software. He did not specify what steps have been taken since 2010, when a virus known as Stuxnet disrupted controls of some nuclear centrifuges.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Persecution of Christians is on the rise in Iran. According to World Net Daily, reports coming out of Iran say persecution of Christians is only growing more bold and brazen, as Iranian authorities once again raided a house church - this time in Shiraz - and arrested between 6 to 10 members of the congregation. The detainees are being held in an undisclosed location. &quot;Jihad Watch&quot; publisher Robert Spencer says that the Iranians don't know that they're doing the very thing that will produce more Christians. He said, &quot;They don't know that Christianity grows amid persecution...Islam has expanded through violence and intimidation, so it isn't at all surprising that they'd resort to it again.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The United States will cut its support for Israel's missile defense program by $6 million. According to Haaretz, U.S. officials said the U.S. budget proposed by the Obama administration for 2013 would cut the funding for Israeli missile defense programs by $6 million. The cut would affect the development of the Short Range Ballistic Missile Defense program and the Arrow System Improvement Program. The $3 billion annual military assistance to Israel, within the framework of the 10 years memorandum of understanding, will remain unchanged. The budget plan also stipulates that no funds be allocated to a Palestinian state unless the Secretary of State determines and certifies that the Palestinians have addressed a long list of issues including &quot;a firm commitment to peaceful co-existence with the State of Israel&quot; and &quot;taking appropriate measures to counter terrorism and terrorist financing in the West Bank and Gaza.&quot;

    <itunes:summary>Iran says its Nuclear Facilities are Immune to Cyber Attack. According to the Associated Press, a senior Iranian military official has claimed the country's nuclear facilities are immune to cyber attack. Gholam Reza Jalali, who heads an Iranian military unit in charge of combating sabotage, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that Iran and its nuclear facilities possess the technology and knowledge to deal with malicious software. He did not specify what steps have been taken since 2010, when a virus known as Stuxnet disrupted controls of some nuclear centrifuges.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Persecution of Christians is on the rise in Iran. According to World Net Daily, reports coming out of Iran say persecution of Christians is only growing more bold and brazen, as Iranian authorities once again raided a house church - this time in Shiraz - and arrested between 6 to 10 members of the congregation. The detainees are being held in an undisclosed location. &quot;Jihad Watch&quot; publisher Robert Spencer says that the Iranians don't know that they're doing the very thing that will produce more Christians. He said, &quot;They don't know that Christianity grows amid persecution...Islam has expanded through violence and intimidation, so it isn't at all surprising that they'd resort to it again.&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The United States will cut its support for Israel's missile defense program by $6 million. According to Haaretz, U.S. officials said the U.S. budget proposed by the Obama administration for 2013 would cut the funding for Israeli missile defense programs by $6 million. The cut would affect the development of the Short Range Ballistic Missile Defense program and the Arrow System Improvement Program. The $3 billion annual military assistance to Israel, within the framework of the 10 years memorandum of understanding, will remain unchanged. The budget plan also stipulates that no funds be allocated to a Palestinian state unless the Secretary of State determines and certifies that the Palestinians have addressed a long list of issues including &quot;a firm commitment to peaceful co-existence with the State of Israel&quot; and &quot;taking appropriate measures to counter terrorism and terrorist financing in the West Bank and Gaza.&quot;

    <title>Charles Krauthammer says Israel ‘Will Strike’ Iran to ‘Prevent a Second Holocaust’ (Second Coming Watch Update #11)</title>
    <description>Charles Krauthammer says Israel ‘will strike’ Iran to ‘prevent a second holocaust’. According to the Daily Caller, Washington Post columnist and Fox news analyst Charles Krauthammer doubled-down on an assertion he made about the inevitability of an Israeli strike on Iran to limit their nuclear capabilities. Krauthammer said, “Our own secretary of Defense has said it’s highly likely and he gave a timeframe — April, May, June, which means the Israelis think that the moment, the zone of immunity where they can no longer attack successfully is approaching... I think Israel will strike because it cannot live under the threat of annihilation from Iran.&quot; He also stated that “I cannot imagine the Israelis are going to allow Iran to go nuclear and to hold the Da-ma-klez sword over 6 million Jews all over again. Israel was established to prevent a second holocaust, not to invite one.”
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
U.S. Navy says it can prevent Iran from blocking the Strait of Hormuz. According to Reuters, the commander of U.S. naval forces in the Gulf said that Iran has built up its naval forces in the Gulf and prepared boats that could be used in suicide attacks, but the U.S. Navy can prevent it from blocking the Strait of Hormuz. Vice Admiral Mark Fox said the Iranians &quot;have increased the number of submarines ... they increased the number of fast attack craft...Some of the small boats have been outfitted with a large warhead that could be used as a suicide explosive device. The Iranians have a large mine inventory.&quot; Iran has made a series of threats in recent weeks to disrupt shipping in the Gulf or strike U.S. forces in retaliation if its oil trade is shut down by sanctions, or if its disputed nuclear program comes under attack. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran says it has smashed the 'idol' underpinning the Holocaust. According to the AFP, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran has broken the &quot;idol&quot; of the Holocaust underpinning the creation of the Israeli state and US hegmony. In a speech marking the anniversary of his country's 1979 Islamic revolution, Ah-ma-din-e-jad said, &quot;The world arrogance (the United States) and colonialists (the West), in order to dominate the world, created an idol called the Zionist regime (Israel)...The spirit of this idol was a story called the Holocaust... The Iranian nation with courage and wisdom smashed this idol to free the people of the West (of its hold).&quot; Iran denies Israel's right to exist and has said it will back any group trying to put an end to the Jewish state. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Netanyahu says Abbas has turned his back on peace. According to The Jerusalem Post, The Prime Minister's Office responded to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas threat at the Arab League in Cairo on Sunday by saying he has &quot;turned his back on peace.&quot; The statement read in part, &quot;Instead of entering into negotiations that will lead to an end to the conflict, Abbas prefers to join up with the Hamas terrorist organization, the same Hamas that is hugging Iran.&quot; In a speech before Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo, Abbas warned that if Israel did not reply to his messages, he would resume efforts to unilaterally seek United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state.

    <title>Nearly Half of Americans Favor a Strike on Iran (Second Coming Watch Update #10)</title>
    <description>Nearly half of Americans favor a strike on Iran. According to Ynet News, nearly half of American voters think the United States should use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The poll was conducted by Pulse Opinion Research for The Hill newspaper which covers events relating to the Congress. 49% of respondents said military force should be used, while 31% said it should not and 20% were not sure. In addition, 62% of respondents said they were somewhat or very concerned about Iran launching a terror attack against the United States, while 37% said they were not very concerned or not at all concerned. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iran vows to back the Palestinian resistance. According to the Jerusalem Post, Iran pledged to back Palestinian resistance against Israel, saying &quot;soon the Zionist regime will be punished for its plots and aggression,&quot; Iran's first Vice President Mohammad Re-za Ra-hi-mi made the remarks to visiting Hamas Prime Minister Is-ma-il Ha-ni-yeh, who arrived for a three-day trip. Rahimi went on to say that &quot;Iran will not retreat one iota from its position on defending the rights of the Palestinian people.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christians are upset as major court rulings go against British worshippers. According to Persecution.org, a landmark legal ruling banning the tradition of saying prayers at council meetings was denounced as an ‘assault on Britain’s Christian heritage’. The High Court controversially backed an anti-religious campaign to abolish official acts of worship. Christians and politicians reacted with dismay after a judge overturned centuries of custom by outlawing a town hall from putting prayers on the formal agenda. The ruling means prayers will not be allowed at the start of council meetings across England and Wales.

    <title>Saudi Arabia Will Buy Nuclear Weapons if Iran Tests an Atomic Bomb (Second Coming Watch Update #9)</title>
    <description>Saudi Arabia will buy nuclear weapons if Iran tests an atomic bomb. According to NBC News, a report says that Saudi Arabia would move quickly to acquire nuclear weapons if Iran successfully tests an atomic bomb. Citing an unidentified Saudi Arabian source, the Times newspaper in the U.K. said that the kingdom would seek to buy ready-made warheads and also begin its own program to enrich weapons-grade uranium. The paper suggested that Pakistan was the country most likely to supply Saudi Arabia with weapons, saying Western officials were convinced there was an understanding between the countries to do so if the security situation in the Persian Gulf gets worse. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have denied such an arrangement exists.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Israel's Arrow missile defense system has successfully been tested. According to the Jerusalem Post, In the face of Iran's continued pursuit of a nuclear weapon, Israel tested the Arrow missile defense system in what officials said was a successful demonstration of the country's ability to defend itself in a future war. An F-15 Israel Air Force fighter jet launched a Blue Sparrow, a missile developed to impersonate long-range Iranian ballistic missiles. The Arrow's radar and detection system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries detected the incoming &quot;enemy&quot; missile and tracked it together with the US X-Band radar deployed in the Negev dessert. Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Friday praised all those that took part in the successful test.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is the Church in Nigeria ‘being eliminated’? According to Christian Today, the Church of England’s ruling body called this week on the Government to “do all it can” to support the protection of religious minorities in Nigeria. In an address to the General Synod, the Bishop of Durham, Rev Justin Welby, said violence in Nigeria had become “pervasive” and that the church had gathered &quot;to consider the fate of a church that in the north of Nigeria is systematically, deliberately and progressively being eliminated.&quot; While he acknowledged that some attacks were being committed against Muslims, he said the “vast majority” of the violence was being directed at Christians.

According to NBC News, a report says that Saudi Arabia would move quickly to acquire nuclear weapons if Iran successfully tests an atomic bomb. Citing an unidentified Saudi Arabian source, the Times newspaper in the U.K. said that the kingdom would seek to buy ready-made warheads and also begin its own program to enrich weapons-grade uranium. The paper suggested that Pakistan was the country most likely to supply Saudi Arabia with weapons, saying Western officials were convinced there was an understanding between the countries to do so if the security situation in the Persian Gulf gets worse. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have denied such an arrangement exists.

Israel's Arrow missile defense system has successfully been tested. According to the Jerusalem Post, In the face of Iran's continued pursuit of a nuclear weapon, Israel tested the Arrow missile defense system in what officials said was a successful demonstration of the country's ability to defend itself in a future war. An F-15 Israel Air Force fighter jet launched a Blue Sparrow, a missile developed to impersonate long-range Iranian ballistic missiles. The Arrow's radar and detection system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries detected the incoming &quot;enemy&quot; missile and tracked it together with the US X-Band radar deployed in the Negev dessert. Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Friday praised all those that took part in the successful test.

Is the Church in Nigeria ‘being eliminated’? According to Christian Today, the Church of England’s ruling body called this week on the Government to “do all it can” to support the protection of religious minorities in Nigeria. In an address to the General Synod, the Bishop of Durham, Rev Justin Welby, said violence in Nigeria had become “pervasive” and that the church had gathered &quot;to consider the fate of a church that in the north of Nigeria is systematically, deliberately and progressively being eliminated.&quot; While he acknowledged that some attacks were being committed against Muslims, he said the “vast majority” of the violence was being directed at Christians.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Signs of His Coming: World's First 'Inter-Religious' University Concludes its First Semester | After 821 Days, Iranian Christian Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani Remains Imprisoned
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Prophecy Bootcamp: Today, we are beginning a new series titled &quot;The Rapture is the Hope of the Church&quot; from John MacArthur. Our first lesson in this series is titled &quot;What the Christian's Hope Is Not.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Action Point: One of the things God wants us to do in light of His second coming is Faithfully Attend and Participate in a Local Bible Believing Church. Listen to what God has to say about this important subject in Hebrews 10: 23-26: &quot;Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner  of some is; but exhorting one another and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.&quot;

Signs of His Coming: CNBC is Reporting that the Global Economy Would Collapse in 7 Days if the Earth Were Hit by a Major Disaster | The Prime Minister of Gaza has Stated that Hamas Will Never Give Up Its Weapons or Territory and that it Will Not Renounce its Claims on Jerusalem
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Prophecy Bootcamp: Today, we are going to continue our study on &quot;The Rapture&quot; from Dr. John MacArthur. If you recall, from our previous broadcasts, we have covered the first pillar of the rapture which is the death of Christ and the second pillar of the rapture which is the resurrection of Christ. Today, we will discuss the third pillar of the rapture which is the revelation of Christ.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Action Point: One of the things God wants us to do in light of His second coming is Live a Holy Life Before Him.

    <title>The Second Pillar of the Rapture (Part 2), Plus Breaking Prophecy News (#2)</title>
    <description>The Prophet Daniel's Report #2
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Signs of His Coming: Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states are on alert for military action between the US and Iran; An Israeli Government Report says that Israel Could Take Out Iran's Nuclear Infrastructure 'In Two Days'
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Prophecy Bootcamp: Today, we are going to continue our study on &quot;The Rapture&quot; from Dr. John MacArthur. If you recall, from yesterday, we took a look at &quot;the First Pillar of the Rapture&quot; which is the death of Jesus Christ. Today, we will discuss &quot;the second Pillar of the Rapture&quot; which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Action Point: The second thing that God wants us to do in light of the second coming of Jesus Christ is to confess our sins when we commit them. One of the main reasons why God wants us to do this is so that we can maintain that sweet fellowship between us. When we as Christians sin, it does not cause us to lose our salvation, but it does cause us to lose fellowship with God. </description>

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Signs of His Coming: Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has vowed that they will not recognize the state of Israel and Russia's Vladimir Putin dreams of a sweeping Eurasian Union. We will look at these developments through the lens of Scripture.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Prophecy Bootcamp: Today, we begin a study on &quot;The Rapture&quot; from John MacArthur, and in the next few broadcasts, we will discuss the the Pillars of the Rapture, the Participants in the Rapture, the Plan of the Rapture and the Profit, or benefit, of the Rapture.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Action Point: If you do not already know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour, God wants you to get to know Him before He returns. If you desire to be saved, you will be glad to know that it is very simple.</description>
