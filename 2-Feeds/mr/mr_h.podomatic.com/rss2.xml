      <title>The Beginning Of The Armadillos</title>
      <description>This Kipling &quot;Just So&quot; story is an imaginative and confusing (at least for the Jaguar) explanation of how the Armadillo came to be. It begins with a close encounter of the dangerous kind for two Amazonian creatures, but ends happily (except for the Jaguar). Did I mention confusing?? Better listen verrrrry carefully.
Like what you hear or have some suggestions??? Let me know. I very much enjoy hearing from you.</description>

      <title>Rudyard Kipling's &amp;quot;The Crab That Played With The Sea&amp;quot;</title>
      <description>This is another Kipling &quot;Just So&quot; story that has a crab (obviously), a little girl, an old man, a rat, and a magician of course, to name just a few of the characters in this story.
There is nothing scary here unless an angry magician frightens you. Come to think of it,.......perhaps an angry magician SHOULD frighten you.  Hehe.
This story is somewhat long (just under 28 minutes) so listen in installments or use it to &quot;shorten&quot; the trip for the children (or yourself).
Thanks to all of you who have left comments or sent e-mail. They certainly &quot;recharge my batteries&quot;. Bless you.

      <title>Rudyard Kipling's &amp;quot;How The Leopard Got His Spots&amp;quot;</title>
      <description>This another &quot;Just So&quot; story by Rudyard Kipling, although I'm beginning to think they should be the &quot;'Sclusively&quot; stories because he uses that word so often.
It's about a Leopard and a Man who hunt together, but find that they must &quot;change&quot; to survive. Quite pleasant, nothing scary. It is implied that the Man and Leopard eat the animals they hunt but it is never actually stated. 
&quot;Listen to the words and tell me what you see. AH HA! Your imagination, the best multimedia system there is&quot;.  Mr. H</description>

      <title>Rudyard Kipling's &amp;quot;The Cat That Walked By Himself&amp;quot;</title>
      <description>This &quot;Just So&quot; story by Kipling is a bit longer than the others here, but the interaction/conflict between the cat and the woman may make it hard to &quot;put down&quot;. Nothing scary here so invite the little ones in for a listen.
Please forgive the long pause between my last posted story and this one. With school out I have a responsibility to teach my sons the value of getting in a good days work around the house and yard. My efforts are not entirely appreciated (hehehe). </description>

      <title>Rudyard Kipling's &amp;quot;How The Camel Got His Hump&amp;quot;</title>
      <description>A pleasant &quot;Just So&quot; story that is fairly short (approx. 10 min.), and has a poem at the end.  It addresses the &quot;dangers&quot; of excessive idleness in a light hearted way.  I have also recorded a quick introduction to the story that gives a few more details.  
Please don't hesitate to leave comments or suggestions. I love hearing from you. </description>

      <title>Rudyard Kipling's &amp;quot;The Butterfly That Stamped&amp;quot;</title>
      <description>This is another &quot;Just So&quot; story by Kipling though a bit longer than the first. I particularly enjoy this one. There is something sweetly beautiful about it. Nothing spooky or scary here.
It also contains some lessons. Exactly what sort of lessons I will not say, for what I hear and see in the story might not be what others hear and see. Each child (whatever age : )  ) should have the opportunity to experience the story in their own way, without having someone tell them what they ought to feel, or see, or hear. 
This story is about 25 minutes, so if need be, listen to half one day and the other half the next. It's a good story.

      <title>Rudyard Kipling's &amp;quot;The Elephant's Child&amp;quot;</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/20541/600x600_640477.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of Kipling's &quot;Just So&quot; stories which were written more than a hundred years ago. He occassionally intentionally mispronounces words as a child might, so you may want to be available to &quot;interpret&quot; for the children. There is some enthusiastic spanking and a bit of retaliation in this particular story but the fourth graders I read to had absolutely no problem with it. There is also a very unfriendly crocodile so perhaps it would be better for the littlest ones if they did not listen just before bed time.
&quot;Listen to the words and tell me what you see. Ah Ha!! Your imagination! The best multimedia system there is.&quot;
