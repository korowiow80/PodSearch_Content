<li><a title="Visit the Double Shadow podcast website" href="http://www.thedoubleshadow.com/">The Double Shadow Podcast </a>(www.thedoubleshadow.com)<br />
An exciting new podcast dedicated to American M.R. James admire Clark Ashton Smith.</li>
<li><a title="Visit the Nunkie Theatre Company Website" href="http://www.nunkie.co.uk">M.R. James performances by the Nunkie Theatre Company</a> (www.nunkie.co.uk)<br />
Nunkie Theatre Company has announced another run of performances based on M.R. James stories performed by the grand panjandrum and actor Robert Lloyd Parry. He will be invoking a pleasing terror in audiences throughout the UK between July and December. Don&#8217;t miss!</li>
<li><a title="Read about it at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stalls_of_Barchester">The Stalls of Barchester</a> (1971 TV version &#8211; wikipedia)<br />
This story has been dramatised for the screen only once, back in 1971, as the first installment of  BBC television&#8217;s classic &#8216;Ghost Story for Christmas&#8217; series. The series is finally being given the <a title="Read about the DVD versions at the BFI Website" href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/179">DVD treatment</a> this year by the BFI.</li>
<li><a title="Read about the series on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_Barsetshire">Anthony Trollope&#8217;s Chronicles of Barsetshire</a> (wikipedia)<br />
Was M.R. James&#8217;s Barchester based on the identically-named cathedral town which features heavily in a series of books by Anthony T? Or is that just a load of old Trollope?</li>
<li><a title="Read about the Gentleman's Magazine on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gentleman%27s_Magazine">The Gentlemen&#8217;s Magazine</a> (wikipedia)<br />
In this story Archdeacon Haynes&#8217;s obituary is said to have featured in the Gentleman&#8217;s magazine, which ran between 1731 and 1922.</li>
<li><a title="Read about Sir Gilbert Scott at wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gilbert_Scott">Sir George Gilbert Scott</a> (wikipedia)<br />
The cathedral in James&#8217;s story is said to have been redesigned by Sir Gilbert Scott. James was not a fan of the rather radical changes which architects like Scott inflicted on English churches during the 19th century.</li>
<li><a title="Visit recmusic.com" href="http://www.recmusic.org/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=21402">The Friar of Orders Grey</a> (recmusic.com)<br />
Haynes&#8217;s description of the choir stalls describes one as appearing like a &#8216;friar of orders grey&#8217;. This is a nod to a popular folk ballad about a bawdy Franciscan friar.</li>
<li><a title="Visit the BBC Website" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00dty2b">St George&#8217;s Chapel at Windsor Castle</a> (BBC Website)<br />
The ornate carvings described in this story could have been inspired by the misericords at a chapel in Windsor, near Eton where James spent much of his life. He went on to write a book about them in 1933 &#8211; &#8216;St Geroge&#8217;s Chapel, Windsor: The Woodwork of the choir&#8217;.</li>

James.</p>
<p>Show notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Read about Comparative Mythology on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_mythology">Comparative Mythology</a> and the <a title="Read about the Cambridhe Ritualists on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Ritualists">Cambridge Ritualists</a> (Wikipedia)<br />
The criticism of Karswell&#8217;s writing style could be read as M.R. James having a dig at his academic contemporaries working in theoretical subjects that James thought were nonsense. For example see <a title="Read an essay that looks at James's criticism of Jane Ellen Harrison" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612029600200114">James&#8217;s &#8216;flaying&#8217; of Jane Ellen Harrison</a> (erratum: we incorrectly call her &#8216;Katherine Harrison&#8217; in recording, sorry!).</li>
<li><a title="Read about the Golden Legend on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend">The Golden Legend</a> and <a title="Read about the Golden Bough on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Bough">The Golden Bough</a> (Wikipedia)<br />
The two very different texts which Mr Karswell is described as putting exactly on par and taking both as historical fact.</li>
<li><a title="Read about Thomas Bewick on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bewick">Thomas Bewick (1753-1826)</a> (Wikipedia)<br />
The &#8220;woodcut of Bewick&#8217;s&#8221; mentioned in Casting the Runes refers to English wood engraver Thomas Bewick, whose work varied between both studies of nature and the bawdy and macabre. For example <a title="View Thomas Bewick image" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bewickthief_big.jpg">a man followed by demons</a>, <a title="View man urinating on a wall by Thomas Bewick" href="http://www.fulltable.com/vts/aoi/b/bewick/v/18.jpg%20">a man urinating on a wall</a>, and <a title="View this image" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/headers/3359790/original.BMP?1312498894">men riding gravestones</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Read about the Black Spot on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_%28Treasure_Island%29">The &#8216;Black Spot&#8217;</a> (Wikipedia)<br />
James refers to the &#8216;black spot&#8217; being put on John Harrington, a reference to Treasure Island (1883) by Robert Lewis Stevenson.</li>
<li><a title="Read this poem on Project Gutenberg" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/151/151-h/151-h.htm">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a> (Project Gutenberg)<br />
The extract from the poem which Karswell sends to Harrington can be found in &#8216;Part the Sixth&#8217; of Coleridge&#8217;s &#8216;Rime of the Ancient Mariner).</li>
<li><a title="Read about the History of the Lord Warden Hotel" href="http://www.dover-kent.co.uk/leisure/lord_warden_hotel.htm">Lord Warden Hotel, Dover</a> (www.dover-kent.co.uk)<br />
Dunning and Harrington finish their adventure at a real hotel in Dover, the Lord Warden. The building is still there today, but no longer a hotel.</li>
<li><a title="Read about Abbeville on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbeville">St. Vulfran&#8217;s Church, Abbeville, France</a> (Wikipedia)<br />
Karswell meets his death at a French church that M.R. James had visited on a previous holiday. The church is dedicated to <a title="Read about St Vulfran" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulfram_of_Sens">St. Vulfran (or Wulfram) of Sens</a>. Karswell&#8217;s death reminded us of the death of <a title="Watch this scene from Hot Fuzz on youtube." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BavTQmiA9mc">Adam Buxton&#8217;s character in Hot Fuzz</a> (youtube &#8211; warning, it is gory!).</li>
<li><a title="Visit the Irish Gothic Horror Journal website" href="http://irishgothichorrorjournal.homestead.com/TelevisionReviews4.html#anchor_65">Casting the Runes (1979)</a> (Irish Gothic Horror Journal)<br />
An excellent review of the 1979 tv version of Casting the Runes. As mentioned in the podcast, we also didn&#8217;t rate it very highly but still recommend you <a title="Buy this dvd on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Casting-Runes-DVD-Edward-Petherbridge/dp/B000TP4FT8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336663394&amp;sr=8-1">purchase the dvd</a> if only for the interesting extras that come on the disc.</li>
<li><a title="Watch the video on Youtube" href="http://t.co/8zUsnrUy">Kate Bush/Night of the Demon mashup</a> (Youtube)<br />
The &#8220;it&#8217;s in the trees! It&#8217;s coming!&#8221; sample from the start of Kate Bush&#8217;s &#8216;Hounds of Love&#8217; is a sample from Night of the Demon, the 1957 film of Casting the Runes. Thanks to <a title="Visit RodMcKie on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/rodmckie">@rodmckie</a> for drawing our attention to this superb video mashup which combines footage from &#8216;Night of the Demon&#8217; with various Kate Bush footage to great effect.</li>

		<itunes:summary>This episode we return to the diabolical doings of Mr Karswell in part two of our examination of &#039;Casting the Runes&#039; by M.R. James.

Show notes:

	Comparative Mythology and the Cambridge Ritualists (Wikipedia)
The criticism of Karswell&#039;s writing style could be read as M.R. James having a dig at his academic contemporaries working in theoretical subjects that James thought were nonsense. For example see James&#039;s &#039;flaying&#039; of Jane Ellen Harrison (erratum: we incorrectly call her &#039;Katherine Harrison&#039; in recording, sorry!).
	The Golden Legend and The Golden Bough (Wikipedia)
The two very different texts which Mr Karswell is described as putting exactly on par and taking both as historical fact.
	Thomas Bewick (1753-1826) (Wikipedia)
The &quot;woodcut of Bewick&#039;s&quot; mentioned in Casting the Runes refers to English wood engraver Thomas Bewick, whose work varied between both studies of nature and the bawdy and macabre. For example a man followed by demons, a man urinating on a wall, and men riding gravestones.

	St. Vulfran&#039;s Church, Abbeville, France (Wikipedia)

Show notes:

	Popish Plot Playing Cards (BritishMuseum.org)
Having trouble getting your head around the popish plot? Why not invest in a pack of Popish Plot Playing Cards! Alas hundreds of years out of print. The Seven of Hearts is the one of Edward Coleman being &#039;drawn&#039; to his execution behind a horse, and the Six of Diamonds is also particularly gruesome.
	M.R. James&#039;s Women by David G. Rowlands (Ghosts &amp; Scholars)
This essay looks at the small selection of women who appear in James&#039;s work, including &#039;The Rose Garden&#039;s Mrs Anstruther.
	&quot;The Rules of Folklore&quot; in the Ghost Stories of M.R. James by Jacqueline Simpson
Landmarks and Shrieking Ghosts by Jacqueline Simpson
An excellent pair of essays originally published in Ghosts &amp; Scholars that drew our attention to the influence of Danish and Suffolk folklore on &#039;The Rose Garden&#039;.
	Weald Country Park, Essex (Wikipedia)
The site of the former Weald Hall, residence of the terrible Sir William Scroggs and the possible real-world &#039;Westfield Hall&#039;. The hall fell into disrepair and was pulled down after world war II but the park can still be visited and looks like a nice day out!
	Victims of the Popish Plot (Wikipedia)
Wikipedia provides a brief rundown of those accused during the popish plot. Play special attention to Sir William Scroggs, Oliver Plunkett and Edward Colman!
	The Head of Oliver Plunkett (Wikipedia)
As mentioned in this episode, popish plot victim Oliver Plunkett&#039;s head is on display in Drogheda, Ireland. A possible inspiration for the strange face in &#039;The Rose Garden&#039;?
	Proceedings against Sir William Scroggs (on Google Books)
Cobbett&#039;s Complete Collection of State Trials features a transcript of the indictment against Sir William Scroggs that makes very interesting (and frequently humorous) reading.
	Gaude, Gaudy, Domini in Laude by Roger Johnson
The essay that drew my attention to Weald Hall was featured in the Ghosts &amp; Scholars Newsletter 15, not available online but an incentive (if more were needed) to subscribe to this foremost Jamesian news source.
	Eastscapes: Doggerland
Photographic work by friend of the podcast and M.R. James fan David Senior will be on display at the House Gallery in Camberwell, London from the 15-22nd March 2012 as part of his collaboration with artists Misa Tamura and Dan Howse.

Errata: Since recording we have been informed that the correct term is &#039;Hanged&#039; rather than &#039;Hung&#039;. Could we be arsed to go back and re-record? We could not.</itunes:summary>

James&#8217;s essay &#8216;Stories I Have Tried to Write&#8217;, read by Tom Hemmings!</p>
<p>Regular service will resume in a few weeks when Mike returns from his reckless galavanting.</p>
<h3 style="clear: both;">Notes</h3>
<p><em style="display: block;">‘Stories I have Tried to Write’ was written by M.R. James in November of 1929 and first published at the end of that month in ‘The Touchstone 2’, a publication of <a title="Visit the Eton College Website." href="http://www.etoncollege.com/">Eton College</a> where James was Provost at the time. The editors would no doubt have preferred to have received a completed ghost story of the sort James had produced for the Eton Boy Scouts two years previously (‘<a title="Read the Full Text of Wailing Well" href="http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/jamesX31.htm">Wailing Well</a>’, one of the last James ghost stories to find print during his lifetime) but instead they received a short essay in which James runs briefly through a number of story ideas that never saw completion. </em><br />
<em style="display: block;">Some of these stories are the merest hint of an idea (the Christmas cracker, the tap on the shoulder) while others provide the outline of an almost completed story, with settings, characters, names and so on all prepared. As James mentions in the essay, some of these stories he not only tried to write, but did write, only later deciding they were not good enough for publication. A draft of the <a title="Read the Marcilly-le-Hayer at Ghosts and Scholars" href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/ArchiveMarcilly.html">Marcilly-le-Hayer</a> story can be found among James’s papers in King’s College Library and was publishes in Ghosts &amp; Scholars 22 in 1996. Likewise, the draft of the story involving two students at King’s was found and published in Ghosts &amp; Scholars 12 as ‘<a title="Read the Fenstanton Witch at Ghosts and Scholars" href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/ArchiveFenstanton.html">The Fenstanton Witch</a>’.</em><br />
<em style="display: block;">Other story elements James mentions in the essay hint at plot devices that James did actually use in some of his published stories, for instance the mask that appears amongst the curtains brings to mind the leering face that peers through the hedge in ‘<a title="Read the full text of The Rose Garden" href="http://www.litgothic.com/Texts/rose_garden.html">The Rose Garden</a>’ and similarly in James’s story ‘<a title="Read the full text of A Vignette" href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/j/james/mr/collect/chapter7.html">A Vignette</a>’, a story written in 1935 and not published until after his death in 1936. James’s reference to ‘common objects being vehicles of malice’ was an idea he later fleshed out into the macabrely humorous fable ‘<a title="Read the full text of The Malice Inanimate Objects" href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/ArchiveMalice.html">The Malice of Inanimate Objects</a>’ which was printed in another Eton publication, ‘The Masquerade 1’ in 1933.</em><br />
<em style="display: block;">The essay saw wider publication when it was included in The Collected Ghost Stories of M.R. James (Arnold 1931), and since that time many authors have yielded to the temptation to flesh James’s ideas out into complete stories. The most notable being <a title="More information on Sheila Hodgson" href="http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/HODGSON.HTML">Sheila Hodgson</a> who produced not only a series of stories based on the ideas (published by Ash Tree Press in 1998 as ‘<a title="More information about this books" href="http://www.ash-tree.bc.ca/atp32fellowtravellers.htm">The Fellow Travellers and Other Ghost Stories</a>’), but a highly enjoyable series of radio plays which were broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 1976 and 1992. As far as I am aware these radio plays have never seen the light of day on cassette or cd but can be tracked down by anyone with a search engine, bit torrent client and ‘relaxed’ attitude towards copyright law. Or so I am told. *cough*.</em><br />
<em style="display: block;">More information on the essay and the various stories it has inspired can be found in the excellent ‘Stories I Have Tried to Write’ <a title="Read the story notes at Ghosts &amp; Scholars" href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/ArchiveStories.html">story notes at Ghosts &amp; Scholars</a>.</em></p>

Notes
‘Stories I have Tried to Write’ was written by M.R. James in November of 1929 and first published at the end of that month in ‘The Touchstone 2’, a publication of Eton College where James was Provost at the time. The editors would no doubt have preferred to have received a completed ghost story of the sort James had produced for the Eton Boy Scouts two years previously (‘Wailing Well’, one of the last James ghost stories to find print during his lifetime) but instead they received a short essay in which James runs briefly through a number of story ideas that never saw completion. 
Some of these stories are the merest hint of an idea (the Christmas cracker, the tap on the shoulder) while others provide the outline of an almost completed story, with settings, characters, names and so on all prepared.

A draft of the Marcilly-le-Hayer story can be found among James’s papers in King’s College Library and was publishes in Ghosts &amp; Scholars 22 in 1996.
