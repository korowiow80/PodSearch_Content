			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Interesting Fun Facts From Popular Culture History &#8211; Madonna News From 1985</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">From The Mr. Pop Timeline Of History.</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Madonna Date History &#8211; April 1, 1985</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Madonna Songs</h4>
<p>Madonna is hot. She has two singles in the top-5 this week – “Material Girl,” and “Crazy for You” each from separate albums. And, she has another single due out in several weeks – “Angel.” If as if that weren’t enough, Madonna has a new song “In The Groove” from her movie “desperately Seeking Susan” whose video is getting played on MTV. To be sure, her record label, Warner Brothers, fearing over video exposure, has killed plans for a video of her next single (Angel) because MTV is crowded with a pair of her clips, already.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> <span style="text-align: center;">Madonna Date History &#8211; April 12, 1985</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/P16QYhc3Aw0" frameborder="0" width="320" height="247"></iframe><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;"><strong>One of the bigger hits so far this year &#8211; “Like a Virgin” </strong>by Madonna &#8211; written by Billy Steinberg and Tom<br />
Kelly. Lyricist Steinberg says the song “came from personal experience. I wasn’t just trying to somehow get that racy worked virgin in a lyric. I was saying, from personal experience, that I may not really be a virgin. I’ve been battered romantically and emotionally like many people, but I’m starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it’s healing all the wounds and making me feel like I’ve never done this before, because it’s so much deeper and more profound than anything I’ve ever felt.&#8221;</h5>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Madonna Date History &#8211; July 19, 1985</h3>
<h5>Hollywood news &#8211; Actor Sean Penn and his pop-singer-fiancée  Madonna are targets of a $1 million<br />
damage suite filed by Laurence  Cottrell &#8211; a free-lance photographer.  He says Penn attacked with a rock and his own camera in a Nashville,  Tenn. hotel car park last month.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Madonna Date History &#8211; July 28, 1985&#8230;</h3>
<h5>Madonna has filed a lawsuit seeking to bar the release of a 5-year-old pornographic movie in which she is the star performer. The film, titled “A Certain Sacrifice” features her in an orgy scene. She is also shown in a<br />
rape sequence in a coffee-shop restroom. At the time, she signed a release permitting her voice and body to be featured in the film, but not her name. She was paid $100 for her performance.</h5>
<h5>Everyone is talking about the Aug. 16 marriage of  Madonna to actor Sean Penn. How will it be covered<br />
by the media?</h5>
<h3><strong>Madonnamania</strong> -</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mrpophistory.com/popcultureblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Madonna-Merry-Widow.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1708" title="Madonna Merry Widow" src="http://www.mrpophistory.com/popcultureblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Madonna-Merry-Widow-150x150.jpg" alt="madonna-pictures-fun-facts-www.mrpophistory.com" width="150" height="150" /></a>Apparently Madonna is responsible for increased sales of the “Merry Widow” bra, which she frequently wears onstage and in publicity photos. More and more girls are going for the innerwear-outerwear effect that Madonna likes. They’re wearing the Merry Widow with opened shirts and blouses – as though they’re T-shirts so that satin and lace can be seen.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Madonna Date History &#8211; August 15, 1985</h3>
<p>Married – Pop singer Madonna to actor Sean Penn – at Malibu Beach at the home of Penn family friend Kurt Unger. Seen attending – Rosanna Arquette, Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise, Judd Nelson, Martin Sheen, Chris Penn, David Letterman. Also seen Diane Keaton, Cher, Andy Warhol, David Geffen, Carol Kane, and Christopher Walken. There were 200 guests all together.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Madonna Date History &#8211; October 12, 1985</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mrpophistory.com/popcultureblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Madonna-Sean-Pean.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1709" title="Madonna Sean Pean" src="http://www.mrpophistory.com/popcultureblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Madonna-Sean-Pean-150x150.jpg" alt="madonna-sean-penn-picture-1985-pop-culture.com" width="150" height="150" /></a>Actor Sean Penn is fined $100 and given a 90-day suspended sentence after pleading no contest to attacking two British journalists. He and wife Madonna were coming out of a Nashville hotel, when the pair approached for an interview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mr. Pop Notes: I thought 1985 was a terrific year for Madonna news &#8211; the first full year she was in our pop culture lexicon. Thanks Madonna and congrats on this year&#8217;s Golden Globe Awards.  All the above information was from the Mr. Pop week-by-week history archives. The dates indicate the week events occurred.</h4>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">Google Pop Culture &#8211; As The Search Engine Solutes Charles Adams 100th Birthday January 7, 2012</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Some History Facts Pertaining To Charles Adams&#8217; Most Famous Contribution &#8211; The Addams Family</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The 1960&#8242;s &#8211; History Timeline &#8211; February 28, 1964 -</h2>
<p>Al Simon is named executive producer for a new series based  on the Charles Adams characters. The name of the<br />
series is tentatively titled, “The  Addams Family.” Simon has been  associated with The Beverly  Hillibillies, Mr. Ed and Petticoat  Junction. The series will draw from the Adams’ books  including “Addams &amp; Evil”, “Night Crawlers” and<br />
“Homebodies.” The series is scheduled to debut next TV  season.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Date Timeline &#8211; August 5, 1964. Addams Family TV Mansion Actually Is A Real House On Adams Blvd In Los Angeles.</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.mrpophistory.com/popcultureblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Addams-family-mansion.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1681" title="Addams family mansion" src="http://www.mrpophistory.com/popcultureblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Addams-family-mansion-150x150.jpg" alt="timeline-1960's-addams-family-mansion-history-pop-google-mr-pop-culture" width="150" height="150" /></a>Did you know that the exterior shot of the Addams Family Victorian mansion, was shot in L.A. &#8211; at a house on &#8230; Adams Blvd! “The Addams Family” will debut on ABC-TV this September. David Levy, producer of the show, said he got the idea for the series when he was walking by a bookstore in New York. In the store window, was a book called “Homebodies” by Charles Adams. It had the entire group of  Addams characters in a family portrait on the<br />
cover. “I stopped and looked at that cover and told my friend &#8211; there’s a hit series.” Levey says he called Adams and he agreed to work out a series plan. Although he had been drawing the characters for 30 years, none of them had names, so Levy asked Adams to name them all. “He came up with names like Morticia for the ghostly woman, Lurch for the great hulking butler, Uncle Fester for the little bald grinning man, Gomez for Morticia’s husband. Gomez surprised me, but Addams said he always felt his character had Latin blood.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Date Timeline &#8211; October 1, 1964. TV Listings/TV Ratings. Addams Family In The Top-20 TV Guide Shows!</h2>
<p>Bewitched – 32.3  Gomer Pyle – 29.5 Addams Family – 25.8 Munsters – 25.0 No Time For Sergeants – 24.7 Peyton Place (Thurs) – 23.4 Flipper – 23.3 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea – 22.8 Peyton Place (Tues) – 21.9 Daniel Boone – 21.3 Many Happy Returns – 21.3 Tycoon – 21.2 Wendy &amp; Me – 20.7 Gilligan’s Island – 20.7 Broadside – 20.3 Cara Williams Show – 20.1 Bing Crosby – 19.9 Shindig – 19.7 Valentine’s Day – 19.7 12 O’Clock High – 18.8 Kentucky Jones – 18.7</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Date Timeline &#8211; May 10, 1965 &#8211; Ted Cassidy &#8211; Lurch&#8217;s Career Is On A Roll</h2>
<p>Apparently the roll of “Lurch” on the “Addams Family” has given Ted Cassidy a boost in his career. There’s a record, cartoon series and motion picture, among other projects in the works for the actor. Says Cassidy &#8211; “I get very nervous about the whole thing. but I know I’m not going to live to be 400 and there’s a lot I want to do. It’s not that I want to make any big mark, but I do want to have a good, full life.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center;">Date Timeline &#8211; June 8, 1965. Probably Because Of The Addams&#8217; Family&#8217;s Lower-then-expected-ratings:</span></h2>
<p>Changes to TV shows next season – The Addams Family is adding three invisible characters to second season&#8230;Carolyn Jones will be doing double duty on the Addams Family next season, In addition to playing Morticia, she will be seen as Morticia’s older sister, Ophelia Frump. David Levy, series creator, describes Ophelia as “a blonde with stringy hair on which she wears a garland of buttercups. After sprouting archaic prose - elegantly- she is likely to slide down the banister.” She’ll be billed as an expert at karate and jujitsu.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Date Timeline &#8211; November 1, 1965. Charles Adams Finally Meets The Addams Family Cast &#8211; On Set</h2>
<p>Television news &#8211; Charles Adams, creator of those cobwebby cartoons in the New Yorker, finally travels to Los Angeles  to meet the cast of his TV series &#8211; The Addams Family. He’s only met Carolyn Jones in New York. Adams,<br />
doesn’t seem to mind that the series &#8211; now in its second season &#8211; is still in black &amp; white. “I’ve always preferred<br />
black-and-white, and I think I am dealing with a black and-white subject.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Dateline &#8211; December 1, 1965 &#8211; Who Plays &#8220;IT&#8221; On The Addams Family?TV Guide Question</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it was answered that week &#8211;  “Who plays Thing, on the Addams Family series? The credits merely say “Itself.” &#8230; “Thing is just another TV mystery. ABC press agents insist they don’t know. We suspect it might be the producer’s right hand man.”<br />

<h4>Top News of the Week From 2009:</h4>
<div><strong>Two down, one to go. </strong>President Barack Obama&#8217;s health care overhaul easily cleared its second 60-vote test in the Senate early Tuesday morning. Senate Democrats remained united in their goal of passing historic legislation by Christmas, and Republicans were steadfast in opposition.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>The motion to shut off debate</strong> on a package put together by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid passed 60-39.</div>
<div>Senate Democrats passed a landmark health care bill in a climactic Christmas Eve vote that could define President Barack Obama&#8217;s legacy and usher in near- universal medical coverage for the first time in the country&#8217;s history. &#8220;We are now finally poised to deliver on the promise of real, meaningful health insurance reform that will bring additional security and stability to the American people,&#8221; Obama said shortly after the Senate acted.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Terrorist attack fizzles on plane over U.S</strong> . &#8211; The U.S. system for checking suspicious travelers and airport security came under new scrutiny after an alleged terrorist bent on destroying a jetliner was thwarted only by a malfunctioning detonator and some quick-thinking passengers. An apparent malfunction in a device designed to detonate the high explosive PETN may have been all that saved the 278 passengers and the crew aboard Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day. No undercover air marshal was on board and passengers subdued the suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23, of Nigeria. Abdulmutallab was hospitalized with burns from the attack and was read</div>
<div>an indictment filed Saturday in federal court in Detroit charging him with attempting to destroy or wreck an aircraft and placing a destructive device in a plane. He was released from the hospital Sunday to the custody of federal</div>
<div>marshals, who would not reveal where he was being held. But his lawyer said he was being held at a federal prison in Milan, Mich.</div>

<p>The world wide web. The Internet. Call it what you like. Want more world wide web history?</p>
<p>Take a look at what Yahoo looked like in 1996. It was a little crude wasn&#8217;t it? But, that was the world wide web.</p>
<p><a title="mr pop culture/yahoo in 1996" href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961219135447/http://www9.yahoo.com/">Click Here &#8211; Yahoo on December 19, 1996.</a> This is what they looked like.</p>
<p>Ahh &#8211; the world wide web back in the late 1990&#8242;s. It was so new and frustrating. We take it for granted today, but, back then, it was difficult to get anything on the web other than text and basic graphics. Forget music or audio and video.</p>
<p>Now, how about Netscape the first big commercial browser? They had a website with some great tech/web news:</p>
<p><a title="mr pop culture  netscape in 1996" href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961219074448/http://www7.netscape.com/">Check out the latest news from November 26, 1996. </a> From Netscape.</p>
<p><a title="mrpopculture  netscape internet history" href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980703113528/http://www1.netscape.com/">And again, July 1998</a> Notice &#8211; the Amazon mention on this page. Back then, they only sold books.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Week In Review &#8211; News, Pop Tech &amp; More</p>
<p>October 8, 2011 as compiled by Gary West &amp; <a title="Mr Pop Culture" href="http://mrpopculture.com">www.mrpopculture.com</a></p>
<p><strong> In The News &#8211; </strong></p>
<p>Flames lit up downtown Cairo (<a title="24 dead in Cairo/Mr Pop Video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VppaHZsiYlA">Mr. Pop Video)</a> where massive clashes raged Sunday, drawing Christians angry over a recent church attack, Muslims and Egyptian security forces. At least 24 people were killed and more than 200 injured in the worst sectarian violence since the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak in February. The rioting lasted late into the night, bringing out a deployment of more than 1,000 security forces and armored vehicles to defend the state television building along the Nile, where the trouble began. The military clamped a curfew on the area until 7 a.m.</p>
<p>Baltimore County Police responded to a call at about 10:48 a.m. Saturday and found two women fighting inside the store. The bleach and disinfectant created toxic fumes, forcing the immediate evacuation of the entire Arbutus store, officials told ABC News affiliate ABC 2. It closed for several hours.Fire, EMS and hazardous materials units were dispatched to the scene, as well as 10 medics. A Saturday morning of shopping turned into an emergency hazmat situation at a Baltimore Walmart where two patrons threw bleach and disinfectant at one another, officials said.</p>
<p>Stocks rose sharply in the U.S. and Europe Monday after French and German leaders promised to strengthen European banks. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 275 points, led by Bank of America. The euro rose against the dollar. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said they would finalize a &#8220;comprehensive response&#8221; to the debt crisis by the end of the month, including a plan to make sure that banks have adequate capital.</p>
<p>A sea exploration company said Monday it has discovered a ship filled with silver 8,000 feet beneath the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean. Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. said it found the remains of the SS Mantola, which sank on Feb. 9, 1917. It was torpedoed by German submarine U-81. The ship was insured to carry silver worth 110,000 British pounds when it sailed in 1917. That value would mean that the ship could hold as much as 600,000 ounces of silver based on silver prices in 1917. Odyssey will retain 80 percent of the value of the silver that&#8217;s recovered. At current market prices, that much silver would be worth more than $19 million.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama is spending time with wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Obama traveled to the facility in Bethesda, Md., just outside Washington on Monday afternoon. Obama has occasionally visited service members wounded in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. He visited the National Naval Medical Center in February and made a trip to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in June, before the center was renamed and moved to its current location.</p>
<p>A copy of Steve Jobs&#8217; death certificate made public Monday indicates that the Apple Inc. co-founder died of respiratory arrest resulting from pancreatic cancer that had spread to other organs. He battled pancreatic cancer in 2004 and underwent a liver transplant in 2009 after taking a leave of absence for unspecified health problems. He took another leave of absence in January — his third since his health problems began — and resigned in August, handing the CEO job over to his hand-picked successor, Tim Cook.</p>
<p>A steam-powered car considered the oldest vehicle in the world still running has sold at auction in the United States for more than $4.6 million. The De Dion-Bouton et Trepardoux Dos-a-Dos Steam Runabout, nicknamed &#8220;La Marquise,&#8221; which was built in France in 1884, sold for more than twice its estimate at auction Friday in Hershey, Pennsylvania. RM Auctions listed its top speed as 38 miles per hour (61 kilometers per hour) and said it had only had four previous owners over the past 127 years.</p>
<p>Another Republican Debate &#8211; All eyes were on Texas Gov. Rick Perry and businessman Herman Cain in Tuesday’s Republican debate, and both failed to ­­seize the moment. Cain arrived as a candidate rising on the strength of a buoyant personality and a catchy tax plan that has captured the imagination of many conservative Republicans. But after a series of debates in which his rivals treated him kindly, Cain found himself on the defensive for the first time, with his tax plan under attack. Perry arrived in a slump after three mediocre debate performances in September and poll numbers that were sinking. But he found himself struggling to reassert himself, at times sidelined as others took over the debate and at times caught in exchanges that turned unexpectedly against him.It was Mitt Romney who prospered most.</p>
<p>Obama’s Job Bill – No Pass – as the Senate blocked his signature American Jobs Act. The cleverly named bill was sold as a paid-for, bipartisan package of cures for the country&#8217;s anemic job market. But the Senate soundly defeated the measure, leaving it eight votes shy of the 60 that Obama needed just to get the Senate to consider it. Worst of all for Obama were the defections of two of his fellow Democrats, which limited the bill to getting more than a bare majority, as well as the declarations from several more that they would vote against the package if the Senate ever did consider it for an up-or down vote.</p>
<p>Congress approved free trade agreements Wednesday with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, ending a four-year drought in the forming of new trade partnerships and giving the White House and Capitol Hill the opportunity to show they can work together to stimulate the economy and put people back to work. In rapid succession, the House and Senate voted on the three trade pacts, which the administration says could boost exports by $13 billion and support tens of thousands of American jobs. None of the votes were close, despite opposition from labor groups and other critics of free trade agreements who say they result in job losses and ignore labor rights problems in the partner countries.</p>
<p>A gunman opened fire in a busy hair salon, killing eight people and critically wounding another while leaving bodies scattered throughout the business in a normally sedate Southern California beach community. The gunman got into a truck and drove away from Salon Meritage after Wednesday&#8217;s shootings. Scott Evans Dekraai, 42, was stopped by officers about a half-mile away and surrendered without incident while saying he had multiple weapons with him, police Sgt. Steve Bowles said. Dekraai was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder, Bowles said. In all, one man and five women died at the salon, one man and one woman died after being transported to a nearby hospital, and one woman remained in critical condition late Wednesday. Their names have not been released.</p>
<p>Occupy Wall Street &#8211; City officials said early this morning they will postpone a cleanup of  Zuccotti Park after earlier threatening to evict Occupy Wall Street protesters who have been encamped here. As the announcement was made via the “people’s mic” just before 7 a.m., the crowd waved their brooms in triumph.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s office tweeted that Brookfield Properties, owner of the park,  (and not the city) decided to postpone cleaning. The city was informed “late last night.” Occupy Wall Street had vowed yesterday to stay in the park and try to prevent the cleaning crews from entering.</p>
<p>A van driven by a sheriff&#8217;s deputy who ran a group home for adopted and foster children collided with an empty cattle trailer on Thursday in a highway construction zone, killing him and five children and injuring seven other children. Howard Mitchell, 57, was taking 12 of the children from the home in Kit Carson to Eads at the time of the crash around 7:30 a.m., troopers said. The school district in Eads, about 15 miles away, said on its website that the Mitchell family had close ties to the community of about 600 people.</p>
<p>Time Poll &#8211; Despite sweeping pessimism about the nation&#8217;s fortunes and his own sliding approval ratings, President Obama leads potential. Republican rivals Mitt Romney and Rick Perry in hypothetical general-election match-ups, according to a new poll. Obama leads Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who sits atop the GOP presidential field, 46% to 43% among likely voters.The President has opened a double-digit lead over Perry, 50% to 38%, highlighting concerns percolating through the GOP that the Texas governor would face a steep uphill climb should he capture the nomination. Obama also boasts a 49% to 37% edge over businessman Herman Cain, whose strong Tea Party support has propelled him toward the top of Republican ranks in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Gap Inc. plans to close stores in the U.S., while expanding in China. The struggling retailer, which runs the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, detailed plans on Thursday to close 189 locations, or 21 percent of its namesake Gap stores in the U.S., by the end of 2013. At the same time, the largest U.S. clothing chain said it plans to triple the number of Gap stores in China from about 15 by the end of the year to roughly 45 by the end of next year</p>

<p>A strange year for Tiger Woods took another bizarre twist Sunday when a fan was arrested for running toward the seventh green at CordeValle and tossing a hot dog in Woods&#8217; direction. The bun barely reached the green. The hot dog landed on the putting surface. e 31-year-old man, whose name wasn&#8217;t released, dropped to the ground to be arrested as Santa Clara sheriff&#8217;s deputies converged on him.-</p>

<p><strong>In The News –</strong></p>
<p>Strapped to a gurney in Georgia&#8217;s death chamber, Troy Davis (<a title="Troy Davis Executed/Mr. Pop Culture" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXJsSk7RcZc&amp;feature=related">Mr. Pop Video) </a>lifted his head and declared one last time that he did not kill police officer Mark MacPhail. Just a few feet away behind a glass window, MacPhail&#8217;s son and brother watched in silence. Outside the prison, a crowd of more than 500 demonstrators cried, hugged, prayed and held candles. They represented hundreds of thousands of supporters worldwide who took up the anti-death penalty cause as Davis&#8217; final days ticked away. &#8220;I am innocent,&#8221; Davis said moments before he was executed Wednesday night.(Sept21) &#8220;All I can ask &#8230; is that you look deeper into this case so that you really can finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends to continue to fight this fight.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="Lawrence Brewer Execution/Mr Pop Culture" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XqYhTbthDc">(Mr. Pop Video)</a> A white supremacist gang member was executed Wednesday (Sept21) evening for the infamous dragging death slaying of a black man. James Byrd Jr., 49, was chained to the back of a pickup truck and pulled whip-like to his death along a bumpy asphalt road in one of the most grisly hate crime murders in recent Texas history. Lawrence Russell Brewer, 44, was asked if he had any final words, to which he replied: &#8220;No. I have no final statement.&#8221; A single tear hung on the edge of his right eye.</p>
<p>A U.S. man is suing Starbucks Coffee Co after his 5-year-old daughter allegedly found a video camera pointed at the toilet in a bathroom in one of their cafes. William Yockey, of Virginia, is asking for $1 million in the civil suit on four counts, including breach of privacy, his lawyer, Hank Schlosberg, told Reuters on Tuesday. Yockey and his daughter went into a Starbucks in downtown Washington to use the restroom during an April sightseeing trip, he said. After using the unisex toilet, the girl discovered a digital video camera hidden in the U-shaped drain pipe under the sink. The camera was aimed at the toilet and recording, Schlosberg said.</p>
<p>The number of people applying for unemployment benefits fell last week, though the decline isn&#8217;t enough to signal improvement in the job market. Weekly applications dropped by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 423,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average, a less volatile figure, rose slightly for the fifth straight week to 421,000.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard Co.&#8217;s decision to fire CEO Leo Apotheker after just 11 months and replace him with former eBay chief Meg Whitman is another dizzying turn of the executive merry-go-round at a company whose leadership issues are straining a sprawling technology empire.</p>
<p>Swapping Apotheker, who has now been ousted from two high-profile CEO jobs in two years, for Whitman is a decision designed to stem investor fury over a series of questionable strategy moves</p>
<p>U.S. Stocks are falling as recession fears and global selling take them to new yearly lows. Shares were on track for their fifth straight day of declines and their worst weekly losses since 2008. Finance ministers from of the world&#8217;s leading economies pledged early Friday to take whatever steps are necessary to calm the markets. The statement did little to stem the selling.</p>
<p>Another Republican slug fest – this one in Orlando on Thursday. As usual – Mitt Romney and Rick Perry went at it – with their smug smiles and all.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin said Saturday he&#8217;ll run for Russia&#8217;s presidency in 2012, almost certainly ensuring he&#8217;ll retake the office he previously held and likely foreshadowing years more of a strongman rule that many in the West have called a retreat from democracy. If Putin wins two presidential terms in a row, he will have been atop the Russian hierarchy for almost a quarter-century.</p>
<p>A six-ton NASA science satellite pierced the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean and fell back to Earth, the U.S. space agency said on Saturday, but it was not yet known where the remains landed. NASA said its decommissioned Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, which took an unpredictable course as it tumbled through the upper atmosphere, fell to Earth sometime between 11:23 p.m. EDT on Friday and 1:09 a.m. EDT on Saturday.</p>
<p>UBS chief executive Oswald Gruebel has resigned over a $2.3 billion rogue trading loss, the bank said Saturday. The move ends days of speculation about whether Gruebel could retain his position following the latest scandal to hit Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank.</p>
<p>A millionaire developer who lived in the same central Florida neighborhood as Tiger Woods and other celebrities was convicted Saturday of murdering his wife in their mansion. The six jurors deliberated more than 12 hours over two days before finding Bob Ward guilty of second-degree murder. The two-week trial took place in the same courthouse where the Casey Anthony case was tried this summer. Ward was stoic as the verdict was read. Before the verdict, he hugged his two college-aged daughters as the women wept. He faces up to life in prison when he&#8217;s sentenced in November.</p>
<p>Libyan revolutionary authorities say they have discovered a mass grave containing the remains of 1,270 inmates killed by the regime of Moammar Gadhafi in a 1996 prison massacre. The site was found near Tripoli&#8217;s Abu Salim prison, where the victims were killed on June 26, 1996, after protesting conditions at the facility.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama is on the road selling his jobs plan — and his re-election hopes — to plugged-in networkers in Silicon Valley and around the country. He was to appear Monday at a town hall-style event hosted by the career-focused social networking site LinkedIn to pitch his nearly $450 billion jobs proposal as he travels through California scooping up campaign cash.</p>
<p>(<a title="787 Boing Airliner Delivered/Mr. Pop Video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiKNecZm6b8">Mr. Pop Video)</a> Boeing&#8217;s long-awaited dream machine became a commercial reality on Sunday when the lightweight plastic-composites 787 Dreamliner was formally delivered to its first Japanese customer. Boeing says the revolutionary carbon fiber design will hand 20 percent fuel savings to airlines struggling to avoid a new recession, and give passengers a more comfortable ride with better cabin air and large electronically dimmable windows. The first $200 million aircraft was handed over to Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways three years behind schedule after persistent delays that cost Boeing billions of dollars.</p>
<p>A new survey shows that the average cost of employer-sponsored health insurance surged this year, snapping a trend toward moderate growth, but experts say increases may slow again in 2012. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation says annual premiums for family coverage climbed 9 percent compared to 2010, when they rose only 3 percent.</p>
<p>Greece&#8217;s international debt inspectors will return to Athens on Thursday after they suspended their review of the country&#8217;s finances early this month amid talk of budget shortfalls. European Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj Tardio said the decision to go back to Athens &#8220;follows recent announcements by the Greek authorities concerning fiscal consolidation measures that constitute an important&#8221; development.</p>
<p>President Obama is encouraging students to work hard in their classes, saying the country is counting on them. Obama was scheduled to speak Wednesday afternoon at Washington&#8217;s Benjamin Banneker Academic High School. His back-to-school address will be televised live and carried online. In his prepared remarks, Obama urges students to pursue an education after high school and says that in tough economic times, the country needs their ideas and passion. &#8220;Whether we fall behind or race ahead in the coming years is up to you,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>A man was arrested Wednesday (Sept 28) and accused of plotting an assault on the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol using remote-controlled aircraft armed with explosives — the latest of several terrorism cases to spring from federal sting operations. Rezwan Ferdaus was arrested in Framingham, Massachusetts, after undercover federal agents delivered materials he had allegedly requested, including grenades, six machine guns and what he believed was 24 pounds of C-4 explosive. Federal officials said the public was never in danger from the explosives, which it said were always under control and closely monitored.</p>
<p>In a significant new blow to al-Qaida, U.S. airstrikes in Yemen on Friday(Sept 30) killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American militant cleric who became a prominent figure in the terror network&#8217;s most dangerous branch, using his fluent English and Internet savvy to draw recruits for attacks in the United States. The strike was the biggest U.S. success in hitting al-Qaida&#8217;s leadership since the May killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. But it raises questions that other strikes did not: Al-Awlaki was an American citizen who has not been charged with any crime. Civil liberties groups have questioned the government&#8217;s authority to kill an American without trial.</p>
<p>Federal agents on Thursday raided a Boeing plant that makes military helicopters in a Philadelphia suburb and charged more than three dozen people with distributing or trying to get prescription drugs, among them powerful painkillers. The arrests were made by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration at the 5,400-employee plant in Ridley Park, where workers build aircraft including the H-47 Chinook helicopter and the V-22 Osprey. The plant is part of Boeing&#8217;s Defense, Space and Security unit.</p>

<p><a title="Facebook Timeline/www.mrpopculture.co" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi3CAn5kMdo">(video www.mrpopculture.com/Facebook)</a> Facebook f8 – as founder Mark Zuckerberg rolled out new features including a personal timeline. In his keynote speech at f8, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg unveiled new ways for users to share information &#8212; and for content creators to gather fresh intel on what is beings shared. Facebook is expanding its vocabulary beyond &#8220;Like&#8221; to add verbs: Users will soon be able to &#8220;watch&#8221; a movie or &#8220;read&#8221; a book. Facebook also unveiled changes to the permissions process users go through when they install new apps. The new version will let users control in more detail what information their apps share with others.</p>
<p>According to a new study from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 31% of American adults prefer text messages to phone calls. An additional 14% said the contact method they prefer depends on the situation. To put this in perspective, most Americans (but just barely: 53%) still generally prefer to get voice calls rather than text messages. Also, Pew notes that 4% of cell owners do not make or receive any voice calls on an average day. And 27% of cell owners do not use text messaging, even occasionally.</p>
<p>Kindle &#8211; The maker of the world&#8217;s most popular e-book reader is rumored to be announcing a color, touch-screen tablet device called the &#8220;Kindle Fire,&#8221; that claims to have seen the gadget. Here are the Kindle Fire&#8217;s specs: 7-inch color screen, compared to 6-inch for current Kindles</p>
<p>&#8211; Wi-Fi only (no 3G version)</p>
<p>&#8211; Touch-screen navigation</p>
<p>&#8211; Glowing LED screen instead of paper-like e-ink</p>
<p>&#8211; Android operating system</p>
<p>&#8211; Hits stores in November</p>
<p>&#8211; Current Kindle will remain on sale</p>
<p>MoboTap, the creator of the popular Dolphin Browser for Android and iPhone, has unleashed a browser for the iPad. The app, Dolphin Browser HD, contains all of the gesture control features that have made it a hit on the Android platform. Drawing a “&lt;&#8221; will take you back a page, and drawing a &#8220;&gt;” will take you forward. Users can also create their own gestures and shortcuts to access their favorite websites or launch browser commands. (We suggest “M” for Mashable.) The iPad app also includes Dolphin Webzine, the browser’s Flipboard-style system for reading web content, tabbing browsing, a URL bar that predicts what website you’re going to type, and a speed dial for accessing favorite websites with a quick tap. Users can access their bookmarks by swiping from left-to-right or their open tabs by swiping right-to-left.</p>
<p><strong>Entertainment news –</strong></p>
<p>(<a title="Vesta Williams/Mr. Pop Culture" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-BYVO8BvAU">Mr. Pop Video)</a> Big-voiced R&amp;B diva Vesta Williams, perhaps best-known for her 1980s hits &#8220;Don&#8217;t Blow A Good Thing&#8221; and &#8220;Congratulations,&#8221; has been found dead of a possible drug overdose in a Southern California hotel room, coroner&#8217;s investigators said Friday. She was 53. Williams was found dead at 6:15 p.m. Thursday in an El Segundo hotel room, Los Angeles County coroner&#8217;s Capt. John Kades (KAY&#8217;-dihs) said.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrpophistory.com/popcultureblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Michael-Jackson.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1632" title="Michael Jackson" src="http://www.mrpophistory.com/popcultureblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Michael-Jackson-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>More than two years after Michael Jackson went into cardiac arrest at his mansion, the doctor accused of responsibility for his death went on trial on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jackson&#8217;s parents, Joe and Katherine, his sisters, Janet and La Toya, and other family members arrived at the Los Angeles court, where dozens of media and fans holding pictures of the dead &#8220;Thriller&#8221; singer, sunflowers, and placards saying &#8220;Justice for Michael&#8221; gathered outside. Dr. Conrad Murray&#8217;s trial is expected to give the public a glimpse into the King of Pop&#8217;s final days as he rehearsed for a series of concerts aimed at restoring a career shattered by a 2005 child molestation trial, despite his acquittal. The trial, which is being televised live in the United States, is expected to last four to six weeks.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Pop Culture &#8211; If you were watching the Raiders and the Bills today, you saw a great game. Particularly in the fourth quarter. A minute left in the game, and you thought the Oakland Raiders had it  35-31. But wait. Now Buffalo has the ball. They keep driving and driving. Even getting a first down at 4 and 3. WOW! All of a sudden, they&#8217;re inside the Raider&#8217;s 30 yard line, and because of &#8220;NFL contract obligations&#8221; they shut the game off!!!!</p>
<p>Shut if off!! Mind you, it&#8217;s 35-31 - Buffalo is losing &#8211; but, they could win this in the 35 seconds or so. So, CBS shuts off the game, goes to local commercials &#8211; and up pops another game &#8211; San Diego at New England. We learn &#8211; about 10 minutes later, Buffalo DID INDEED &#8211; win the game!!!!</p>
<p>Holy uncool!!! BAD, BAD policy. Why even bother??? Shame on the NFL and CBS.</p>
<p>The audience lost.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Week In Review &#8211; September 1, 2011</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Compiled By Gary West @<a title="Mr. Pop Culture" href="http://mrpopculture.com">www.mr popculture.com </a></strong></p>
<p><strong>In The News &#8211; </strong></p>
<p>Wall Street&#8217;s four-day rally ground to a halt on Thursday, with major indexes falling 1 percent on caution ahead of a key labor market report expected to underscore fears the economy is headed for another recession. Financials were the biggest losers, selling off sharply in the afternoon, led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc . Goldman&#8217;s shares fell 3.5 percent to $112.16 after agreements with the Federal Reserve and New York state&#8217;s banking regulator over wrongful foreclosures raised concerns that Goldman is still not yet off the hook.</p>
<p>Turkey expelled Israel&#8217;s ambassador and said Friday it is cutting military ties with the country over its refusal to apologize for last year&#8217;s raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla that killed nine people. Turkey&#8217;s move came before the anticipated publication Friday of a U.N. report on violence aboard a Gaza-bound protest flotilla, further straining a relationship that had been a cornerstone of regional stability.</p>
<p>Employers stopped adding jobs in August, an alarming setback for an economy that has struggled to grow and might be at risk of another recession. The government also reported that the unemployment rate remained at 9.1 percent. It was the weakest jobs report since September 2010. Stocks tumbled on the news. The Dow Jones industrial average sank more than 190 points in early-morning trading.</p>
<p>Bands of heavy rain and strong wind gusts from <a title="Tropical Storm Lee/Mr. Pop Week Of Sept 1, 2011" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZL5VS4V0NI">Tropical Storm Lee</a> knocked out power to thousands in south Louisiana and Mississippi and prompted evacuations in bayou towns like Jean Lafitte, where water lapped at several front doors along the main highway Saturday morning. The sluggish storm stalled just before making landfall, and threatened to dump more than a foot of rain across the northern Gulf Coast and into the Southeast in coming days. No injuries were reported and there were only scattered reports of water entering low-lying homes and businesses.</p>
<p>By Sunday, at least 6 to 10 inches of rain had fallen in some spots along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, and the National Weather Service warned there was a threat of extensive flooding and flash floods because of the storm&#8217;s slow, meandering jog inland.</p>
<p>A North Carolina man will spend the rest of his life in prison after a jury on Saturday found him guilty of fatally shooting eight people at a nursing home in March 2009. Jurors found Robert Stewart, 47, guilty of eight counts of second-degree murder connected to the rampage that left seven patients and a nurse dead in Carthage, a small town about 60 miles southwest of Raleigh. A judge then sentenced Stewart to 189 to 236 months in prison on each count, to be run consecutively, defense attorney Frank Wells told Reuters. The state charged Stewart with first-degree murder, arguing he had gone to the Pinelake Health and Rehab Center looking for his wife who had recently left him.</p>
<p>The FBI and Homeland Security have issued a nationwide warning about al-Qaida threats to small airplanes, just days before the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Authorities say there is no specific or credible terrorist threat for the 10-year anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. But they have stepped up security nationwide as a precaution.</p>
<p>While Lee&#8217;s winds have lost some of their punch, forecasters warn that its slow-moving rain clouds pose a worse flooding threat to inland areas with hills or mountains in the coming days. Flash flood watches and warnings were in effect across a swath of the Southeast early Monday, stretching from the lower Mississippi Valley, eastward to the Florida Panhandle and the southern Appalachians, according to the Hydrometeorological Predication Center. The massive storm system dumped more than a foot of rain in New Orleans and spawned tornadoes elsewhere before it weakened to a tropical depression Sunday night. Its remnants were expected to continue to march to the northeast.</p>
<p>A two-week-old Houston-area boy has died after being mauled by the family dog. The incident happened Saturday night as the baby sat in an infant carrier on the floor of a room in the family house. Harris County sheriff&#8217;s spokesman Thomas Gilliland says the dog, a Labrador mix, began sniffing the child and attacked him before the parents could pull it away.</p>
<p>Pakistani intelligence officers working with the CIA arrested three members of al-Qaida including a top operative believed to have been tasked by Osama bin Laden with targeting American economic interests around the world, Pakistan&#8217;s army said Monday.</p>
<p>Absent but still the star of the show, comedian Jerry Lewis <a title="Jerry Lewis/Mr. Pop Culture" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT8ptC8I0vM">(Mr Pop Video</a>) helped the 2011 Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon raise more than $61 million over the weekend. An annual event that stretched over 21 hours on Sunday honored his efforts during the past 45 years to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to fight the disorder through medical research, the organization said on Monday. Gigantic photos of Lewis, who retired this year from the fundraiser he has headlined since 1966, served as a backdrop for the stage on which four co-hosts gushed about the funny man with a big heart.</p>
<p>Wildfires sweeping across drought-stricken Texas have destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the last several days as they move into more populated areas, Governor Rick Perry said on Tuesday. Perry surveyed damage in west Austin on Tuesday, where dozens of homes have been destroyed and hundreds evacuated. Speaking after his visit, The Texas governor, who left the presidential campaign trail to deal with the fires, said he hopes cooler temperatures and slowing winds Tuesday will help firefighters contain more than 50 fires across the state.</p>
<p>(<a title="IHOP Carson City/Mr. Pop Culture" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDaraOgzouk">Mr Pop Video)</a> A gunman wielding an AK-47 opened fire on a table of uniformed National Guard members at an IHOP restaurant on Tuesday in an outburst of violence that killed four people, wounded eight others and put Nevada&#8217;s capital city on high alert. Five Nevada National Guard troops sitting together at the back of the restaurant were shot — two of them fatally. Another woman was also killed, and the gunman, 32-year-old Eduardo Sencion of Carson City, shot himself in the head and died at a hospital. The shooter&#8217;s motive was unclear, but family members said he had mental issues. He had never been in the military and had no known affiliation with anyone inside the restaurant.</p>

<p>President Obama&#8217;s approval rating hit another new low, and Rick Perry has surged to the lead in the 2012 Republican presidential race, according to a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday. After what could be considered the worst summer of his presidency politically, Obama&#8217;s approval rating is at a new low of just 44 percent in the NBC/WSJ poll. Just 37 percent approve of his handling of the economy&#8211;a six-point drop since July. The poll&#8217;s margin of error is 3 percent.</p>
<p>Gov. Rick Snyder on Tuesday signed into law a stricter, four-year lifetime limit on cash welfare benefits, prompting advocates for the poor to warn that tens of thousands of residents will find themselves without cash assistance on Oct. 1. Michigan&#8217;s first-year Republican chief executive said the state will offer exemptions to the limit for those with a disability who can&#8217;t work, those who care for a disabled spouse or child and those who are 65 or older and don&#8217;t qualify for Social Security benefits or receive very low benefits.</p>
<p>A Russian jet carrying a top ice hockey team crashed while taking off Wednesday in western Russia, killing at least 43 people and leaving two critically injured, officials said. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said the Yak-42 plane crashed immediately after leaving an airport near the city of Yaroslavl, on the Volga River about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northeast of Moscow. It was carrying 45 people, including 37 passengers and eight crew, and the ministry said all but two people were killed in the crash.</p>

<p><strong>Tech News – </strong></p>
<p>Facebook intends to launch its long-rumored music service next month with Spotify, MOG and Rdio as three of the company&#8217;s launch partners. The music and media platform will be announced at Facebook’s f8 developer conference on September 22. It will allow users to listen to music from within Facebook.com. Evidence of Facebook&#8217;s music platform first surfaced in the code of Facebook&#8217;s video chat service. According to two sources familiar with the matter, Facebook will not directly host or stream any music or media. Instead, it will rely on partners to provide the content. This is in contrast to Apple, Google and Amazon&#8217;s strategy of hosting music content on their servers. Facebook&#8217;s plan is to become a platform for media content in the same way it is a platform for applications and games.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&amp;T on Wednesday seeking to block its $39 million merger with T-Mobile. The merger would create the largest wireless company in the United States, combining AT&amp;T&#8217;s 98 million customers with T-Mobile&#8217;s 34 million users, for a total of 130 million subscribers. AT&amp;T is currently the second-largest wireless company by number of subscribers, and T-Mobile is fourth. he DOJ said the merger would lead to a situation in which just two companies &#8212; the AT&amp;T-T-Mobile combination and Verizon Wireless &#8212; would dominate the mobile market. The new AT&amp;T and Verizon would account for more than two-thirds of wireless subscribers and 78% of the wireless industry&#8217;s revenues.</p>
<p>Netflix has started to restrict its users from streaming more than one movie at a time as part of its price hike. The change could have a major effect on how families use Netflix. No longer can one person watch a movie from the iPad while the rest of the family watches another film on the Xbox, for example. As website Stop the Cap points out, Netflix has always had a policy that limited streaming, with those on a single DVD or streaming-only plan limited to streaming one film at a time. But it appears as if Netflix just started enforcing this rule on September 1. The changes seem to coincide with Netflix’s price hike, which took effect on Sept. 1 as well. Now, if you attempt to launch two movie streams, Netflix will block it and tell you that your membership plan doesn&#8217;t support multiple movie streams.</p>

<p><a title="Lady Gaga Harper's Bazaar/Mr Pop Culture" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01plPM1-qy0">(Mr. Pop Video)</a> Only someone as over-the-top as Lady Gaga could make posing au natural seem shocking.

<p>Journalist Andrea Mitchell revealed that she&#8217;s battling breast cancer on her MSNBC show Wednesday. I had planned to be hiking in Wyoming last week, but instead discovered that I am now among the 1 in 8 women in this country &#8212; incredibly 1 in 8 &#8212; who have had breast cancer,&#8221; she said. The 64-year-old said the disease &#8220;was discovered during my annual screening just a short time ago.&#8221; &#8220;Luckily for me, I am one of the fortunate ones; we discovered it in the earliest stage, it hadn&#8217;t spread, and I&#8217;m already back at work with a terrific prognosis,&#8221; Mitchell added.</p>
<p>A Paris court convicted former Christian Dior designer John Galiano on Thursday for making anti-Semitic insults in a bar but gave him only a suspended sentence, taking into account his apology to the victims. Galliano, who didn&#8217;t attend the announcement of the verdict, was given no prison time. He was given a suspended (EURO)6,000 ($8,400) fine, which means it goes on his criminal record but he does not have to pay it.</p>

Not just the hits. The 1960&#8242;s was full of great pop music. Even the stuff that didn&#8217;t make the charts, or was low on the charts &#8211; was terrific. A great example of that &#8211; is Allan Sniffen&#8217;s Rewound Radio. Listen this Labor Day weekend &#8211; and you&#8217;ll hear the hits mixed with the songs that didn&#8217;t quite make it. Let&#8217;s face it, radio stations couldn&#8217;t play it all. Only one in nine single releases made it to the top-40 charts. Imagine, all that great stuff &#8211; the stuff that was supposed to be played. Check out Rewind Radio  now &#8211; I recommend it&#8230;</p>
