<p>Transcription of the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Alpar: Alright, we’re at the OM-Report and this time it’s with Greg Boser. Greg, can you introduce yourself?</p>
<p>Boser: My name’s Greg. I’m an SEO guy.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay.</p>
<p>Boser: And I actually- my actual job is President of Products and Services for BlueGlass Interactive so, I’m not technically and SEO guy anymore but I still run the strategy team at BlueGlass and…</p>
<p>Alpar: So how many people does BlueGlass…</p>
<p>Boser: Probably about 45 – last count, give or take.</p>
<p>Alpar: And it’s pretty much a new brand, right, in the business.</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, it’s- we like to call it a mash-up kind of, so it’s- several of my partners, we all had consultancies individually and then a year ago – June – four of them got together and merged and created BlueGlass and then I met them here. I already knew them but they came to Oktoberfest last year and started talking to me about coming in and running the Search Division and over a few beers that sounded like a good idea. So I said yes and merged my company into it and now a year later- like I said, I moved out of the Search and I run the Products and the Services so we’re developing some tools and stuff like that and then I also…</p>
<p>Alpar: Tools like monitoring or like work-flow management tools or what kind of tools?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, kind of enterprise level SEO and marketing tools to manage that, a lot of the processes that I’ve used, I’ve been doing this since I don’t know, ’96, so basically to…</p>
<p>Alpar: Before there were search engines, basically. </p>
<p>Boser: Before, yeah, before- back when we used to argue about the name SEO, before the phrase even existed. So there’s not very many of us back then and so over the years, just a lot of the methodologies that we put together and just the internal tools that we had at my old company, we decided…</p>
<p>Alpar: Can you probably give like one really, really specific example? You know without giving away too much? Like what would be such a tool?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah. Ah, the thing that we’ve been…</p>
<p>Alpar: That you would think, ‘Wow we have that and it’s really cool.’</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, the thing that we’ve been working on this year a lot is- we had an internal tool, visibility tool that basically would go out and pull positions but it also factored like market share of the engine, average click-through rate, we had some data…</p>
<p>Alpar: What positions…</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, we had some data that I got from…</p>
<p>Alpar: Would you differentiate…</p>
<p>Boser: Drinking with the Search people over the years, right? As far as percentage of clicks and so we would use a…</p>
<p>Alpar: Wasn’t there like leakage a while ago, like a year or a year and a half ago?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah and there was AOL data, so part of that was factored in there and we used to use that in my company to do performance-based contracts where we could come in and baseline and establish that there was a trust…</p>
<p>Alpar: And they would trust your visibility score? Could they trust your visibility score? I mean, was there- because I think your customers need to have like a certain level of expertise in order to be willing to let themselves, you know… You know, put their lock on your visibility index without being afraid of you manipulating something, you know? </p>
<p>Boser: Yeah… The way that we did it, so, in those contracts we would be fully transparent and disclose how we calculated it. So if they wanted to check it, I mean they could actually do the math manually if they wanted to so there is definitely in that kind of model a bit of client education but we found it was- you know…</p>
<p>Alpar: Are clients in the US, in general that- you know, far out I mean d-</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, I mean I was…</p>
<p>Alpar: Or is it a lot of education, actually?</p>
<p>Boser: For me, personally it wasn’t but I tended to get, you know, when you’ve been doing it long enough, like if somebody calls me…</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Boser: You know you’re like ‘I don’t want to take a lot of clients that are new to the space.’ They’ve usually been referred by somebody so probably a little higher calibre client as far as knowledge than some places but it was very interesting because I was really the only- not too many SEO’s work that way and…</p>
<p>Alpar: You know, in Germany and in some parts of Europe, many work that way since about three years or so?</p>
<p>Boser: Really?</p>
<p>Alpar: There are like three tools that provide visibility index with usually a…</p>
<p>Boser: Yup, like a Sistrix and um…</p>
<p>Alpar: Sistrix, Searchmetrics and then there’s like two or three others.</p>
<p>Boser: So yeah, ours is…</p>
<p>Alpar: Is it similar…</p>
<p>Boser: It was similar… </p>
<p>Alpar: But with a custom keyword base, you know, that’s adjusted to the client? Is that how you figured it out?</p>
<p>Boser: Right, so basically what we do is- in those kind of contracts- is we establish a bucket of phrases that the client agrees on, we basically take a snap-shot of what we feel represents the majority of the search traffic – usually 50 to a hundred phrases – and their estimated volume as far as search traffic so we can quantify how much a phrase is worth and then our payment system and our bonuses would be based on how they rank for that whole body of phrases, so it would be a global visibility score for the whole domain, so we could run that and then…</p>
<p>Alpar: But in the keyword space of this client.</p>
<p>Boser: Right, so we can run  for this and it is … Apples, right? For all your apple keywords, you’re the 27th most visible site on the web and we can see how big the gaps are between the scores, so we could look at that and be able to get an idea…</p>
<p>Alpar: So usually…</p>
<p>Boser: What it might take to get him to move and then what we would do is we’d establish that baseline and then we usually start like on a twelve month contract and we would have a certain level that we would have to reach increasing that score over that twelve months and if we hit that, then the contract would get extended and we’d have a new metrics, so it usually worked out to be about three year engagement if we hit our number. And we would come in and we’d start working for probably</p>
<p>Alpar: They would pay a fixed fee and an additional bonus just to reach the- if they hit the buttons?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah so, I- it was basically about 60 percent less than what I would charge on a normal consulting gig so, I’d work for cheaper up front and with the bonus tier, obviously…</p>
<p>Alpar: You can get over it. </p>
<p>Boser: Yeah and the nice thing is at the end of those- the tail-end of those kind of contracts, because it was a small shop that was really the only way I could scale and so the nice thing is, when you’re on the tail-end, you don’t really have to do a lot of work and they’re paying significantly more than you would have charged them… So it ends up working out to be about 3.5X return on it. The upside for them is, if we don’t hit that metric in that first year then they…</p>
<p>Alpar: That’s cheap for them.</p>
<p>Boser: Then they can walk away and they paid a lot less than they would have to other firms. So, we took that tool that was part of things that I brought into the BlueGlass thing and right when I got to BlueGlass, Google rolled out all their localization stuff in the States. And not only including Google Place-Listings but also flavoring the organic listings based on where you’re searching from.</p>
<p>Alpar: And then which kind of searches they are because some searches are obviously local. If you’re looking for a hairdresser, well, you’re obviously not looking for hairdressers but…</p>
<p>Boser: The big thing that they- the changes they made is they started taking queries that didn’t have a GEO…</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Boser: qualifier to it. </p>
<p>Alpar: But they can figure out which queries usually would have a GEO qualifier and then blend in some local results in those. </p>
<p>Boser: Yeah and so we got really fascinated by it and then the other thing they did is they gave everybody a location – you could no longer opt-out of it. So it used to be, you’d be logged in to get that location thing and so for our bots that crawled and create this visibility score, they would just not take cookies so you could get an accurate snapshot. Then what happened is even bots have cookie- or location now. So all of a sudden we noticed- I came in one day and our bots at the time were in Dallas, Texas and all the data was skewed. I started seeing all these Texas domains and local Dallas, all these sites and organic! So, through the numbers I was like ‘Wow, that’s… How do we? We can’t do this model anymore because it’s- how do we get accurate data like that?’ So that got us on the mission to rebuild this tool to where we can select and run that same thing on dozens of different GEOs, and qualify them based on population and… So basically, to do it, it’s, you know, we want to go look at the top 50 US Metros and see how you rank in each one. So now that bucket of a hundred words becomes- you have to query that 50 different times.</p>
<p>Alpar: Understood.</p>
<p>Boser: So from a scalability standpoint, it’s been…</p>
<p>Alpar: Just a lot more detail and then you have to work with that.</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, it’s more requests to Google, so not getting banned and managing the IP’s so that’s what we’ve been working on this last year since I’ve been there and we’re just getting ready to- we’re rolling out internally now and it’ll be fully operational by January but also ties in, so not only can you score it, you can pass the data anyway. So we can now look at stuff as like, what kind of sites rank in cities with less than a thousand- a hundred thousand people in them, right? And we can start seeing trends and tying and linking profiles and really now understanding what’s- how Google’s driving all that and now we can go back to doing the performance-based stuff but it’s very interesting because you mentioned Searchmetrics and I had a call with him on Monday and I love their stuff but the data they gave- or anybody, it’s not just them- anybody that’s doing it based on crawling.com, it’s so different than what people are actually seeing.</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes, from the services.</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, because it’s… So what I find is, clients will be like, ‘Okay, my traffic’s dropped but I rank, they see themselves ranking,’ they don’t know where they’re not, where they’re not so now we’re going to be able to give them very micro-focussed information on that and be able to build strategies around that so… and that’s going to roll with the rest of our tool suite which will do backlinks and you know, be able to go take those sites, query them, get all the backlinks, all that kind of stuff. I’m hoping we’re going to start working with Searchmetrics, kind of jointly and offering their tool to clients as well which is very complimentary with the stuff we’re doing. So hopefully in a year they’re going to add some API’s and we’re going to be able to- I’d love to use them as our data provider, they’re- I really love their stuff and I think matched up with our ability to bring that kind of thing to the table from the States would be pretty powerful so… And then we’re going to get back into doing some performance-based stuff and…</p>
<p>Alpar: If you look at BlueGlass it seems like it’s like a- it’s a band of superstars – I would call it &#8211;  and it’s funny because usually for me, sometimes you either have like single persons that have themselves as a brand of some sort and then there are these one-man consulting armies, I would call them, that you know, yeah.</p>
<p>Boser: Definitely been there.</p>
<p>Alpar: You know what I mean? And then some of those guys, then they tend to, you know, some are willing or some prefer to build an organisation around that, to kind of scale it a little bit and you bring it into structure, but then again you know, this is not as easy as well but I’m not aware of- usually, like each of the agencies, many times they’re branded by like a single- one specific single person and then there’s this BlueGlass thing that just shows up and it’s- isn’t it confusing? I mean, do you have to build a brand or are you guys like…</p>
<p>Boser: That’s interesting, that’s- those are great  &#8230; and it, you know, the number one comment- and even since I was the last person to join, even though they’re all my friends, when I first started it was like, ‘That’s a lot of chiefs, not a lot of bread.’ There’s a lot of ego there, you know what I mean, it’s like everybody’s well-know, been doing it for a long time, it’s like I can see prob- like how is that going to work? And…</p>
<p>Alpar: But what was the idea behind it? Do you think it’s that the certain sized companies are not willing to work with individuals and this is why you know it does make more sense to team up? </p>
<p>Boser: Well it’s a little bit of that so yeah it’s interesting. I mean in a small shop, typically what happens is you get projects that are too big and we already outsource to each other anyway, so my focus was primarily organic SEO – that’s what I’m known for and so when I’d have Social Media stuff, these are guys I would refer clients to or sun-contract them and then there was in many of your larger agencies, and they do a lot of outsourcing to vendors as well, so it really was a kind-of a one-stop place where you could get it all. So that was the idea, like, the sum of the parts could be more powerful than us individually. The challenges in doing that have been, you know, a lot of the same things that everybody thought. It’s like it was, then you come in and not only that, not only are you merging up the personalities and the egos of the people that ran those companies but you’re also merging employees and systems and everything and they came out of the gate with a ton of- they already had- we never shut down at all.</p>
<p>Alpar: The clients.</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, so out of the gate, you know, so I stepped in BlueGlass, I had like over 120 clients and very large and fast-moving.</p>
<p>Alpar: And did you all- did you all switch contracts from the individuals to BlueGlass? Did you go all the way?</p>
<p>Boser: Most did, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: How does that work?</p>
<p>Boser: I didn’t bring a lot of clients into it at the time but the other companies did and… So there was a bit of chaos and it took- we learned a lot over the years of how to…</p>
<p>Alpar: You know these one-man SEO armies, they also sometimes- they work out of home, they’re probably not even used to working in an office, going into an office each day. Did you have these cases as well? Or not so much.</p>
<p>Boser: So I still work from my home.</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Boser: Because I’m on the West Coast but everybody else is- most of everybody else is in our office in Tampa. We have an office in downtown LA that I go to, well not every day but primarily for programmers so like the guy that came with me from my company is our VP of Products, he’s in LA and him and I go to that office and work but it’s not a regular daily thing but everybody else was already in Tampa, pretty much because Dave’s company, Search &#038; Social, he’d merged with Lauren Baker previously so they were already working in that office. Chris and Daniel Winfield came down – they actually relocated from New York so they live in Tampa and they’re in the office daily. So I’m- I’m really the only one that- other partners- it’s not &#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, so I was bitching about you when I was asking that question. I’m sorry, I didn’t know! I- you should have given me a sign, I would have stopped it.</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And it’s interesting because… I’ve done- I’ve done both, I’ve worked from home I- we had an office for many years and then in the credit crunch thing we ended up shutting the office down and just decided to get lean and not be wasteful ‘cause we were wasting money like everybody was in that time it was- and so I was back working from home and it’s an interesting adjustment. And then I also have the East Coast, West Coast thing so I get up a lot earlier now than I ever used to, to just make sure that I’m available for more of the day with my team back there, so that was a interesting thing, not…</p>
<p>Alpar: So how do you coordinate? Mostly like Skype or some video chat?</p>
<p>Boser: We do a lot of Skype, we do video chat, Chris Winfield and I have daily management meetings – the two of us ‘cause with the new structure now and Dave and some of the other partners, we spun off a new venture called Steelcast that is a joint venture between us and some other people here in this room and so Dave, so there’s less partners running BlueGlass proper now. Dave took the stuff that he was working on and we set him up over there, they’re doing a lot of vendor stuff for us now, we’re getting much…</p>
<p>Alpar: What do you mean by vendor stuff?</p>
<p>Boser: Ah just stuff that’s like production so we do a lot of link-building.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay.</p>
<p>Boser: The actual work of going out and doing those links so that kind of stuff is moving to Steel- we came up with the idea that as the reason agencies…</p>
<p>Alpar: Just a- just a funny thought – imagine one of the partners brought in some client and now, this- you know, the client moved to BlueGlass and now the partner used to work for the client, he’s now going to Steelcast. Isn’t that- do you have some, you know, explanatory work to do with the clients or do they all take it well?</p>
<p>Boser: No, you know… That’s certainly…</p>
<p>Alpar: they can say like ‘Wait, wait, wait, my man is going away! Well I have a contract with him, how can he go away?’</p>
<p>Boser: One of the hardest issues when you’re a consultant is that your clients do get a lot of real personal time, right? In this kind of model, there is an adjustment period there. You know, having clients that come to you because they like- it’s interesting now, I still this quite a bit. My job at BlueGlass is really far beyond SEO. I actually … with Chris managing .. its more like being a boss.</p>
<p>Alpar: So it’s more like management. Yes it’s management because…</p>
<p>Boser: Being the boss, you know what I mean, doing management kind of stuff. Like I said, I still stay probably more active in it that I should but I still lead and do consulting in the strategy part for organic search.</p>
<p>Alpar: But if clients are big, they want to talk to the boss.</p>
<p>Boser: Yes. Yes, and…</p>
<p>Alpar: They need to face up to the boss and not just to somebody from the company, right? They want some face time, some of that premium face time. </p>
<p>Boser: Absolutely and it’s- and it’s important to take the time- we have a lot of really smart, young talent.</p>
<p>Alpar: How do you recruit them? Are they also like big egos who had huge social media visibility before or are they- you just recruit them young?</p>
<p>Boser: We’re very big on- we always try to hire within at first and the idea, especially now, we’ve created this separation with BlueGlass is that we- one of the things we did shortly after I got here is we ditched the individual channels. Like, so we used to have- I was the VP of Search and then Lauren was VP of Social Media and we kind of ran as individual departments and we didn’t always communicate well with each other. We’d have larger clients and we’re all working on it but sometimes, you know, and then I think it’s all so integrated now, that we merged all that into one Services union…</p>
<p>Alpar: So you have like one Key-Accounter that are talking to a client and then…</p>
<p>Boser: And we have- we really do attack it as a group project – the whole company, the whole- we have a strategy team now that crosses social search and everything. So when we get a new client we really do map out the plan from the top down and the whole company’s involved in doing that and everybody- we’re much more transparent, everybody knows what everybody else is doing, so we can really leverage our collective brain pool because that’s what we think is our advantage, is that we can come up with good ideas and… So it took a while to work out, you know, how to structure it. The analogy I already- always give my partners is like- trying to make these changes is kind of like fixing the flat tyre on a car whole you’re driving 50 miles an hour, right? It’s getting the time so we slowly trimmed down the number of clients, the types of clients we change; we try to work with fewer and…</p>
<p>Alpar: Bigger?</p>
<p>Boser: A lot but we had to work out what our monthly minimums and that kind of stuff were and…</p>
<p>Alpar: So what is a monthly minimum? </p>
<p>Boser: I don’t know, if I’m going to say it on a podcast but I’m going to probably guess but you know, we’re not your cheapest, we’re not your most expensive… But what we did is as indivi-</p>
<p>Alpar: So how can there be more expensive ones?</p>
<p>Boser: Ah, you’d be surprised at what some bug agencies charge.</p>
<p>Alpar: But do you think they just sell better? Or how can you give- what are you…</p>
<p>Boser: I mean, the question is, is that are you getting more value for that money? I got into this with BlueGlass because I wanted to prove that you can scale quality, right. I think the smaller shops can offer a lot of times better quality, that’s how I made my living – going up against larger agencies, that  could do better work, but I couldn’t scale and so…</p>
<p>Alpar: So how do you think that worked? ‘Cause usually agency work, I mean, it’s usually driven by people so scaling has to do with people and processes probably.  Processes and organization</p>
<p>Boser: So a lot of the tools- so my approach from the product side of the company is that even though we might turn it into a tool that we sell as a product to end-users at some point, that’s not how we design and build stuff. Everything’s built for our team first, so it has to work for me and my team and do what I need it to do and when that’s completed and it’s efficient, now we can do more business because data-collection, especially in search – there’s obviously a lot of ground work in organic search – to do proper research and to build real strategy, you have to put in the time and the data. So a big chunk of the scalability is taking my years of processes and putting those into a suite of tools that we can then use to train new, younger people…</p>
<p>Alpar: And then you can scale things because that is suite is your work. </p>
<p>Boser: And then- then the idea is- I prefer- we always try to look to hire within first before we, you know, probably not going to be a lot- another big name like your so-and-so come in and- because we find that the kids that come to us – I call them kids because I’m the oldest guy in the company, they’re not really kids but – they are all excited and want to learn how to be marketers, you know and they’re very smart and they work really hard…</p>
<p>Alpar: But then again, marketers- a marketer is not necessarily like a team player, right? If you’re building like a big agency and once it’s scaled you need like more team-players, right?</p>
<p>Boser: Right. You do but I’ll tell you my theory on that so I think a lot of things that messes agencies up is that they try to, you know, good talent at some point is going to leave and want to go do their own thing and that’s just a natural process that happens and agencies a lot try to pressure people into staying and create bad situations. In my model because the things that we’ll be doing in 2012, there’s also training and partner programs, so I want to be able to take these large-scale systems and tools to that smaller shop and help empower them…</p>
<p>Alpar: So if they go rogue, or not go rogue…</p>
<p>Boser: I’ll support that. Right? So that’s…</p>
<p>Alpar: If they go… Yes. And they can still use the tools and so on and so on but you also…</p>
<p>Boser: use the revenue from there and then we have a place to refer- we get a lot of great referrals…</p>
<p>Alpar: Like the smaller clients are probably too small for BlueGlass, you can refer them to your old employees.</p>
<p>Boser: Yup, exactly and…</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh that’s a smart move, I like it. </p>
<p>Boser: that’s- that’s the model that I really want to build because that’s- that’s where I came from, I am one of those guys and I know that space very, very well and the idea is not to try go cannibalize that market because it happens all the time. We get leads in that are great companies, great clients, but just from a cost standpoint there’s a certain price point we need to be at to make sense versus… But we want to take care of that client; we want to give- so we want to give, so we say hey…</p>
<p>Alpar: And if you refer him, you want to be sure…</p>
<p>Boser: That they do good work, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: He’s in good hands because otherwise you get the, you know, the back.</p>
<p>Boser: So, if we can take some of these smaller shops and build models and processes that we know work because we’ve grown our company with it and they’re effective and the tools to support that, then we can empower them and have a place to refer them too and the same thing applies to in-house shops. So we do a lot of consulting with companies that have large in-house operations. We want to, so let me say it like the amature thing – we’re tools bundled with consulting and we can come in and train, help you build and internal team, actually doing staffing stuff. I think we’ll be doing some of that this year, so…</p>
<p>Alpar: So from a- if we jump like from a level higher, if you look at the whole industry, do you think that in the States there is still an in-transparency problem when people are wanting to pick an SEO agency, isn’t it really, really hard for them to understand? You know, each of the agency, they’ll say, you know, ‘I have a budget of 200 000 a year,’ each of the agency will make an offer that will, you know, meet that, what they need and obviously it won’t be less because the agency wants the revenue and so on, and then how, I mean, if you look at it from a client perspective, then you have these five agencies, they all have great pitches, you know some might gave away a little more because probably they’re hungry and they’re willing to work for free and others will probably say, ‘No, first you sign the contract otherwise I don’t analyze your website, you know, I can’t tell you anything,’ but there’s still like a hug in-transparency and the tickets that are- I mean, the contracts, you know, if you sum up the amount of money, it’s quite a bit So how do- how is this solved?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah it’s interesting. It’s very difficult for clients to know… </p>
<p>Alpar: How do they see good from bad?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah and I- my personal take on it is that I’m not a big fan of sales-pitchy kind of- I don’t think a real agency needs a sales team, right? And that’s not how…</p>
<p>Alpar: How many real agencies are there then?</p>
<p>Boser: Well that’s it. We’re building a new model, right and my thing is, I think the biggest mistake that happens in the agency world is that an agency- a lot of agencies will take any client that has the money. They don’t take the time to see if that client’s really a fit. So, I actually spend more time kind of interviewing the client than the other way around. My thing is I want a relationship that’s going to be long term and I want a company that not only has money to pay us but is a fit for all the different things we do so my whole team is engaged, it’s not- we don’t- I don’t-</p>
<p>Alpar: So the task that they want from you is something that you can actually fulfill and you will not- the company will be pissed off all the time</p>
<p>Boser: And do a great job, exactly. You got to be willing to say no, even to- and here’s where it happens when especially young, growing agencies where they really get tripped up is- they get really excited when it’s a big brand name, okay because it’s a feather in the cap and you can say ‘I do work for so-and-so’. In those relationships &#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Is that usual in the States because in Germany nobody really wants to say who they work for and the companies that are being worked for also don’t want the SEO agency to say, ‘Okay, I work for them.’</p>
<p>Boser: There is an out- a middle band where like I never was big on disclosing clients and I would have- I would ask the client first, but there’s a certain level when you start competing with other agencies and you start the RFP process in the States.</p>
<p>Alpar: What’s RFP?</p>
<p>Boser: RFP is a Request for Proposal.</p>
<p>Alpar: Ah okay.</p>
<p>Boser: So real large companies will send those out and then the big agencies prepare bids and do a lot of work for no money up front that is, I think is kind of crazy sometimes but to get in there you have to be able to say, you have to be able to have- show that big brand that you’ve worked with another big brand, right? So it all becomes this chest-pounding, macho thing.</p>
<p>Alpar: You could do that.</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, yeah it’s…</p>
<p>Alpar: From your looks I mean</p>
<p>Boser: yeah, yeah. That’s a good one.</p>
<p>Alpar: Sorry</p>
<p>Boser: And so what ends up happening there is I think agencies end up making bad choices based on that and then they’re not able to exceed the client’s expectations so, I’m always trying to teach our- you know, promise less, deliver more and don’t always be a yes man because I’ve seen- I’ve walked into situations, you know, where over-aggressive salesperson, somehow the contract ends it with some kind of promise of 30 percent monthly growth in search.</p>
<p>Alpar: What you don’t do that? Only 30 percent? What is BlueGlass doing anyway?</p>
<p>Boser: And I actually saw the situation where- and then the company actually achieved 27 percent growth over time which was phenomenal but they said 30, so now they’re- and as a client, they’re a failure right. So just learning the nuances of how to be able to not get overly excited and chase a client that’s a bad fit – that I think is the most important thing for scale or growth and that helps a lot in the brand recog- the referrals from those clients because you did do a good job. I’d rather take a client that nobody’s heard of now and a year later be the one that gets the credit for building a brand than… </p>
<p>Alpar: But then again, how do people know that you worked on it?</p>
<p>Boser: Because a lot of </p>
<p>Alpar: Are they okay with you disclosing you worked for them?</p>
<p>Boser: A lot of companies- it varies from- but we have, we’ve had clients before that are fine for people to know they went through us.</p>
<p>Alpar: I guess you do some link-building for most of the companies, right?</p>
<p>Boser: We do a lot of cli- there’s a bee that’s going to sting you in a minute.</p>
<p>Alpar: No, it’s not going to sting me.</p>
<p>Boser: We do a lot of content marketing. A lot of info-graphic stuff, outreach, really organic, so that’s the core…</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s really a US phenomenon though, unfortunately. It doesn’scale that way in other countries. At least, that’s my experience, probably I’m totally wrong.</p>
<p>Boser: Well it’s interesting because one of the companies, the things that we spun off into the Steelcasting is a company called CopyPress which is a content-writing company that has…</p>
<p>Alpar: But what is that? It’s not the- CopyPress? Sounds so familiar. I’m sorry.</p>
<p>Boser: But that’s how we originally addressed that. We built that system as a team…</p>
<p>Alpar: Similar to TextBroker or not? </p>
<p>Boser: It’s similar, yes. We think it’s better, but same idea though – outsource content writers where you can write content for projects and that’s how a lot of the smaller agencies now do scale for that kind of content and marketing because you don’t have to have full-time staff. So, now that that’s over there we have in-house writers at BlueGlass and graphics people and we use a combination of both so we can scale up when we need to. </p>
<p>Alpar: Whenever you do these kind of link-marketing activities, it seems to me that the actual trick is the seeding, although I’m not sure how you call it but you now, through the initial push of attention because that’s usually happening through social media.</p>
<p>Boser: Social’s a big part of it so we social media pushes and we have a team that handles that part so we publish a piece of content and then the team goes out to try to generate visibility for it  through social channels, you know we…</p>
<p>Alpar: And then the magic happens anyway.</p>
<p>Boser: Some- yeah and not everyone’s a hit, that’s how social promotion is but when it is, it can be hugely successful. We also do application development now, web development, so we’re doing a lot of off-brand kind of micro-site stuff for clients to help give them- ‘cause one of the biggest things that you run into with the bigger companies is…</p>
<p>Alpar: They’re not that fast.</p>
<p>Boser: You call it paralysis, yes.</p>
<p>Alpar: Paralysis, yeah.</p>
<p>Boser: They…</p>
<p>Alpar: And then everybody has to decide how the homepage will look and then every link has to be discussed and it’s a &#8230;</p>
<p>Boser: And you pay me a lot of money to write this brilliant organic search strategy but there’s a lot of IT, there’s lot of rebuilding.</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you do like a mini site on a different domain or just pick a sub-domain or like a sub-directory and then work with the… </p>
<p>Boser: So… Well a lot of different ways so… For example I used to work in the travel-space quite a bit and a client a lady consulting for- called Uptake.com and founder of the company used to- run Yahoo! travel and a bunch of really smart people and they had a search tool that was basically pulled from all different places. With sentiment-search so you could plan vacations around holidays, romantic stuff, that kind of thing and so they have these great pages but Google didn’t think they were algorithmically surrounded. They were like fins, even the Panda kind of thing, right? But users liked them when they got there so instances like that, we went out and helped them establish a blog-network, that wrote about travel stuff that kind of surrounded the site and we pushed that stuff in social media and when appropriate, that content linked back into those pages on the main ship. So we use the content marketing to build the kind of attraction and almost through the links that got Google to change its mind and rank that kind of stuff. So and that’s the kind of thing that we’re moving into a lot now because we can do that separate of their IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>Alpar: And then it happens fast, especially if it’s a…</p>
<p>Boser: And they- and then we manage the whole thing, it’s our writers, we run the blog, we do the SEO on it, so we find we’ve been a lot more creative with things like that.</p>
<p>Alpar: And the client, it’s their blog or it’s your blog?</p>
<p>Boser: It depends on the contract, so we’re going to be building more of our company on products.</p>
<p>Alpar: Portfolio.</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, I mean I think ultimately at the end of the day, we will be somewhat of a media company that way and have properties that we own and run on our own, that we sell advertising, you know. Demand Media is like the big kind of giant of that model, so they actually run LiveStrong and they actually have eHow and they do that- their content, you know a more micro-focussed, hopefully better from the consulting side but that’s an appealing model to me because there’s no, there’s more value down the road in properties than there is services, right? You hit a cap and plus you can do more things. </p>
<p>Alpar: Regarding scalability or what do you mean?</p>
<p>Boser: In potential to sell your company, you know, evaluation, things like that, so…</p>
<p>Alpar: ‘Cause you have some assets that you can show. But then again if…</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah it’s, the lowest multiples that you can get is on a pure service business, right, because your clients can go away and then you don’t have it. Assets…</p>
<p>Alpar: If that was the case, if people were purely regarding that then there agencies would never be sold, so there are usually set-ups, you know, there are lock-up periods, you know earn-out periods and so on… So, let’s jump somewhere else. You seem like a really calm person and I cannot accept that, so I want to hear about one issue that really pisses you off in the Search business but I want to really, you know, I want to see the angry side of you. You cannot be that calm and that laid-back. I mean, there have to be things that make you boil, come on.</p>
<p>Boser: It’s funny, over the years I’ve been angry at a lot of stuff. I guess my biggest beef really is Google’s predatory aggregation approach to stuff, the way they’re cannibalizing specific industries. Like I’ve worked in several industries that have…</p>
<p>Alpar: Well basically anything that’s a comparison business is getting killed, sooner or later.</p>
<p>Boser: I- many years, worked in the States with companies like BizRay and Price- so I know the Comparison Shopping space very well and that…</p>
<p>Alpar: Comparison Shopping or Travel Aggregators – anything that aggregates, they won’t…</p>
<p>Boser: Exactly, so basically what Google has done is- initially, I think it’s the greatest bait and switch that’s ever happened in the States, so they came out initially and said ‘Hey, our mission is to organize the world’s information and we want to send you to that great information as quick as possible,’ and we went ‘Great, we love you!’ So we went out and became brand Evangelists and I got my mother to switch her homepage to Google. </p>
<p>Alpar: Oh my God! I’ll slap you.</p>
<p>Boser: yeah, I mean like- yeah, I know it’s like, I would actually go around to my…</p>
<p>Alpar: Go back and switch it to somewhere else, like to Yahoo!</p>
<p>Boser: I call them my NIF’s – my Non-Internet Friends, right?</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh so okay, NIF’s?</p>
<p>Boser: NIF’s. N-I-F-S. We work in these business, everybody has them. You have your- and they don’t really get what you do but I would go around to all those friends and say, ‘You got to check this out,’ ‘cause I- it was so much better and I believed what they said. So now that they’ve grown and now that they have all the eyeballs, they’ve switched from ‘our mission is to organize the world’s information’ to ‘our mission is to own the world’s information.’ Right? So they’re going out and cannibalizing and they use the search engine to unfairly compete in other spaces because they don’t have to start from scratch, build it and gain the organic attraction, they just instantly are at the top and Comparison Shopping was the best one because they started burying them for queries, they changed it up to where only new sites ranked for products…</p>
<p>Alpar: So where’s that leaving us? I mean, we don’t have a chance, they cannot be stopped and the trust will not happen and it will not be fast enough and the trust also don’t go all the way, so what is the… What will it look like in…?</p>
<p>Boser: I agree that they probably won’t move fast enough, I’m not…</p>
<p>Alpar: You know, in four years, they’ll pay a couple of billion of fees and then they’ll continue. </p>
<p>Boser: What I would like to see come out of it is basically that – you can’t use the engine, you can go buy whoever you want and you can jump in a market, compete but you shouldn’t be able to instant domination destroy good companies with a lot of great people because you’ve decided that the only aggregator in the world that’s valid is you. And they are actually doing this. They are going directly to- they’re bypassing- and some of these are well-established middle- online education spaces in an area where Google’s made pushes, they went and had a summit with schools in New York and basically cut their middle guys out of the conversation and said, ‘You don’t need us.’ I think you’re going to see it in the States in Real Estate very soon, like Google MLS…</p>
<p>Alpar: Credit cards…</p>
<p>Boser: Mortgage rates ..</p>
<p>Alpar: Flight- flight travel, anything.</p>
<p>Boser: Right, right and so that worry- it’s interesting that the biggest reasons that I’m pushing our company to go in the applications and that kind of thing is that even though I’m a search guy, I tell clients all the time – start working on ideas to connect and engage your clients away from Google. Right? If you can get all your users searching your site from an app, then you’re not depen- as dependent. And start building models that will allow you to survive if your space is the next space. More branding – really become a brand, be in that keep organic, generic keyword kind of company. It’s just not a long-term thing…</p>
<p>Alpar: The generic keyword, you don’t need like a keyword as in a product, but like a brand name like…</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, even like there’s a lot of companies that sort of focus on domains that match keywords and they don’t really build like a name like a Yahoo! or a Google or a name that’s not a real word. There’s a lot of value in that – doing stuff to generate more brand-related searches, to establish yourself, you just have to start making that move because like you said, if it does get fixed…</p>
<p>Alpar: I must say, I like your angry mood; it’s still so reflective and stuff. I think I have to step on your to e really hard, then I can see you’re angry.</p>
<p>Boser: I think I- I, you now, over the years I’ve certainly been more outspoken before. I used to do a session at SES years ago, Danny still put it together and it was called, ‘The ten things search engines do that piss me off,’ and… </p>
<p>Alpar: And you couldn’t name ten?</p>
<p>Boser: Oh no, there was ten. It was back in the time when they were doing kind of shady stuff, when they had paid inclusion and Inktomi was running around targeting people for monetization, they were kicking people out of the database and then knocking on the door saying, ‘Hey! Miss your traffic? Come sign up!’</p>
<p>Alpar: Right.</p>
<p>Boser: And I used to have a lot of experience in one year with all that stuff and Danny was doing this panel of standards like, and I said, ‘You know what? They need standards too. We’re not all the crooks.’ Then I started telling them these things I experienced that year and he was like, ‘Hey, do a panel on that,’ and I’m like ‘Alright.’ So I have been far more flamboyant and outspoken but, you know, I have to be a little bit more… I’m a boss now.</p>
<p>Alpar: What got you to calm down?</p>
<p>Boser: The people that pay attention to what I say and…</p>
<p>Alpar: So it&#8217;s the new role that gets you calmer?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, you know and you got to be a…</p>
<p>Alpar: Like the solid rock so everybody can lean onto you?</p>
<p>Boser: Exactly. I got to assure myself because…</p>
<p>Alpar: There’s so many right pictures in this one podcast. I think I have to cut it in half so there’s not too much at one time</p>
<p>Boser: Part two, yeah. So it’s assuring my partners that I’m not going to be a loose cannon, but you know you do- you mellow over somewhat. I don’t know if jaded’s the word. There are just some things you grow to accept because it’s not worth the anger and you just refocus on new stresses that’s the same thing. It’s like I’m the organic SEO guy and I’m out creating iPad apps and things like that. </p>
<p>Alpar: What do you tell to people you know, who say, is there going to be SEO at all in five years because Google’s hunting and fighting against everything and they devalue links and you know these kind of guys? You don’t have any…</p>
<p>Boser: And here’s my thing is like, I love the fact that Google’s getting better on that stuff and it keeps the job creative and we were having this discussion last night that this is what really Facebook is latching onto is that SEO to me is more of a mindset and a style of- it’s very analytical. People that are SEO’s are people that love to be okay with ‘I don’t know how it works but I’ll figure it out,’ right ‘cause that’s…</p>
<p>Alpar: Reverse engineering – you have to enjoy it. </p>
<p>Boser: Yes and it’s a spe- not everybody has it. You can a great marketer, but that mindset, so that mindset applies to anything on the web. So, I know a lot of a- a kid that worked at Uptake – I call him a kid – he worked at Uptake and now he works at Facebook. He’s brilliant, young guy who loves that kind of thing and now he’s at a place like Facebook where he can apply that to not only search engine stuff but everything they do and that’s my thing is that I might not wake up every day and go, ‘I do social media’ but I love- I can sit down to figure out what could be a cool social campaign because I can approach it the same way I used to do 15 years ago with and algorithm that, you know, just trial and error, testing and all that kind of stuff and there’s a lot of that that will apply to all aspects of the web and that will never go away but it is all blended now. So, you can’t live in a bubble anymore. That’s my biggest thing – I’m doing a talk in PubCon this year – I did it last year too but it’s kind of like an hour of just me and me at the front and this old guy Greg just talking about…</p>
<p>Alpar: How it used to be in the old days.</p>
<p>Boser: Lecturing the little whipper-snappers. You know, the young kids, saying: &#8220;You know kids &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Alpar: Getting that finger up in the air and going, ‘Ha! You don’t know what I have seen.’ </p>
<p>Boser: You know, just trying to tell them like you need to go out and test; we have what I call a second generation regurgitation. Like these…</p>
<p>Alpar: Regur-what?</p>
<p>Boser: Regurgitation, like…</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay I don’t know that word.</p>
<p>Boser: It’s a nice way to say vomit. They’re just tossing up what they’ve gotten from somebody else. They didn’t learn it themselves. So they read a blog…</p>
<p>Alpar: And then they think, it is that way.</p>
<p>Boser: Their knowledge of SEO is what they read on the blog and they never went out and challenged it and tested it.</p>
<p>Alpar: Is there another truth?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah and you know and it’s always someone’s like, even the best bloggers, take what they say and go ‘Oh!’ and run with that and go do some tests and see if that is true. Is it true in all spaces? You’ll find out a lot of neat stuff, but validate your own thoughts and prove them to yourself before you go out telling them as the gospel to a client, right.</p>
<p>Alpar: As a gospel to a client?</p>
<p>Boser: Yeah, you know like, it’s kind of a lost art form in a lot of ways, ‘cause everything’s much different, you know, the social networking, you now, coming to these things – I’m better as an SEO because of my personal connections throughout the world, knowing very, very bright people, having great relationships with them. So, when I’m seeing something I can’t figure out, I can’t find somebody that’s at a higher spot, I can call people that run and they’ll tell me right, and you can’t do that on Facebook.</p>
<p>Alpar: Well thanks so much. I think that’s probably the longest Podcast I’ve ever done. </p>
<p>Boser: Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Alpar: No, no, no, no I think it’s enjoyable. I think it’s full of good information and fun things to think about. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Boser: Thanks for having me.

Transcription of the post:

Alpar: Alright, we’re at the OM-Report and this time it’s with Greg Boser. Greg, can you introduce yourself?
Boser: My name’s Greg. I’m an SEO guy.
Alpar: Okay.
Boser: And I actually- my actual job is President of Products and Services for BlueGlass Interactive so, I’m not technically and SEO guy anymore but I still run the strategy team at BlueGlass and…
Alpar: So how many people does BlueGlass…
Boser: Probably about 45 – last count, give or take.
Alpar: And it’s pretty much a new brand, right, in the business.
Boser: Yeah, it’s- we like to call it a mash-up kind of, so it’s- several of my partners, we all had consultancies individually and then a year ago – June – four of them got together and merged and created BlueGlass and then I met them here. I already knew them but they came to Oktoberfest last year and started talking to me about coming in and running the Search Division and over a few beers that sounded like a good idea. So I said yes and merged my company into it and now a year later- like I said, I moved out of the Search and I run the Products and the Services so we’re developing some tools and stuff like that and then I also…
Alpar: Tools like monitoring or like work-flow management tools or what kind of tools?
Boser: Yeah, kind of enterprise level SEO and marketing tools to manage that, a lot of the processes that I’ve used, I’ve been doing this since I don’t know, ’96, so basically to…
Alpar: Before there were search engines, basically. 
Boser: Before, yeah, before- back when we used to argue about the name SEO, before the phrase even existed. So there’s not very many of us back then and so over the years, just a lot of the methodologies that we put together and just the internal tools that we had at my old company, we decided…
Alpar: Can you probably give like one really, really specific example? You know without giving away too much? Like what would be such a tool?
Boser: Yeah. Ah, the thing that we’ve been…
Alpar: That you would think, ‘Wow we have that and it’s really cool.’
Boser: Yeah, the thing that we’ve been working on this year a lot is- we had an internal tool, visibility tool that basically would go out and pull positions but it also factored like market share of the engine, average click-through rate, we had some data…
Alpar: What positions…
Boser: Yeah, we had some data that I got from…
Alpar: Would you differentiate…
Boser: Drinking with the Search people over the years, right? As far as percentage of clicks and so we would use a…
Alpar: Wasn’t there like leakage a while ago, like a year or a year and a half ago?
Boser: Yeah and there was AOL data, so part of that was factored in there and we used to use that in my company to do performance-based contracts where we could come in and baseline and establish that there was a trust…
Alpar: And they would trust your visibility score? Could they trust your visibility score? I mean, was there- because I think your customers need to have like a certain level of expertise in order to be willing to let themselves, you know… You know, put their lock on your visibility index without being afraid of you manipulating something, you know? 
Boser: Yeah… The way that we did it, so, in those contracts we would be fully transparent and disclose how we calculated it. So if they wanted to check it, I mean they could actually do the math manually if they wanted to so there is definitely in that kind of model a bit of client education but we found it was- you know…
Alpar: Are clients in the US, in general that- you know, far out I mean d-
Boser: Yeah, I mean I was…
Alpar: Or is it a lot of education, actually?
Boser: For me, personally it wasn’t but I tended to get, you know, when you’ve been doing it long [...]</itunes:summary>

<p>Transcription of the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Alpar: Okay, we’re in a new edition of OM Report at SEOktoberfest Fest and please introduce yourself.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Hi there, my name is Martin Macdonald. I’m head of SEO for an agency called OMD which is part of the Omnicom group. The reason why we’re laughing here is because this is the second time that we’ve done this but this is hopefully the first time that it’s actually been recorded. So I’m head of SEO for a group called OMD. We are part of Omnicom which is the world’s largest advertising agency.</p>
<p>Alpar: So OMD does advertising in all channels and now also started SEO as well?</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah, absolutely. We are the- we have the biggest trading desk for television in the United Kingdom so we’ve got a virtual lockout on that level of advertising. Search is something that we’ve been engaged with for a couple of years, I think…</p>
<p>Alpar: Search as in search engine advertising? Paid PPC?</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yes, the full SEO. Exactly, PPC. So they started down the PPC path three or four years ago. We now have the biggest agency in the UK for PPC.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s called (Action?)</p>
<p>Macdonald: It’s OMD Search. OMD Search and about 18 months ago we started down the path of building an SEO agency.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you were like the start of this initiative or just a part of it?</p>
<p>Macdonald: No, I’ve come in quite recently – I came in about six months ago to OMD to head up and drive the development of the business within the UK first but there is a wider extent across Europe with technology share and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Alpar: What have you been doing like before OMD? </p>
<p>Macdonald: I…</p>
<p>Alpar: Seven months ago.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Fair enough, so I was Head of Search for a company called Seatwave for just over three years. Seatwave is the…</p>
<p>Alpar: The second-hand ticket.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Exactly, yeah it’s the largest second-hand ticket marketplace in Europe. It’s the number one in all eleven countries that it operates in. I started there when it was a very young company and we developed out of the three, three and a bit years that I was there and before that I worked in Poker SEO for four years so I’ve been, you know I’ve been doing this for the best part of ten years now.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, okay. So what’s the difference between working a start-out and working with the classical OMD clients, like with A-brands I would say, right?</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah, there’s a huge, huge difference. So throughout my entire career, the seven or eight years I was doing this before I started working exclusively with big brands, we always had absolute buy-in from both the Dev Team and the Board-Level people within the companies. We were able to- we had really quick development cycles, we were able to push new features out within days. We were able to take control of absolutely every piece of the websites that we were optimizing for to compete across every possible search term that we could. Trying to do that with some of the world’s biggest websites is almost impossible but that’s what our jobs as SEO’s has to be over the next say three to five year, is to educate people that SEO is actually an intrinsic part of the marketing mix. That’s really what I see as being my main challenge. It’s not performing SEO on these companies&#8217; websites because at the end of the day, these brands have all got massively powerful websites anyway; they’re just extremely poorly executed. If we can get the buy-in from the board level, then we can change this around and the entire SERP-landscape will be very different in three to five years time because all of these powerful brands will be able to rank for stuff that they should already be ranking for anyway. </p>
<p>Alpar: Which actually Google also pushes, you know. The push brands, they make discounts on keyword domains and that kind of stuff so it’s actually a development that grew like as well. So…</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah, yeah sure. I mean how are we-</p>
<p>Alpar: Just a second – when you’re kind of from this beautiful start-up setup where everything that you dream of can be done and the OMD comes along and they offer you, you know, you can work with A-brands. Did you know what was coming? Or did you guess? I mean, you have friends in big agencies, they could’ve warned you how it’s going to be.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Alpar: How did you know you’re not going to go nuts and you know, be angry all the time because things are not progressing as fast as you wish they would?</p>
<p>Macdonald: So, it’s a great question and the reason why I took the job at OMD was because I had the chance to shape something that was very new, that was essentially a start-up within the Omnicom group, again, one of the world’s largest companies…</p>
<p>Alpar: How many people was there- six month ago, months ago.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Six months ago there were six, seven people on the team. We now have the core of 15 plus twelve support staff so just under 30 just doing full-time SEO and that’s the rate of growth. That’s the reason why I’m there – it’s because the rate of growth is fantastic, it’s incredible and we’re within the framework of this massive organisation so we can grow as quickly as we can possibly build the team out. That’s the- that’s you know, that’s the challenge.</p>
<p>Alpar: Usually OMD has clients that they work together with anyway so they have their PPC campaigns and then they say, ‘Ah, I got this great guy, he does something different than PPC’ and then you come along and teach and preach or…? </p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah, that’s basically how it works so the one thing that we don’t need to do ever is go out and pitch for new business because OMD in the UK-</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s huge.</p>
<p>Macdonald: We have 5000 clients. You know, and we’re doing SEO for maybe a couple of dozen of them. There is so much potential for growth within that group that it was a challenge that I couldn’t pass up – that’s the reason why I took the job working with the big brands because this is something that I feel we can shape the way that the SEO industry works over the next three to five years by having that scale behind us. I mean, we’ve got lots of strategic partnerships like we’re Google’s number one customer world-wide for Adwords. We have a lot of ability and now executing on the ability that we have is the challenge that we’ve got.</p>
<p>Alpar: So when you have those, you know, many, many clients, how do you say, ‘Okay, I’m ready to take on the next one.’?</p>
<p>Macdonald: It’s all down to the execution of process within the team. So the one thing that we don’t ever want to do is turn this into the kind of agency – and a lot of the big agencies in London and probably across Europe suffer from this – where they have a very rigid and reglemented approach to what they do. So they might have three or four modules of Link-Building and three or four modules of Content-Creation and you know, they might do a technical site order in that…</p>
<p>Alpar: Just- do you keep things simple so they can scale, right?</p>
<p>Macdonald: Exactly.</p>
<p>Alpar: I mean there is a logic to it.</p>
<p>Macdonald: No, there absolutely is a logic to it but I think the problem with that kind of model is that it never ultimately delivers great value to the customer and having always been in-house, I know how powerful a medium SEO can be and that’s my challenge – to bring the small agency model into scale. So, that’s the challenge. </p>
<p>Alpar: It hasn’t been done before so it could even be that it’s not possible. You’re aware of that?</p>
<p>Macdonald: I’m- lots of things look like they’re not possible when you first start but if you’re determined enough, you can change the world.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. Ohhhhh…. That’s a big vision, I must say. I don’t go that far but that’s good, that’s good.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Well you’ve got to have big vision, right? The- if you look at the scale of the company we work in, someone, 25 years ago when they formed this group, had the vision to turn it into the world’s largest advertising agency.</p>
<p>Alpar: If it worked out.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah, and they worked very hard and I’ve got a fantastic team who- all of whom I think are, you know.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you’ve got- hire them with experience or without experience and then you teach them?</p>
<p>Macdonald: Well, at the moment we’re very experience-heavy, so we have had people that have left other agencies and come to work with us. We’ve got people who’ve always been into SEO their entire lives and things like- you know, we’ve got some really, really skilled SEO operatives at this point in time. In order for us to scale up further, what we need to do is we need to introduce a proper training regime for new people to come in and be- the major problem with SEO has always been the fact that to learn it, it’s always an apprenticeship and that doesn’t scale. So what we need to do is build up the process that will allow us to get 20 or 30 grads in at one time and then as soon as they’re in, they can start producing and adding value to customers.</p>
<p>Alpar: But then again, just to get you into some contradictions. You&#8217;re saying the big clients, their problems are really simple at least compared to my everyday business and what you have been doing before and now you say you’re hiring experienced, heavy people but they’re actually not necessary for the clients that you have right now, right? </p>
<p>Macdonald: That’s correct. Up until now, we have been very, very top-heavy on talent – that’s absolutely true and that was just the path that the company went down in the first place and I don’t disagree that, you know, it was the wrong thing to do or if it’s…</p>
<p>Alpar: No, if you’re building up like juniors, then that’s really, really great to have experienced people and then you can scale, that…</p>
<p>Macdonald: Absolutely. So we’ve got this part down the process now in that we’ve got- we have got the processes in place as to how to execute good SEO for big brands, we have a got a very, very skill-heavy labour set at the moment in the SEO team and our challenge now is to introduce the correct training regime so that we can scale this out to a very wide level by training people up quickly and effectively to deliver great results.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, the experience-heavy SEOs, I was told – of course I cannot share that opinion, but I was told some of them are divas. So how do you deal with the diva factor in SEO? Of course I was referred to that as well but I can definitely not agree and I cannot see how it happens so I’m just asking you because probably in the UK it’s all different. Probably there you have the divas that we don’t have.</p>
<p>Macdonald: I would never say that anyone on my team is a diva. So…</p>
<p>Alpar: Besides yourself.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Besides myself, so it’s not a problem that I have to deal with them, but they probably have to deal with it with me. So I can’t even answer that.</p>
<p>Alpar: But you work in an office, nine to five?</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: So it’s not like you work out of home or anything? It’s really there, present…</p>
<p>Macdonald: There, present all the time apart from when I’m coming to great events like this where I get to spend a couple of days out of the country, so yeah. </p>
<p>Alpar: Of course but it’s for yourself to learn. It’s not like you’re enjoying this, right? I mean, it’s a heavy burden, you coming here.</p>
<p>Macdonald: It’s not a heavy burden coming to events like this. This particular event is great but at the same time, so much of our industry – because it’s still in its infancy – is based on the personal relationships that you’re able to develop with other people in the industry and sharing that information. I don’t think it will be like this forever, I think as soon as the industry grows up, which is what it needs to do, things like this will probably stop.</p>
<p>Alpar: How long will that take? It has been like this for ten years now.</p>
<p>Macdonald: It’s…</p>
<p>Alpar: How long will it take?</p>
<p>Macdonald: It’s been like this for ten years but if you look at the quality</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s growing each year.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah, yeah but if you look at- it’s not so much that our industry needs to grow, it’s that the advertising industry needs to envelop SEO and that is something that is now happening. If you look at the three big media agencies: Omnicom, WBP, you know… these are all companies who are now buying SEO agencies left, right and centre, building great teams. They are finally bringing into the marketing mix and that will be what develops our industry… And matures it.</p>
<p>Alpar: A question regarding the marketing mix, I used to have a- I used to do an internship at a really, really marketing-strong company that did consumer products and all they’re thinking about are these advertising flights and that’s like the complete contradiction to what SEO is because it’s continuous, you have to invest in it all the time, you see a little in the beginning and a lot in the end. How do you take the people in these big A-brand companies on this…? Travel…</p>
<p>Macdonald: And convince them?</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes. </p>
<p>Macdonald: So, so basi- I guess the question there is ‘How do you evangelise SEO?’ and it’s quite an easy thing to do because if you look at any typical PPC campaign and then compare it over the course of twelve months to an SEO campaign, we can generally deliver six, eight, ten times more value on a cost-per-click basis or on an acquisition-of-client basis. With big brands, that isn’t the only challenge, however. If you look at FMCG companies, you know, it might be a soft-drink manufacturer, for instance – they’re never going to sell a can of soft drink over the internet.</p>
<p>Alpar: Exactly. So you have to have this brand that they involve with values and, you know…</p>
<p>Macdonald: Exactly. So there’s a lot of things that we can do as well. Now, I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but there’s a really good example that was done – it wasn’t an SEO, it was PPC but it was a great example that Converse did about two years ago with a campaign called ‘Domination.’ You can look it up on YouTube. It’s a fantastic example of what can be done and what they did was over the course of a year, they looked at lots of search terms that have got predictably high volumes at certain times of year that fit in with a specific demographic of searcher but have no competition. So examples for that might be ‘how to get a prom date.’</p>
<p>Alpar: What?</p>
<p>Macdonald: ‘How to get a prom date’ in America. Or ‘first day of summer’ is another good example and they built up micro sites that were branded ‘Converse’ that gave the people the information that they were looking for because they knew that the average, you know, it would be class A, B, C, 18 to 24 year-old guys that were searching for it…</p>
<p>Alpar: And smart as well.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Exactly. So there’s lots of different ways that SEO can be used to attract brand equity and brand recognition for these big companies.</p>
<p>Alpar: But Converse shoes you can actually sell online but…</p>
<p>Macdonald: You can. </p>
<p>Alpar: You know, if it was an ice cream or any, really, FMCG company then that’s a perfect example.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah, exactly. Exactly and you know, if you look at- I was having this discussion a couple of weeks ago with another one of my friends and this doesn’t just apply to the worlds of FMCG. If you look at Politics… Perfect.</p>
<p>Alpar: Or cars.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Well cars but…</p>
<p>Alpar: You can, like a test drive – you can generate like a lead for a test drive online and the image that is there, connected to certain car brands. You cannot build that, you know, in clicks</p>
<p>Macdonald: That’s true, that’s true but let’s take lead generation entirely out of the question here. If you look at competitive SEO against values or against demographics.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay.</p>
<p>Macdonald: So recently, about two years ago we had this thing in London where the Mayor, Boris Johnson was introducing bendy buses, you know the really long buses that are joined at the middle and it turned into a big political issue and things like that. Now, is it a great innovation I missed? No, no there’s nothing particularly special about them at all, they’ve got them in the rest of Europe and all the rest… But the thing is, he could have used at that point, SEO, to rank for the terms that were specific to what he was trying to introduce to get his message out there, in the same way that that the world’s biggest brands that will never sell their product online, can also get their message out there by targeting terms that make sense.</p>
<p>Alpar: Sure, If I’m selling cream – face, hand cream or something and I’m the brand, I should be ranking for hand cream, that kind of stuff, you’re… </p>
<p>Macdonald: No… Things like beauty tips, you know, things like that that are not inherently commercial at all. There’s so much opportunity out there for people to introduce their brands so if we look at…</p>
<p>Alpar: Or associate like something positive because they look at tips and then they know, okay this brand really helps me and then they’re more likely to buy.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Right, so look at the top ten results on Google.com for the search term ‘eat healthy’.’ Okay? I don’t think there’s any root domains in that. It’s all- it’s eHow, it’s Mahalo it’s things like that, okay.</p>
<p>Alpar: probably website with lots of great content right?</p>
<p>Macdonald: Well, you know, arguably, they’ve got lots of content – I’ll agree with that, but my point there is if you look at, I don’t know, health clubs, what a perfect search term for them to be targeting. Yet they don’t. You know you could still argue that those guys will sell memberships online and things like that but if you look at FMCG or look at fast food retailers for instance, why wouldn’t some of the world’s biggest fast food retailers want to rank for ‘eat healthy’ and then explaining why their food is better than other people’s and all that.</p>
<p>Alpar: How do you explain these companies that say the time lag that there is between activity and results, because you know from their PPC campaign, they know I- okay but I give you 20000 bucks this month and you fire them out, I get the clicks, and you know, the same thing from their – TV ads, print ads, whatever – how do you explain this, I mean how do you take that…</p>
<p>Macdonald: So, I’ve never really experienced that as a problem. The kind of people that we have to pitch to are all highly successful individuals who are on the boards of very large companies. I am, you know, there might be marketing directors of airlines</p>
<p>Alpar: So they’re not making decisions for the next three months, moor going for the next three years. </p>
<p>Macdonald: Exactly. So these are highly competent, highly successful people and it’s not a problem I’ve run into. If we were doing this for our SME’s, I can totally see how this would be a problem but we’re doing this for brands that have existed for maybe a hundred years already right</p>
<p>Alpar: You have more strategic Backlinks.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Exactly.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay that’s cool. So what really pisses you off in Search these days?</p>
<p>Macdonald: What really pisses me off in Search these days?</p>
<p>Alpar: So it’s just to get away from the politically correct answers.</p>
<p>Macdonald: yeah, yeah, yeah that’s fine. That’s a great question. What really pisses me off in Search these days is the fact that certain things still work that just fill the internet up with crap. So, by that…</p>
<p>Alpar: Did you talk to Joost, because I asked him the same question; he gave me the same answer. I think, I think you’re, you know…</p>
<p>Macdonald: Did he? No I- yeah no seriously, seriously I-</p>
<p>Alpar: It was a preparation for the interview.</p>
<p>Macdonald: (laughter) yeah but I’ve compared notes with him. No, it’s my number one bugbear right as I hate the whole article spinning and directory submission and the sake of creating more stuff on the internet just for the sake of getting it there for a link, I don’t think is an appropriate way for big brands, particularly, to be operating. So, it’s much, much, much more important for me to do well-executed campaigns that make sense. I mean, there’s a great example that we did for Virgin this year where we launched a news story – it was just after Pluto had been re-qualified not a planet…</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. </p>
<p>Macdonald: So we launched a news story with Virgin saying that Richard Branson had bought Pluto to re-instate it as a planet. Now we got links from almost every newspaper in the world off the back of that, you know – The BBC, CNN, Fox News, CBS – all of them linked back to the page that we wanted to for it.</p>
<p>Alpar: Is it actually legal to say something that is not true?</p>
<p>Macdonald: We released it on April the first.</p>
<p>Alpar: Ahh that’s good, that’s good, yeah but then again ah okay… It can take off.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah it went massively viral.</p>
<p>Alpar: He’s crazy enough, so it could be possible.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Exactly.</p>
<p>Alpar: Could it be? It could be.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Exactly, exactly but that’s the thing – it’s about creative thinking. It’s not about going onto a webmaster forum or an SEO forum and paying someone 15 dollars to do a thousand directory submissions. That is bullshit. I disapprove of that level of SEO. I have done for many years. I don’t think that’s what this as an industry should be about – it should be about creative thinking and execution of great campaigns.</p>
<p>Alpar: But that is only from the perspective of doing SEO for large companies SMEs or like the individual Affiliate guy who does a little SEO for his own websites to earn a little on the side?</p>
<p>Macdonald: Well, there’s always going to be the question of – if you can get value from that, whatever, 50 dollars that you’re investing in link-building, right, and if you can get value from it and it’s ROI positive, then I can totally see how you would do that.</p>
<p>Alpar: That’s why it still exists – that’s the whole explanation.</p>
<p>Macdonald: But- yeah. That’s fine, that’s fine.</p>
<p>Alpar: It works and it pays off, that’s why it exists. </p>
<p>Macdonald: But one day – touch wood – it will stop working. Hopefully when Google figure that shit out once and for all, it will stop working and then…</p>
<p>Alpar: What’s your guess? When is that going to be?</p>
<p>Macdonald: That will be- I had an argument about this last night that I think you were involved in- I think over the next two, I’ll say three ‘cause I got- I got, alright, alright…</p>
<p>Alpar: Ooooohh that’s- yesterday you were like ‘18 month- 18 month max!’</p>
<p>Macdonald: Alright, fair enough so… A lot of creative people in SEO have managed to engineer the link graph to such an extent that we can make things rank – I’m not including myself in this, I would never do anything like this – but there’s- we’ve managed to engineer networks that allow us to link to websites inorganically, to make them rank the stuff. There is only a very small percentage of the human population that have the ability to create a link on the internet – not very many people have their own websites or blogs. You know, it’s such a small fraction.</p>
<p>Alpar: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Such a huge fraction of the entire internet have the ability to have a social profile. I see no way that this will not be worked much heavier into the Google algorithm over the next 18 months or two years. It has to be. So they got quite far down the road with Twitter and then they’ve abandoned that, suspiciously one might say about three weeks after the loss that Twitter experienced, Google Plus was launched. Now I don’t think that has…</p>
<p>Alpar: Accidents, accidents.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Pure coincidence. It was probably two different business units, had no idea…</p>
<p>Alpar: Coincidence, didn’t communicate well, it’s a big company.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Alpar: And anything bad can happen. </p>
<p>Macdonald: But… And whilst I don’t think at the moment it’s got any influence on natural rankings, I genuinely think that as soon as they’ve got enough data, they will switch that on, and that will be what we will be engineering for in future.</p>
<p>Alpar: I think it’s a really smart thought that the representation- I mean, if we think of a link as a recommendation, then I can really, you know, see your point that few people can give a recommendation via a link but many can give them via social signals, so just a question of when it happen…</p>
<p>Macdonald: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Alpar: But it has to be the next level.</p>
<p>Macdonald: It has to be, it has to be.</p>
<p>Alpar: And it just like, like when Google took over and you know AltaVista and Lycos with On-Page focus. It couldn’t work. It just delivers better results and this is what social’s going to be some day.</p>
<p>Macdonald: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: We’ll just have to place our bets – when is that going to be?</p>
<p>Macdonald: I- yeah I was doing this 15 years ago when you had to write Viagra on a page a 150 times, right, and we’ve got Dennis here who was head of SEO for eBay for some time and I’ve used a little slide shot of them doing exactly that a couple of years ago in many of my presentations saying, ‘Okay, it wasn’t just the little guys that were keyword stuffing, eBay spent years doing it because it worked.’ You know that’s the- that goes back to the whole point about the 50 dollars for submitting to a thousand five hundred directories – at the moment it works. It’s a bad strategy. It’s a technique but it’s a bad strategy.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s like lead-throwing. You know, they do it while it works, if it doesn’t they will look for something else if there is something else but a strategic move would be different. </p>
<p>Macdonald: Absolutely. Absolutely so that’s- that to me is the fundamental difference between working on big brand SEO and SME SEO.</p>
<p>Alpar: Aright. Thanks so much for the interview.</p>
<p>Macdonald: You’re very welcome. Thank you.

Transcription of the post:

Alpar: Okay, we’re in a new edition of OM Report at SEOktoberfest Fest and please introduce yourself.
Macdonald: Hi there, my name is Martin Macdonald. I’m head of SEO for an agency called OMD which is part of the Omnicom group. The reason why we’re laughing here is because this is the second time that we’ve done this but this is hopefully the first time that it’s actually been recorded. So I’m head of SEO for a group called OMD. We are part of Omnicom which is the world’s largest advertising agency.
Alpar: So OMD does advertising in all channels and now also started SEO as well?
Macdonald: Yeah, absolutely. We are the- we have the biggest trading desk for television in the United Kingdom so we’ve got a virtual lockout on that level of advertising. Search is something that we’ve been engaged with for a couple of years, I think…
Alpar: Search as in search engine advertising? Paid PPC?
Macdonald: Yes, the full SEO. Exactly, PPC. So they started down the PPC path three or four years ago. We now have the biggest agency in the UK for PPC.
Alpar: It’s called (Action?)
Macdonald: It’s OMD Search. OMD Search and about 18 months ago we started down the path of building an SEO agency.
Alpar: So you were like the start of this initiative or just a part of it?
Macdonald: No, I’ve come in quite recently – I came in about six months ago to OMD to head up and drive the development of the business within the UK first but there is a wider extent across Europe with technology share and so on and so forth.
Alpar: What have you been doing like before OMD? 
Macdonald: I…
Alpar: Seven months ago.
Macdonald: Fair enough, so I was Head of Search for a company called Seatwave for just over three years. Seatwave is the…
Alpar: The second-hand ticket.
Macdonald: Exactly, yeah it’s the largest second-hand ticket marketplace in Europe. It’s the number one in all eleven countries that it operates in. I started there when it was a very young company and we developed out of the three, three and a bit years that I was there and before that I worked in Poker SEO for four years so I’ve been, you know I’ve been doing this for the best part of ten years now.
Alpar: Okay, okay. So what’s the difference between working a start-out and working with the classical OMD clients, like with A-brands I would say, right?
Macdonald: Yeah, there’s a huge, huge difference. So throughout my entire career, the seven or eight years I was doing this before I started working exclusively with big brands, we always had absolute buy-in from both the Dev Team and the Board-Level people within the companies. We were able to- we had really quick development cycles, we were able to push new features out within days. We were able to take control of absolutely every piece of the websites that we were optimizing for to compete across every possible search term that we could. Trying to do that with some of the world’s biggest websites is almost impossible but that’s what our jobs as SEO’s has to be over the next say three to five year, is to educate people that SEO is actually an intrinsic part of the marketing mix. That’s really what I see as being my main challenge. It’s not performing SEO on these companies&#8217; websites because at the end of the day, these brands have all got massively powerful websites anyway; they’re just extremely poorly executed. If we can get the buy-in from the board level, then we can change this around and the entire SERP-landscape will be very different in three to five years time because all of these powerful brands will be able to rank for stuff that they should already be ranking for anyway. 
Alpar: Which actually Google also pushes, you know. The push brands, they make discounts on keyword d[...]</itunes:summary>

<p>Transcription of the Podcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Alpar: So, today’s OM Report is with Joost. Joost, please introduce yourself.</p>
<p>de Valk: Hi, Joost de Valk. I do WordPress and a bit of SEO.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay.</p>
<p>de Valk: And combining the two.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So, what was first, WordPress or SEO? </p>
<p>de Valk: SEO. </p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. </p>
<p>de Valk: I picked WordPress because it was reasonably easy to SEO but… and then I started building plug-ins to actually make the SEO for WordPress easier, so… But SEO was there first. I had a professional career in SEO before I even started in WordPress. </p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, but you’re an engineer at heart, I mean, you studied something like Computer Science or something like that?</p>
<p>de Valk: No, I studied theology…</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh!</p>
<p>de Valk: …and International Business and Management Studies but I’ve been coding ever since I was twelve and built my first website in- when I was twelve in ‘94 so… I’ve always been a Coder, I’ve got- I’ve studied those two studies and dropped out and went to work as a Java Developer, basically. So, yeah, I’m a Coder at heart, but also the different markets here and the combination or- sort of makes me into what I am, I guess.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, so you have like a whole range of free products you’re giving away – how does that make- how does that work out? I mean, how does that pay off? You- just because of the honour and pride and the number of downloads, you know, it doesn’t earn money.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, it doesn’t. It does- it has generated a huge amount of visibility for me which generates a lot of leads every…</p>
<p>Alpar: Leads for?</p>
<p>de Valk: For SEO Consulting and WordPress Consulting.</p>
<p>Alpar: So what do you do more – WordPress Consulting or SEO Consulting? Or is it usually, actually SEO with WordPress Consulting?</p>
<p>de Valk: It’s usually both. Yeah, yeah, it’s usually both. So, although I do other platforms as well – I’ve done quite a bit for Magento – so I do, I’ve done the same…</p>
<p>Alpar: Onlineshops.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, so I’ve done the same stuff there, released some free extensions, done an article on Magento SEO and so… I tend to think I could actually replicate it for any other platform should I want to.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, we’re all waiting for a Joost-Magento SEO Plug-in?</p>
<p>de Valk: Well, there is one already can- a Robots-Meta Extension for Magento that I built.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s not as big as the WordPress one?</p>
<p>de Valk: No, my WordPress actually…</p>
<p>Alpar: In- functionality-wise.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, my WordPress SEO Plug-in is by far the biggest thing I’ve built so far. At least…</p>
<p>Alpar: Are you aware of how many people are using it?</p>
<p>de Valk: People? No, I know it runs on over a million sites now…</p>
<p>Alpar: Wow.</p>
<p>de Valk: But that is because it also&#8230; It’s run on a very large amount of multi-site installations, so…</p>
<p>Alpar: So like WordPress MU.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, so there’s a couple of very…</p>
<p>Alpar: Would you say  μ?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, multi-site is the new name, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay.</p>
<p>de Valk: So, there’s a couple of very, very big ones where…</p>
<p>Alpar: It started off with like the Greek letter, right? But then it was confusing, it was like the u.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, it was the μ at first and they turned it into multi-site later on.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s a little less nerdy and it’s a little easier to not make mistakes recording it.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, it’s a lot more useful that way.</p>
<p>Alpar: And so how do people have to imagine your every day work? You have a fancy office with lots of employees, coders that do your stuff and you just attach your name onto it? Is that how it works? With a great view… Palace, basically.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, not at all. No I just- I, yeah work- No, no, I only started out on my own in October last year, so I was an agency guy before that and as most of your English listeners will know, agency people make their own. So, so I started out on my own in October, been doing very well but I work from home. I like that a lot. I’ve got two kids so I see them an awful lot, number three’s coming up so I have a lot of time for that and a lot of- I do outsource a lot to all over the world depending on what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Alpar: So like what kind of tasks? Like coding tasks or outsourced blog posts?</p>
<p>de Valk: Everything. No, not my own blog posts but I do outsource content writing for other stuff, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay.</p>
<p>de Valk: So…</p>
<p>Alpar: But the coding you do yourself? Or you do some of the coding outsourced as well?</p>
<p>de Valk: I outsource some of the coding.</p>
<p>Alpar: Which countries do you outsource to?</p>
<p>de Valk: Depends on the…</p>
<p>Alpar: Like, off-shore or like near-shore or…</p>
<p>de Valk: No, near.</p>
<p>Alpar: Friends in Netherlands.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, that- most of it depends on what it is. So, if it’s sites or stuff for clients it’s usually in Europe. For instance, for my SEO Plug-In that I recently had an English WordPress Core Developer do some of the stuff in there because I couldn’t fix it myself. So, it depends a bit on what needs to be done. My experience with outsourcing to…</p>
<p>Alpar: So it’s pretty entrepreneurial, actually.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah. My- yeah. My experience with outsourcing to India and so have been less… good.</p>
<p>Alpar: Good.</p>
<p>de Valk: So…</p>
<p>Alpar: Others may have other experiences, that’s always okay.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, so I really like working with a lot of the Eastern European countries and we have some pretty good experiences there, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, what- are the clients that you consult, are they, you know, are they big publishing houses because they use WordPress or do you- or like shops or do you focus on elements or themes?</p>
<p>de Valk: It- a lot of- no, everywhere. So, in the last year I’ve worked with eBay, SalesFirst, Tribune, I mean, but a lot of the…</p>
<p>Alpar: You seem to have more than one person talking to them, right? So, I mean, at least two of the companies you named, I know others who also work for them.</p>
<p>de Valk: Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Alpar: So how does that work? I mean, how do you collaborate? So you like…</p>
<p>de Valk: You don’t, because you’d usually hear after the fact that they worked there as well. That’s how big companies work, they just waste money. So…</p>
<p>Alpar: You think this is the case? Or does it probably also make sense because for people who look at fresh eyes at the same topics and then you get new input and then you get more…</p>
<p>de Valk: No, yeah, I do things &#8211; No, the thing is that I do things; I do other things, usually. So for eBay for instance, most of what I do for eBay is just training their Developers and SEO. So it’s more training that I do…</p>
<p>Alpar: Making them understand why the Marketers maybe want something?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, making- and making sure that they don’t fuck up in the first place.</p>
<p>Alpar: So what is the kind of things that you make them look out for? How does one have to…?</p>
<p>de Valk: The funny thing is, most Web Developers really like developing according to web standards but they can’t really convince their bosses that they need to spend a bit more money and do everything according to web standards and I can usually show them that that is actually very good SEO as well, so they can sell it a bit better to their bosses and then they- when a Marketer comes to them, they say ‘Can we do this and this?’ they can actually implement it in a nicer web-standard-friendly way and it usually works very well for their SEO. Then I teach them the small little tricks where these things are different and show them that SEO actually makes money but what happens in a lot of companies where I come in is that SEO’s and Developers are fighting because SEO’s are in the Marketing Department and they hate the Developers and the other way around…</p>
<p>Alpar: Are they even separate, then they fight against other Online Marketers, against Product Managers, against Tech Guys and so on, and so on?</p>
<p>de Valk: Etcetera, yeah. So…</p>
<p>Alpar: That’s a very integrative, you know, kind of task – SEO – it’s more integrative. It has to do with all other parts of the company…</p>
<p>de Valk: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Alpar: Compared to SEO or anything else.</p>
<p>de Valk: yeah so I try to explain that to those Developers and because I come from a developer background and have some- well, I’ve got some things to my name that show them that I’m actually a good developer…</p>
<p>Alpar: So they trust your opinion</p>
<p>de Valk: They trust me and….</p>
<p>Alpar: You can take them on the journey.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, it helps a lot. So, yeah that what I- I do that quite often and I really…</p>
<p>Alpar: Bit it seems to- if you’re focused on the Tech-Side of SEO, it must have been that your focus is mostly On-Page. Is that…?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah it is. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so my…</p>
<p>Alpar: And we can always stay perfectly white-hat if you’re not cloaking around, which is also good for the image and good for the relations too, right?</p>
<p>de Valk: I tend to think I’m very white-hat.</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes, yes, yes. Okay, okay. So, why are you white hat? I mean, especially from an intellectual point of view it- wouldn’t it make sense to test other things and that as well?</p>
<p>de Valk: The thing is that most of the companies that I work with can’t even be bothered if I do on-page SEO, well, for big companies, it usually…</p>
<p>Alpar: They don’t even need the links; they just need it to be good on-site</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, the rewards of that are astonishing and then if there’s- if more’s needed, fine, then I’ll happily refer them to someone else. Usually someone here – who’s here now –  and tell them like, ‘Okay, you probably need more links’ or something like that, they go work with him or her or whatever…</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So you have some- does it work the other way around? With guys who are more from the Link Marketing side of things – do they talk to you when they need deeper Tech-Stuff?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, that happens quite often, you know, there’s quite a few Link Builders out there who don’t know that much about on-site SEO.</p>
<p>Alpar: Probably, it’s also a big difference, you know, if it’s like a short-hat kind of task which, you know many people can manage and then if you come to something that has several million products and it’s like a totally different story and that’s probably where they need help.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah and the thing is that my- the- it’s the technical side but it’s also the consulting side – to actually get those companies to implement what you want to do.</p>
<p>Alpar: So do you think that’s like a communication thing or is it- ‘cause you’re like a heavyweight and…</p>
<p>de Valk: It’s more politics and yeah, it’s a bit of coming in as a heavyweight, that helps because you usually end up higher in the…</p>
<p>Alpar: Hierarchy.</p>
<p>de Valk: In the hierarchy and it makes it easier to push things through. </p>
<p>Alpar: So you think it’s probably good that you’re in- a lot more expensive because it gives your words more weight?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, absolutely. I think pricing has something to do with that, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, do y- is there- is the day-rate of Joost official or not so much?</p>
<p>de Valk: It is, yeah. My day rate is two-and-a-half thousand Euros which is not even that expensive for … measured by the German standards &#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: No, I would think so, I know more expensive ones.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, there’s come up quite a few in those &#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: But then in the States, you know, it’s a whole different ball game, right?</p>
<p>de Valk: Well, two-and-a-half thousand Euros used to be not that much but it is now a lot in the States and that’s not because of the Euro, that’s because of the crappy Dollar, so…</p>
<p>Alpar: So now you’re going to adjust your rates?</p>
<p>de Valk: No it’s just…</p>
<p>Alpar: From the US it’s higher now.</p>
<p>de Valk: it’s just okay as it is, and I usually make project prices anyway or retainers for long periods but it’s around that mark.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So, how would you think- you said you work mostly with US clients, so how do you think- what’s the difference between SEO in the US and SEO in Germany. Do you think there is a difference and if there is, how is it…? </p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, there is a difference. Everything happens earlier in the US. So…</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you think like Google algorithms changes and so on?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, yeah and…</p>
<p>Alpar: Then it doesn’t- then this is like a very small difference, I’d say.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, some stuff happens like six months earlier in the US and in Germany it’s a bit faster, in Holland it’s like waiting for years sometimes. Also, their language recognition in English is still so much better than any other language. So… I would say that the biggest difference is actually that SEO is somewhat different for these countries.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, because it’s just a little bit behind times</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah. Yeah, it’s a bit more competitive in the States for a lot of Germans, although Germany can get very competitive for terms as well.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, what do you think about the inter-mining of Social SEO? Do you think that is different in the States and in Europe? Because, you know, it may be the same thing, you know, that the same thing will happen here, just a little bit later. Then again, it may be that they just use it differently. What do you think about that?</p>
<p>de Valk: I- a bit of both. It will happen because they’re probably the best signals Google is ever going to get for ranking.</p>
<p>Alpar: If they can get them from Facebook.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, they won’t get them from Facebook, but they’ll scrape them off of Facebook like buttons and stuff like that…</p>
<p>Alpar: I think there’s one company present here who’s going to show something like that.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah. But yeah they- they’ll use those signals and time will tell what will happen exactly. For now, I’m just focusing on all of them and just…</p>
<p>Alpar: On what?</p>
<p>de Valk: On all of them and just making sure that you have good links and do the social stuff well. Funny thing is it makes sense to do it all well because you getting normal links without doing the social stuff well is pretty hard.</p>
<p>Alpar: You think so? Why that?</p>
<p>de Valk: Because, if you want to white-hat, at least. Because you actually have to be talked about and I- for people to link to you, they have to talk about you and they way they talk about you right now is using those social channels so it all ties into one another and I do think that they will use them as checks and balances against each other so if you- if they see very little social traffic at your site and they see a lot of new incoming links, then it’s a very good way for them to see, ‘Oh wait, something weird is happening.’</p>
<p>Alpar: But then again, there’s stuff that people are shy to talk about. We just had- in that other presentation we had the example of online dating. People are usually still shy to admit that they would do online dating. So, yeah it will be different for several niches.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah. Yeah, for several markets and…</p>
<p>Alpar: And it’s like pay-day loans – who’s going to like a pay-day loan page?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, or my mom for instance does relationship therapy. That’s not the kind of thing that people are going to be tweeting about</p>
<p>Alpar: No, no, no, no, no. They didn’t- won’t even add your mom on Facebook.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, absolutely not, so that makes that stuff harder then at the same time, that’s the problem that all her competitors have as well so it’s now a real problem.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So it will be, there will be huge advantages depending on what  …</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, that’s already happening anyways, I mean shop and search is completely different from… So Google does differentiate an awful lot between all of those things anyway, and basically, Google is turning into a lot of vertical searches.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, tell me one thing that really pisses you off in search. You- you know, the interview is calm so far, I’ll ask you something that really…</p>
<p>de Valk: Well there is quite a few things that piss me off quite badly and the thing that pisses me off most is people using ten-year old techniques – ten-year old black-hat techniques and still ranking with them because Google doesn’t bother to fucking fix it.</p>
<p>Alpar: Because it’s like in countries where Google has just sort of…</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, when I still encounter sites ranking with no frame-span, for instance, I- you see that happening in Holland every once in a while, and I’m like ‘Fuck it.’</p>
<p>Alpar: But does it- do you have the feeling that it at least works just for shorter periods.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, it works quite well for and it’s- and there’s a lot of stuff like that that just works and it annoys the shit out of me.</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you think it’s probably because it’s just- you know, Holland is not their focus and then… In Holland, this spam is such a little part; it just doesn’t make sense to take care of it because it’s in such a niche.</p>
<p>de Valk: No, that’s not entirely true. True, but it’s the same thing, I mean this idiot will do something that scrapers and I’d look at it in indeed.com on indeed.nl, these job-scraping sites, I mean those are incredibly big scraping sites.</p>
<p>Alpar: You mean, actually doing some good job on the metadata I think… Then again…</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, but they make their fucking results-pages look like Google. It’s like…</p>
<p>Alpar: As Google’s?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, so I click on a search result and I get to a search result. I thought Google was against that but apparently that’s a different ball game for some of those sites, so that pisses me off.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So, what do you think, how will that solve, because Google will do any vertical at some point I time and then the scrapers in that area will die as well?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: So Google is the problem but they will solve it as well?</p>
<p>de Valk: Google will file the patent on job-search last week and so before job-search are- three to six months, before Google will release job-search, those sites will start dropping in rankings. You can wait for that to happen</p>
<p>Alpar: And then we’d have a mystic update parallel to that that will take care of some other stuff as well?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: And then, accidentally all the job-scraper sites will go down.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: It will just be a sad fact with a special update named after some other animal, right?</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, or engineer, or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Alpar: Or something in between.</p>
<p>de Valk: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Alpar: Alright. Thanks a lot for the interview.</p>

Transcription of the Podcast:

Alpar: So, today’s OM Report is with Joost. Joost, please introduce yourself.
de Valk: Hi, Joost de Valk. I do WordPress and a bit of SEO.
Alpar: Okay.
de Valk: And combining the two.
Alpar: Okay. So, what was first, WordPress or SEO? 
de Valk: SEO. 
Alpar: Okay. 
de Valk: I picked WordPress because it was reasonably easy to SEO but… and then I started building plug-ins to actually make the SEO for WordPress easier, so… But SEO was there first. I had a professional career in SEO before I even started in WordPress. 
Alpar: Okay, but you’re an engineer at heart, I mean, you studied something like Computer Science or something like that?
de Valk: No, I studied theology…
Alpar: Oh!
de Valk: …and International Business and Management Studies but I’ve been coding ever since I was twelve and built my first website in- when I was twelve in ‘94 so… I’ve always been a Coder, I’ve got- I’ve studied those two studies and dropped out and went to work as a Java Developer, basically. So, yeah, I’m a Coder at heart, but also the different markets here and the combination or- sort of makes me into what I am, I guess.
Alpar: Okay, so you have like a whole range of free products you’re giving away – how does that make- how does that work out? I mean, how does that pay off? You- just because of the honour and pride and the number of downloads, you know, it doesn’t earn money.
de Valk: No, it doesn’t. It does- it has generated a huge amount of visibility for me which generates a lot of leads every…
Alpar: Leads for?
de Valk: For SEO Consulting and WordPress Consulting.
Alpar: So what do you do more – WordPress Consulting or SEO Consulting? Or is it usually, actually SEO with WordPress Consulting?
de Valk: It’s usually both. Yeah, yeah, it’s usually both. So, although I do other platforms as well – I’ve done quite a bit for Magento – so I do, I’ve done the same…
Alpar: Onlineshops.
de Valk: Yeah, so I’ve done the same stuff there, released some free extensions, done an article on Magento SEO and so… I tend to think I could actually replicate it for any other platform should I want to.
Alpar: So, we’re all waiting for a Joost-Magento SEO Plug-in?
de Valk: Well, there is one already can- a Robots-Meta Extension for Magento that I built.
Alpar: It’s not as big as the WordPress one?
de Valk: No, my WordPress actually…
Alpar: In- functionality-wise.
de Valk: No, my WordPress SEO Plug-in is by far the biggest thing I’ve built so far. At least…
Alpar: Are you aware of how many people are using it?
de Valk: People? No, I know it runs on over a million sites now…
Alpar: Wow.
de Valk: But that is because it also&#8230; It’s run on a very large amount of multi-site installations, so…
Alpar: So like WordPress MU.
de Valk: Yeah, so there’s a couple of very…
Alpar: Would you say  μ?
de Valk: Yeah, multi-site is the new name, yeah.
Alpar: Okay.
de Valk: So, there’s a couple of very, very big ones where…
Alpar: It started off with like the Greek letter, right? But then it was confusing, it was like the u.
de Valk: Yeah, it was the μ at first and they turned it into multi-site later on.
Alpar: It’s a little less nerdy and it’s a little easier to not make mistakes recording it.
de Valk: Yeah, it’s a lot more useful that way.
Alpar: And so how do people have to imagine your every day work? You have a fancy office with lots of employees, coders that do your stuff and you just attach your name onto it? Is that how it works? With a great view… Palace, basically.
de Valk: No, not at all. No I just- I, yeah work- No, no, I only started out on my own in October last year, so I was an agency guy before that and as most of your English listeners will know, agency people make their own. So, so I started out on my own in[...]</itunes:summary>

<p>Transcription:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alpar: So, hello, we are here at the Campixx and I found somebody who does not, who is not a native German. Roy, tell us about yourself.<br />
Huiskes: Hey I am Roy, I used to work at a company called Onetomarket and I am doing the podcast State of Search with Bas van den Beld. Probably familiar with a lot of people, especially with podcast listener check it out. And I was for Onetomarket based, we did a lot of stuff in Germany so I went to German conferences and a lot of friends of mine are still here and I heard good stories about Marko’s thing and this is the reason why I ended up over here, drinking beer. And doing the podcast and having fun.</p>
<p>Alpar: No, I think it is a really great thing that you bring some international colour into a seemingly local conference.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Definitely.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, tell us about yourself, what, I think podcasts are not really the best way to earn money, so I assume you are doing something else besides that?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah definitely, I am an SEO.</p>
<p>Alpar: Oooh!</p>
<p>Huiskes: For instance, gee wonder why? I started to do SEO for Onetomarket, five six years ago. No, I started at Onetomarket five years ago, six years ago, whatever, before that I did SEO at a local shop but that wasn&#8217;t that big.<br />
Alpar: So what did you do even before, did you study? Did you, you know, programme? What did you do?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I actually did&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Drop out of school?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Definitely dropped out of school, tried to, ten years tried to get a diploma, nah, never worked out. Started, well was smarter than my teachers actually, so that didn&#8217;t work out that well. They were talking about &#8216;yeah you should be graphical, make art of websites’. Screw that, I want to make money from it, and everybody else should as well. So that’s why I dropped off and I started to do research marketing because I needed traffic on my site. I could create the best beautiful things and if nobody saw it, it’s still shit. So I wanted people to see my stuff. That is why I went into SEO.</p>
<p>Alpar: So how does the SEO scene, you’re from the Netherlands, if somebody doesn’t know, and how does the SEO scene in the Netherlands look like? I mean you know, is it&#8230;?</p>
<p>Huiskes: It’s nice compared to the German one, I think.</p>
<p>Alpar: What do you mean? What German, what is the nice thing about it?</p>
<p>Huiskes: The way people interact with each other. The German ones are more aggressive towards each other.</p>
<p>Alpar: You think?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I think it is more aggressive on a competitive level, not aggressive towards the persons, but more aggressive in getting on the number one position. And all of them were pretty straight against each other. We have still this thing called stop bugging us.</p>
<p>Alpar: So do you share the number one position?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah definitely. Nah, we are switching, we are switching sides again, but I mean we are looking at start pages, start pages aren’t in Germany. But the start pages do work. It’s a lot of clones from that as well.</p>
<p>Alpar: Can you probably explain for people who do not know what start pages are. They are called Startpaginas, correct?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah. Yeah, definitely, yeah. GoedBegin.com, it’s one of our crap sites</p>
<p>Alpar: What’s it called?</p>
<p>Huiskes: GoedBegin.com. It’s a crap site, don’t go there. Seriously, don’t go there. There is no</p>
<p>Alpar: I have to go train. GoedBegin?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, GoedBegin.com. Don’t go there, seriously. No, seriously that’s a bad sign for you. That’s the one that got banned. So, don&#8217;t go that way. But stuff like that, its clones, Startkabel, it is all pages with just links on it for if you’re elderly and you don’t know what to start with, this is the point where you start and you got links to everywhere. So there is lots of funny links on there and lots of bought links and trade links and, it’s crap, but it works, it ranks. It used to rank.</p>
<p>Alpar: It seems to be like, I have been active in the Netherlands as well and to me it seems it’s a, I haven&#8217;t seen this phenomenon in any other country, have you?</p>
<p>Huiskes: It’s a Dutch thing, yeah, definitely. It’s, the … who runs the biggest one, that’s the startpagina and it has 22 thousand sub domains, something like that, which are specific in niches. So if you run for instance a radio station, there is a radio station startpagina for you. If you are interested in that, you can start with your internet on that page. Ah, it is the same thing in China, they have this Emperor&#8217;s page, and Emperor does the recommendations on that as well, so it’s a nice way of getting rich.</p>
<p>Alpar: The Chinese and the Netherlands they are connected by</p>
<p>Huiskes: We have the same stupid kind of way, yeah; definitely, we have the same stupid way of starting with internet</p>
<p>Alpar: Wow, international webs on the</p>
<p>Huiskes: We like Chinese food as well, though.</p>
<p>Alpar: How about the other way around? Ah maybe not.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Don’t guess now, no the Boerenkool wouldn’t work that well in China I guess. (Laughs)</p>
<p>Alpar: Alright, so so how do they, I mean are they, in other countries like in France everyone wants to blog, and in Germany some blog, some have their simple CMS websites so if people want to start out in internet in Netherlands, they really build a startpagina to start with?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, that is the fastest way to go and then they started out to weblog.nl, that is one of the common ways as well, that did pretty well.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s something like a free blogging website, it’s just like WordPress or Blogger and &#8230;.</p>
<p>Huiskes: And it’s Dutch, that’s the main difference because Dutch people like to talk to other Dutch people.</p>
<p>Alpar: Obviously. Then it does make sense they understand each other well.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Most Americans don&#8217;t understand that, I don’t know where you’re running the podcast but people in Europe like to speak in their own language and that’s a big difference between the way of American people approaching Europe. For instance, I was looking at a travel site and they translated everything to Google translate. It doesn’t work like that over here, I mean we look at it like this is stupid, really this looks stupid, don&#8217;t go there. Just hire a Dutch guy to translate it for you and do it properly because otherwise nobody is going to book you because they don&#8217;t trust you.</p>
<p>Alpar: So obviously. So, how do they, I mean do they startpaginas? Are they so loved by Google.nl that they rank them automatically or then, I mean to me if I look at a startpagina its just one single sub domain with two hundred links or even more or five hundred links and there is like no content on it. You would think it’s not really valuable in, if you look at SEO in other countries.</p>
<p>Huiskes: It gets shared so much over time it has this much of a value from, if you look the key word startpagina it just has that much searches that Google says okay, maybe we don&#8217;t like it, maybe we think it shouldn’t be there on a content level but it is there because people are looking for it, so we have to put it&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: So people are looking for a keyword and startpagina as a combination</p>
<p>Huiskes: Could be, yeah. I haven&#8217;t looked it up, but I kind of imagine that happening, yeah. A lot actually.</p>
<p>Alpar: And then again they build their startpagina. The young and fresh and approaching SEO in the Netherlands, they build their startpagina for the niche they want to be active in and then they start link building for the startpagina?</p>
<p>Huiskes: You have to apply to get access to a startpagina, so you cannot build every startpagina yourself.</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh, really.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah well, you can if you do a niche. For instance if you do some small thing and you, and they think its valuable enough to make a niche from it, you are allowed to. For instance, one of the rules</p>
<p>Alpar: So, what do you have to do, I mean, do you have to send a copy of your passport or do you have to just fill out a form?</p>
<p>Huiskes: No, just have a good story, it’s all money based. You sign a contract, some kind of contract with them.</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh really? Do you have to pay for a startpagina?</p>
<p>Huiskes: No, you don’t have to pay but you are not allowed to put on, I don’t know the guidelines specific for it, but it is something like you can put up ten.</p>
<p>Alpar: You don’t have a startpagina?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I don&#8217;t own any of them at all. In fact I am really happy.</p>
<p>Alpar: Oooh, poor Dutch SEO guy without a single one of those.</p>
<p>Huiskes: No, no, no definitely I have got my reasons for that, because I know people who do</p>
<p>Alpar: Ah I see, I see.</p>
<p>Huiskes: And that’s, I don’t do that much link building, so I don’t need to but what it states that you are obliged to not have more than ten commercial links on a start page.</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh really?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, that’s what you sign up for. Nobody does that, because everybody because everybody put in paid links without using, informing some of them. But the problem is you cannot put in more than ten tracker links from affiliate companies or something like that. So that’s the way of getting out of it.</p>
<p>Alpar: So if I use a URL shortener, I can still do it?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I would just link directly.</p>
<p>Alpar: Then you go and get the affiliate link, the affiliate commission.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Not for the affiliate network.</p>
<p>Alpar: Ah okay.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Which is never the best way to get link use from a page.</p>
<p>Alpar: True true true. Okay. So, and then are there like people who have huge networks of these startpaginas or how &#8230;</p>
<p>Huiskes: There’s a couple of companies who run a couple of start pages.</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh really. Wow so then they are not topically focussed, they are really focussed on, instead of having a blog network they have a start &#8230;</p>
<p>Huiskes: Mostly financial traffic.</p>
<p>Alpar: Hard core money key words instead.</p>
<p>Huiskes: That’s the focus spot.</p>
<p>Alpar: Wow.</p>
<p>Huiskes: But that’s okay.</p>
<p>Alpar: So they, do you think then the startpagina providing companies should charge those? Or do they do this? Wouldn’t it make sense for example let’s say credit would be a highly commercial valuable keyword? Then if I would startpagina dot nl or how the URL is, I could maybe charge my, the startpagina order of credit dot startpagina.nl.</p>
<p>Huiskes: If there&#8217;s not an owner, if there is an owner on it what some of them do is actually, if you are an owner you have it you are allowed to, if they lose it they are going to keep it to themselves, because if it’s not valuable, no nobody is going to get it and then it’s money for the publisher as well. So that’s the trick they do it right on.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, why does it pay off for the startpagina providers?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Oh, it doesn&#8217;t, it started out with not paying off, just creating content for people, helping people around and well if you will have for instance loans at startpagina.nl, that will certainly bring you money, not from an SEO paid link perspective, but as well from an affiliate perspective.</p>
<p>Alpar: Just because people are typing the stuff in?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, actually if you are looking for the homepage starpagina.nl there is five, the top five, the top five best click links, banks or other. That’s the money from startpagina. So they earn money from it and it’s all nofollow on the startpagina I guess. They are working on a nofollow thing, have a look into that as well, they are working on it.</p>
<p>Alpar: Obviously, okay, interesting, interesting. So, it’s really weird because&#8230;.</p>
<p>Huiskes: We don’t have what the German word is for Artikelverzeichnisse.</p>
<p>Alpar: Article directories in German.</p>
<p>Huiskes: We don’t have it at all, it’s not in Holland. We have two that’s crap, it’s really just crap. Nobody uses it. Link building is completely different and you probably know a little bit about it. It’s different from, if you do it only Dutch based, it’s different.</p>
<p>Alpar: Why? Or how? I mean is it only the startpaginas and the article directors, that the main difference? Just this one tool?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I can get ten newspapers in Germany that will place paid links, and you can get as well and everybody can, we can find it. I haven&#8217;t been able so to say, I haven&#8217;t been able to find one in Holland.</p>
<p>Alpar: Maybe you are not nice enough, or you are not asking the right way?</p>
<p>Huiskes: If I am nice enough? I won&#8217;t have to pay, so that’s something different (laughs). If I am nice enough it’s a free link , but if I just go to a sale, sales guy, or know the guy who runs it, there is nobody I know who does that for Dutch newspapers.</p>
<p>Alpar: But do you think that they haven&#8217;t discovered this niche, monetization niche for them or they think it’s immoral or they&#8230;.</p>
<p>Huiskes: It’s unethical, immoral I think and I think that’s first stop and then again they don’t know the value of it. So, they don’t even understand how much. We did a lot of newspapers in my old company and one of them just killed their whole archive. Well that’s from monetization is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes, but then again big old companies, they are not usually the ones to secure about their online activities and how they should work. I know they don’t all have worked out online strategies. So, your podcast is in English or in Dutch?</p>
<p>Huiskes: It’s in English.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, so why in English? I mean you are Dutch based, you’re a Dutch person, and you do SEO in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Huiskes: State of Search blog. We did the SearchCowboys before and that was English, that was one of Bart&#8217;s projects that okay well if we do a podcast, we do a SearchCowboys, it’s going to be in English and it’s more fun. We have a broader audience. We have then good SEOs that really listen to podcasts in Holland, that’s not really an audience, I can call them myself and I&#8217;d like to, it’s no problem. We drink every once in a while that’s fine.</p>
<p>Alpar: Skype conference.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, that’s on a daily base, its fine.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, okay, so how do you perceive from an outside perspective, SEO in Germany?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I like it, it’s fun people, professionally it’s a bit more on the Black Hat side I guess, it’s not Black Hat, but it’s more aggressive getting their good positions and I like that as well. I like the competition in it.</p>
<p>Alpar: I think, if I can add one&#8230;</p>
<p>Huiskes: It’s less whiney.</p>
<p>Alpar: Excuse me.</p>
<p>Huiskes: It’s less whiney I think.</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes it’s true. You know I think aggressive; I wouldn&#8217;t share that opinion, if I can add my perspective to it. I think it’s more like in sports, you we are running as long as it’s the race but after the race we are friends and we go for a beer. It’s like a sporty game, but everybody wants to win.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, I agree, it’s not an aggressive&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Like sports you know, during the race everybody is, you know.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, we can kill each other but afterwards we drink beer.</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes, yes, yes exactly, so it’s friendly, I think.</p>
<p>Huiskes: No, I agree but it’s &#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: You don’t even know.</p>
<p>Huiskes: That’s aggressive for the position not for everything else so I agree on that part, it’s not hatred towards people, especially maybe some Polish &#8230; but that&#8217;s old.</p>
<p>Alpar: Nah, that’s old, that’s old. So, which other countries do you have experience in?</p>
<p>Huiskes: We did a little bit in Spain.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, so how&#8217;s Spain?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Spain was, I haven&#8217;t been in Spain for well one and a half years seriously, so, it was pretty new to us, at least SEO was pretty new over there and it’s a huge amount of traffic over there, so Spain was a good market to start in but that’s what this other companies discovered as well, so everybody went to Spain.</p>
<p>Alpar: Is that with Onetomarket still? Or with the company afterwards?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah with Onetomarket, ja. And Italy that’s one of the companies, it’s a big country especially well for instance fashion is big over there, so you can do it. It is not too big on internet yet, it’s a developing country in community internet, if you look at a Dutch or a German or a Scandinavian perspective.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s true. But if you look at the fashion traffic, you mentioned fashion traffic in Italy, right? If I think about, let’s say I would have some insights in some fashion topics in Germany and if I look at that traffic, a high portion of that traffic is very very relevant regarding transactions, so, if I divide traffic, you know some is maybe more informational, some is more transactional, how would you think is the Italian traffic? Do you think it is as &#8230; ??</p>
<p>Huiskes: It is not transactional yet, but if you are there right now, you’re going to be ahead of everything else so I think it is a good idea to start out, if you do anything, Italy is I think one of the developing countries in that. Especially when everything is growing over there. It’s improving, it’s getting better. It’s not as professional as you see over here, and in general if I look at German, UK, Dutch companies there are more advanced at measuring everything. I mean the analytics are better than what I see from most companies in the US. I have to say. And I am also quite&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alpar: You have been inside the US; I mean have you been there, have you worked there?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I saw stuff in there. Carb, people I work for in the US, it’s also smart guys on a marketing level but they don&#8217;t care about, measuring is not that important for us, and I think&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you know like the details so much?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Maybe, I don&#8217;t know?</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you think that’s what the Germans especially like about SEO?</p>
<p>Huiskes: The Gründlichkeit. (laughs) Could be, could be. No, but I do think it a little bit in the, it’s not, they don&#8217;t care as much. They care about the product instead of the money wise side. I think the UK and the Netherlands, because maybe our overall heritage or maybe it’s a culture kind of thing. We are more spot on and we, our why is really important for a lot of people. We link based deals from two fifty a link. Yeah, whatever. It doesn’t work for me like that. Could be working for somebody, but I don’t work like that. I cannot guarantee because I cannot guarantee and if I can, I would do it but it doesn’t&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: You sound professional.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Nobody can guarantee, so that’s fine with me. You can buy, if you have your own network you can guarantee, that’s the risk you take for buying into a network, so I agree with that part, I can give you insights into how I am and how I work and that’s fine with me and that works, and I can show you cases that worked so, I can do a lot of stuff but I&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s a lot about trust, right?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I think SEO is about trust. I mean you are so tied to the core of everybody&#8217;s business. I always draw this map when I talk to customers and searches, a lot of people, you have verticals like bannering like own advertising like affiliate marketing and email marketing. They put it at verticals besides each other and search is actually underneath all of those, because if you do good affiliate marketing it will affect your search. If you do good TCF data it will affect your search. So, a search&#8217;s ambient findability is what the nice word is. Yes!</p>
<p>Alpar: Buzzword Bingo.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yes! Bullseye for that. I mean it works like that. If you&#8217;re, you need to be final, you need to be found. That’s what you want and it can be on so many levels that you can be found so it’s okay to integrate that in your whole marketing but it’s okay, it’s realise that it’s in your core, same what you talked about. Transactional informational, what kind of content are you producing is your website actually transactional or is it just putting out lots of content for other purposes. It’s okay with that. You have to figure out and think about that.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you have listened to some of the presentations that have been here during the day, did you hear one thing that you probably, you know, people seem to be thinking about here a lot and they don’t think about so much in the Netherlands besides the aggressiveness? Other topics that we seem to care about and you guys&#8230;.</p>
<p>Huiskes: I mean link building is always a hot topic in Holland, but it’s, there&#8217;s more to be said about links over here than there is in Holland.</p>
<p>Alpar: How come?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Don’t have a right answer for that. I am not sure what to think of it. For instance, we don’t have link networks. Not big link networks like the ones you have in Germany.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, how big, what kind of a link network would you consider big?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I cannot order links for a thousand Euros, somewhere. I have to go to a specific company which I know does that for me, but there is no network that says okay TLA like networks.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, but there&#8217;s few of those in Germany, there&#8217;s probably two, so it’s not like there&#8217;s many</p>
<p>Huiskes: No, but it’s more, so and if it’s two there is spin off, if there is spin off there is something to be talking about, you can talk about, so I think in general there is a bit of a stretch over there at that part.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, what do you think, do you think because the Dutch and UK and German market, they are developed more so they are kind of</p>
<p>Huiskes: Measuring, measuring market.</p>
<p>Alpar: They are measuring more? do you have a feeling that still those are kind of conquering into other markets who are less developed because they think it more of an opportunity rather than to be like in a very sporty environment as in Germany?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I think.<br />
Alpar: Do you see that happening or do you think that the language gap is just too big?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I think the language is definitely a setback for a lot of people because people think to, it’s not a language it’s a culture thing and I think there is a difference between, you can translate a thing, but its, you don&#8217;t get the culture then. The culture is important as well for getting the right E commerce numbers out of it. I mean it is nice to rank number one, but if you sell shit, then the number one position doesn’t help you that much. It does drive you traffic and it will cost you eventually money without getting anything. So, you need to understand the culture of the country that you are in. Especially when going to for instance Saudi Arabia, it’s different. It’s harder to sell, well&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alpar: Underwear?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah for instance (laughs). That’s one of the things.</p>
<p>Alpar: Just as an example I could think of.</p>
<p>Huiskes: It’s harder to do that, you cannot advertise that at once. Casual gaming. Kissing games is pretty big.</p>
<p>Alpar: In, big as in they like? And look for it?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Casual gaming is a, kissing games is pretty big if you look at girl games. Girl games are a pretty big niche in casual gaming.</p>
<p>Alpar: Girls for girls as in kids? Or girls as in women?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Girls as in Kids, not the women. Boys is pretty big as well but&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Why is it a niche?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I don’t know, it’s just there. They like, girls like to play this dress up games and there is this niche in there that’s called kissing games and you need to kiss and somebody is going to watch and not stop kissing. If you do that in Saudi Arabia, it’s not going to go down well for your site. I can tell. Well it will get links though but in general it is not a good idea to do that.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, what, they cannot kick your site out of Google?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Not out of Google but they can just ban it from a proxy of the country, so, it doesn’t work like that. So that’s not the smartest way to go in that case (laughing) and then all the press and the legal stuff you get into, it’s no fun. Nobody wants their hand chopped off.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, what are you doing these days?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I am actually a consultant. A lot of consultants&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: As anyone is who has read a SEO blog once or twice.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Don&#8217;t call me a social media guru now. (Laughs)</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes, yes yes, it was so close, I was, I thought you were going to say that.</p>
<p>Huiskes: No, fuck that, no truly, I</p>
<p>Alpar: So, you are an SEO guru.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, I do SEO stuff, I consult companies with SEO, I build a little bit as well, I develop on websites. Because I want to do the full, I don’t want to work for</p>
<p>Alpar: Are you like the classical one-man army as they would say?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah I do, I partner up with friends, like …, friends from all of one&#8217;s market or just from the Netherlands or whatever country they are based upon, because I think you need a specialist for the right tool for the right job. So I, it’s still a one-man shop, but I do grab my network when I need it and what I like do do is, and it’s harder to get there because I have a bit of a name in Netherlands for doing consultancy so I get consultancy for the bigger companies and for smaller ones, I do the full Monty. I go just all out and I say okay, this is your site and no, I am not going to write a report for you because a report is going to cost me sixteen hours to write it or whatever it just figure out all&#8230;..</p>
<p>Alpar: You build it from scratch instead?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I am going to rebuild it for you in twenty four, it’s going to be a bit more hours, but you are done afterwards. Don’t crap about reading stuff; I am going to do it for you. And then</p>
<p>Alpar: It does make sense a lot.</p>
<p>Huiskes: And I am going to do on a retainer for Ad or whatever and I am start building up&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Especially for small and medium size enterprise, it does make lots of sense.</p>
<p>Huiskes: And there is money to be made on the small business side. I mean everybody is changing&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: There is a lot of missed opportunities, I think, because it is hard to do for the, it’s hard to do to buy into a SEO, because SEO companies like larger SEO agencies, it seems to target only the big really well paying companies but I think any small and medium sized company, I think there is still even in Germany there’s a gap, what is the right thing for them to do if they can spend a thousand Euros a month. What’s the right thing? It’s real hard to answer that.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yeah, but local search works pretty good.</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Product search, it’s amazing, I mean, its twenty percent of your traffic easy and it’s selling traffic, I mean it’s transactional so, it’s okay. You can start, Adwords is okay as long as you have the knowledge of what you are doing at once, and have the insight that it still keep, whatever you do it’s a monthly base, so it is never going to be cheaper than it is. It is always going to be at the end. You are going to pay as much as everybody can afford to especially in a competitive market, so I think Adwords is a great way to start but you have to build it up and try to get better with organic.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, as a one-man army, how many clients can you deal and satisfy?</p>
<p>Huiskes: It depends on the kinds of things I am doing.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s like five, fifteen or&#8230;</p>
<p>Huiskes: If I do consultancy it can be lot because, well I can answer a phone every day, that’s not too hard to do but if it is building websites and maintaining, it is not too much, three, five, somewhere there.</p>
<p>Alpar: All the time? Oh that’s not too much.</p>
<p>Huiskes: No, its fine.</p>
<p>Alpar: It could have been fifty, you know, how would you know?</p>
<p>Huiskes: Ah, could be, depends on the project. Some projects are easy to manage, bit more, other projects it’s undoable.</p>
<p>Alpar: Are you focussed on certain topical areas? Or are you broad let’s say?</p>
<p>Huiskes: I have a lot of experience in travel, and that comes back again and again and again.</p>
<p>Alpar: Yeah sure, it has always been one of the big topics on the web rate.</p>
<p>Huiskes: It’s a big one and I know how it works. I have been doing a lot of stuff in that area as well. I am not too fond of it anymore, I’d say. Got a little bit bored by it. They always have the same issues, that’s the problem and it’s never going to change because they don’t want to change.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s a very long tale.</p>
<p>Huiskes: That’s the problem, they keep all of their own business and ah well, and it works for them and it fine. It pays the bills.</p>
<p>Alpar: Well, thanks a lot for your time. You have been a great partner to talk to.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Cool, its fine.</p>
<p>Alpar: Yeah, Let’s go have a beer.</p>
<p>Huiskes: Yes.</p></blockquote>

Transcription:
Alpar: So, hello, we are here at the Campixx and I found somebody who does not, who is not a native German. Roy, tell us about yourself.
Huiskes: Hey I am Roy, I used to work at a company called Onetomarket and I am doing the podcast State of Search with Bas van den Beld. Probably familiar with a lot of people, especially with podcast listener check it out. And I was for Onetomarket based, we did a lot of stuff in Germany so I went to German conferences and a lot of friends of mine are still here and I heard good stories about Marko’s thing and this is the reason why I ended up over here, drinking beer. And doing the podcast and having fun.
Alpar: No, I think it is a really great thing that you bring some international colour into a seemingly local conference.
Huiskes: Definitely.
Alpar: So, tell us about yourself, what, I think podcasts are not really the best way to earn money, so I assume you are doing something else besides that?
Huiskes: Yeah definitely, I am an SEO.
Alpar: Oooh!
Huiskes: For instance, gee wonder why? I started to do SEO for Onetomarket, five six years ago. No, I started at Onetomarket five years ago, six years ago, whatever, before that I did SEO at a local shop but that wasn&#8217;t that big.
Alpar: So what did you do even before, did you study? Did you, you know, programme? What did you do?
Huiskes: I actually did&#8230;
Alpar: Drop out of school?
Huiskes: Definitely dropped out of school, tried to, ten years tried to get a diploma, nah, never worked out. Started, well was smarter than my teachers actually, so that didn&#8217;t work out that well. They were talking about &#8216;yeah you should be graphical, make art of websites’. Screw that, I want to make money from it, and everybody else should as well. So that’s why I dropped off and I started to do research marketing because I needed traffic on my site. I could create the best beautiful things and if nobody saw it, it’s still shit. So I wanted people to see my stuff. That is why I went into SEO.
Alpar: So how does the SEO scene, you’re from the Netherlands, if somebody doesn’t know, and how does the SEO scene in the Netherlands look like? I mean you know, is it&#8230;?
Huiskes: It’s nice compared to the German one, I think.
Alpar: What do you mean? What German, what is the nice thing about it?
Huiskes: The way people interact with each other. The German ones are more aggressive towards each other.
Alpar: You think?
Huiskes: I think it is more aggressive on a competitive level, not aggressive towards the persons, but more aggressive in getting on the number one position. And all of them were pretty straight against each other. We have still this thing called stop bugging us.
Alpar: So do you share the number one position?
Huiskes: Yeah definitely. Nah, we are switching, we are switching sides again, but I mean we are looking at start pages, start pages aren’t in Germany. But the start pages do work. It’s a lot of clones from that as well.
Alpar: Can you probably explain for people who do not know what start pages are. They are called Startpaginas, correct?
Huiskes: Yeah. Yeah, definitely, yeah. GoedBegin.com, it’s one of our crap sites
Alpar: What’s it called?
Huiskes: GoedBegin.com. It’s a crap site, don’t go there. Seriously, don’t go there. There is no
Alpar: I have to go train. GoedBegin?
Huiskes: Yeah, GoedBegin.com. Don’t go there, seriously. No, seriously that’s a bad sign for you. That’s the one that got banned. So, don&#8217;t go that way. But stuff like that, its clones, Startkabel, it is all pages with just links on it for if you’re elderly and you don’t know what to start with, this is the point where you start and you got links to everywhere. So there is lots of funny links on there and lots of bought links and trade links[...]</itunes:summary>

<p><span id="more-68"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Alpar: Okay, so we are here with Dixon Jones. Dixon, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Jones: Hi I am the marketing director of Majestic SEO, which is a large link database. So we have about two point, three point two trillion links at the moment. We crawl the internet, about half a billion links every single day and we track the link information, the back link information into people&#8217;s websites.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, why would people need a paid tool if they have Yahoo?</p>
<p>Jones: Well, Yahoo own, well apart from the fact that Yahoo maybe on its way out, what with the Microsoft deal, they also only give you a thousand back links in their data set, maximum, even if they have more, but they don’t have very many actual links anyway. Majestic&#8230;..</p>
<p>Alpar: How will you know, I mean you didn&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: Well, you can compare, if you compare back links for sites that have less than a thousand links for example, Then we would generally pick up four or five times as many links as Yahoo, and of course, we don&#8217;t make the decision for you as to which links are good and which ones are bad but we provide all the information.</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you think Yahoo does that?</p>
<p>Jones: Well, I think Yahoo, I don’t know what Yahoo is doing now, I can&#8217;t speak for Yahoo, but I do know that Yahoo’s site explorer is not the tool it used to be and so now you really, you really should be looking at using our tool or linkscape&#8217;s tool and on both counts, you know, we have a much larger data base than anybody else.</p>
<p>Alpar: Linkscape and the SEOMoz stuff.</p>
<p>Jones: SEOMoz yeah, they have some cool tools too.</p>
<p>Alpar: And do you know how big their data base is compared to yours?</p>
<p>Jones: Yes. Its, they kind of use slightly different measurements, but they have, we think, a two hundred billion URLs or something like that to our three trillion links to our three trillion links, so I mean there is a big difference. We think there is a big difference, yeah, where we are similar&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: They also seem to have quite&#8230;. Their database … but it is obviously not open, right?</p>
<p>Jones: It is still small in comparison so, size is one thing and freshness is the second thing, so we have a smaller data base, round about the same sort of size as Linkscape&#8217;s and Linkscape&#8217;s is quite a lot bigger than Blackhole&#8217;s from what we can establish. We think that Linkscape has much more than Blackhole. We have one now that is a similar sort of size to Linkscape which we call our Fresh Index, and we update that information every day, which is kind of cool for people that are really sort of wanting to find the new links to a competitor&#8217;s website or even to their own site, but also it could be used for media mentions and that sort of thing. If somebody suddenly talks about your website in the back end of Uganda or somewhere like that, because you have had a power plant failure or something there and then you could use it for that sort of information.</p>
<p>Alpar: But your tool is really focused on the Backlinks, right? I mean it&#8217;s not like you could do anything with the tools, they kind of, you said you made a decision and focused it on this area?</p>
<p>Jones: Oh yeah, absolutely, we are not trying to be everything to all people. We really have an industrial crawl and a really really high level crawl and we just look at the back link data this time. Not just Backlink data, also we do pick up the titles of those pages and also the anchor tags which is all part of the link anyway. What we don’t do is any kind of rankings checking or decision-making as to where you should get your next link from.</p>
<p>Alpar: This will always mean that people need something additional to your tool?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah</p>
<p>Alpar: So, what do they mostly use? Do you have an insight …</p>
<p>Jones: We have, absolutely, so we would then, we have an industrial strength API which then goes into those SEO suites. So, for example, Raven tools or Wordtracker or Analytics SEO.com, all of those have access to our data on an industrial level, so that they can then take the information and augment it with other bits of information. So they will have &#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: So you kind of focus on a niche and then others incorporate with generated &#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: Because It would be madness for all those companies to all try and collect the same amount of data That we are collecting.</p>
<p>Alpar: I assume that this is because you crawl and you don&#8217;t crawl Google, but you crawl the websites themselves, you don’t have the problems that probably people who monitor a lot have then because &#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: it’s a huge number of people, yeah, if you are making like a fifty dollar</p>
<p>Alpar: You need a lot of IPs and so on</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah, if you are making a little bit of software that is trying to sort of rip it off of Yahoo itself or ripping out of Google or some other search engine somewhere. You are trying to take short cuts. We are really crawling every single web page on the internet. Well not every single one but you know the vast majority.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, how did you become that SEO niche tool builder?</p>
<p>Jones: Well, we started out by looking at being a distributing crawler, which is, so what we did was we found hundreds of people round the world that were interested&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, were you scraping websites and creating like a spammy content?</p>
<p>Jones: No, no no no.</p>
<p>Alpar: or why were you crawling in the web?</p>
<p>Jones: No, no no. So, we were trying to create a search engine without building all the infrastructure that is needed for a search engine. So what we got was hundreds of people around the world who were doing the crawling on their computers, and on their small ISPs and that sort of stuff. So they were using the spare bandwidth and that still happens to this day although we now have our own crawlers.</p>
<p>Alpar: Why would they let you crawl from there?</p>
<p>Jones: so they would crawl from there because they have an incentive. They have a whole game going on, who can crawl the most pages out of their team mates. That’s a different side of the equation.</p>
<p>Alpar: It looks like a historic thing.</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah, so, but it meant that we were getting so much data we found that we couldn’t store it all, so we couldn&#8217;t make a search engine out of Alex&#8217;s front room when it started, you know (laughs) But we had created the crawl so now we can crawl as aggressively as Google and if that was a paying point we could do more so we decided to take what we thought was the most valuable part, which was the link information because that’s so big, you just can&#8217;t find endings, all your links into a website unless you crawl the whole of the internet to find those links. So it&#8217;s the hardest piece for anybody to build.</p>
<p>Alpar: Can you discriminate between, I mean sometimes there is like some scrapers sites that take bits of your content and put a link and there is like millions of those?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: Can you separate those, like algorithmically from the rest that has like a little bit more legitimate content, a little bit more legitimate links, is it (really?) hard to do?</p>
<p>Jones: At this particular moment we use a metric called AC rank which is a very poor man&#8217;s page rank. All it is&#8230;..</p>
<p>Alpar: Developed by yourself?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah. We call it a citation rank and it is just a representation of how many web pages link into the page that links, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Like the raw number of links, not something like domain &#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: It’s not, it’s not, yeah, sorry, its number of referring domains that link into a page.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, so its domain popularity?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah, domain popularity and it’s an algorithm.</p>
<p>Alpar: Is it like linear or like algo &#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: It’s a log scale, so its log scales going for no apparent reason going from nought to fifteen. I don’t know why from nought to fifteen.</p>
<p>Alpar: But you set it up so you must know?</p>
<p>Jones: hey, I didn’t set it up, Alex set it up, and I don’t think it was his basically (laughs) He didn&#8217;t want to make it, he didn’t want people to get confused with page rank, so it’s not the same measurement. But we should have done a percentage or something like that. Anyway, we have now this, this&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alpar: Don&#8217;t worry, its historic, you just invent the next&#8230;.</p>
<p>Jones: Sure!</p>
<p>Alpar: The next Dixon rank or something then&#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah we just have a little&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: it will go from zero to ten.</p>
<p>Jones: Absolutely, yeah, but it doesn’t give a good representation of spam on a page, it just measures domain links so it can be manipulated and you can find things that are poor, but less so in the fresh index, because all of those kind of tactics were set up years ago, and now our crawl is much more intelligent. We used to crawl just every single page and now every day we crawl the important pages and so the BBC are not going to link to a spammy site.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you decided more on a trust-rank, like from a root source where you will crawl with priority or do you indeed try to find like the … where it starts and ends and then stop there.</p>
<p>Jones: We do crawl pretty deep but now we are more intelligent. So what we will do is, we will go back to the important pages every hour and start again. Because those pages are continually generating content and then less important pages every three hours and then every day, every week and every month, whatever. So, it just means that we have got some logic in there of which sites we think are going to be more important. And what we have done then is, we are actually crawling slightly less pages, but we are finding more links as a result, and better links, so better quality.</p>
<p>Alpar: And who are mostly your clients? Are they in the US? Are they in the UK or are they in continental Europe?</p>
<p>Jones: Ah, very world-wide. The UK, we are a UK-based company so we have a large UK following, which is great. Obviously here in the US we are getting a bit of a name for ourselves but we are picking up clients&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s a first time for you in the conference so &#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: no no, I have talked&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alpar: with a booth.</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah with a booth, I have talked in the conference way before&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: So, how is the experience having a booth in the conference?</p>
<p>Jones: Its hard work. I thought having the booth was the easy way to do it now&#8230;.</p>
<p>Alpar: Is it more people approaching, are they asking more?</p>
<p>Jones: No, it’s more that you just have to stand up all day (laughs)</p>
<p>Alpar: So you never had a booth at all before?</p>
<p>Jones: No, no no no.</p>
<p>Alpar: Oh, okay, so it the first time with a booth and then there is the SES in New York?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah I mean it’s not quite true, we took a, had a booth earlier on this year in Israel and also at Think Visibility in London so we got a couple of little practise ones there before having the major one here. But, I mean it definitely works you have got to be in the right audience, but talking for me has been a very very powerful way of getting out to the market, and speaking at events, that was way before Majestic came along, so, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, how do you think that your tool is mostly used, I mean, do people really use it as an end user, like as an SEO or are they mostly aggregating data into different tools or are they mostly agencies that they have their own tools? Do you have insight into that?</p>
<p>Jones: We have got three or four different types of people and what we haven&#8217;t got really is the Mom and Pop business that has a restaurant and they need to get links and stuff. They would be either pretty dedicated or pretty mad to use our tools. They would go to one of our data suppliers or one of our reseller suppliers, so like Raven Tools or Linkdex, or one of those kind of people, and that would be a better fit for them because it …</p>
<p>Alpar: Linkdex is what?</p>
<p>Jones: Linkdex is a UK company that also&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Also DIYSEO I guess.</p>
<p>Jones: Like that, like that sort of thing, yeah, and so our, we have the reseller API people that are building tools, we then have, I&#8217;d say the next big thing is hard core SEOs. The kind of people who have conference pass ticket, you know and that whether they are in-house or whether they are agency, they would use our data, and you know, more and more we are just trying to convince them that we are the best data set. We know we are, we just got to just let everybody else know that (laughs) it’s my marketing that is coming out.</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you think there are probably other big datasets that you are not aware of?</p>
<p>Jones: Well there is, I mean there is, there is Sistrix, there&#8217;s Linkscape; there is also Eric Ward who is doing some stuff. I am not quite sure what he is doing though, but he hasn&#8217;t got very large&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: You probably you know if somebody pops up, I&#8217;d say, Ahhh, they have got a trillion back links too, out of nothing.</p>
<p>Jones: Out of the blue, I’d be highly suspicious, I would be highly suspicious. Because they would have, because they would have, in order to get that without us noticing, without the world noticing, they would have had to have done it without revealing their crawler agent.</p>
<p>Alpar: Can you crawl and be blocked?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah, absolutely, we obey rules so, absolutely yes.</p>
<p>Alpar: You do?</p>
<p>Jones: So absolutely yes, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: do you think that is an advantage if you are a link database?</p>
<p>Jones: I think, I think …</p>
<p>Alpar: Or is it just out of moral reasons &#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: I think it is a moral reason, you want to obey … We want to do this job properly, we don’t want anybody to have arguments, in fact we have the best identification of crawler of any of the crawlers out there. Because we use distributed crawlers people can come to our site, well our boss can come from any IP number, we don&#8217;t know what IP number they are coming from, so in order to&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: (So they&#8217;re) from a cloud or something?</p>
<p>Jones: Which means that people can fake our bot and they can come from an IP and pretend to be our bot, so what we have is, if you go onto the majestic site and get the free account and use the API key we can give you a handshake basically to prove whether or not it’s the right bot&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: But then again, Just as a play of thoughts I would never of course do such things but imagine I was somebody, you know earning out of getting people links, then I can hide away all my sites, and then I am not endangered by competitors of my clients, of them finding my links, is that correct?</p>
<p>Jones: Kind of but of course just because you have blocked all your sites, doesn’t mean to say we don’t know all the links into your sites. We can see every single link into your websites, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: But if I blocked, let’s say site A is getting the links, and site A&#8217;s competitor wants to analyze site A&#8217;s links, I am site B and I have blocked your bot via robot, you cannot see the links from site B to site A, right? So a part of the competitor links that are blocked by robots, those cannot be analyzed.</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah, that&#8217;s true</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you know how many people block you; do you have some kind of experience? Does anybody care at all? Is it just theoretical?</p>
<p>Jones: We do obviously make a note of the robots. There are a number of people using robots.txt for …but the people stopping us is very small at the moment.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So, did you try to analyse those cases, that you know, why do they hate me, why do they block Majestic SEO, what have I done to them?</p>
<p>Jones: It’s usually a lone person out there that’s selling links and stuff? so there&#8217;s not many people out there that would object to the bot coming in. If it became an industrial problem then we would have to look at it, but &#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: And if you think, because if the value of the bot is diminished because everybody blocks Majestic, or is it a chain of thoughts which we should not continue right now? (Laughs) Sorry.</p>
<p>Jones: Thanks. (Laughs)</p>
<p>Alpar: Forget about it. So, do you do anything else besides Majestic and hanging around conferences?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah, no I do.</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you have a life?</p>
<p>Jones: (laughs) yeah I have a life. I have a wife and kids, yeah, absolutely</p>
<p>Alpar: Do you have business? Business besides Majestic?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah I have got a consultancy in the UK which I don’t get as involved in as I used to, but we have &#8230;  Yeah, we have got fifteen or twenty employees Receptional which is a consultancy in the UK. It’s been there for ten years</p>
<p>Alpar: What’s it called again, I am sorry?</p>
<p>Jones: Receptional, which has been going for ten eleven years now, so that’s pretty active.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you jump between Majestic and Receptional all the time?</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: or do they work in the same area?</p>
<p>Jones: No I work mostly from my office in Receptional but three, say I&#8217;d say sixty seventy percent of my time is spent doing Majestic these days, so the vast majority of my time, and then probably one of the other days is just doing administration for Majestic.</p>
<p>Alpar: So what’s a good thing about the agency, and what’s a good thing about the tools which you, why do you prefer which, I mean what’s, let’s focus on the good aspects</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah, of Majestic?</p>
<p>Alpar: Yes.</p>
<p>Jones: Yeah well, I think&#8230;</p>
<p>Alpar: Compared to the work today</p>
<p>Jones: the amount of crawl data that we have managed to do is just technologically an incredible feat.</p>
<p>Alpar: So who was the brains behind the technology</p>
<p>Jones: A guy called Alex Chudnovsky and he is a bright guy, I have to say, he is really really clever. Pain in the neck sometimes, geniuses always are, but he&#8217;s done a really really good job with the technology and what we have done is manage to create scale that is really hard to copy. It’s funny, you know, you think you start with a big database system, but as soon as you get to (two/?) three hundred billion records, all of a sudden it becomes very difficult to maintain and manage on industrial systems, so we had to build all the database structures from scratch so we could scale.</p>
<p>Alpar: Let’s just finish off with one last question because I know you have to rush off to your next appointment. What do you think of SEOs in Germany? Or do you&#8230;</p>
<p>Jones: I think they are quite clever. (laughs) Yeah, they are far too clever. And I think Sistrix is a great tool as well, so I think that’s good. I know that they are going international but I think they should just stick to the German market (laughs)</p>
<p>Alpar: Great. Thanks a lot for the interview</p>
<p>Jones: Thanks so much for your time.</p></blockquote>

&#160;

This Podcast is also available on iTunes and on Youtube. You can find the transcription in the post details.

Alpar: Okay, so we are here with Dixon Jones. Dixon, what are you doing?
Jones: Hi I am the marketing director of Majestic SEO, which is a large link database. So we have about two point, three point two trillion links at the moment. We crawl the internet, about half a billion links every single day and we track the link information, the back link information into people&#8217;s websites.
Alpar: Okay, why would people need a paid tool if they have Yahoo?
Jones: Well, Yahoo own, well apart from the fact that Yahoo maybe on its way out, what with the Microsoft deal, they also only give you a thousand back links in their data set, maximum, even if they have more, but they don’t have very many actual links anyway. Majestic&#8230;..
Alpar: How will you know, I mean you didn&#8217;t&#8230;
Jones: Well, you can compare, if you compare back links for sites that have less than a thousand links for example, Then we would generally pick up four or five times as many links as Yahoo, and of course, we don&#8217;t make the decision for you as to which links are good and which ones are bad but we provide all the information.
Alpar: Do you think Yahoo does that?
Jones: Well, I think Yahoo, I don’t know what Yahoo is doing now, I can&#8217;t speak for Yahoo, but I do know that Yahoo’s site explorer is not the tool it used to be and so now you really, you really should be looking at using our tool or linkscape&#8217;s tool and on both counts, you know, we have a much larger data base than anybody else.
Alpar: Linkscape and the SEOMoz stuff.
Jones: SEOMoz yeah, they have some cool tools too.
Alpar: And do you know how big their data base is compared to yours?
Jones: Yes. Its, they kind of use slightly different measurements, but they have, we think, a two hundred billion URLs or something like that to our three trillion links to our three trillion links, so I mean there is a big difference. We think there is a big difference, yeah, where we are similar&#8230;
Alpar: They also seem to have quite&#8230;. Their database … but it is obviously not open, right?
Jones: It is still small in comparison so, size is one thing and freshness is the second thing, so we have a smaller data base, round about the same sort of size as Linkscape&#8217;s and Linkscape&#8217;s is quite a lot bigger than Blackhole&#8217;s from what we can establish. We think that Linkscape has much more than Blackhole. We have one now that is a similar sort of size to Linkscape which we call our Fresh Index, and we update that information every day, which is kind of cool for people that are really sort of wanting to find the new links to a competitor&#8217;s website or even to their own site, but also it could be used for media mentions and that sort of thing. If somebody suddenly talks about your website in the back end of Uganda or somewhere like that, because you have had a power plant failure or something there and then you could use it for that sort of information.
Alpar: But your tool is really focused on the Backlinks, right? I mean it&#8217;s not like you could do anything with the tools, they kind of, you said you made a decision and focused it on this area?
Jones: Oh yeah, absolutely, we are not trying to be everything to all people. We really have an industrial crawl and a really really high level crawl and we just look at the back link data this time. Not just Backlink data, also we do pick up the titles of those pages and also the anchor tags which is all part of the link anyway. What we don’t do is any kind of rankings checking or decision-making as to where you should get your next link from.
Alpar: This will always mean that people need something additional to your tool?
Jones: Yeah
Alpar: So, what do they mostly use? Do you have an i[...]</itunes:summary>

<p><span id="more-34"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Alpar: So, we are here to do a special interview. Can you introduce yourself please and what your role is?<br />
Forrester: Yeah, my name is Duane Forrester, I am a Senior Product Manager with Bing, the search engine and my actual day job is running the webmaster program for Bing; so the forums, the community, the blog and the tools themselves.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, so how come you are hosting an SEO clinic at the SES? It’s confusing.</p>
<p>Forrester: (Laugh) Because for the past ten years, I have been an in-house SEO. I started with a small company in Eastern Canada and then moved on to run SEO for MSN in US America’s. So I understand small scale and large scale SEO, I have been doing it for a decade. So when we sit down, we want to do a bit of a review, it’s a great opportunity for me to help people understand what really makes a difference and to shed a little bit of light from the search engine’s perspective on what we are really looking for.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, but do you really have, I mean, if you were an in-house SEO, you were kind of reengineering to feel how, how the algorithm works, did you get insight into that once you have, you know, entered the, the other side?</p>
<p>Forrester: I, I have a very different point of view today, yes. (Laughs)</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, okay.</p>
<p>Forrester: Nothing I can talk about obviously, but, but yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: No, no, no, don’t worry about it, okay, okay. So, I mean, how did you, I mean that’s quite a, quite a, quite a game changer I mean, I mean, both steps to me sound like quite a game changer, even if, there is a lot of, I am aware of quite a few SEOs that are really successful like on the small or mid-size projects, but if you give them a long tail website with a couple of million sub-pages, they are lost. And they also then find out, they don’t even have the capacity to do it. So how, did you know that you could do even MSN?</p>
<p>Forrester: Well, it was a scenario where I kind of, like most people, started with my own website and just kind of played around, you know, even in the days before Google, when you just add more keywords and you don’t rank the competitor and then you’d come back the next day and update that and, and then that grew. And I got to a point where, I have a background in marketing from Caesars Palace, I used to work with casinos in Canada that were run by them; so that background in marketing combined with my own experience online led me to get into online marketing. And when I started with the company, it was relatively small; we had on the order of tens of thousands of pages and I think I was employee 11 or 13, or something; when I left they had two hundred employees, hundreds of thousands of pages. So we kind of grew over time. And while you’re doing that, you encounter scale because it’s easy to go in and optimize a webpage for the name of a pitcher, it was a sport website; but then, when you have to do this for every team, across all of the leagues, you know, that’s quite a bit of a work. Then when it comes to, to, to statistical data pages, that stuff’s constantly changing and then we added the extra layer of comparing stats between teams, so we were competing, or taking these very dynamic pages that could just be built on the fly. So you start really figuring out ways to do things at scale, right? Like you realize you can’t handwrite every title tag. What you have to do is work with the editors and educate them to understand that when they write something, it needs to target the right keywords. So when they produce the product, you have a good product on the other end. You have to work on what is the best way to automate a meta description tag, what’s the best piece of content on the page to take and put in that location, and so on.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you mostly talk to yourself or did you have like a mentor that guided you through, through the dark days?</p>
<p>Forrester: Well, actually, it’s interesting to say that; no, it’s funny because as I look back, I realize that, you know, ten, twelve years ago, when all this was just starting, I was at the beginning of it, I didn’t realize that then, I just, I naturally thought I was like to the party. So I started in the forums, asking questions, then answering questions, I was brought on as a moderator in one forum; I actually met a gentleman there who ended up being essentially a mentor to me and we bounced ideas off each other and tried new things; and, and it worked that great. And then, he was actually the guy who told me I should write my first book (Laughs). And so I brought that and …</p>
<p>Alpar: And that brought you to MSN?</p>
<p>Forrester: Well, that was posted on my blog, they found me through that effort and asked me to come on in for an interview and, and my life just totally changed after that. (Laughs)</p>
<p>Alpar: So how, how many employees does Microsoft have?</p>
<p>Forrester: Globally, globally it’s more than one thousand.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay.</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: So how was, how was it like everyday, everyday business life, definitely you know, is there, I mean even with two hundred employees you can probably still know everyone, you know from seeing, but Microsoft for me is like a huge company …</p>
<p>Forrester: It is. But you have to remember that within the organization, there’s different groups in there, alright?</p>
<p>Alpar: Alright.</p>
<p>Forrester: So where I worked at MSN, and even where I work now at Bing, I am, it’s very straightforward, alright? They’re small teams, they do very specific things. So if you need to do something, you could still go down and talk to someone. The difference is scale. When you do something at MSN and you say ‘okay, we need to change a title tag, we’re seeing the logo of the, of the brand is at the beginning, we want it at the end.’ When you make that change at MSN that happens on the order of tens of millions, not on hundreds or even thousands of pages, so …</p>
<p>Alpar: So are you then, you know, are you, are you more cautious because the effect just multiply by bigger numbers of pages?</p>
<p>Forrester: Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Alpar: So would you run tests like with the sort of like ten thousands sub-pages and then deploy it to all millions, or …</p>
<p>Forrester: No, typically not, because what, what we have to focus more on is…</p>
<p>Alpar: So your guts feeling is good (Laughs)</p>
<p>Forrester: Well, it’s, that’s part of it, right; part of it is that you work within a team of experts. So, you know, MSN actually has a global team of experts SEOs …</p>
<p>Alpar: How many of them?</p>
<p>Forrester: I think when I was there we had seven at one point.</p>
<p>Alpar: And they were all like one level or was there like one ahead?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, we were all same level; well, we had one, we had one lead for a group.</p>
<p>Alpar: More equal … more equal than others.</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly, he was the cat herder.</p>
<p>Alpar: And that was you or not?</p>
<p>Forrester: No, that was, it was actually my German friend, Frank Gosch, so great guy, based in London, and I kind of miss him, he’s a great fellow. But, but what we would do is, we would be very careful around, when we wanted to go do work, we would actually be not thinking of it in terms of, here’s the SEO; then we want; we would also be thinking in terms of ‘okay, we’re going to ask a developer to do this work, so we need time invested in a project and that has a cost to our company. And it’s not just that the right cost to our project but what other projects may be in need to be worked on.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you have to decide what’s more important.</p>
<p>Forrester: Absolutely. So before even getting to this stage of executing, you know, you’re very involved with all kinds of planning and /</p>
<p>Alpar: I guess you have to justify, you know, if, if it’s worth it or if it’s just those SEO guys doing some stuff they think is important.</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. And I mean, you know, don’t get me wrong; we are a bunch of SEO guys doing what we think is important (Laughs). Although we don’t have our fingers on the trigger; we are not pushing the buttons or pulling the leverage.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you have to decide, I mean you have to, you know, make sure that it’s really worth the effort, and not do it for the sake of it.</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. That’s probably the biggest change because when you’re working in a small organization, you know everyone and you, you’re seen as the expert on the top; it’s easier for you to go in and say, you know ‘hey Craig! Can you actually do this for me?’ And Craig trusts me, so Craig does that work. Now when I go in, it’s …</p>
<p>Alpar: There is a process.</p>
<p>Forrester: This is what I need to do, okay. Will you need to align the process, tell me what the return’s going to be, justify this thing. Then someone else takes that …</p>
<p>Alpar: Compare to the cost probably also.</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. And someone takes all over all those factors, and not only for my projects but for every project, and determines what will get worked out. And then …</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. It’s so hard for me to imagine if I am, if I was an MSN, would I, would I do optimization and think, okay, Google’s going to send me traffic? Is that something you think of or is it…</p>
<p>Forrester: Oh, absolutely!</p>
<p>Alpar: Really?</p>
<p>Forrester: It’s a website like any other. Right, so …</p>
<p>Alpar: I was, if I was Google and I, I probably don’t like Microsoft (Laughs), I would maybe … Do you think it’s all, they all play fair?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, largely, they do; because here’s why: the search engine job is to bring back to best results for something. So if, either the engine decided that it wanted to remove a competitor from it own index, then that really hurts the relevancy in its  index. It is not a good user experience, okay? It’s not, it’s just not the good thing to do but, but it hurts the user. And, and at the very core of everything we do, is the user experience. So we have to show this.</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s more like a long-term perspective.</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. It, it would be like, if you had a window in your home and you covered one pane with a piece of cardboard. You not seeing the full view and no one want to do that.</p>
<p>Alpar: So who’s usually competitive of MSN?</p>
<p>Forrester: Typically larger portals like Yahoo …</p>
<p>Alpar: New sites or that kind of stuff, general interest very much.</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, exactly; general interest entertainment, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Alpar: But like, so MSN is just the, the content, it’s not like where you buy your window Samsung, this is not MSN?</p>
<p>Forrester: No, it’s a separate area.</p>
<p>Alpar: Alright. So, there was seven guys only for MSN?</p>
<p>Forrester: Globally, yes.</p>
<p>Alpar: Wow! It’s quite a, quite a few.</p>
<p>Forrester: It is, it is, but it’s …</p>
<p>Alpar: But, but then again, it’s the number of pages so …</p>
<p>Forrester: It is a huge project, huge project.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, so in, in, what kind of numbers were you looking because if, obviously MSN is like a publishing business or there is no leads, there is no sales, right?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: I would, I mean, for Hotmail you can probably generate leads or something.<br />
Forrester: Those ads are all over MSN.</p>
<p>Alpar: Sure, sure. Again, you, you are kind of targeting the maximum reach, I guess.</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: This is like probably, like a typical publishing house target.</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, yeah. We’re, we’re really optimising our content driving traffic into the website; that was our main goal.</p>
<p>Alpar: So was it only US or were you also .. having some inside in the /</p>
<p>Forrester: No, no, every market, every market globally.</p>
<p>Alpar: So which market were you really active in?</p>
<p>Forrester: It’s, my area of coverage was US in Americas. So Canada and United Stated, Brazil, Guatemala, all of the Central and South American countries where MSN has a presence.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. Let’s, let’s talk about those, let’s talk about those. Did you have like different content for the different Spanish markets, or did you have additional local content?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yep! It depends on the market. There was always some local components to it and in a lot of cases, because there was common languages, or something was a regional issue, it would be shared across these areas, right?</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, what did you do with duplicate content?</p>
<p>Forrester: It’s an ongoing; it’s an ongoing thing, right? (Laughs) There is, but the good thing about this is, when the search engines actually lock in a region, when you get down to the regional level, they are looking at the regional level. So when you go to Colombia, an article could be showing up in Colombia, an article showing up in Guatemala, both Spanish, same thing, two different URLs, two different market places. So it’s not really duplicate because it’s actually targeting that local market, right? So this is where the kind of globalisation research is paying dividends for really large publishers.</p>
<p>Alpar: And, and did you have like different top level domains for each country or did you have subfolders and or sub-domains?</p>
<p>Forrester: They were pretty much sub-domains, yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: And how, how does it feel to, to work in those markets? I would think, just from a gut feeling, that there, it’s a little easier and less competitive than probably in the US.</p>
<p>Forrester: It’s, it’s very different from the US. It’s, there is a lot of competition in the US, but the competition you have in other markets tends to be very well established. Like for largest television channel in Brazil, happens to have the largest internet portal in Brazil as well. And then they can leverage that television coverage to drive people to the website. So it became…</p>
<p>Alpar: And in each country there is like strong media players that have strong websites?</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. So it’s, it’s …</p>
<p>Alpar: And MSN is online only.</p>
<p>Forrester: Right. So it, it becomes a bit of a challenge then, right? Because it’s not like in the US where, well in the US, MSN is one of the larger players in market place; in Brazil, it’s a smaller player. And it needs to actually be very creative at what it does. And my hat after the folks in Brazil, because they are amazing at what they do with MSN there.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So which, which of the markets is the strongest? Is it Brazil because it’s bigger or, I am not, I don’t know all the markets well, so …</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, they are all strong, okay? The Brazilian market is growing but it is not just us that’s growing, it’s the internet at large is growing there. You know, the adoption rate of huge mobile usage is skyrocketing; the number of people coming online in Brazil is massive. I mean, it’s just a huge market as a country, right? So it’s, it’s a little bit, it’s a little bit difficult to say which one is the stronger, because they have the strength for different reasons.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So, like, any highlight that you can mention that you still remember that, you know, amazed you from one of the countries?</p>
<p>Forrester: Pretty much the only thing (laugh) that I, that really sticks out to me is, it’s working with the people; that’s, that’s my big standard. Because SEO was the same, doesn’t matter where it is, right? There is some differences when you get in the keywords research and you try to translate different phrases or concepts between languages, that kind of stuff; but it was, it was working with people, you know. When you work with folks …</p>
<p>Alpar: So they work, they have a different working style with different nations?</p>
<p>Forrester: Oh absolutely, absolutely. So I, I, I travelled to Brazil and I was totally knocked off my game because I wasn’t used to the idea of having lunch at two o’clock in the afternoon, having dinner at ten o’clock at night and then going to bed at midnight and coming in, to the office later in the morning; I am very much up at five AM and get in the office early, that kind of thing. So you kind of hit that culture wall and you’re like ‘Wow!’ (Laughs) And, but it was, it was an amazing environment, it didn’t feel …</p>
<p>Alpar: How long did it take you to adapt?<br />
Forrester: About two days (laughs). Yeah, it was pretty good, it was pretty good.</p>
<p>Alpar: It must have been really hard.</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, I mean, you know all the people; so you feel like you’re working within a family, right? So you’re on conference calls with them every week, you see them at the office, they’d fly out into the United States, you fly down to Brazil. So, so you really know these people.</p>
<p>Alpar: Can you wake up early enough?</p>
<p>Forrester: Well, I, I was up anyhow, right? (Laughs) Although the time difference kills me, six hours. But, but you have this real sense of family. And when I’d walk in to the office, it didn’t feel like going to an office where I was working. It felt like going to be with family members and the conversations were open back and forth, people trying things instantly and …</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s like the, the liking character that comes in to play there?</p>
<p>Forrester: That’s, that’s the feel that I get, you know. I’ve travelled a fair amount and I, it doesn’t seem to matter whether I am tourist or I am going for meetings. I, that same vibe exists there, right? It’s fantastic, a love working with folks out of the UK and Europe; I, I haven’t met anybody yet that I have been challenged with; every culture I have met, especially in the world, is, they’re thirsty for knowledge, they want to learn, they want to grow, they want to be successful. And that, we have, everyone has that in common. So, it’s pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So is, do you think that, I mean, let’s, let’s talk a bit more the SEO side of things, because I think, I got carried away a bit (Laughs). Obviously you see how well I prepared for the interview. Do you think now that, thing Bing is, you know, gaining reach, is it, is it challenged more by spam or less, or …?</p>
<p>Forrester: I, I think the, the concept of being challenged by spam exists, no matter your size, right? Every time someone thinks they can exploit an area, they are going to go out of it 100 percent. So really, our focus is on, just making sure that we are doing everything that we can to manage that. And it’s an ongoing, it’s an ongoing approach; I mean, it’s constant. Every day, several times a day, work is being invested to make sure that we understand what the latest is, the areas that we need to improve on our end and we see any new patterns developing, capturing those, testing them and really understanding, okay, this is the new state of the union that we have to address, moving forward.</p>
<p>Alpar: So is this process a summary to over, other search engines where they have quality search analysts under one side that, you know, go from, from, let’s say, top view and then they have, let’s say, more use, cost user input they also think about the quality and then feedback? Is it, is it similar?</p>
<p>Forrester: About, the most I can tell you is that we’re continually investing in it, right? The actual process itself and how it all runs, it’s not really anything I can touch on.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, we were also curious in the, in the session where you just, where you just did the presentation, or the, the SEO clinic. And you, you mentioned really, like several times, really …</p>
<p>Voice: Three times.</p>
<p>Alpar: Three times at least, like three or four times about keyword density or it’s like something that I don’t think so often of; is it really those cases that matter to you, and did you, did you just like run all the keywords of the site, you know, reduce to the stem of the word and then look the percentage of how often that shows up and then, you know …</p>
<p>Forrester: Well, I’ve never said ‘keyword density’; I never said those words…</p>
<p>Alpar: Keyword stuffing that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Forrester: Right, keyword stuffing I mentioned. It’s interesting to bring up keyword density because …</p>
<p>Alpar: So you were, were referring to the matter information …</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, I am just talking strictly a little automated keyword tag there because, because literally, they are just, the folks are piling stuff in there it shouldn’t be; and it was that obvious.</p>
<p>Alpar: You mean the examples were not so advanced, so …</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. But on the topic of keyword density, it’s something a lot of people come across and they say ‘well I really have to nail this, I need to know what the percentage is on that’. Don’t be chasing keyword density, don’t be looking for that, don’t be trying to figure out if it’s five percent right, it’s nine percent right, write good content; find the keyword to focus on, write good content for it, be unique about it and then read it out loud. If it sounds good when you read it out loud, it’s probably fine. If it sounds like you’re saying the word too many times, you need to pull that out.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. Do you think leading SEOs agree on, with you on that?</p>
<p>Forrester: Some will, some won’t. (Laughs) It’s, it’s, I mean, but that’s typical; every time you seat, you talk with SEOs, right, you’ll get a variety of answers, you know. I, I have, I have, probably five or six years ago, I was a big proponent of keyword density, of figuring what it was, nailing it down and doing all that; then it occurred to me one day that every single page is rated against every other single page that it’s fighting against. So there is no way to predict what the best density will be.</p>
<p>Alpar: But, but you can start analyzing if, if you are targeting like, say, a limited amount of, of, of topical buckets; you can analyze what the average keyword density is in that topical area and then adjust your keyword density a little bit above the average.</p>
<p>Forrester: Okay.</p>
<p>Alpar: That would make sense, right?</p>
<p>Forrester: How much time does it take you to do …</p>
<p>Alpar: It must be automatically, it cannot be handmade.</p>
<p>Voice: With the script.</p>
<p>Alpar: With the script, I mean …</p>
<p>Forrester: So you’re going to hold to your content programmatically and it’s not going to be unique content.</p>
<p>Alpar: No, no; I mean, you can have unique content. Let’s say, like typical sta, I mean this is like really advanced topics, right?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah.</p>
<p>Alpar: So who would do that, probably a price comparison engine who, like mostly lives off SEO, right? So they would have, let’s say, in categories, they would have unique content anywhere, right? They have it just to, you know, leg, legitimately they have it; but then again, there are some certain areas of the page where you can another keyword or two if you feel that, for this topical area, it makes sense; and you want to be a little above the average of your competitors in the topical area. So that would make sense?</p>
<p>Forrester: It can, it can make sense …</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s very advanced, so it’s not for everybody if I am selling, I don’t know, T-Shirts, it’s too complex, if you just have ten different products, it’s way too complex; but if you’re running like a large scale SEO operation, then, you know, it does make sense, or you, you don’t agree with me?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah. You see, to me, that’s, it’s just not something I invest in, right? Even a large scale e-Commerce, all those things, it’s not an area that I put time into; simply because what I know, I know what the search engines are looking for, is content. I know they are looking for good, deep, rich, authoritative content. So if you can prove to me that your blue sweater is the best blue sweater on the internet when somebody is searching for a blue sweater, then I am likely return that page as top result. If you’re doing that because you adding a couple of keywords on that page, in addition to what it is, that’s not adding extra content, that’s just putting a few things on the page. We can see that, we can see that’s not content, it’s not text describing the product, you are going to more detail; we can see that it’s a few words added to the page and that doesn’t carry a lot of weight.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So what do you think about pictures and videos? I mean, I think it, it definitely helps with the bounce rate and the help people perceive the page; but then again, search engines are stupid. They don’t understand one single picture or one single video. They just don’t understand it. Yeah, I can put Alt Text in, I can, I can take my audio and you know, transcribe it; I put it in the, the description areas, but then again, they still don’t see the picture, they do not understand what’s on there. I mean, I, I know that some search eng, engines are buying smaller companies that tried, you know, to breakthrough, but, what’s your thought of that? Because there is so much work, you know, taking those great pictures and great videos and still, I mean, they, they only help me from those aspects; they don’t, neither help me on-page stuff really, they don’t help me with off-page stuff, they only help me, let’s say, the user aspect of it. But, then again, it, it sounds expensive.</p>
<p>Forrester: So here is the value to you, right? Well but, you, you hit on it, okay? This is user experience issue, alright? You want to make sure that when a user shows up on your website, they stay engaged on that page. You’re going to do that with videos, you’re going to do that with, with audio tracks, you’re going to do it with vid, images, all of that stuff; ‘cause that’s what people are looking for. They are looking for the multiple photos of that product, they want to see the video of that, that, that RC helicopter in action, you know. I know, a buddy of mine in Germany crashes is like several times a week, so he’s always looking for more.</p>
<p>Alpar: We just have one in the company and they destroyed it in less than an hour, so it’s like two hundred bucks gone. (Laugh)</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. If you want to see the video of that thing flying before you spend the first two hundred dollars …</p>
<p>Alpar: (Laughs) it was a short video.</p>
<p>Forrester: But a still’s enough. But this is the point, right? It’s the user experience. So imagine if I show you as a first result and then the user clicks on that and goes in, and stays on your website; they’re looking at the photos of the helicopter, they’re looking at the video, they’re watching this stuff, they’re engaged with it; this is what I see, I see me ranking them, I see the user clicking on it, I see the user leaving me and go to the website.</p>
<p>Alpar: And staying there for a while.</p>
<p>Forrester: I don’t see them coming back, right? That makes a big difference to us.</p>
<p>Alpar: One question directly on that. You know page, like page speed is a big factor too, it seems at least or at least, it has grown from zero to something. So if I have ten pictures per product and three videos, my page will take long to load if I am not, if I don’t go for like lazy loading or Ajaxrain, type of that funky stuff. Do you think, you know, people have to think of page load and let’s say content reach stuff?</p>
<p>Forrester: Definitely, there’s definitely a balance in there, right? Most websites, most web-pages, even if you add some more video and image content, don’t necessarily have to worry too much about it, okay? You know, it’s, it’s something that you want to be aware of, because if it has a negative effect on the user experience; we’re, we’re going to see that, we’re gonna ping the URL and the clock starts ticking, wondering what we’re waiting for, you know. And we also know the difference between, you know, we’re on a slow internet connection versus, you know, it’s actually components from your website, I mean. So, it’s not like you’re going to look at it from home and go like ‘Oh, I am lightning fast or I am so slow, this is a problem’. That’s a non reliable way to do it, right?</p>
<p>Alpar: So you have to weigh in for both and try to find to compromise yourself? If you think one is …</p>
<p>Forrester: If it’s my website, I’d be skewing towards using the experience; that’s what I’d be looking towards, okay?</p>
<p>Alpar: Because the internet will become faster over time anyways, or do you ….</p>
<p>Forrester: All of those things, yeah. There, we think we’re seeing bandwidth increase, we’re seeing speed increase, we’re seeing a lot of that stuff, that’s happening anyhow; but more importantly, all of this is when a user shows up and they look for something, they want to find it. Users generally will wait a little bit for that page to load; there, there’s an assumption of relative slow to all of this. The real kick though is that if you give them a lightning fast page, but it doesn’t have any tangible content that they can really look at or enjoy, or engage with, and you say ‘Alright, I know it’s 09:30 at night, I know you had a long day and I just gave you a thousand words, you’re going to have to read through. But I am going to give you the best description ever of a helicopter’. You know what? They’re going to go back because, at that time of night at home, the kids are in bed, they are relaxing; what they want, there’s a quick video to watch and images to look at, so they can dream about what they want to buy, right? So, so you have to make sure that it’s in there. Don’t go on load up fifty images on this thing that are all ten megapixels or that kind of stuff, right? People get carried away on that. They’d rather go and buy a really nice camera; they turn the thing up to full power and they are looking at it going. This is the most crystal clear image ever and there you go. I can show you details, I can show the small screw on that little thing; no one needs that level of detail, right? When they buy the product, they can look at it and see the little screw, you know (Laughs). Prior to that, they just need a nice small little idea, right? I remember, five, six years ago, the guideline on the image search was to have images somewhere around 250 by 250 pixels, right?</p>
<p>Alpar: Which is so small actually. I would say it’s a little too small.</p>
<p>Forrester: These days, it was a reasonable size then to have on a page, that you could click and see a larger version on it, right? So that …</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s like the mid-size, not the thumbnail but the mid-size version of it.</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly, so it was like a large thumbnail that would allow somebody to click on the result, and then as a separate URL, you would see the full size of it.</p>
<p>Alpar: Which will still make sense. Can I jump a little on the topic? So let’s say, if we come back to Brazil, let’s say I have a content website that has like two hundred sub-pages, I am like local simple service not in a highly competitive area and I have an office in Portugal and in Brazil and, can I use the same exact content, just change the address and, if one top level domain is targeting Portugal like pt and one targeting Brazil; what’s your, what’s your take on that?</p>
<p>Forrester: Just be careful to try to make it as unique as possible to the market, right? They may be both Portuguese languages, but they’re totally different countries. So …</p>
<p>Alpar: So, let’s say my Portuguese website even gets ten Portuguese links and the Brazilian website gets ten Brazilian links; but the content is the same.</p>
<p>Forrester: Doesn’t change my answer. You have to try to be as unique as possible for the market, right?</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay, but within Brazil, this, this website is unique, the other one is not targeting Brazil?</p>
<p>Forrester: Agreed.</p>
<p>Alpar: So you think for Portugal to …</p>
<p>Forrester: But they’re going to be things happening in Brazil that have nothing to do with Portugal, and vice versa. So you’re naturally going to be creating completely different contents.</p>
<p>Alpar: You think so? But look, if I , if I …</p>
<p>Forrester: The football team in Portugal is not the same one playing in, in Brazil.</p>
<p>Alpar: No, but look; I am, I, let’s say you have a grey t-shirt on, I am selling grey t-shirts.</p>
<p>Forrester: Okay, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, I am, I have a grey website like an online shop for grey t-shirts. And I sell grey t-shirts in Portugal and because this is the only language I speak, I sell grey t-shirts in Brazil too because I know somebody there they can do the logistics. So in this case, you know, it’s the same t-shirt, it’s the same sales pitch I am giving, it’s the same description about material and so on I can give; what about that?</p>
<p>Forrester: Make sure you’re giving us the right signals, right? Because if all you do is take that content and you say ‘Okay, copy and paste it over here’, we need to understand that that grey t-shirt /</p>
<p>Alpar: I will have ten, ten additional local links; that’s my only, only signal I am giving.</p>
<p>Forrester: But, but don’t just, don’t just rely on the links, right? Go into your webmaster account, make sure you get the Geo-targeting tags in your, in your header tags, make sure that you’re using not just those ten links but you are looking for other things to reinforce the fact that this is it; because are you hosting two different websites in two different locations, or you’re hosting in one location?</p>
<p>Alpar: I am hosting in one location in the US, both of them.</p>
<p>Forrester: Right okay. So all we need …</p>
<p>Alpar: it’s really confusing for you guys?</p>
<p>Forrester: No, we’re just going to need as many signals as you can give us to tell us which domain is applicable to which location. And, the more signals you give us about that, the stronger we can trust that that’s accurate; that the result we’re taking in from you and then the result to give back to that local market are accurate to the market.</p>
<p>Alpar: So we’re back to our Portuguese and, and, and Brazilian websites. So you say we have to give more signals which means, within the webmaster area, I define, okay, this is located for this, and in the meta tags I do the same, and I have some local links. You think that is sufficient or you think I should walk the extra mile and those hundreds page content that I, I have, I wrote different content? Just to be different?</p>
<p>Forrester: You should always walk the extra mile for us; there is no question about us, okay? We need to know that the result we’re going to give back is properly targeting that area, because if we’re going to take the result in, we’re going to have to understand and trust.</p>
<p>Alpar: But, but the uniqueness of content is something else, something different, then the, the targeting of a certain area, right?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Alpar: So I don’t even want to optimise for grey shirt Brazil, grey shirt Portugal; I just want want to optimise for grey shirt. So duplicate content is the, which I am worried about and not which geographic area I am targeting.<br />
Forrester: But if you’re using them in two different locations, then they are not duplicate to each other; because one is targeting one country and one is targeting a different country. So, so if you can tell us very strongly that these belong to two different countries, then you can avoid the duplication, okay? You can also avoid the duplicate issue by not using the same content, by writing it a little bit differently.</p>
<p>Alpar: So which, what would you do if, if you were the grey t-shirt seller?</p>
<p>Forrester: If it were me, I’d be going with the unique content route, no question at all. It’s easier, it’s more straight forward and it is very dependable. So you can actually sit down and say that’s what I wrote for Portugal, that’s what I wrote for Brazil. There are only so many ways to talk about a grey t-shirt, granted. (Laughs) However, …</p>
<p>Alpar: There is a Portuguese way and a there’s Brazilian way; it’s completely different. (Laughs)</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. Right. You may look at it and say ‘Well common language, but culturally this is how we’re going to tackle this. So we’re going to look it from …’</p>
<p>Alpar: I, I totally agree, but there are people from other big search engines that oversimplify this case and it’s, it’s really interesting to hear a, a different opinion. I, I think Sibita who’s listening all the time here has another question.</p>
<p>Sibita: Yes. At the SCS 2011 in New York, we were talking about bounce rates; that bounce rate became more important for search engines. What do you think about that? Do you think this might be not, that’s easy to, to, to tackle, like it’s open for spammers maybe; what do you think about the bounce rate? Is it, is it important?</p>
<p>Alpar: Can it be manipulated? &#8230; Oh, probably it’s a, maybe, different question, I am sorry.</p>
<p>Forrester: No, no, that’s okay; and, and, there is very little I can actually talk about this topic guys. To be honest with you, it’s a signal that we would want to look at because, it’s a, it’s a, it’s an intent or a, it’s a form of satisfaction that users are giving back to us, okay? But again, when we look at signals, we look at signals on scale, on really big scale, okay? And then we also look at them in a very small scale. So we can see patterns happening, right? So if a competitor are constantly coming into your website, or come into our website performing a search and then, going click and back, click and back, click and back, I mean, we see that pattern very easily and then we just count it</p>
<p>Alpar: But then again, probably, probably he is clicking and going back because the result just showing him that it’s not my website, so it’s not the good result, you know. (Laughs)</p>
<p>Forrester: No, that’s not the case (Laughs). We only show the best results. But if somebody is doing that to you, you then the pattern becomes obvious, right? So then, we can kind of like just ignore that pattern and say …</p>
<p>Alpar: If it’s way out of the ordinary, it’s suspicious.</p>
<p>Forrester: Right, exactly. Because we, we do have an understanding of what we’d be considering like ordinary. So if it’s, you know, somebody unleashes their robot on you and you know, and all of a sudden there are fifty thousand back actions every minute, that’s probably a problem, you know…</p>
<p>Alpar: Like running a TV add.</p>
<p>Forrester: (Laughs) No, it’s a fairly good signal, something is not normal. But the main thing people need to think about around this bounce rate is, it’s not the rate itself, right? It’s the reason behind the rate. So why are users doing this? And is that got anything to do with my landing page, my content, my presentation? Is it something that I am doing on the website that’s making users go back?</p>
<p>Alpar: And I am sure it’s also like a competitive factor; it’s not like only my bounce rate, but it is, it has to be compared with other people ranking for my keywords, for the same keywords and then compare to that, you know.</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. Because what you’ll find over time is …</p>
<p>Alpar: If you find a ninety percent bounce rate, and everybody in the surf has a ninety-five percent bounce rate, you’ll look really good.</p>
<p>Forrester: Exactly. And that’s quite a very critical point on this. Everything is kind of compared against everything else, so, you know, bounce rates can be lower or higher, you’d obviously want to have a bounce rate as low as possible. That’s what you&#8217;d strive for. But if the average bounce rate on that topic is twenty percent and you’re at ten percent, then you’re ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Sibita: The bigger question was that’s manipulative, manipulative, no…</p>
<p>Alpar: It can be manipulated.</p>
<p>Sibita: Yeah. Isn’t, isn’t that true that it can be very easily man-, manipulated? My God!</p>
<p>Forrester: If it’s something that can be easily manipulated, then it’s not a good signal. So, we’re watching for that kind of stuff all the time. Right. So, it’s not like, we’re very smart (laughs). We’re not going to sit down going: ‘Well, you know, maybe no one will figure that out’ and we just leave it out there. We really do take pains to make sure that if we’re looking at something, we’re saying to ourselves, ‘Alright, what’s the logical op, outcome of this’. So, if we, if we want to rely on something, we need to know that it’s trustworthy before we can actually activate it, right. That is critical for us.</p>
<p>Sibita: So, it’s not on a long tail?</p>
<p>Forrester: It, it doesn’t matter where it’s applied, right. It’s always something that we’re watching for. And, and everything that we look for, applies whether it’s head or long tail, it doesn’t make a difference to us, right. The theory behind it’s all the same.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. And, what’s your take on SEO tools, they seem to they seem to proliferate in the last one or two years?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah! (Laughs). I love them. I think some of them are absolutely fantastic. I think some of them are just not so good, right. There are a lot of good enterprise level tools out there, which is primarily what I tend to gravitate toward. I am a fan of building tools for my needs, which what my team did back in MSN /</p>
<p>Alpar: Which is what every engineer does, right? Not inventor syndrome?</p>
<p>Forrester: No, no, exactly. I’m, but I’m not a, I’m not an engineer, so, my approach to it though is, we have to deal with scale somehow, and in order to deal with scale, you need certain factors in place. Most off-the-shelf systems are, are still trying to crack that level that I was in need of. But there are still lots of them out there that are fantastic for it, right? And there are tools today that can actually handle that load. Three years ago they weren’t there, now they’re there. I think yes the tools are fantastic but you have to really be careful what they’re telling you, right, and how you’re using it. You have to just make sure that the data bases are current in it, that if they’re running against rules and telling you the work they need to do, that the latest updates have been factored in. Worse is, how do you even factor in the latest updates because we, as an SEO you kind of haven’t figured out what it means yet and did that actually affect, you know, ‘do I rewrite something’, ‘does this have more prominence’, this kind of stuff. So, you need to make sure that what you’re using is stable as well, okay. I’m not a big fan of tools that do scraping for ranking results, people should be avoiding those things. It’s …</p>
<p>Alpar: Why? (Laughs). Because it’s, the server loads were causing a big… (laughs)</p>
<p>Forrester: The engines do not appreciate that, and we see where it’s coming from.</p>
<p>Alpar: But then again, but then again, you know, they still work?</p>
<p>Forrester: Well, it gives you a result and we see where it’s coming from. So, do you actually want to upset us or…</p>
<p>Alpar: But you don’t know if a search is ter-, like, if a search is initiated you don’t know which of the results is initiating the search. It might even be somebody who’s not ranking there, yet, because, you know…</p>
<p>Forrester: Right. But we see the IP addresses, we see all the background details of the request being made, and if we see, if we see a pattern, if we see a pattern…</p>
<p>Alpar: And I’m sure the tools providers deal with that all the time.<br />
Forrester: Absolutely. And generally, Daemons tools, not a problem. However, if they’re overused, that can be an issue, and if we get pushed too hard, we can push back.</p>
<p>Alpar: Okay. So…</p>
<p>Sibita: You’re also working with a captcha?</p>
<p>Forrester: Pardon me?</p>
<p>Sibita: You’re working also with a captcha? If there’s too many…</p>
<p>Alpar: Like a captcha systems if there is …</p>
<p>Forrester: Oh, yeah! That’s, that’s a normal part of it, right, right. And it’s odd because I see that trigger sometimes, even when I’m doing something manually (laughs).</p>
<p>Alpar: It’s because we’ve installed stuff on your computer (laughs), a special Trojan stuff. Don’t worry, it’s natural, it’s okay. Okay, one last question, because it’s obviously a German podcast, where do you think, do you have contact with SEO in Germany and what do you think of it?</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, actually, part of my team, that I used to work for was based in Munich. And, I think it’s, I think there’s a, it’s very strange there are pockets of people around the world that have really gotten into online marketing and SEO, Germany is one of those areas.</p>
<p>Alpar: So, which are other areas?</p>
<p>Forrester: Portland, Oregon. I know! (Laughs).</p>
<p>Alpar: Never heard of it (laughs). I have to go there.</p>
<p>Forrester: I know. It’s one state below me on the West Coast, at a fantastic place. But the culture grows up, right, and the people get involved in it and they get together, and that’s what builds the culture; and it is so incredible because when you go to small events in these areas and you talk with people, it’s amazing the learning. The things they understand, the tasks that they’ve run, the stuff that they’ve kind of taken out of that, and then say ‘wow, this works, so we’re going to pursue this angle. It’s fantastic.’</p>
<p>Alpar: Alright, thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Forrester: Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Alpar : Thank you.</p></blockquote>

		<itunes:summary>I have interviewd Duane Forrester for OMReport.com during SES New York City in March 2011
&#160;

This Podcast is also available on iTunes and on Youtube. You can find the transcription in the post details.

Alpar: So, we are here to do a special interview. Can you introduce yourself please and what your role is?
Forrester: Yeah, my name is Duane Forrester, I am a Senior Product Manager with Bing, the search engine and my actual day job is running the webmaster program for Bing; so the forums, the community, the blog and the tools themselves.
Alpar: Okay, so how come you are hosting an SEO clinic at the SES? It’s confusing.
Forrester: (Laugh) Because for the past ten years, I have been an in-house SEO. I started with a small company in Eastern Canada and then moved on to run SEO for MSN in US America’s. So I understand small scale and large scale SEO, I have been doing it for a decade. So when we sit down, we want to do a bit of a review, it’s a great opportunity for me to help people understand what really makes a difference and to shed a little bit of light from the search engine’s perspective on what we are really looking for.
Alpar: Okay, but do you really have, I mean, if you were an in-house SEO, you were kind of reengineering to feel how, how the algorithm works, did you get insight into that once you have, you know, entered the, the other side?
Forrester: I, I have a very different point of view today, yes. (Laughs)
Alpar: Okay, okay.
Forrester: Nothing I can talk about obviously, but, but yeah.
Alpar: No, no, no, don’t worry about it, okay, okay. So, I mean, how did you, I mean that’s quite a, quite a, quite a game changer I mean, I mean, both steps to me sound like quite a game changer, even if, there is a lot of, I am aware of quite a few SEOs that are really successful like on the small or mid-size projects, but if you give them a long tail website with a couple of million sub-pages, they are lost. And they also then find out, they don’t even have the capacity to do it. So how, did you know that you could do even MSN?
Forrester: Well, it was a scenario where I kind of, like most people, started with my own website and just kind of played around, you know, even in the days before Google, when you just add more keywords and you don’t rank the competitor and then you’d come back the next day and update that and, and then that grew. And I got to a point where, I have a background in marketing from Caesars Palace, I used to work with casinos in Canada that were run by them; so that background in marketing combined with my own experience online led me to get into online marketing. And when I started with the company, it was relatively small; we had on the order of tens of thousands of pages and I think I was employee 11 or 13, or something; when I left they had two hundred employees, hundreds of thousands of pages. So we kind of grew over time. And while you’re doing that, you encounter scale because it’s easy to go in and optimize a webpage for the name of a pitcher, it was a sport website; but then, when you have to do this for every team, across all of the leagues, you know, that’s quite a bit of a work. Then when it comes to, to, to statistical data pages, that stuff’s constantly changing and then we added the extra layer of comparing stats between teams, so we were competing, or taking these very dynamic pages that could just be built on the fly. So you start really figuring out ways to do things at scale, right? Like you realize you can’t handwrite every title tag. What you have to do is work with the editors and educate them to understand that when they write something, it needs to target the right keywords. So when they produce the product, you have a good product on the other end. You have to work on what is the best way to automate a meta description tag, what’s the best piece of content on the page to take and put in that location, and so on.
Alpar: So you mostly talk to yourself or did you have like a me[...]</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OMReport.om will be hosting an online marketing podcast from today on. Topics of the podcast will closely match to what <a href="http://www.andrealpar.de">I do</a> business wise, e.g. onlinemarketing, affiliate marketing, seo, performance marketing, start-ups especially the fast growing one&#8217;s in the internet space. Focus of the podcast are interviews with interesting people working in this space.</p>
<p>As I am based in Germany most of the interviews I do are actually in German and will be hosted on the <a href="http://www.omreport.de/"> German version of this podcast</a>. Some of the interviews I do are in english and only those will be featured here. So it may as well be, that the english podcast is not updated very frequently so I would suggest to <strong>subscribe to it via iTunes, <a href="http://twitter.com/omreport" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/omreport" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/omreport" target="_blank">Youtube</a></strong> so you do not miss out on new episodes.</p>
<p>With this episode Zero theres a slightly ironic self interview included. Have fun and let me know how you like the podcast?</p>
<p>The transcript of this episode can be seen on the detail-page of this. If you rather would like to view the podcast you can do this on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGrus7nT5r4">Youtube</a>.<br />
<span id="more-19"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Interviewer: So, welcome to episode zero of OM Report. OM Report is another online marketing podcast brought to you by Andre Alpar and this is the episode number zero, so, the episode before the real episodes. And I’ll try to do it in a similar way, as I’m doing the real episodes, which means I’m doing an interview, and in this case because the episode zero is kind of there to explain a little bit the background of the podcast, I’ll interview myself. So, Andre, who the hell are you and why do you think you should bring out another online marketing podcast?<br />
Alpar: So, I’m an online marketeer from Germany and, most of the interviews that I do are in German for the German crowd and, the podcast has another German website. And sometimes I still meet people that are not from Germany and still have a great story to tell and I want to ask some interesting questions. So, those people, are interviewed in English and I thought, once the interview is done in English I should also make it available to the English speaking crowd out there, so, I publish this on omreport.com, and also the transcription on omreport.com is in English, and for the German listeners, I have a German translation of the whole thing on omreport.de</p>
<p>Interviewer: So, do you think you can really keep this up regularly?</p>
<p>Alpar: Well, for the English podcast I’m not so positive right now, because, as I said, most of the interviews I’ve done so far, like a dozen, they are in German, so you’ll be seeing these things from time to time. So, I would ask you kindly to, you know, check out the Twitter feed or check it out on YouTube or iTunes, and then you’ll see whenever I have another English edition of the OM Report for you.</p>
<p>Interviewer: So, how do you choose your interview partners, I mean, how do you contact them?</p>
<p>Alpar: Mostly I do the interviews on conferences or networking events where I’m visiting as a speaker or a participant. So, usually I just, you know, pick up whoever I can find and who seems to be an interesting person to talk to. And this is how I basically figure it out. I don’t really prepare for the interviews so they’re, most of the questions are completely spontaneous. So, sometimes the, the interviews are, don’t have like a perfect red string all the way through, but instead, they are kind of spontaneous and jumpy regarding the topics that they run.</p>
<p>Interviewer: So, how do I get the podcasts?</p>
<p>Alpar: The number one way would be, you know, visit the website, www.omreport.com, and then again, we have a Twitter feed, that’s /OM Report, on Facebook you also find it as OM Report, on iTunes the same and we also have it as, just basically a still picture of the interview partner and the interview as the, the audio track on YouTube. And I look forward to you guys checking out the English version of the OM Report. Thanks a lot.</p></blockquote>
