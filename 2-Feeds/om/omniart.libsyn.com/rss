<strong>Jeffrey’s surprising and inspiring conversation with <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cheeke" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cheeke" target="_blank">Robert Cheeke,</a> vegan bodybuilder extraordinaire featured in the documentary &#8220;<a title="http://store.veganessentials.com/vegan-fitness--built-naturally-dvd-p1761.aspx" href="http://store.veganessentials.com/vegan-fitness--built-naturally-dvd-p1761.aspx" target="_blank">Vegan Fitness: Built Naturally</a>&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>Robert’s fascinating story shatters the stereotype that one has to eat a protein saturated, meat based diet, in order to build great muscle mass and definition.</p>
<p>Robert talks about what led him to a vegan plant based diet and how this has helped him to win bodybuilding championships many time over &#8211; something most commonly think is completely impossible.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/Robert-CheekeB1.jpg" alt="Robert Cheeke" align="right" /><br />
<strong> A real maverick in the body building world, Robert and is a leading spokesperson for vegan athleticism and what it can accomplish in a very real, down to earth way.  Robert’s story puts to rest the myth that vegans are thin and weak  and replaces it with a positive uplifting truth that anything can be accomplished with focus, spirit and determination .</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jeffrey&#8217;s penetrating conversation with filmmaker and researcher <a title="http://thrivedoucmentaryreview.blogspot.com/2011/11/about-foster-gamble.html" href="http://thrivedoucmentaryreview.blogspot.com/2011/11/about-foster-gamble.html" target="_blank">Foster Gamble</a>, the man behind the <a title="http://www.thrivemovement.com/" href="http://www.thrivemovement.com/" target="_blank">THRIVE</a> movement and groundbreaking film of the same name. </strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/FosterGambleA1.jpg" alt="Foster Gamble" align="left" /></p>
<p>In this in depth conversation, Foster speaks about his 40 years of research and personal experience investigating the causes behind the social, economic and environmental crisis engulfing our world and describes the cutting edge of human ingenuity and technological solutions that are currently available to these formidable challenges.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/FosterGambleB1-1.jpg" alt="Thrive" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>As a direct heir to the <a title="http://www.pg.com/en_US/index.shtml" href="http://www.pg.com/en_US/index.shtml" target="_blank">Proctor and Gamble</a> family fortune, Foster has been gifted with the unique opportunity to spend his life exploring in-depth areas of scientific exploration and consciousness not commonly known or understood and has painstakingly integrated this information into the narrative that is the Thrive movement and film.   In this very candid conversation, Foster reveals for the first time many details of his personal story of exploration and what he sees as a positive future for humanity.</strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/FosterGambleC1.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></p>
<p>It is truly a refreshing perspective, especially in contrast to the deep corruption that permeates  world politics and money.  Solutions that are based on truth are the only sustainable solutions, and in this comprehensive conversation with Foster we think you will find many revelations that are inspiring and compelling and give you a sense of what is actually possible but has rarely, if ever, seen the light of day.</p>

It is a real life Avatar movie without a happy ending.... yet.

Zoeuml; has worked with sustainable development projects in indigenous lands, been an active campaigner for the inclusion of rights for nature in the new Ecuadorian Constitution, and she has worked closely on the case against Chevron in the northern Ecuadorian amazon (the largest environmental law suit in history which was featured in an investigative news story on Australia's channel 7 just a week ago.

She leads shamanic tours in the Andes and jungles of Ecuador, helping people to reconnect with the magic of the wilderness, nature and indigenous wisdom andnbsp; lsquo;Toxi Toursrsquo; for celebrities, film makers, journalists, and photographers of the areas destroyed by oil development.


Zoeuml; also attends conferences all over the world as an Amazon ambassador such as the indigenous peoples global summit on climate change in Anchorage Alaska, and the UN permanent forum on indigenous issues annual conference in NYC.

<p>In the 1980’s Robert turned this research into an international consulting company, specializing in knowledge management, called <a title="http://www.infomap.com/" href="http://www.infomap.com/" target="_blank">Information Mapping</a>.</p>
<p>His recent development of visual argumentation mapping has resulted in the publication of the <a title="http://www.stanford.edu/~rhorn/a/topic/arg/artclCmptrSpArgmttn.pdf" href="http://www.stanford.edu/~rhorn/a/topic/arg/artclCmptrSpArgmttn.pdf" target="_blank">Mapping Great Debates series</a> which you can find in the national museum in <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague" target="_blank">The Hague</a> as part of an exhibit on information design as a fine art.</p>

<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/Rose.jpg" alt="Alfonso De Rose" align="left" /><br />
Alfonso was born in <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" target="_blank">Italy</a> where his father was a Congressman and the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Public_Works_(Italy)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Public_Works_(Italy)" target="_blank">Minister of Public Works</a>. Through sheer determination and self-discipline, Alfonso achieved success in a number of areas early in life &#8211; winning trophies in a  soccer, martial arts, and American football, and at the age of 20 he became the Italian Champion of the <a title="http://www.ifbb.com/" href="http://www.ifbb.com/" target="_blank">International Federation of Body Building</a>.   As a physical trainer in the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Air_Force" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Air_Force" target="_blank">Italian Air Force</a> Alfonso discovered that his purpose in life was to help others achieve their own personal breakthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>Once in the United States, Alfonso began his work to help people achieve clarity and a laser like focus to naturally slim their bodies.  He now travels extensively through Asian countries where he has helped many people overcome poverty and human slavery through his wisdom, techniques, and mastery of meditative practices.</strong></p>
<p>Alfonso and Jeffrey speak about many meaningful things in the course of this conversation as Alfonso shares his heart, mind and soul that really needs to be experienced, to be truly understood.</p>

Jeffrey’s fascinating conversation with brilliant author <a title="http://popeannalisa.com/new-author/" href="http://popeannalisa.com/new-author/" target="_blank">Peter Canova</a>.</p>
<p>From the time Peter first experienced phenomena such as telepathy, remote viewing, intuitive medical readings, and psychic healing, Peter has spent much of his life seeking to understand the forces that link humanity together at an un   seenlevel.</p>
<p>Peter’s former businesses—luxury hotel development, shipping, and import/exporting—carried him around the world, giving him an insider’s view of international politics, finance, and the mentality of foreign cultures.</p>
<p>Athens, Rome, London, the Middle East, Thailand, and Africa provided the crucibles that melded business, political, and economic intrigues in Peter’s experience, giving him real life stories that could make best sellers in and of themselves.</p>
<p>Peter had an affinity for writing, and in the late 1990’s he acted on this talent winning a First Literary Prize for his very first short story at the highly respected<a title="http://www.sbwriters.com/" href="http://www.sbwriters.com/" target="_blank"> <strong>Santa Barbara’s Writer’s Conference in California. </strong></a></p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Peter took first place out of 500 entries in <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" target="_blank"><strong>Francis Ford Coppola’s</strong></a> online <a title="http://www.all-story.com/" href="http://www.all-story.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Zoetrope Magazine</strong></a> for his first publicly circulated short story, <strong>The Blood of our Departed</strong>.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/PeterCanovaB1.jpg" alt="Pope Annalisa" align="right" /><br />
Peter continued his track record of writing excellence with the publication of <strong><a title="http://popeannalisa.com/video-pope-annalisa/about-pope-annalisa-video/" href="http://popeannalisa.com/video-pope-annalisa/about-pope-annalisa-video/" target="_blank">Pope Annalisa</a></strong>, which immediately won the<strong><a title="http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/" href="http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/" target="_blank"> Nautilus</a></strong> and <strong><a title="http://www.independentpublisher.com/" href="http://www.independentpublisher.com/" target="_blank">Independent Publishers Awards</a></strong> in quick succession followed by the <strong><a title="http://www.usabooknews.com/bestbooks2010.html" href="http://www.usabooknews.com/bestbooks2010.html" target="_blank">National Best Book Award</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In Pope Annalisa, Peter explores an ancient spiritual tradition which cut across not only Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, but also the so-called pagan mystery schools of ancient days.</strong></p>
<p>With twenty-five years of voluminous research behind him in both mainstream and alternative religious/spiritual studies, with a particular interest in early Christianity, Peter is a leading expert on Gnostic and other ancient spiritual traditions.</p>
<p><strong>He travels the country as a speaker on such topics as parallels between</strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism_in_modern_times" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism_in_modern_times" target="_blank"><strong> Gnostic mysticism</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank"><strong>quantum physics</strong></a><strong>, the </strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddess" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddess" target="_blank"><strong>Sacred Feminine</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene" target="_blank"><strong>Mary Magdalene</strong></a><strong> and the lost women of the Bible, and the secret teachings of Jesus. </strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/PeterCanovaC1.jpg" alt="Pope Annalisa" align="left" /><br />
Peter’s skills helped him break down these  complex spiritual themes into simple and entertaining fiction, and the result is Pope Annalisa &#8211; a combination of this research and information channeled in his own meditations.</p>
<p>His hope is that this crossover novel, part thriller and part spiritual wisdom text, will point to a new paradigm transcending the dead end dogmas of religious, cultural and gender differences that have caused so much suffering in the human community.</p>
<p>We think you will find this amazing conversation with Peter a remarkable excursion into the information that made <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code" target="_blank">The Da Vinci Code</a> so powerful and take that thrust to an entirely new level of depth.  Peter’s skills and passion are quite evident in this conversation that is sure to further illuminate this understanding of our shared religious traditions in the western hemisphere.</p>

</ul>
<p>Jeffrey’s wonderful conversation with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gravel" target="_blank">Senator Mike Grave</a>l whom many of our American audience members may remember was a candidate in the 2008 presidential Election.</p>
<p>Jeffrey met up with <a href="http://www.mikegravel.us/" target="_blank">Senator Grave</a>l at the recent <a href="http://2011.consciouslifeexpo.com/program-guide.html" target="_blank">Conscious Life</a> expo in Los Angeles and was simply delighted with the depth and breadth of their conversation regarding economic, social, and political affairs and how the conscious individual can positively participate in our quickly changing political and social landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Senator Gravel is a fascinating and brilliant American statesman with a deep history of bringing critical change to America at very pivotal point in our history.  Many may not remember or know this, but Senator Gravel served in the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/" target="_blank">US Senate</a> from 1969 to 1981 and is credited with waging a successful one-man <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster" target="_blank">filibuster</a> for 5 months that forced the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon" target="_blank">Nixon administration</a> to cut a deal ending the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States" target="_blank"> military draft</a> in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>Added to this was Mike’s extraordinary achievement in releasing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers" target="_blank">Pentagon Papers</a>, the 7,000 page secret official document that revealed the governments lies and manipulations that misled the country into the Vietnam war and whose release precipitated the lawsuits which eventuated the end of that horrible quagmire of a war that marks one of the darkest hours of our nations history.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/MikeGraveldebate.jpg" alt="Mike Gravel" align="right" /><br />
After serving in the Senate, Senator Gravel went on to found <a href="http://demofound.org/" target="_blank">The Democracy Foundation</a>, <a href="http://philadelphiatwo.org/" target="_blank">Philadelphia II</a>, and <a href="http://www.mikegravel.us/national_initiative" target="_blank">Direct Democracy</a> &#8211; all nonprofit corporations dedicated to the establishment of direct democracy in the United States through the enactment of the <a href="http://ni4d.us/" target="_blank">National Initiative for Democracy</a> by American Voters.</p>
<p>As author of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Power-Mandate-Mike-Gravel/dp/1434343154" target="_blank"> Citizen Power</a> in 1971, Senator Gravel determined that much of what he wrote then is apropos in America today: hence, the release of <a href="http://www.citizen-power.us/" target="_blank">Citizen Power: A Mandate for Change</a> that reflects the accuracy of his evaluation of problems then, his current position on a number of issues facing America now, and the process Americans can undertake to become empowered s lawmakers in partnership with their elected legislators.</p>
<p><strong>We know all of you listening will find this rare glimpse into the mind and soul of one of America’s political hero’s most inspirational. Senator Gravel reveals his brilliant insight from his many years of pursuing the highest truths that succeeded in progressing the American Experiment towards ever greater transparency and a deeper understanding of what freedom really entails and requires from an awakened citizenry. Senator Gravels life has been a true demonstration of what an unrelenting commitment for truth and high ideals can achieve and what is possible in a nation that takes the ideals of democracy seriously enough to manifest them</strong>.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Jeffreyrsquo;s wonderful conversation with Senator Mike Gravel whom many of our American audience members may remember was a candidate in the 2008 presidential Election.

Jeffrey met up with Senator Gravel at the recent Conscious Life expo in Los Angeles and was simply delighted with the depth and breadth of their conversation regarding economic, social, and political affairs and how the conscious individual can positively participate in our quickly changing political and social landscape.

Senator Gravel is a fascinating and brilliant American statesman with a deep history of bringing critical change to America at very pivotal point in our history.nbsp; Many may not remember or know this, but Senator Gravel served in the US Senate from 1969 to 1981 and is credited with waging a successful one-man filibuster for 5 months that forced the Nixon administration to cut a deal ending the military draft in the United States.

Added to this was Mikersquo;s extraordinary achievement in releasing the Pentagon Papers, the 7,000 page secret official document that revealed the governments lies and manipulations that misled the country into the Vietnam war and whose release precipitated the lawsuits which eventuated the end of that horrible quagmire of a war that marks one of the darkest hours of our nations history.


After serving in the Senate, Senator Gravel went on to found The Democracy Foundation, Philadelphia II, and Direct Democracy - all nonprofit corporations dedicated to the establishment of direct democracy in the United States through the enactment of the National Initiative for Democracy by American Voters.

As author of Citizen Power in 1971, Senator Gravel determined that much of what he wrote then is apropos in America today: hence, the release of Citizen Power: A Mandate for Change that reflects the accuracy of his evaluation of problems then, his current position on a number of issues facing America now, and the process Americans can undertake to become empowered s lawmakers in partnership with their elected legislators.

We know all of you listening will find this rare glimpse into the mind and soul of one of Americarsquo;s political herorsquo;s most inspirational. Senator Gravel reveals his brilliant insight from his many years of pursuing the highest truths that succeeded in progressing the American Experiment towards ever greater transparency and a deeper understanding of what freedom really entails and requires from an awakened citizenry. Senator Gravels life has been a true demonstration of what an unrelenting commitment for truth and high ideals can achieve and what is possible in a nation that takes the ideals of democracy seriously enough to manifest them.

A true visionary, Senator Gravelrsquo;s life contributions to our nation cannot be underestimated for the impact that they have had and will continue to have for not only our generation, but future generations to come.

This is Jeffreyrsquo;s lovely conversation with Madeleine Marentette, founder of Grail Springs, Canadarsquo;s Award Winning Spa #38; Wellness Retreat Centre created in the spiritual consciousness of the Holy Grail.

Madeleine will be presenting The Daily Grail of Living the Enriched Life A womanrsquo;s personal ldquo;Eat, Pray, Loverdquo; Odyssey at the upcoming Conscious Life Expo in Los Angeles, February 11th-13th.


As an educator, spiritual guide, speaker, producer and best-selling author, Madeleine is a relentless actionist for environmental sustainability, social justice and animal welfare.nbsp; Madeleine holds a series of lectures and retreats throughout the year both at the Grail retreat centre and abroad. She is presently working on her next 2 books.nbsp; One is a spiritual cookbook for planetary healing and the second a book on the science of the soul. 

With the resounding success from producing the lsquo;Awaken the Dreamer Symposiumrsquo; which featured international transformational leaders as well as the Grail Lady Faire, Canadarsquo;s first ever 7-day festival especially for women empowering women, Madeleine is already planning next yearrsquo;s


symposium and faire which growing exponentially will enable many to fulfill their inner calling to find deeper peace, healing, and vocation dedicated to serving others.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Fresh Perspectives,  produced by Omni Art Salon Productions, offers listeners around the world the opportunity to hear fascinating, in-depth conversations with authors, scientists, politicians, doctors, academics, innovators, and artists investigating today’s most compelling ideas and concepts</strong>.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/GeorgeMasonA1.jpg" alt="George Mason" align="left" /><br />
Jeffrey investigates the foundation for freedom and consciousness in the life and work of United States Founder <strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason" target="_blank">George Mason</a></strong> elucidating upon the precarious nature of his times and how they are so relevant today.  Included is Jeffrey’s recitation of an extraordinary article Jeffrey recently came across written by <strong><a title="http://www.RCarterPittman.org/" href="http://www.RCarterPittman.org/" target="_blank">Robert Carter Pittman</a></strong> in 1953 that was originally published in the <a title="http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/kerbs/manuscript_03/index.html" href="http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/kerbs/manuscript_03/index.html" target="_blank">Autograph Collector’s Journal</a>, Spring Convention Edition.</p>
<p>Mr. Pittman was the author of many articles in the field of constitutional law and history, published in the <strong><a title="http://www.abajournal.com/" href="http://www.abajournal.com/" target="_blank">American Bar Association Journal</a></strong>, the <strong><a title="http://www.virginialawreview.org/" href="http://www.virginialawreview.org/" target="_blank">Virginia Law Review</a></strong>, the <strong><a title="http://www.gabar.org/communications/georgia_bar_journal/" href="http://www.gabar.org/communications/georgia_bar_journal/" target="_blank">Georgia Bar Journal</a></strong>, the <strong><a title="http://www.alabar.org/publications/lawyer.cfm" href="http://www.alabar.org/publications/lawyer.cfm" target="_blank">Alabama Lawyer</a></strong>, the <strong><a title="http://www.thefloridalawjournal.com/" href="http://www.thefloridalawjournal.com/" target="_blank">Florida Law Journal</a></strong>, and other publications.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/DeclarationofRightsA1.jpg" alt="Declaration of Rights" align="right" /><br />
In the early 1940’s, Pittman began collecting originals and copies of letters, manuscripts and holographs by, or relative to, <strong><a title="http://www.gunstonhall.org/georgemason/" href="http://www.gunstonhall.org/georgemason/" target="_blank">George Mason of Virginia</a></strong>, author of the <strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights" target="_blank">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a></strong>, June 12 1776, and the<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Virginia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Virginia" target="_blank"> </a><strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Virginia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Virginia" target="_blank">Virginia Constitution</a></strong> of the same year—from which our<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights" target="_blank"> </a><strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights" target="_blank">U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights</a></strong> was derived. Mr. Pittman was considered by many to be an authority on the Bill of Rights and constitutional law pertaining to it.</p>
<p>Mr. Pittman’s article is self definitional as you will understand upon hearing his exceptionally clear understanding of the importance of <strong>The Bill of Rights</strong> and why it is so threatened today in 21st Century America and the entire world, and why it is so relevant to the crisis of consciousness, truth and quality of life that humanity is experiencing in the sea of corruption that engulfs our world today.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/IndependenceHallA1.jpg" alt="Independence Hall" align="left" /><br />

		<itunes:summary>Fresh Perspectives, nbsp;produced by Omni Art Salon Productions, offers listeners around the world the opportunity to hear fascinating, in-depth conversations with authors, scientists, politicians, doctors, academics, innovators, and artists investigating todayrsquo;s most compelling ideas and concepts.


Jeffrey investigates the foundation for freedom and consciousness in the life and work of United States Founder George Mason elucidating upon the precarious nature of his times and how they are so relevant today.nbsp; Included is Jeffreyrsquo;s recitation of an extraordinary article Jeffrey recently came across written by Robert Carter Pittman in 1953 that was originally published in the Autograph Collectorrsquo;s Journal, Spring Convention Edition.

Mr. Pittman was the author of many articles in the field of constitutional law and history, published in the American Bar Association Journal, the Virginia Law Review, the Georgia Bar Journal, the Alabama Lawyer, the Florida Law Journal, and other publications.


In the early 1940rsquo;s, Pittman began collecting originals and copies of letters, manuscripts and holographs by, or relative to, George Mason of Virginia, author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, June 12 1776, and the Virginia Constitution of the same yearmdash;from which our U.S. Constitutionrsquo;s Bill of Rights was derived. Mr. Pittman was considered by many to be an authority on the Bill of Rights and constitutional law pertaining to it.

Mr. Pittmanrsquo;s article is self definitional as you will understand upon hearing his exceptionally clear understanding of the importance of The Bill of Rights and why it is so threatened today in 21st Century America and the entire world, and why it is so relevant to the crisis of consciousness, truth and quality of life that humanity is experiencing in the sea of corruption that engulfs our world today.


It is inspiring to know that against all odds this incredible Bill of Rights which has served as security for the exploration of consciousness and expansion of ideas that have made The United States so extraordinary was somehow saved and eventually embedded in the US Constitution, surviving powerful attacks since itrsquo;s very inception to ensure that those who are doing independent and important work in evolving consciousness will be protected against the forces of greed, corruption and despotism with sometimes a very thin line, but a line that holds firm because it based in the strength of truth.

<p>Produced by Omni Art Salon Productions, Fresh Perspectives with Jeffrey Milburn offers listeners around the world the opportunity to hear fascinating, in-depth conversations with authors, scientists, politicians, doctors, academics, innovators, and artists investigating today’s most compelling ideas and concepts.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s conversation is with veteran television, film and stage actor </strong><a title="http://www.joanvanark.com/" href="http://www.joanvanark.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Joan Van Ark</strong></a><strong>, who is best known to the general public for playing </strong><a title="http://www.answers.com/topic/joan-van-ark" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/joan-van-ark" target="_blank"><strong>Valerie Ewing</strong></a><strong> on one of the longest running and most popular shows ever on Television, </strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_(TV_series)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_(TV_series)" target="_blank"><strong>Dallas</strong></a><strong> and then it&#8217;s spinoff, </strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knots_Landing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knots_Landing" target="_blank"><strong>Knots Landing</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/JoanVanArk2.jpg" alt="Joan Van Ark" align="right" /></p>
<p>Perhaps what many do not know about Joan is that she is an amazingly accopmplished stage actor having entered the world of acting and entertainment at a very early age. Joan was the 2nd youngest student to attend one of the finest acting schools in the world, the <a title="http://drama.yale.edu/" href="http://drama.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale School of Drama</a>, on a scholarship and has a long list of remarkable stage credits for on and off Broadway productions and other venues around the world.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Joan received a </strong><a title="http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/index.html" href="http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/nominees/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Tony nomination</strong></a><strong> for her performance in &#8220;</strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_for_Wives" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_for_Wives" target="_blank"><strong>The School for Wives</strong></a><strong>,&#8221; and she won the </strong><a title="http://www.theatreworldawards.org/home.html" href="http://www.theatreworldawards.org/home.html" target="_blank"><strong>Theater World Award</strong></a><strong> for &#8220;</strong><a title="http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3504" href="http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3504" target="_blank"><strong>The Rules of the Game</strong></a><strong>.&#8221; as well as co-starring in the New York production of </strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Albee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Albee" target="_blank"><strong>Edward Albee&#8217;s</strong></a><strong> </strong><a title="http://www.pulitzer.org/" href="http://www.pulitzer.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Pulitzer Prize</strong></a><strong> winning play  &#8220;</strong><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Tall_Women" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Tall_Women" target="_blank"><strong>Three Tall Women</strong></a><strong>.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/JoanVanArk3.jpg" alt="Joan Van Ark" align="left" /></p>
<p>Joan has had the great fortune to work with some of the most accomplished talent in the world during her extensive career including renowned actors, directors and producers of all stripes. It is not common that an artist can list <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Harris" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Harris" target="_blank">Julie Harris</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Tandy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Tandy" target="_blank">Jessica Tandy</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Cronyn" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Cronyn" target="_blank">Hume Cronyn</a>,<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Caldwell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Caldwell" target="_blank"> Zoe Caldwell</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Nichols" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Nichols" target="_blank">Mike Nichols</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rubinstein" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rubinstein" target="_blank">John Rubenstein</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Chamberlain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Chamberlain" target="_blank">Richard Chamberlain</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_York_(actor)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_York_(actor)" target="_blank">Michael York</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glynis_Johns" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glynis_Johns" target="_blank">Glynis Johns</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Lee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Lee" target="_blank">Michele Lee</a>,<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Dobson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Dobson" target="_blank"> Kevin Dobson</a>, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher" target="_blank">Fran Drescher</a>,<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper" target="_blank"> Dennis Hopper</a>,<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debi_Mazar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debi_Mazar" target="_blank"> Debi Mazar</a>,<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippi_Hedren" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippi_Hedren" target="_blank"> Tippi Hedren</a> and many many others in ones repertoire of co-creation, but that is exactly what Joan can do.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>One of the most interesting things Jeffrey found in researching Joan’s diverse stage credits covering everything from <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" target="_blank">Shakespeare</a> to <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim" target="_blank">Sondheim</a>, was her amazing work in 2004 at the <a title="http://www.kennedy-center.org/" href="http://www.kennedy-center.org/" target="_blank">Kennedy Center</a> in <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." target="_blank">Washington, D.C</a>., where she originated the role of <a title="http://www.curtainup.com/fivebytenn.html" href="http://www.curtainup.com/fivebytenn.html" target="_blank">Mrs. Fenway</a> in &#8220;<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_one-act_plays_by_Tennessee_Williams" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_one-act_plays_by_Tennessee_Williams" target="_blank">Escape</a>,&#8221; part of a world premier of &#8220;<a title="http://www.curtainup.com/fivebytenn.html" href="http://www.curtainup.com/fivebytenn.html" target="_blank">Five by Tenn</a>,&#8221; a collection of newly-found <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" target="_blank">Tennessee Williams</a> one-act plays.  This kind of challenge rarely appears to an actor of any background, and Joan’s 21 minute monologue drew rave reviews, a difficult feat even for the best of the best to attain.</strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/JoanVanArk4.jpg" alt="Joan Van Ark" align="right" /></p>
<p>Joan has won a <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Drama_Critics_Circle_Award" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Drama_Critics_Circle_Award" target="_blank">Los Angeles Drama Critics Award</a>, been nominated for a <a title="http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/index.html" href="http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/index.html" target="_blank">Tony</a>, been featured on the biographical program,<a title="http://www.mylifetime.com/" href="http://www.mylifetime.com/" target="_blank"> &#8220;Intimate Portrait,&#8221; on Lifetime</a>, won the<a title="http://www.theatreworldawards.org/home.html" href="http://www.theatreworldawards.org/home.html" target="_blank"> Theater World Award</a>, a<a title="http://www.ladramacriticscircle.com/awards.htm" href="http://www.ladramacriticscircle.com/awards.htm" target="_blank"> Los Angeles Drama Critics Award</a>, earned six nominations and two <a title="http://www.soapoperadigest.com/Emmys/" href="http://www.soapoperadigest.com/Emmys/" target="_blank">Soap Opera Digest Awards</a> for Best Actress, and in 1997, Joan directed a short documentary on homelessness and domestic violence for the<a title="http://www.dga.org/index2.php3?chg=" href="http://www.dga.org/index2.php3?chg=" target="_blank"> Directors Guild of Americ</a>a, which was nominated for an <a title="http://www.emmys.tv/" href="http://www.emmys.tv/" target="_blank">Emmy</a>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The greatest achievement for any individual living in the cultural cauldron of Hollywood is longevity and depth. Joan has more than achieved both of these and in the mix has not only managed to remain married to her high school sweetheart, <a title="http://www.laradio.com/wherem.htm" href="http://www.laradio.com/wherem.htm" target="_blank">John Marshall</a>, an award winning TV newsman in his own right, but also has raised a daughter, <a title="http://www.vanessamarshall.com/" href="http://www.vanessamarshall.com/" target="_blank">Vanessa Marshall</a>, who is an accomplished actress, director and comedian.</strong></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; width: 150px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/JoanVanArk5.jpg" alt="Joan Van Ark" align="left" /></p>
<p>We think you will find Jeffrey’s conversation with Joan who has been in the center of the Hollywood hotbed for years most fascinating and uplifting as you hear what kind of commitment and courage it requires to achieve her kind of success, especially amidst the unrelenting  examination certain elements in the press devote towards those who have risen to the top.  Joan also describes her personal experience with recently assassinated Hollywood publicist <a title="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ronni-chasen-laid-rest-emotional-47922" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ronni-chasen-laid-rest-emotional-47922" target="_blank">Ronni Chasen</a>, another example of the fierce winds that come with a rarified life.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Hearing how Joan handles challenges, the unknown and ensuing fear vividly brought to our attention what <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Williamson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Williamson" target="_blank">Marianne Williamson</a> said so beautifully about this subject in 1992 in this quote:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.&#8217; We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There&#8217;s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won&#8217;t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It&#8217;s not just in some of us; it&#8217;s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we&#8217;re liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.&#8221;</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>And it is exactly this kind of liberation that Joan Van Ark so clearly demonstrates that is both inspirational and encouraging for anyone whose life is steep . As an artist who has never backed down in the face of difficulty, Joan’s very being leaves one with the impression that quite literally anything is possible with enough focus, determination, perseverance and of course most importantly, love.</strong></p>

		<itunes:summary>Produced by Omni Art Salon Productions, Fresh Perspectives with Jeffrey Milburn offers listeners around the world the opportunity to hear fascinating, in-depth conversations with authors, scientists, politicians, doctors, academics, innovators, and artists investigating todayrsquo;s most compelling ideas and concepts.

 

Today's conversation is with veteran television, film and stage actor Joan Van Ark, who is best known to the general public for playing Valerie Ewing on one of the longest running and most popular shows ever on Television, Dallas and then it's spinoff, Knots Landing. 



Perhaps what many do not know about Joan is that she is an amazingly accopmplished stage actor having entered the world of acting and entertainment at a very early age. Joan was the 2nd youngest student to attend one of the finest acting schools in the world, the Yale School of Drama, on a scholarship and has a long list of remarkable stage credits for on and off Broadway productions and other venues around the world.

 

Joan received a Tony nomination for her performance in "The School for Wives," and she won the Theater World Award for "The Rules of the Game." as well as co-starring in the New York production of Edward Albee's Pulitzer Prize winning playnbsp; "Three Tall Women." 



Joan has had the great fortune to work with some of the most accomplished talent in the world during her extensive career including renowned actors, directors and producers of all stripes. It is not common that an artist can list Julie Harris, Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, Zoe Caldwell, Mike Nichols, John Rubenstein, Richard Chamberlain, Michael York, Glynis Johns, Michele Lee, Kevin Dobson, Fran Drescher, Dennis Hopper, Debi Mazar, Tippi Hedren and many many others in ones repertoire of co-creation, but that is exactly what Joan can do.

 

One of the most interesting things Jeffrey found in researching Joanrsquo;s diverse stage credits covering everything from Shakespeare to Sondheim, was her amazing work in 2004 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., where she originated the role of Mrs. Fenway in "Escape," part of a world premier of "Five by Tenn," a collection of newly-found Tennessee Williams one-act plays.nbsp; This kind of challenge rarely appears to an actor of any background, and Joanrsquo;s 21 minute monologue drew rave reviews, a difficult feat even for the best of the best to attain.



Joan has won a Los Angeles Drama Critics Award, been nominated for a Tony, been featured on the biographical program, "Intimate Portrait," on Lifetime, won the Theater World Award, a Los Angeles Drama Critics Award, earned six nominations and two Soap Opera Digest Awards for Best Actress, and in 1997, Joan directed a short documentary on homelessness and domestic violence for the Directors Guild of America, which was nominated for an Emmy.

 

The greatest achievement for any individual living in the cultural cauldron of Hollywood is longevity and depth. Joan has more than achieved both of these and in the mix has not only managed to remain married to her high school sweetheart, John Marshall, annbsp;award winning TV newsman in his own right, but also has raised a daughter, Vanessa Marshall, who is an accomplished actress, director and comedian.



We think you will find Jeffreyrsquo;s conversation with Joan who has been in the center of the Hollywood hotbed for years most fascinating and uplifting as you hear what kind of commitment and courage it requires to achieve her kind of success, especially amidst the unrelentingnbsp; examination certain elements in the press devote towards those who have risen to the top.nbsp; Joan also describes her personal experience with recently assassinated Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen, another example of the fierce winds that come with a rarified life.

 

Hearing how Joan handles challenges, the unknown and ensuing fear vividly brought to our attention what Marianne Williamson said so be...</itunes:summary>

Jeffrey&#8217;s  amazing conversation with<a title="http://www.fwii.net/profile/KarenRedHawkDallett" href="http://www.fwii.net/profile/KarenRedHawkDallett" target="_blank"><strong> Karen RedHawk Dallett</strong></a>, an expert communicator on behalf of the<strong> International Film Community</strong>, <strong>The Indigenous Peoples of North and South America</strong>, and a creative entrepreneur who has had impact on so many lives and so many issues of our time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/RedhawkD1.jpg"><img class="alignright alignnone size-medium wp-image-851" style="float: right;" title="Linked Hands" src="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/RedhawkD1.jpg" alt="Linked Hands" /></a><br />
Karen has been in the art of storytelling throughout her lifetime. Born into the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catawba_(tribe)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catawba_(tribe)" target="_blank">Catawba Tribe</a> her great grandmother married a Scotsman and from that point forward storytelling was instilled in her nature when she began acting in theater at the age of 7. Architecture and archeology became her professional focus, as she began to understand societal footprints on the environment. This study brought a focus on cultural storytelling and it’s affects on contemporary indigenous cultures and the environment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/RedhawkA1.jpg"><img class="alignleft alignnone size-medium wp-image-849" style="float: left;" title="Sun Dance Film Festival" src="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/RedhawkA1.jpg" alt="Sun Dance Film Festival" /></a><br />
Most recently, Karen owned a bookstore in Park City and from 2002-09 was Utah’s <strong><a title="http://www.sundanceresort.com/" href="http://www.sundanceresort.com/" target="_blank">Sundance Resort</a> </strong>literary programming coordinator; launched <strong><a title="http://www.npr.org/" href="http://www.npr.org/" target="_blank">NPR’s</a></strong> program, <strong><a title="http://www.kpcw.org/this-green-earth" href="http://www.kpcw.org/this-green-earth" target="_blank">This Green Earth</a></strong>, which she executive directed and hosted; and created a <a title="http://www.nativenetworks.si.edu/eng/blue/nafvf_09.htm" href="http://www.nativenetworks.si.edu/eng/blue/nafvf_09.htm" target="_blank">Native American film festival</a> in New Mexico and has worked with <strong><a title="http://www.santafefilmfestival.com/" href="http://www.santafefilmfestival.com/" target="_blank">NM film festivals</a>,</strong> as a consultant and executive, in Santa Fe, where she now resides.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, Karen is writing and developing indigenous film projects and has recently returned from <a title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/21/bolivias-peoples-conferen_n_546310.html" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/21/bolivias-peoples-conferen_n_546310.html" target="_blank">Cochabamba Bolivia and the World People&#8217;s Conference on Climate Change</a> and Protecting Mother Earth and is an active participant in the US Caucus for this group.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/RedhawkB1.jpg"><img class="alignright alignnone size-medium wp-image-851" style="float: right;" title="Santa Fe Film Festival" src="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/RedhawkB1.jpg" alt="Santa Fe Film Festival" /></a><br />
We think you will find Jeffrey&#8217;s conversation with Karen  remarkably informative and comprehensive as a social, economic and spiritual sage articulates so many of the most pressing issues that affect not only the indigenous peoples of the world but humankind as a whole.  This is especially true given the incredibly tragic oil spill catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico that highlights beyond a shadow of a doubt the precarious position that humanity is in as the accountability and responsibility for our environment takes the center stage of our cultural and economic public dialogue.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/RedhawkE1.jpg"><img class="alignleft alignnone size-medium wp-image-849" style="float: left;" title="Festival" src="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/RedhawkE1.jpg" alt="Festival" /></a><br />
It is a complete delight to hear this conversation with such far reaching importance and historical significance seen through Native American perspective’s rarely given any attention in the media.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Jeffrey'snbsp; amazing conversation with Karen RedHawk Dallett, an expert communicator on behalf of the International Film Community, The Indigenous Peoples of North and South America, and a creative entrepreneur who has had impact on so many lives and so many issues of our time.


Karen has been in the art of storytelling throughout her lifetime. Born into the Catawba Tribe her great grandmother married a Scotsman and from that point forward storytelling was instilled in her nature when she began acting in theater at the age of 7. Architecture and archeology became her professional focus, as she began to understand societal footprints on the environment. This study brought a focus on cultural storytelling and itrsquo;s affects on contemporary indigenous cultures and the environment.


Most recently, Karen owned a bookstore in Park City and from 2002-09 was Utahrsquo;s Sundance Resort literary programming coordinator; launched NPRrsquo;s program, This Green Earth, which she executive directed and hosted; and created a Native American film festival in New Mexico and has worked with NM film festivals, as a consultant and executive, in Santa Fe, where she now resides.

Currently, Karen is writing and developing indigenous film projects and has recently returned from Cochabamba Bolivia and the World People's Conference on Climate Change and Protecting Mother Earth and is an active participant in the US Caucus for this group.


We think you will find Jeffrey's conversation with Karennbsp; remarkably informative and comprehensive as a social, economic and spiritual sage articulates so many of the most pressing issues that affect not only the indigenous peoples of the world but humankind as a whole.nbsp; This is especially true given the incredibly tragic oil spill catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico that highlights beyond a shadow of a doubt the precarious position that humanity is in as the accountability and responsibility for our environment takes the center stage of our cultural and economic public dialogue.


It is a complete delight to hear this conversation with such far reaching importance and historical significance seen through Native American perspectiversquo;s rarely given any attention in the media.

Jeffrey’s lovely conversation with <strong>Marta MacBeth</strong> who has been making trips to Costa Rica to<a title="http://www.wilddolphinjourneys.com/" href="http://www.wilddolphinjourneys.com/" target="_blank"> <strong>swim with the dolphins</strong></a> and engage with them through music and drumming for many years. Marta tells her amazing stories of her developed relationship with dolphins and how they are teaching all of us the deeper side of the interconnectedness of life through unconditional love.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marta says that Dolphins have been calling to her for a long time in her dreams and that the first time she swam with them she experienced an unconditional love that was so unique that it was simply indescribable.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/dolphinshead.jpg"><img class="alignright alignnone size-medium wp-image-851" style="float: right;" title="dolphins" src="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/dolphinshead.jpg" alt="dolphins" /></a><br />
Marta’s focus and priority has been to travel the world, explore many cultures and to create extraordinary memories for others, so she and the love of her life, Craig, have co-created the<strong> <a title="http://www.wilddolphinjourneys.com/" href="http://www.wilddolphinjourneys.com/" target="_blank">dolphin tours</a> </strong>and have been leading drumming and dolphin tours for many years in Costa Rica.  The joy of communicating with dolphins through drumming is so compelling and spell binding that Marta and Craig are always opening these tours up to others who would also like to experience unbounded dolphin joy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/MartaC1.jpg"><img class="alignleft alignnone size-medium wp-image-849" style="float: left;" title="dolphins" src="http://www.omniartsalon.com/wp-content/uploads/MartaC1.jpg" alt="dolphins" /></a><br />
We think you will find Jeffrey’s conversation with Marta a fascinating glimpse into another aspect of the love and consciousness that permeates our beautiful planet on so many levels and in so many kingdoms and realms for those who have the heart and eyes to see and hear.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Jeffrey’s wonderful conversation with <strong>Marge Klemp</strong> who has been a member of <a title="http://www.eckankar.org/" href="http://www.eckankar.org/" target="_blank"><strong>ECKANKAR</strong> </a> for 40 years.<img src="file:///Users/jeffrey/Desktop/MargeKlemp1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In those 40 years Marge has had many remarkable experiences both with the founder of the modern day teachings of Eckankar, <a title="http://www.eckankar.org/Masters/Peddar/hisStory.html" href="http://www.eckankar.org/Masters/Peddar/hisStory.html" target="_blank"><strong>Paul Twitchell</strong></a>, and then through her former marriage to the present leader of Eckankar, <a title="http://www.eckankar.org/Harold/" href="http://www.eckankar.org/Harold/" target="_blank"><strong>Harold Klemp</strong></a> who currently serves as the <a title="http://www.eckankar.org/Harold/bioinfo.html" href="http://www.eckankar.org/Harold/bioinfo.html" target="_blank"><strong>Mahanta, The Living ECK Master</strong></a> with whom she had a daughter.</p>
<p>The Modern day teachings of Eckankar were originally inspired and compiled by Paul Twitchell who served as the <strong>Mahanta, The Living ECK Master</strong> from 1965 through 1972.  These foundational writings revealed much about this 95,000 year old spiritual path having a tremendous impact for this modern age. Harold Klemp, the current leader of Eckankar is also a prolific writer, and has been steadily adding to this extraordinary  pool of realization of the Divine for the last 28 years with many books describing everyday experiences that ordinary people have with the source of all life.<br />
<strong><br />
Today, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckankar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckankar" target="_blank">Eckankar is the Religion of The Light and Sound</a> with students and members all over the world. </strong></p>
<p>Over the last 40 years Marge has traveled on behalf of Eckankar to roughly 39 countries, all over the United States and to several provinces in Canada to meet with Eckankar members and to speak to others about the ECK teachings.</p>
<p>Graduating from the <a title="http://www.colorado.edu/" href="http://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>University of Colorado</strong></a> with a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Political Science with a concentration in International Affairs, Marge has spent a lot of time researching the historical impact of religion on society which is very evident in our conversation as she speaks about her personal experience with her childhood religion of Mormonism and the impact it had on her spiritual search.</p>
<p>Marge is also a writer who loves to study historical law with a keen eye for detail and how human affairs are impacted by the subtleties and reality of other dimensions.</p>
<p>An avid researcher,  writer, and grandmother of three, Marge is currently working on a book about her remarkable childhood and experiences with her family which I’m sure will yield many valuable insights.</p>
<p><strong>We think you will find Jeffrey’s conversation with Marge fascinating, informative, inspirational, very real and a rare glimpse into the core of how the Divine actually works towards the upliftment of consciousness for the betterment of all.</strong></p>
<p>We also want to mention that we have remodeled the webpage and today’s show is an introduction of new theme music by musician and composer <a title="http://www.davidyoungmusic.com/" href="http://www.davidyoungmusic.com/" target="_blank"><strong>David Young</strong></a> whom many of you will may remember has been on the show.  The new theme music by David is called<a title="http://www.davidyoungmusic.com/" href="http://www.davidyoungmusic.com/" target="_blank"> <strong><em>Song of a HU </em></strong></a>and its available at Davids website which you can get to by clicking on the banner ad with David on the upper right hand side of this website.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Jeffrey's has a deep and revealing conversation with Dr. Andrew Lange  about his book Getting At The Root  (Treating the Deepest Source of Disease).

This book explores a medical approach that transcends pharmacy, surgery, and new technologies with more vital, archetypal medicines such as homeopathy, osteopathy, and alchemy.

Andrew served as Chair of the Department of Homeopathic Medicine and Supervising Clinical Physician at Bastyr University in Seattle. He has also taught internationally and served on the faculty of the College of Homeopathy in London. Today he maintains a private practice in Boulder, Colorado.

We think you will find Jeffrey's conversation with Andrew most informative and thought provoking challenging many assumptions individuals maintain from both the allopathic and homeopathic paradigms. The future of health and healing will only improve when we embrace the approach that focuses on the fundamental laws of cure that really work, regardless of the disease or technique.
