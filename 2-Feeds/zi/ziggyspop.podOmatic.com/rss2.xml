    <description>Our Goal is to showcase the wide range of talent from around the sphere. 

On Iguana's Indie Artists Podcast you will hear what we believe, to be a great cross-section of Independent Artists, some that need an avenue to get their music heard for the first time, some that are on the cusp of major success and others that are enjoying national, even International exposure.

Our mission is to give Independent artists a way to promote their musical talent to a wider audience....the world.

Justice William O. Douglas, quotes about Vigilance:  
As nightfall does not come all at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. And it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air - however slight - lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.

Today's Closing Quotes &quot;Vigillance&quot;

Thomas Jefferson, quotes about Vigilance:  
It is a great importance to set a resolution, not to be shaken, never to tell an untruth. There is no vice so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible and he who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, till at length it becomes habitual, he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world's believing him. This falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time depraves all it's good dispositions.
more Thomas Jefferson quotes

Barry Goldwater, quotes about Vigilance:  How did it happen? How did our national government grow from a servant with sharply limited powers into a master with virtually unlimited power? In part, we were swindled. There are occasions when we have elevated men and political parties to power that promised to restore limited government and then proceeded, after their election, to expand the activities of government. But let us be honest with ourselves. Broken promises are not the major causes of our trouble. Kept promises are. All too often we have put men in office who have suggested spending a little more on this, a little more on that, who have proposed a new welfare program, who have thought of another variety of 'security.' We have taken the bait, preferring to put off to another day the recapture of freedom and the restoration of our constitutional system. We have gone the way of many a democratic society that has lost its freedom by persuading itself that if 'the people' rule, all is well.
more Barry Goldwater quotes
Abraham Lincoln, quotes about Vigilance:  Let it [the Constitution] be taught in schools, seminaries and in colleges; let it be written in primers, in spelling books and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, enforced in courts of justice. In short, let it become the political religion of the nation.
more Abraham Lincoln quotes
William J. Small, quotes about Vigilance:  As Hitler showed us, a press suppressed does not make a recovery. As Lenin indicated, a press controlled does not revert to a critic&#8217;s role. As history reminds us, free speech surrendered is rarely recovered.
more William J. Small quotes
George Washington, quotes about Vigilance:  Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.
more George Washington quotes
Daniel Webster, quotes about Vigilance:  I apprehend no danger to our country from a foreign foe ... Our destruction, should it come at all, will be from another quarter. -- From the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government, from their carelessness and negligence, I must confess that I do apprehend some danger. I fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants, and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct; that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men, and become the instruments of their own undoing. Make them intelligent, and they will be vigilant; give them the means of detecting the wrong, and they will apply the remedy.
more Daniel Webster quotes

      <title>10-27-06 Ziggyspop  Purely Political Pack Episode 19a</title>
      <description>EPISODE 19A - Purely Political 5 Pack

Our First 2 Tracks came courtesy my addiction to  the AFI Podcast.
http://allflorida.blogspot.com/

AKIR - Politricks

In addition to AKIR's vast exposure to varied East Coast flavors, his lyrical influences include: the finesse of SLICK RICK, the mellow vibe and consistent originality of Q-TIP, the smooth delivery and GQ style of BIG DADDY KANE,the rapid fire flow and intensity of KOOL G RAP and, the lyricism of RAKIM.	

AKIR- The Initiation

THE MAJESTIC TWELVE - Are You Ready

A band from Wilmington, NC, USA who try hard not to suck. Independent anti-scene scenesters who are also guilty of organizing music festivals, dressing up in funny outfits for no reason, and generally keeping themselves passionately entertained at any cost.
