            <title>Matrix Energetics with Dr. Richard Bartlett (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>

            <description>On this episode of the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Dr. Richard Bartlett about Matrix Energetics©. It has been Dr. Bartlett’s burning desire for many years to push the envelope until he came up with a teachable system that people from all walks of life could use for themselves, not just a few select or “gifted” people. Not just health practitioners but people with no previous experience as well. Dr. Bartlett worked to develop a system that produced observable and verifiable changes and which could be taught to others as easily as any other life skill. Matrix Energetics© encompasses a new state of mind, a new way of looking at the world we live and breathe in, and a new way of reaching out to new possibilities, a consciousness shift. According to modern physicists, all reality can be described as vibrations and waveforms where everything is light and information. We chose the “matrix” name because we enter into a unique morphic field when we do this work. One can imagine it much like a lattice of information, and one learns to reach into the lattice and change that information. Often in a seminar the unconscious mind is the student and the logical mind has to take a breather. Then the logical mind gets its time to be happy as we explore the science behind the “magic.” Matrix Energetics© is dedicated to bringing this new consciousness shift and personal power of transformation and healing to as many people as possible. When people can observe and see for themselves verifiable physical changes rapidly as happens when using Matrix Energetics, it helps them to accept these new possibilities and makes it real for them.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>The Reader of Hearts with Darrin Owens  (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show) </title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/Nci7AOfSW10/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On this episode of the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Darrin Owens. In 2011 Darrin experienced a transformation in his personal and spiritual life. After a regression with famed, past life therapist, Dolores Cannon, he retained powerful memories of a lifetime with Queen Elizabeth I. This regression was a catalyst and doorway to establish a new level of his spiritual work with “Gloriana” the consciousness and intelligence of the Divine Feminine. Darrin also stands on the foundations of “A Course in Miracles” and the work of Edgar Cayce in his spiritual teaching and practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darrin is on a mission to help others embrace their spirituality with his book “Reader of Hearts: The Life and Teachings of a Reluctant Psychic”. According to Darrin, being a psychic isn’t just about “knowing things”; it is also a spiritual practice. This lively, entertaining book offers seven lessons of the spiritual path — including spiritual awakening; conscious creation; attunement; and inner guidance — and relates stories from Darrin’s life to illustrate them. Each chapter addresses one of the lessons and includes exercises, prayers, guided meditations, and affirmations. By turns both humorous and poignant, the book offers wisdom and guidance for readers just discovering their spiritual connections and those already accomplished in psychic and spiritual skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <itunes:summary>On this episode of the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Darrin Owens. In 2011 Darrin experienced a transformation in his personal and spiritual life. After a regression with famed, past life therapist, Dolores Cannon, he retained powerful memories of a lifetime with Queen Elizabeth I. This regression was a catalyst and doorway to establish a new level of his spiritual work with “Gloriana” the consciousness and intelligence of the Divine Feminine. Darrin also stands on the foundations of “A Course in Miracles” and the work of Edgar Cayce in his spiritual teaching and practice.

Darrin is on a mission to help others embrace their spirituality with his book “Reader of Hearts: The Life and Teachings of a Reluctant Psychic”. According to Darrin, being a psychic isn’t just about “knowing things”; it is also a spiritual practice. This lively, entertaining book offers seven lessons of the spiritual path — including spiritual awakening; conscious creation; attunement; and inner guidance — and relates stories from Darrin’s life to illustrate them. Each chapter addresses one of the lessons and includes exercises, prayers, guided meditations, and affirmations. By turns both humorous and poignant, the book offers wisdom and guidance for readers just discovering their spiritual connections and those already accomplished in psychic and spiritual skills. </itunes:summary>

            <description>On this episode of The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Dayna Winters, Patricia Gardner and Angela Kaufman about their book: Wicca: What’s the Real Deal? Breaking Through the Misconceptions of Wicca. Witches are everywhere! You can find them in your local schools, workplace, or community. They are your friends, colleagues, neighbors, and sometimes family members. But what do you really know about them? Break through your misconceptions with this groundbreaking, comprehensive guide showcasing Wicca and Witchcraft, written in a simple myth/truth format. Three Witches, elders in the pagan community, take on Wiccan-related fallacies still present in society today. They invite Wiccans to come out of the broom closet and they encourage understanding of the tenets of Wicca by those just interested in learning about the basics. This book will serve as a tool for parents and family members who seek to appreciate a loved one’s religious choices, and it will help those seeking to separate the truth about modern Witchcraft from centuries of misinformation.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/_0fDeLlO78o/</link>
            <description>On this episode of the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Jillian Chantal, author of The Gambler (Desert Breeze Publishing). In 1937, Dirk McSwain, known as The Gambler, makes his living on the turn of a card. When his family home is in jeopardy of being lost, he boards the Queen Mary ocean liner, playground of both royalty and the wealthy alike. He hopes to win big to save his property. He meets three beautiful, unchaperoned Irish sisters the first day at sea and determines to deprive them of some of their fortune. What he doesn’t count on is an obnoxious passenger accusing him of cheating at cards and then dying the next morning. At the captain’s request, he teams up with one of the sisters who has a psychic gift. The story is her journey to the acceptance of that gift.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Sally Dubats about her novel, The Grimoire Chronicles: Veil Between Worlds. Cassie is a teenage Witch with a problem — her memory was stolen. She blames astral projection; unplanned out-of-body experiences that induce amnesia happen when life gets ugly. Cassie does what any Witch would do; she casts a spell to remember. The magick sparks a mind-blowing adventure to another dimension where anything is possible, supernatural beings abound, and a dangerous romance blossoms with the very mysterious Trenton. But Trenton is hiding terrible secrets, and Cassie suspects that he just might be the one who ripped a hole in her memory. The Witches’ New Year looms, and the veil between our world and the next grows thin. Time is running out, and Cassie delves deeply into the highest arts of Witchcraft to discover the terrifying truth… and to survive. Will Cassie be trapped between worlds? With Trenton? Forever?&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Tasting the Universe with Maureen Seaberg (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/Km5jccu4_OM/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Maureen Seaberg about Synesthesia. A violinist sees a scarlet form when he plays a certain note; a rock star sees waves of blue and green as she composes a ballad; an actress tastes cake when she utters the word “table.” This fascinating mingling of the senses is called “synesthesia,” and the people who possess this amazing gift are called “synesthetes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synesthesia is scientifically described as a cross-wiring, or lack of chemical inhibition, between brain neurons that occurs in about five percent of the population, often among “creatives”–musicians, artists, actors, writers, and so on. Scientific research is currently being conducted throughout the world to discover more about this condition. However, experts in the fields of spirituality and quantum physics are convinced that the truth of synesthesia lies not only within traditional science, but also within the realm of the mystical and the ineffable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step into Maureen’s glittering alternate universe as she explores this fascinating subject, combining clear explanations of groundbreaking scientific research with an exploration of deeper spiritual truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasting the Universe explains and explores:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Why survivors of near-death experiences sometimes “return” with this amazing gift.
&lt;br /&gt;    * Why all infants are believed to be synesthetes until four months of age.
&lt;br /&gt;    * The experiences of famous synesthetes such as Itzhak Perlman, Billy Joel, Pharrell Williams, and Marilyn Monroe (whose biographer, Norman Mailer, first asserted that she possessed this gift).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Maureen, synesthesia is not an idle “brain tick” that can be explained away by science (although it does offer some important clues), but a unique and ineffable ability to tap into and reveal a greater creative universe and even the divine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Lightning Shaman with Dannion Brinkley (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/2XuxMjj-hag/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Dannion Brinkley. Dannion’s expertise in the area of death and dying has educated millions not to fear the presently held concept of transition from this world to the next. As a result of his journeys to the ‘other side’ and back again, he brings to the forefront the wondrous truth that there is indeed no such thing as death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dannion has survived insurmountable odds including two lightning strikes, open-heart surgery, brain surgery and a massive grand mal seizure. Many concur that Mr. Brinkley is a truly one of the world’s most incredible near-dear survivors, truly a “walking miracle”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In related issues surrounding the death process, Brinkley is one of the early crusaders of hospice and palliative care bringing the topic of end of life care to the forefront of discussion and education in America. Dannion created a non-profit organization, The Twilight Brigade (Compassion in action) to recruit hospice volunteers for dying Veterans. He has been a hospice volunteer for over twenty-seven years, having personally accrued more than 18,000 hours at the bedside. These decades of tremendous hands-on experience qualify him as a leading expert in the grief and bereavement process as well as being an authority in the field of necrophobic reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Difficult People with Lisette Larkins (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/GnT2un9v2og/</link>
            <description>On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Lisette Larkins about her book, Difficult People: A Gateway to Enlightenment. For most of us, difficult people are the bane of our existence. They annoy us, they throw us off balance, they test our patience, and—to one degree or another—they provoke reactions that are decidedly unhealthy. But it is also true that difficult people (DPs) mirror our own dysfunctional mental states and provide us with wonderful opportunities to understand ourselves, heal ourselves, and learn to live in the moment. Lisette Larkins realized the positive aspect of dealing with difficult people when she was providing care for a late-stage Alzheimer’s patient. Through daily interactions with a DP, Larkins began a personal journey of exploration that ultimately led to spiritual awakening. In Difficult People: A Gateway to Enlightenment, Larkins shares her journey and guides readers in reaching a “chronic state of well-being.”&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Alice and Richard Matzkin. Painter Alice Matzkin and her sculptor husband, Richard, contemplate growing older in their nearly 100 paintings and sculptures. In their award winning book, The Art of Aging, painter Alice Matzkin and sculptor Richard Matzkin share the wisdom of elder mentors to look for the positive side of growing older and to come to acceptance and appreciation of their aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this beautiful and touching book, a couple – painter Alice Matzkin and sculptor Richard Matzkin – explore the experience of aging through their art. In a series of projects that confront their fear and curiosity about growing old, they examine physical changes, sensuality and relationships, aging parents, spirituality and death. Drawing on their personal experiences and the wisdom of older mentors, they conclude that the elder years can be a time of ripening and harvest rather than stagnation and despair. Their art features well-known people such as feminist Betty Friedan and potter Beatrice Wood, as well as friends, neighbors, relatives and themselves. Both artists find a source of creativity in the older nude body. This profusely illustrated book contains a wealth of inspiration, especially for those about to enter their later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Timothy Wyllie, author of The Return of the Rebel Angels: The Urantia Mysteries and the Coming of the Light. As recorded in The Urantia Book, two hundred millennia ago 37 planets, including our own, were quarantined from the rest of the Multiverse to quell the spread of the rebellion within the angelic hierarchy. Now, after eons of isolation, the fallen angels have been forgiven and Earth’s connection with the Multiverse is being restored, initiating a massive transformation of consciousness as we reconnect with angelic guides, extraterrestrial beings, and our spiritual heritage as sacred vessels for God’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing an update to The Urantia Book through angelic transmissions he has received and remarkable spirits he has met, Timothy Wyllie investigates the underlying motives of the angelic rebellion and the impact it has had on our planet for the past 200,000 years. Offering a profoundly optimistic vision of the future and reassurance that the coming spiritual transition will be gentle, Timothy Wyllie describes his encounters with angels, ETs, and other enlightened beings around the world, including how he made contact with his own guardian angels, met the man who may have been Grand Master of the Prieure de Zion, fell in love with a beautiful Cathar reincarnate in Provence, and officiated at the 1981 Conference in Spirit inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. He explores different planetary cosmologies, authentic extraterrestrial intelligence, entheogenic revelations, and the spiritual implications of the Holographic Paradigm, weaving together a coherent and provocative understanding of the current state of our planet within the larger context of a benevolent and caring Multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Exploring Fate and Free Will with Marie Jones (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/x0wIzGaSo_I/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On this episode of the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with author Marie Jones about her book, Destiny vs Choice: The Scientific and Spiritual Evidence Behind Fate and Free Will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the day we are born, we are bombarded with the contradictory claims that our lives are predestined and that Fate deals us the cards we must play, or that our lives are the results of our choices and that we shape it as we go along. Destiny vs. Choice examines the philosophical, spiritual, and scientific evidence for both claims, and shows us how we can live better, more fulfilling lives no matter which side ultimately “wins” the debate. The book explores the historical battle between Fate and free will, Intelligent design, evolution, the Big Bang, and DNA as blueprints for life, The Law of Attraction, intention, and consciousness as ways to create reality, how quantum physics offers evidence for both destiny and choice and Fate and the paranormal: ghosts, life-after-death experiences, and astrology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Kari Samuels about numerology and how numbers can teach us about our relationship with others. According to Kari, numerology is an ancient tool that is easy to understand. By learning the universal language of numbers, you can find more information about what your birth date reveals about your gifts, talents, and abilities, karmic lessons, fate and destiny and the best timing for important events.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Mark Romero, an internationally known energy healer, guitarist, and teacher who has helped thousands of people worldwide to experience instantaneous healings and shifts in their perceptions. More people are experiencing exponential growth in inner peace, clarity, and focus simply by immersing themselves in the vibrant, rich rhythms that so beautifully sooth the soul and enrich the spirit. Through his transformational music, Mark channels higher frequencies of energy to assist humanity in eliminating limiting thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions that are holding us back from the lives we truly desire. CEOs and top executives swear by his music as a tool to help them effectively deal with stress, remain grounded, and expand the portals to more creativity. Mark has worked with Dr. Bruce Lipton, Marianne Williamson, T. Harv Eker, and Mark Victor Hansen to name a few. Audiences have positively received his shows, which are an extremely unique combination of insight, live musical performance, and colorful narrative.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/oifuo-o-rmM/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>On this episode of Explore Your Spirit, Kala speaks with author Patricia Damery about her book, Farming Soul. A psychological and spiritual reckoning, 'Farming Soul' questions theories and assumptions that date back to the early 1900's and the days of Freud, assumptions which have too often separated spirituality from psychology. One strand of 'Farming Soul' is about redeveloping a relationship to the land-Mother Earth-being rooted in a particular place and being guided by the tenets of Rudolf Steiner's Biodynamic(TM) agriculture. Another strand is about Patricia Damery's professional path of becoming a Jungian analyst, which includes an exploration of four aspects of the body: the physical, the etheric, the astral, and the mental. Farming Soul is a courageous offering that will help reconnect us to our deeper selves, the often untouched realities of soul, and at the same time ground us in our physical relationship to self and Mother Earth.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Discover Your Emotional Type with Dr. Marc Micozzi and Mike Jawer (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/Xv64QxOMQQ0/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Dr. Marck Micozzi and Michael Jower about their new book, Your Emotional Type. Different people process their feelings in different ways--your emotional style is a fundamental aspect of who you are. It affects more than just your outlook on life; it can affect your well-being as well. Many chronic ailments are not the result of germs or genes but are rooted in our emotional biology. The link between emotional type and health explains why modern medicine--which views treatment as “one size fits all”--often fails to successfully treat chronic pain and illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the interplay of emotions, chronic illness and pain, and treatment success, Michael Jawer and Dr. Marc Micozzi reveal how chronic conditions are intrinsically linked to certain emotional types and how these ailments are best treated by choosing a healing therapy in line with your type. Explaining the emotional ties behind the 12 most common chronic illnesses--asthma, allergies, chronic fatigue, depression, fibromyalgia, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcers--the authors provide an easy assessment survey that allows you to identify your emotional type as well as the ailments to which you are susceptible.

            <itunes:subtitle>Discover Your Emotional Type with Dr. Marc Micozzi and Mike Jawer </itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>On this episode of Explore Your Spirit with Kala, Kala speaks with Dr. Marck Micozzi and Michael Jower about their new book, Your Emotional Type. Different people process their feelings in different ways--your emotional style is a fundamental aspect of who you are. It affects more than just your outlook on life; it can affect your well-being as well. Many chronic ailments are not the result of germs or genes but are rooted in our emotional biology. The link between emotional type and health explains why modern medicine--which views treatment as “one size fits all”--often fails to successfully treat chronic pain and illness.

Examining the interplay of emotions, chronic illness and pain, and treatment success, Michael Jawer and Dr. Marc Micozzi reveal how chronic conditions are intrinsically linked to certain emotional types and how these ailments are best treated by choosing a healing therapy in line with your type. Explaining the emotional ties behind the 12 most common chronic illnesses--asthma, allergies, chronic fatigue, depression, fibromyalgia, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcers--the authors provide an easy assessment survey that allows you to identify your emotional type as well as the ailments to which you are susceptible. Extending this connection between mind and body, they assess 7 alternative healing therapies--acupuncture, hypnosis, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, guided imagery, and relaxation techniques--and indicate which methods work best for each emotional type. Empowering you as a patient to seek out the therapies that will work best for you, this book offers a welcome path to effective pain relief and sustainable health. </itunes:summary>

            <description>Kala speaks with Gillian Holloway, author of The Complete Dream Book: Discover What Your Dreams Reveal About You and Your Life. The average person will dream over 150,000 dreams in a lifetime--each one a complex web of imagery and deeper meaning. The Complete Dream Book uses the interpretation of 28,000 actual dreams from contemporary dreamers, just like you, to help you access the substance and meaning of your own dreams. Discover Who's who in your dreams, Which dreams recur during certain life stages, The true meaning behind your nightmares, Why you have certain dreams again and again, How to tell if a dream is worth interpreting--and if you've done it correctly and the phenomenon of precognitive dreams. The Complete Dream Book is the only dream interpretation book based on concrete data about real people's dreams and how the real events in their lives relate to their nighttime visions.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;On this episode of the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Dr. Gregg Korbin about his book, Beyond Reason: Lessons from the Loss of a Gifted Child. Sometimes people enter our lives and change us forever. Author Gregg Korbon's son, Brian, was such a person. In Beyond Reason, Gregg shares the story of his sweet and brilliant nine-year-old child. Though healthy, Brian told his parents he was going to die before he reached "double digits" (age ten). Six months later, after scoring the first run of his Little League career, he collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though his death garnered media attention, the mysteries before and after his death were never shared. Brian foresaw his future, gave himself a going away party, and left good-bye gifts and a note telling his parents not to worry about him. After his death, Brian's influence continued. His father—a rational physician who did not believe in metaphysical phenomena—embarked on a mystical journey through grief into a creative world he did not know existed. What he learned by healing stretched the capabilities of his reasonable mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>On this episode of the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Duann Kier about her book, Fundamentalisman: Resurrecting the Fundamentals of Relationship from the Fundamentalism of Religion. In the book, Duann asks the following questions: If you are a Christian fundamentalist and your beliefs are working for you because you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are right and real, this book is probably not for you. If you are a Christian fundamentalist and are beginning to question some of the beliefs you’ve been taught along the way, this book may be for you. If you are—or once were—a Christian fundamentalist and your beliefs just aren’t working for you anymore, this book is definitely for you.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

In this interview, Drunvalo Melchizedek explains and how every 13,000 years on Earth a sacred and secret event takes place that changes everything. Mother Earth’s Kundalini energy emerges from its resting place in the planet’s core and moves like a snake across the surface of our world. Once at home in ancient Lemuria, it moved to Atlantis, then to the Himalayan mountains of India and Tibet, and with every relocation changed our idea of what spiritual means. And gender. And heart.

            <title>Energetic Balancing with Aleya Dao (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/1oSeioM5krA/shows10.shtml</link>
            <description>This week on the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Aleya Dao about her work in sound energy. In 2001, Aleya Dao experienced enlightenment as she was awakened to her true being and essence. One result of this awakening was her uncanny ability to tune into multiple levels of subtle energies and consciousness fields and to perceive multiple dimensions of reality. Another result was the emergence of her ability to shift and heal individuals and groups through her voice. Since her enlightenment experience, Aleya is clairaudient and has the ability to hear and then reproduce the sounds that come from the angelic realm. Her meditations, toning concerts, and musical performances move people into states of higher consciousness, a sense of deep connection, and awakens within them a place where they once again feel at “home.”&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Since her enlightenment experience, Aleya is clairaudient and has the ability to hear and then reproduce the sounds that come from the angelic realm. Her meditations, toning concerts, and musical performances move people into states of higher consciousness, a sense of deep connection, and awakens within them a place where they once again feel at “home.”</itunes:summary>

            <title>Elusive Peace with Doug Noll (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/B_LO9_LfTqw/shows4.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Doug Noll about his book, Elusive Peace. Everyone wants world peace. Churches pray for it. Entertainers sing for peace. It is every good person's birthday wish. But how will we ever get there? The headlines don't provide much hope. Peace talks fail; negotiations over climate change end inconclusively; Iran is developing nuclear weapons; Afghanistan is an expensive mess; and the Israelis and Palestinians are no closer to a peace agreement. There seems to be more war and strife than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this in-depth analysis, professional mediator Douglas E. Noll goes behind the headlines to understand why crucial negotiations fail. He argues that diplomats often enter negotiations with flawed assumptions about human behavior, sovereignty, and power. Essentially, the international community is using a model of European diplomacy dating back to the 18th century to solve the complex problems of the 21st century. Reviewing a wide range of conflicts and negotiations, Noll demonstrates that the best efforts of negotiators often failed because they did not take into account the deep-seated values and emotions of the disputing parties. In conclusion, Noll draws on his own long experience as a professional mediator to describe the process of building trust and creating a climate of empathy that is the key to successful negotiation and can go a long way toward resolving even seemingly intractable conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>Kala and Kailash discuss Following Sound into Silence: Chanting Your Way Beyond Ego into Bliss . In this unique book/CD set, Kailash urges readers to take up chanting as an authentic and effective spiritual practice. Although chanting is an ancient spiritual tool, it is well suited to our contemporary lifestyles. No generation before us has had to contend with the onslaught of voices clamoring for our attention, the chaos of distractions vying for our imaginations and allegiance, or the flood of information that is our daily lot. Kailash shows how chanting, both alone and with others, can quiet and stabilize our minds, expand our hearts, elevate our emotions, and reduce our self-centeredness...yielding direct, sustained experience of the Divine.

            <title>The Medium Next Door with Maureen Hancock (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/tXtWerjH3lo/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Maureen Hancock about her new book, the Medium Next Door: Adventures of a Real-Life Ghost Whisperer. At just five years old, Maureen Hancock discovered her ability to communicate with the dead. Descended from a long line of legendary Irish mystics, she was no stranger to the spiritual realm, but for fear of being misunderstood by her friends and family she kept the otherworldly messages to herself, eventually suppressing them completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maureen wouldn't hear the spirits again until she was in a near-fatal car crash. Soon after, she had hundreds of voices in her head, many of which helped her crack cases and expose fraud in her role as a litigation paralegal at a large Boston law firm. Then, when tragedy struck on 9/11, Maureen was bombarded with messages from the spirit world. As each one made contact with her, she finally came to terms with her calling: to communicate with the deceased, assist the dying, search for missing children, and teach the living about life after death, all the while raising her children in her suburban home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <itunes:subtitle>The Medium Next Door with Maureen Hancock</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>This week on The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Maureen Hancock about her new book, the Medium Next Door: Adventures of a Real-Life Ghost Whisperer. At just five years old, Maureen Hancock discovered her ability to communicate with the dead. Descended from a long line of legendary Irish mystics, she was no stranger to the spiritual realm, but for fear of being misunderstood by her friends and family she kept the otherworldly messages to herself, eventually suppressing them completely.

Maureen wouldn't hear the spirits again until she was in a near-fatal car crash. Soon after, she had hundreds of voices in her head, many of which helped her crack cases and expose fraud in her role as a litigation paralegal at a large Boston law firm. Then, when tragedy struck on 9/11, Maureen was bombarded with messages from the spirit world. As each one made contact with her, she finally came to terms with her calling: to communicate with the deceased, assist the dying, search for missing children, and teach the living about life after death, all the while raising her children in her suburban home.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Project Happiness with Randy Taran (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/UJf6dVwV_qs/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>This week on the Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Kala speaks with Randy Taran, the Creator/Executive Producer of Project Happiness. With the unspoken epidemic of stress and depression infiltrating every community, how can kids (of all ages) learn to generate their own happiness regardless of the situations they face? Follow three groups of high school students from three continents on a quest to understand the nature of lasting happiness. What they discover uncovers the potential for happiness that is in us all. The film focuses on four teens from Santa Cruz, California. Each faces personal obstacles to happiness: loss, alienation and the everyday challenges of being a teenager passing into adulthood. An innovative project that asks the question “How do we achieve lasting happiness?” introduces them by internet and video diaries to their peers in Nigeria and India and quickly leaves lectures and books behind. The teens also engage in conversations with cultural icons George Lucas, Richard Gere and groundbreaking neuroscientist Richard Davidson. The three international groups ultimately meet face to face in India for the first time to prepare for a rare private audience with the Dalai Lama.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>This week on The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show, Nick Redfern returns to EYS to speak with Kala about his new book, The Real Men in Black: Evidence, Famous Cases and True Stories of These Mysterious Men and their Connection to UFO Phenomena. The Men in Black were elevated to superstar status in 1997 in the hit movie of the same name. Although the Hollywood blockbuster was fiction, the real Men in Black have consistently attempted to silence the witnesses of UFO and paranormal phenomena since the 1950s. In The Real Men in Black, author Nick Redfern delves deep into the mysterious world of these mysterious operatives. He reveals their origins and discusses classic cases, previously unknown reports, secret government files, and the many theories that have been presented to explain the mystery. Highlights of The Real Men in Black include: The story of Albert Bender, the first man to claim an encounter with the Men in Black, The involvement of the MIB in the Mothman saga that dominated the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the 1960s, Encounters with the MIB at the site of one of the world's most famous monsters: Loch Ness and exclusive interviews with leading researchers of the MIB phenomenon.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/p1ql46ZgRW8/shows2.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Emily Carlin about her book: Defense Against the Dark: A Field Guide to Protecting Yourself From Predatory Spirits, Energy Vampires and Malevolent Magic. When we lie awake at night listening to mysterious sounds, we imagine all the things that could be making those strange noises. The rumbling is the sound of the refrigerator; the knocking is from the old furnace; the creaking is nothing more than the house settling...isn't it? Although the modern world has denied the existence of things that go bump in the night and has taught us that the occult couldn't possibly exist, we know there are things that science has yet to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense Against the Dark introduces the reader to many of those unsavory magickal creatures and occult happenings that exist outside of fairytales. Our ancestors knew these threats were real, and took precautions to protect themselves from whatever evil was lurking in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense Against the Dark discusses:
&lt;br /&gt;- Common lore and mythology of predatory entities such as goblins, vampires, imps, and ghosts
&lt;br /&gt;- How to identify malevolent spirits and understand how curses actually work
&lt;br /&gt;- How to master different protection methods, including shielding, banishing, and hex breaking
&lt;br /&gt;- Easy, concrete methods for protecting yourself in everyday situations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Defense Against the Dark discusses:
- Common lore and mythology of predatory entities such as goblins, vampires, imps, and ghosts
- How to identify malevolent spirits and understand how curses actually work
- How to master different protection methods, including shielding, banishing, and hex breaking
- Easy, concrete methods for protecting yourself in everyday situations</itunes:summary>

            <title>The Divine Principle with Keith Blanchard (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/55Ea5qh8w1c/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>Kala speaks with Keith Blanchard about his book, The Divine Principle. One June morning in 1996, Keith Blanchard, a musician and composer, found himself with just such an opportunity when he was awakened by a voice that seemed to permeate every fiber of his being. "Good Morning, My Friend. Wake up, for we have much to talk about!" Although, initially, he had no intentions of writing a book, when Keith realized that what he was hearing would benefit others as much as himself, he began tape recording his "encounters." The Divine Principle is the result - a transcription of the many lively "talks" between him and God that give us insight into the ways energy and information come together to create both personal and world realities. Keith says, "The subtitle of this book pretty much sums up what I believe is its heart - that each of us is capable of awakening the Divine within ourselves; that we can all anchor Heaven on Earth."&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/__NFHhqclkE/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Jules Watson about her book, The Raven Queen. Queen Maeve is one of the most famous and intriguing women in ancient Ireland, branded by history a voracious man-eater and a ruthless war-mongerer. Imagining a different Maeve, The Raven Queen resurrects a free-spirited young woman who would be no man's plaything, but the ruler of her own destiny. Following that destiny, she unleashes the greatest battle in Irish myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She risks the wrath of the supernatural sídhe to steal her father's sword from his grave by a sacred lake. There Maeve meets the blind druid Ruán, a mysterious exile with a connection to the sídhe she does not understand. She returns to the lake again and again, hoping to gain his hidden power for her own. In the midst of war and chaos, however, comes an unexpected redemption. A part of Maeve she thought long lost is reawakened, and she discovers at last the true nature of the power of women, and the potential she always held within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Moon Phase Astrology with Raven Kaldera (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/fF8FWCU-Mac/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Raven Kaldera about his new book, Moon Phase Astrology. The Moon’s ever-changing phases offer a way to deepen our understanding of our natal Moon sign as well as the Moon’s day-to-day influence on our emotional tides. Through its 8 phases and its wandering dance through each of the 12 signs of the Zodiac--from the Infant’s Moon (the New Moon in Aries) to the Storyteller’s Moon (the Full Moon in Gemini) to the Prophet’s Moon (the waning Balsamic Moon in Aquarius)--the Moon shares its story in 96 different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling the stories of the heart of all 96 Moon phase and Moon sign combinations, Raven Kaldera explains the creative gifts and emotional challenges bestowed upon those born under each Moon archetype as well as how to nurture the positive traits and improve--or at least discourage--the negative ones. Exploring the influences each Moon archetype has on us as it passes, the author reveals which Moons are the most difficult, what innate qualities each Moon brings out in us, and what we can do to honor each Moon. Including evocative quotes illuminating the nature of each Moon, Kaldera shows how to use your natal Moon’s astrological sign and phase to find your "hidden Moons"--the shadows cast by passing Moons--and predict how current and approaching Moons will affect you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Join us on a voyage through time and space into the world of the strange and unusual and unfathomable, as hypnotherapist Dolores Cannon's Convoluted Universe series continues. Suspend belief as you explore worlds and dimensions where your dreams become reality and your reality is only a dream. Open your mind to a myriad of possibilities that have previously only dwelt in the imagination. More mind-bending concepts for those with open minds and eager curiosities. * Other lives as animals, plants and in strange, otherworldly bodies. * Everything is alive. Everything has consciousness. * Help from beings of faraway worlds. * The three waves of volunteers who are coming to help the world go through its transition. * What is God? The true nature of God or the Source, where all come from and all must go back to. * Lifetimes as Creators of universes, the Earth and everything on it. * Different laws of creation and physics where universes obey other rules. * The New Earth and the effects on our bodies as we move into it.. * Who will be left behind when the Earth moves into the next dimension. * A totally new alternative to a walk-in. * The Final Solution Energy that can destroy the world if it becomes necessary.

            <title>Flying Saucers and Science with Stanton Friedman  (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/94YLYNaAbpc/shows2.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Stanton Friedman about his latest book: Flying Saucers and Science, a comprehensive look at the scientific data on the flying saucer phenomenon. Nuclear physicist and lecturer Stanton T. Friedman has distilled more than 40 years of research on UFOs, and shares his work on a wide variety of classified advanced nuclear and space systems. He answers a number of physics questions in layman’s terms, and establishes that travel to nearby stars is within reach without violating the laws of physics. Photographs of little known, far-out advanced propulsion systems, on some of which he worked, are included. Friedman also presents data demonstrating the ability to withstand high accelerations with some surprising results. He clearly shows that government policy on this subject has been to provide false, misleading claims and disinformation, and establishes that the subject truly represents a Cosmic Watergate. Flying Saucers and Science presents intriguing data from a number of large-scale scientific UFO studies that almost no one, especially the noisy negativists, has discussed in detail. It deals with a host of "why" questions such, as reasons for the cover-up, reasons for aliens to come to Earth, and reasons for not landing on the White House lawn. Friedman unveils the SETI program, and details the antipathy of science-fiction writers to UFOs and other mysteries of the saucer conundrum. False notions about those who believe in the reality of alien visitors and the adequacy of coverage by the journalistic and scientific communities are reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanton discusses many topics including: What type of energy and technologies could provide travel between the star, The most likely locations in the universe where aliens come from, Why the aliens are here, Who believes in the flying saucer phenomenon and the government’s motives to cover-up, and much, much more.

            <description>Thinking beyond the genes, We all somehow "know" that the mind/body connection is key to real health. Are you tired of trying to find the words that describe how the mind and body are related, and why their relationships are important for proper health? A renaissance in Cell Biology now provides the cutting edge science - real science - to prove how holistic health therapies work! Research scientist Bruce Lipton, Ph.D., introduces a long-awaited paradigm shift in the biomedical sciences. The new science will inspire your spirit, engage your mind and challenge your creativity as you comprehend the enormous real potential for applying this information in your life and in your profession.

            <title>The Sphinx Mystery with Robert and Olivia Temple (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/RlQ5gNJCKF4/shows9.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Robert and Olivia Temple about their book The Sphinx Mystery: The Forgotten Origins of the Sanctuary of Anubis. Shrouded in mystery for centuries, the Sphinx of Giza has frustrated many who have attempted to discover its original purpose. In The Sphinx Mystery, Robert Temple with his wife Olivia address the many mysteries of the Sphinx. He presents eyewitness accounts, published over a period of 281 years, of people who saw the secret chambers and even went inside them before they were sealed in 1926--accounts that had been forgotten until the author rediscovered them. He also describes his own exploration of a tunnel at the rear of the Sphinx, perhaps used for obtaining sacred divinatory dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Temple reveals that the Sphinx was originally a monumental Anubis, the Egyptian jackal god, and that its face is that of a Middle Kingdom Pharaoh, Amenemhet II, which was a later re-carving. In addition, he provides photographic evidence of ancient sluice gate traces to demonstrate that, during the Old Kingdom, the Sphinx as Anubis sat surrounded by a moat filled with water--called Jackal Lake in the ancient Pyramid Texts--where religious ceremonies were held. He also provides evidence that the exact size and position of the Sphinx were geometrically determined in relation to the pyramids of Cheops and Chephren and that it was part of a pharaonic resurrection cult.

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/W53tfoGNb88/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>Kala speaks with Hollister Rand about her new book, I'm not Dead, I'm Different. Rand was initially puzzled as to why young spirits wanted to speak through her—she had no children of her own and the responsibility of talking with people who had lost theirs seemed too great to bear. But the compelling answers came with time and patience: No one finds death more inexplicable than a grieving parent, thus no spirits are more motivated to make sense of it all for those they’ve left behind than young ones.

            <itunes:subtitle>Children in Spirit World with Hollister Rand</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Kala speaks with Hollister Rand about her new book, I'm not Dead, I'm Different. Rand was initially puzzled as to why young spirits wanted to speak through her—she had no children of her own and the responsibility of talking with people who had lost theirs seemed too great to bear. But the compelling answers came with time and patience: No one finds death more inexplicable than a grieving parent, thus no spirits are more motivated to make sense of it all for those they’ve left behind than young ones. These spirits clearly want to heal broken hearts and deepen our understanding of life and death, and Rand has the unique ability to help deliver their messages. </itunes:summary>

            <description>Kala speaks with Hazel Courteney about her new book, Countdown to Coherence; A Spiritual Journey Toward A Scientific Theory of Everything. Inspired by her own near-death experience and its incredible aftermath, a leading spiritual writer explores the nature of the universe and its rich possibilities for human development. Using cutting-edge scientific and spiritual evidence, Hazel Counteney examines the growing belief that our world is nothing but a holographic projection, and that we are biological computers operating inside a preprogrammed simulator.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>Across time and across the world, an ancient serpent cult once dominated mankind. Then a great battle ensued and Christianity stamped it's authority on the face of the planet. Now after years of research, the real religious history of the world can be told. In Secrets of the Serpent, Philip Gardiner for the first time reveals: the worlds most mysterious places were once sacred to the Serpent Cult, the secret of the Holy Grail and Elixer of Life, the history and mythology of the so called reptilian agenda and alien visitation in ancient times now has a solid opponent - giving answers for the many symbols and myths often confused by those who believe in such things. In Secrets of the Serpent, the author reveals the real bloodline spoken by Dan Brown in the Da Vinci Code - it was in fact a serpent bloodline.

            <title>Pyramid of Fire - The Lost Aztec Code with John Major Jenkins (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/uf3smzS_nuE/shows9.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Over 2,000 years ago the early Maya formulated a profound galactic cosmology. They saw that the sun, on the winter solstice, was slowly moving toward the heart of the galaxy. Naturally enough, with their uncorrupted intelligence intact, they suspected that the world would go through a transformation when the solar and the galactic planes aligned. They devised their Long Count calendar to target when the cosmic alignment would maximize, and that time is AD 2012. We are lucky that the brilliant skywatchers who devised the 2012 calendar left carved monuments for us to decode, and that they have survived the decay of centuries, so that we can know exactly what they prophesied and believed about 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, at the early Maya site of Izapa in southern Mexico, the galactic cosmology and a profound spiritual teaching are preserved. Izapa speaks to us of the Galactic Alignment in 2012 as a transformative nexus in time, a still-point turnabout, inviting us to reconnect with our cosmic heart and eternal source. With the Divine Wisdom. But how can that be achieved? What is the original, undiluted, prophecy for 2012, divined by those ancient mystics and stargazers who invented the 2012 calendar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Izapa's carved monuments provide the answers - now, for the first time in two millennia, the secrets of Mayan sacred science have been decoded. Now, we can directly read the 2012 revelation right at its source.  Original Air Date: 12/17/2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>The Golden Thread of Time, with author Crichton Miller (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/CPtXxxC8KmA/shows9.shtml</link>
            <description>In his book, The Golden Thread of Time, Crichton Miller explores the ancient scientific and spiritual wisdom that has shaped our present and still influences our future. He reveals a forgotten system that reaches back beyond the current established religions, further than Ancient Egypt or Sumerian into an age where Mankind lived in harmony with Nature. The work explains how a Star Cult was born of necessity, leading to the concepts of a Sun God in Heaven that still exists in fragmented form today. How did a scientific and spiritual instrument from the stone age become hidden and lost in our full view? Miller traces the existence of the wheel cross from Palaeolithic and Neolithic hunter gatherers to stone age seafarers and megalith builders who used this instrument in combination with zodiacs, henge's, pyramids and water clocks. Drawing on scientific, historical and archaeological information with appendices from leading scientists and researchers, the book follows the thread of the often tragic occult history of the real cross from its roots in ancient Shamanism through the burning of Alexandria and its rediscovery 500 years later by the Knights Templar, resulting in communication with the Amerindians before Columbus and eventual excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church.

Drawing on scientific, historical and archaeological information with appendices from leading scientists and researchers, the book follows the thread of the often tragic occult history of the real cross from its roots in ancient Shamanism through the burning of Alexandria and its rediscovery 500 years later by the Knights Templar, resulting in communication with the Amerindians before Columbus and eventual excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Four Purposes of Life with Dan Millman (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/VzwSWkbMPso/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Dan Millman about his new book, The Four Purposes of Life. Few writers approach the topic of life purpose with the clarity of Dan Millman, whose prior book The Life You Were Born to Live has reached more than a million readers worldwide. In The Four Purposes of Life, Millman distills decades of exploration and experience into a concise map of what we’re here to accomplish on our life’s journey. This book is for anyone seeking deeper insight into themselves and their lives, but especially for those at a crossroads, facing a challenge or change, when past approaches no longer work. These four purposes — learning life’s lessons, finding your career and calling, discovering your life path, and attending to this arising moment — will bring your life into sharper focus by revealing:
&lt;br /&gt;* the value of everyday challenges in relationships, health, work, and money
&lt;br /&gt;* how to make wiser decisions in career and relationships
&lt;br /&gt;* our twelve required courses in the school of life
&lt;br /&gt;* a mysterious system that clarifies your hidden calling
&lt;br /&gt;* keys to mastering the most important purpose of all
&lt;br /&gt;The Four Purposes of Life can generate a quantum leap in self-knowledge, insight, and wisdom. The seeds planted will bear fruit for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/nmXwbSNoA30/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>Kala speaks with Gary Spivey about his book, Your Keys to Heaven. Gary’s book was five years in the making and a lifetime of experience has been put onto every page. There is no other book like it in any store on the market today. More than just a 'biography' or 'how to' book, Your Keys to Heaven is a revolutionary new book that reveals spiritual secrets that religions have gone to great lengths to hide, and completely edit out of every religious doctrine that you read today. These are time tested techniques that have been used by prophets and the few who knew from the beginning of time. Realize your true potential in life! You will see the world through different eyes and understand a reality that has always been there but you never knew existed! Your Keys to Heaven will show you a world around you where angels exist and can help you in many ways, as well as teaches you how to spiritually heal yourself from illness and disease.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>Kala speaks with Guy Kawasaki about his tenth book, Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions. In it, he explains how to influence what people will do while maintaining the highest standards of ethics. The book explains when and why enchantment is necessary and then the pillars of enchantment: likability, trustworthiness, and a great cause. The next topics are launching, overcoming resistance, making enchantment endure, and using technology. There are even special chapters dedicated to enchanting your employees and your boss. Finally, because there are times you may want to resist enchantment, there’s even a chapter about how to do this too. If you want to change the world — or even part of the world, this book is for you.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In just about everyone’s life, there comes a time when they may question their reason for existing. For Randy that journey began on a day in June of 1995, shortly after he had moved into his new home. A feeling swept over him that an old friend from grade school, Kathy Lynch, had passed away. He had not seen Kathy since 1973 but now he couldn’t get her, or the feeling that she was gone from this world, out of his mind. His former news background was one of many forces pushing him in an intense search to find what became of her. His investigation quickly turns into an obsession, driven by dreams and a pattern of synchronistic events. Along the way,heI find that he, Kathy, and a mysterious author named L.W. Rogers, are somehow all linked together in the past. The pieces of a larger puzzle begin to emerge and prophecies he's foretold are revealed to be the truth as he uncovers a story about past lives, present circumstances and reincarnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a series of acupuncture induced regression sessions, his life follows a metaphysical journey along a cryptic path that has him, at times, questioning his own sanity. The emotional ride that develops threatens to tear apart everything he had worked so hard to accomplish. The only thing sustaining him is my undying belief that events will occur to prove he is on the right course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a true story, about who we are, why we are here and how we are all connected. That connection is meticulously documented as you follow his quest for the truth and then proven in an ending, that is really only the beginning, in The Key Of Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>It's Never Too Late with BJ Gallagher (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/JHP4P9wAHWo/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by George Eliot's famous quote, BJ Gallagher has written a simple, straightforward, upbeat and effective guidebook to getting the life you've always wanted. The author asks: "What are your passions and talents? Do you have gifts to share with the world? Have you ever deferred your dream because it seemed impractical? Do you long to pick up that dream again?" If your answer to any of those questions is "yes," then this is the book for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only go around once in this life, so why not live a life you love? Start now. Live now. Love now. Laugh now. Give full expression to who you really are. Go for that deferred dream - whether it's a new career, a new love, a new sport, or making yourself wealthy. You were put on this earth to be the best YOU that you can be. If you don't do it, nobody else can. Whether you've lost your job, recently graduated from college, or reached the point where you want to start a new chapter in your life, this book is the perfect guidebook. It's a wonderful combination of practical advice, step-by-step guidelines, and pure inspiration. Don't just seize the day - seize the rest of your life!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Life Beyond 100 - Secrets of the Fountain of Youth with Dr. Norm Shealy (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/fIpDKpTOLAo/show8.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Dr. Norman Shealy, who holds 10 patents for innovative discoveries, has published over 300 articles and 24 books, the latest of which are LIFE BEYOND 100—SECRETS OF THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH and SOUL MEDICINE. In 2008 his book PONY WISDOM FOR THE SOUL and MEDICAL RENAISSANCE--THE SECRET CODE, a movie on the benefits of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, will be released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book, Life Beyond 100 - Secrets of the Fountain of Youth, Dr. Shealy discusses leading-edge therapies and breakthroughs in the science of longevity. By following commonsense habits, we can expect an average lifespan of one hundred years. Adding the life-enhancing effects of natural DHEA restoration, stress reduction, meditation, reduced caloric intake, and a range of mind/body techniques may, however, give us another forty years of active, healthy living. Therein lies the available "fountain of youth." These are the conclusions of Dr. C. Norman Shealy after a long career in medicine and, in recent years, as one of the leading spokesmen of alternative medical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of years of clinical practice and research, Youthful Aging also exposes the fallacies behind many of the claims of the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry. These two groups, says Shealy, rather than increasing people's life expectancy, create the opposite effect, consigning hundreds of thousands of people to an often miserable and premature old age. As a counterpoint, this revealing book provides the most ambitious-yet medically grounded and practical-longevity program available.

            <title>NASA Conspiracies with Nick Redfern (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/IbGtFxTH0Eo/shows2.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration--NASA--was established on July 29, 1958. Ever since that day, NASA has been at the forefront of efforts to explore outerspace, resulting in the Apollo missions to the moon, the Skylab space-station, and today's space shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But behind the open face of NASA, there is a much more mysterious world. Redfern reports that NASA has been linked to a wealth of high-level cover-ups, including:
&lt;br /&gt;Claims that the Apollo moon landings of 1969 to 1972 were faked as part of an effort to demonstrate military and technological superiority over the former Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA's role in hiding the truth about the controversial face on Mars--which many believe to be a carved structure, created in the remote past by long-extinct, indigenous Martians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA's deep and longstanding involvement in the famous UFO crash at Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep Throat--like NASA sources that have attempted to blow the lid on NASA's most guarded secrets concerning the U.S. Government's interactions with aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NASA Conspiracies throws open all the doors that the Space Agency has kept closed for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Debra Moffitt, author of Awake in the World: 108 Practices to Live a Divinely Inspired Life. Everyone needs an anchor in this fast-paced and chaotic world. Awake in the World offers 108 easy ways to weave soul-nourishing peace and divinity into each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This engaging and practical guide was inspired by the author's own personal quest for spiritual enrichment. The practices she brought back from a journey around the world changed her life—and can transform yours. Drawn from an array of wisdom traditions, these 108 bite-sized exercises—involving meditation, labyrinth walking, inspired lovemaking, mantras, and ritual—are quick and simple to do. By sharpening your spiritual awareness, you'll learn to cultivate calm in a crisis, focus on what is truly important, and recognize the divine in everyday life. To support and encourage you on this exciting journey of self-discovery, the author shares her own personal, moving stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Faith, Hope and Healing with Dr. Bernie Siegel (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/Dllz1laiOIQ/shows8.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Bernie Siegel broke new ground with his monumental book Love, Medicine, and Miracles, in which he explored the powerful role the mind can play in fighting illness. Sharing stories of seriously ill patients who survived against the odds and those who seemed to give in to their own deaths, the book inspired countless readers to consider the possibilities of thinking themselves well. Siegel believed--and still does--that the power to heal comes from the human mind through will, determination, and love. Over the last 20 years, his philosophy and advice have led many physicians and other healthcare professionals to help patients participate in and influence their own recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many readers of Love, Medicine, and Miracles have wondered what comes next. What happened to patients who followed Siegel's advice? In Faith, Hope, and Healing, Siegel shares the inspiring stories of people who have experienced cancer and found deeper faith, hope, joy, and healing through the process. Grouped into sections on faith, hope, and healing, these stories and Siegel's insightful commentaries will encourage and help readers to develop an attitude and personality that survivors share, while also offering myriad ways to get through difficult times and discover the gifts that illness can bring into a person's life. In this book, Siegel reveals what these people's experiences tell us about our common strengths and humanity and how to live an authentic, fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/svDEmDZdeCg/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>Kala speaks with Drunvalo Melchizedek about the Serpent of Light: Beyond 2012. The Movement of the Earth’s Kundalini and the Rise of the Female Light, 1949-2013. In this interview, Drunvalo Melchizedek explains and how every 13,000 years on Earth a sacred and secret event takes place that changes everything. Mother Earth’s Kundalini energy emerges from its resting place in the planet’s core and moves like a snake across the surface of our world. Once at home in ancient Lemuria, it moved to Atlantis, then to the Himalayan mountains of India and Tibet, and with every relocation changed our idea of what spiritual means. And gender. And heart. Original Air Date: 3/26/2008.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>Kala speaks with Eldon Taylor about his book, What Does that Mean: Exploring Mind,Meaning and Mysteries. Enlightenment is not something that can just be handed to you. The closest thing to it that you can receive are thoughts and questions that can lead you inward in the search for meaning. What Does That Mean? is full of thoughts and questions that do just that. Some insights you may have thought of and then forgotten, and others you may have experienced but simply haven’t appreciated. An old saying asserts that the value of a book is not in what it says but rather in what it does.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>Kala speaks with Donna Read about her film, The Burning Times. This documentary takes an in-depth look at the witch hunts that swept Europe just a few hundred years ago. False accusations and trials led to massive torture and burnings at the stake and ultimately to the destruction of an organic way of life. The film questions whether the widespread violence against women and the neglect of our environment today can be traced back to those times. Part two of a series of three films on women and spirituality, which include Goddess Remembered and Full Circle.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>The Bushman Way with Bradford Keeney (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/-ewsseFEuFI/shows9.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Bradford Keeney about his new book - The Bushman Way of Tracking God. The Kalahari Bushmen are the keepers of the world’s oldest living culture. In spite of colossal challenges and never-ending crises, they have survived for over 60,000 years with joy and peace—yet their spiritual teachings, the source of their enduring wisdom, have never been fully presented. For the first time, these ancient oral traditions have been put down onto paper by a researcher so unique, he was featured in American Shaman: an Odyssey of Global Healing Traditions, which won a Best Spiritual Book award from Spirituality &amp; Health magazine. Bradford Keeney takes the reader through the veil of original spirituality, connecting the fragments of world religions to a source that is unlike any other. Through this wisdom, readers can find the deepest meaning, fullest purpose, and highest joy in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bushman’s Way to Tracking God is articulated through twelve original mysteries, including: activating the non-subtle universal life force (what the Bushmen call n/om), heightening emotional experience, vibratory interaction, direct downloading and absorption of sacred knowledge, extraordinary healing, activation of the ecstatic “pump,” spontaneous ways of rejuvenation, attending the spiritual classrooms, so-called telepathy, an uncommon range of mystical experiences, and last but not least, total bliss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Bradford Keeney takes the reader through the veil of original spirituality, connecting the fragments of world religions to a source that is unlike any other. Through this wisdom, readers can find the deepest meaning, fullest purpose, and highest joy in life.

The Bushman’s Way to Tracking God is articulated through twelve original mysteries, including: activating the non-subtle universal life force (what the Bushmen call n/om), heightening emotional experience, vibratory interaction, direct downloading and absorption of sacred knowledge, extraordinary healing, activation of the ecstatic “pump,” spontaneous ways of rejuvenation, attending the spiritual classrooms, so-called telepathy, an uncommon range of mystical experiences, and last but not least, total bliss. </itunes:summary>

            <title>The SoulMate Secret with Arielle Ford (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/T7alAQlVd7w/shows3.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Arielle Ford about her book, The SoulMate Secret: Manifest the Love of Your Life With The Law of Attraction. As someone who didn’t meet her soulmate until the age of 44, Arielle Ford became something of a heroine for single women. But her journey to that place wasn’t easy. In her early 40’s, despite Ford’s career success, she was a self-described ‘failure’ in romantic relationships. When she did meet and marry her husband Brian, Ford began to get so many questions from people in similar stages of life that she decided to share her story. In The Soulmate Secret, the woman who helped launch the careers of Deepak Chopra, Neale Donald Walsch, and Jack Canfield tells readers how she found her happily-ever-after in her husband Brian and reveals that finding true love is possible at any age if you’re willing to prepare yourself—spiritually, mentally, and physically—to become a magnet for love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arielle uses a series of processes that have to be felt in every cell of your being to create the outcome you desire. This practical guide also includes prayers and techniques to help clear out emotional baggage from the past and make room for true love to manifest itself. With helpful chapters on readiness, belief, “the List,” self-love, and more, The Soulmate Secret will guide the reader to find lasting love.

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/eH8FHoqZIMA/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>Kala speaks with Marguerite Manning about her book: Cosmic Karma: Understanding Your Contract With The Universe, a spiritual guide to true self-awareness because it’s an astrological self-help book for the soul. By teaching you to study your birth chart in the same way ancient astronomers believed it should be studied - as a universal birth map of your soul's chosen energies for this lifetime – this book compels you to discover the most empowering universal secret of all: your birth energies only reflect your ability to be great and shine bright in this lifetime because they’re actually a celestial documentation of your soul’s promise to aim higher and do better than it did in the last one. In short, your birth chart is your soul’s Contract with the Universe. It can’t help but reveal where you’re destined to succeed in the material world because it illuminates your soul’s promise to evolve in the spiritual one. Who knew? Certainly not us, and that’s our dilemma. We humans have no conscious memory of our unconscious past. Who then, is responsible for keeping this contract? Certainly us, and that’s our even bigger dilemma. Learn why your Sun sign was critical to your soul’s growth yesterday, and why your Sun house is pivotal to yours today. Better yet, learn how to finally stop avoiding Saturn's depressing karmic classroom; accepting Neptune's blue-green invitation to the Twilight Zone and leaving hair-trigger Pluto alone in the complaint department. After all, you can’t ignore your soul’s commitments to the cosmos and then wonder why life won’t sparkle, love won’t sizzle and you won’t dazzle. Your destiny is waiting.

            <title>Magic Practices of the Faery Tradition with Orion Foxwood (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/U6oLnQxIctA/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Faery Seership the truths we seek can only be found within ourselves, within nature, and within our relationships to nature. At the center of the Faery Tradition lies the Tree of Enchantment: the symbol for these relationships and for the threefold life of humanity. At each level of the tree, there are attending spirit forces that vary from beings of light to beings of shadow, from the ancestors of humanity to the architects of form and nature, from the destiny of our planet to the creation forces of the universe. The tree’s roots grow through the lower world, where all life originates and the dead travel, its trunk and lower branches reach out across the middle world, where elemental forces and the four directions guide us, and its highest branches reach the into the upper world and the Star realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Orion Foxwood, who shares folk tradition and extensive academic research into the Old Religion of Faery Seership. Based on Appalachian traditions, Wiccan studies, Celtic oral traditions, and the Craft from Western and Northern Europe, The Tree of Enchantment (Weiser Books, October 2008) offers the student of Faery Tradition both introductory and advanced visionary practices and authentic tools to learn to navigate the three realms of humanity. With diligence and an open heart, the reader will learn to cross The River of Blood, pass through The Gate of Awakening, and over The River of Stars.

            <title>Mars and Venus with John Gray  (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/aPIe_WkRdQQ/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with John Gray about his newest book, Why Mars and Venus Collide. The enduring message from John Gray is that men and women are indeed from different planets. This truth has not changed since the publication of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. In fact, the differences between the sexes have become more evident in today's hectic, fast-paced world. Except now, the monster known as stress has become a main ingredient in our lives and it has successfully invaded our relationships. Once upon a time, there was a lifestyle where men went to work and women stayed home. In today's society, you're more likely to find the power couple. They both go to work (for longer than just 9 to 5) and they are overworked, underpaid, and overstressed. They both struggle to excel in the same status-hungry society and hectic, competitive, career-oriented environment. Couples come home to each other -- and instead of being comforted by each other, a new set of problems begin. And most of these challenges can be chalked up to one main ingredient: stress.

            <title>Star of the Magi with Courtney Roberts  (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The Star of Bethlehem is still one of the most popular and puzzling mysteries of the Bible. Its inclusion, at the very beginning of the very first Gospel, raises so many awkward questions for orthodox Christianity that one has to wonder how it ever made the canonical cut in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would the authors (and editors) of the Christian Gospels choose Zoroastrian Magi and astrology to herald the coming of Jesus Christ? Did the Magi have some special significance then that we have since lost? After all, the New Testament narrative opens with them. So who were the Magi, and did their astrological beliefs really lead them to Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The Star of the Magi, Courtney Roberts examines the Star. The Magi had definite expectations of a coming world savior who would be born of a virgin, all mysteriously encoded and foretold in Magian astrology. These ancient Persian beliefs had tremendous bearing on the development of Jewish messianic expectations -- they inspired early Christians and their Jewish and Persian neighbors, and gave them hope in their desperate battles against the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Roberts, astronomy alone cannot unlock the secrets of the Star. There are simply too many phenomena to choose from -- even astronomers concede that that we must now look to astrology for better answers.  Original Air Date: 12/14/2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>The Mastery of Love: A Practical Guide to the Art of Relationship: A Toltec Wisdom Book by Don Miguel Ruiz. In a refreshingly honest investigation of the true nature of love, don Miguel Ruiz brings to light the commonly held fallacies and misplaced expectations about love that permeate most relationships. In the tradition of Carlos Castaneda, he uses inspirational stories to impart the wisdom of three fundamental Toltec masteries (Awareness, Transformation, and Love). The themes explored include the Toltec wisdom of the heart, the track of love, and the war of control.

            <title>Spiritual Partnerships with Gary Zukav and Linda Francis  (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;A spiritual partnership is a partnership between equals for the purpose of spiritual growth. Spiritual partners use spirituality information from their inner sources, such as their emotions and intuition. They also learn to choose their intentions consciously and how to develop trust in the Universe. Spiritual partnership is a new relationship dynamic in the human experience. It exists for a new multisensory humanity that is being born -- a humanity that is not confined to the limitations of what can be seen, heard, touched, tasted, and smelled. You are likely a candidate for creating spiritual partnerships, or you would not be drawn to these words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiritual partnerships are not exclusively for couples in marriage or relationships; they can be created in families, between friends, in the workplace, on sports teams, at school -- anywhere two or more individuals decide to create a relationship as equals in order to grow spiritually. For example, among co-workers, even if one is the boss, another is the manager, and others are hourly employees, the commitment of each is to his or her own spiritual growth, although co-workers of different job levels have different responsibilities in the workplace. Their intention to grow spiritually with every interaction rather than blame or judge each other when reactions occur becomes the defining point of their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what Gary Zukav and Linda Francis mean by "spiritual partnership," you will better understand the Spiritual Partnership Guidelines. Because spiritual partnership is a new relationship dynamic, creating partnerships of this nature will take practice. Gary and Linda suggest that you use the Spiritual Partnership Guidelines daily and see for yourself the changes that you make in your life.

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/P_lYjBT3mug/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Transforming the face of psychiatry, Dr. Judith Orloff asserts that we are keepers of an innate intuitive intelligence so perceptive that it can tell us how to heal -- and prevent -- illness. Yet intuition and spirituality are the very aspects of our wisdom usually disenfranchised from traditional health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a board-certified psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at UCLA, Dr. Orloff exhibits great courage in drawing upon her own intuitive abilities, evident to her since childhood. Her struggles acknowledging and then finally embracing her gift of heightened intuition are chronicled in Second Sight. Her second book, Dr. Judith Orloff's Guide to Intuitive Healing shows how breakthroughs in healing our body, emotions, and sexuality are accomplished by listening to intuition. Her latest book Positive Energy completes a trilogy of books around awakening intuition and subtle energy. Positive Energy takes a probing look at the epidemic of exhaustion in America and how we can reverse it using specific strategies to build energy and combat draining people. Positive Energy is a national and Los Angeles Times bestseller which as been translated into 23 languages.  Original air date: 3/12/2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Summoning the Fates with Z Budapest (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show) </title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/zCF9Qvg51so/shows9.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Kala speaks with Z. Budapest, author of Summoning the Fates. During the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Z. Budapest narrowly escaped a massacre. Was it chance that spared her life, or destiny? In Summoning the Fates, Budapest, a pioneer of the women's spirituality movement, introduces us to the three Fates that rule our lives. Not even the gods and goddesses can escape these raw forces of nature presiding over the past, present, and future. Budapest uses fairy tales, historical lore, and personal anecdotes to describe the three sacred sisters who are especially active during our thirty-year life cycles: Urdh (youth), Verdandi (adulthood), and Skuld (the crone years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want a taste of the cosmic soup bubbling in Fate's cauldron? Budapest also offers heartfelt advice, exercises, and rituals to help you connect with the Fates and embrace your own unique destiny.  Original Air Date: 5/19/2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>The Reiki Magic Guide to Self-Attunement with Brett Bevell (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/k-k2TKaC-UU/shows1.shtml</link>
            <description>Kala speaks with Brett Bevell, a reiki master and author of The Reiki Magic Guide to Self-Attunement and Reiki for Spiritual Healing. Reiki tradition dictates that we first be initiated, or "attuned," by a Reiki master in order to properly practice the healing art. With attunement fees as high as $10,000, this custom has barred many hopefuls from ascending through the degrees of Reiki mastery. In this revolutionary guide, Reiki master Brett Bevell breaks with convention and extends the transformative powers of Reiki to all by presenting at-home rituals for self-attunement. In the true healing spirit of Reiki, he also encourages creativity and experimentation with the practice, allowing readers to personalize Reiki for their everyday use.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Partnering with Nature, with Catriona MacGregor (The Explore Your Spirit with Kala Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/zrdFdBCK5GY/shows4.shtml</link>
            <description>In today's world, it's often too easy to forget about the world outside the window. People struggle daily with stressful jobs, trapped under fluorescent lighting, staring at glowing screens, or surrounded by concrete when they could be outdoors, acknowledging the gifts of natural world. In the face of its absence, we are finally beginning to understand that our connection with nature—plants, trees, animals, and the energy of the earth itself—is more than a luxury; it is a necessary and vital part of our existence. In Partnering with Nature, Catriona MacGregor weaves together historical, spiritual, and scientific examples to emphasize the importance of creating a vital relationship with our natural surroundings. Our separation from nature leads to several devastating effects, whether through stress, feeling a lack of purpose, or the heedless destruction of our environment. Through her exploration of the energies that link humans, animals, and the natural world, she shows how we can learn from nature as we develop our spirituality and ourselves. Through diverse approaches, Catriona offers the reader a solid understanding of why a connection with the Earth is vital to our existence, and how a revival of that connection opens doors to a myriad of benefits in our environment and in our health, our daily lives, and our happiness.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/rXbpPqSzz1I/shows8.shtml</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In Medical Intuition: Your Awakening to Wholeness, Dr. Norman Shealy discusses the significant history of the use of medical intuition by leaders in the field and provides a path to using your innate intuition to develop optimal personal power and health. From beginning to end, you’ll learn how to use your basic healing power effectively and immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shealy has studied the physiological effects of over a dozen talented healers. He has demonstrated in over 116 patients that competent healers can change the computerized electroencephalogram, or brain map, from a distance and they can enhance DHEA and beta endorphin production. His current research emphasizes the potential for using electromagnetic approaches to rejuvenate the body’s production of DHEA and Calcitonin, as well as to reduce free radicals. His latest discovery is rejuvenation of DNA telomeres, which are critical for health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <title>Exploring the Dark Side of Fairies with Dr. Bob Curran  (Explore Your Spirit with Kala Metaphysical Talk Show)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/dYOVD8SRvNU/shows2.shtml</link>
            <description>We all know about fairies—they’re usually helpful, ethereal creatures in children’s stories and Walt Disney films, flitting about doing good, right? Dr. Bob Curran says - Wrong! In ancient times, the concept of fairies was rather different. They were the often-dangerous embodiment of the land, dark and unpredictable spirits that watched Humanity with a jaundiced and hostile eye. And, according to conventional folk wisdom, they were to be feared rather than trusted. Indeed, in their original form, many of our “fairy tales” read more like late-night horror stories. Dr. Bob Curran investigates the folkloric roots of the fairy kind, tracing their origins from the sprites and maenads of Classical times to the sanitized versions of the English Victorians. Among other aspects, he examines the connections in the Christian mind between the fairy kind and demons; the links between fairies and ancient, pagan gods; and the often-strained relations between fairies and humans across the ages.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <itunes:subtitle>Exploring the Dark Side of Fairies with Dr. Bob Curran</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>We all know about fairies—they’re usually helpful, ethereal creatures in children’s stories and Walt Disney films, flitting about doing good, right? Dr. Bob Curran says - Wrong! In ancient times, the concept of fairies was rather different. They were the often-dangerous embodiment of the land, dark and unpredictable spirits that watched Humanity with a jaundiced and hostile eye. And, according to conventional folk wisdom, they were to be feared rather than trusted. Indeed, in their original form, many of our “fairy tales” read more like late-night horror stories. Dr. Bob Curran investigates the folkloric roots of the fairy kind, tracing their origins from the sprites and maenads of Classical times to the sanitized versions of the English Victorians. Among other aspects, he examines the connections in the Christian mind between the fairy kind and demons; the links between fairies and ancient, pagan gods; and the often-strained relations between fairies and humans across the ages. </itunes:summary>

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/LFyNYu1w9jc/shows7.shtml</link>
            <description>Kala speaks with Nina Simons, author of Moonrise: The Power of Women Leading from the Heart. Nina has an enduring interest in the leadership of women and restoring the "feminine" to a balanced place in our culture. Many today find themselves being called toward greater leadership on behalf of the Earth, toward leadership sourced from their inner authority and inspired by what they love and are dedicated to protect, transform, and strengthen. Those successfully heeding this call have embraced the qualities previously relegated to the “feminine”--inner awareness, collaboration, relational intelligence, respect for the sacred and generosity--and married them to the best of their “masculine” attributes to create a new form of leadership more effective for transforming how we live on Earth and with each other. Moonrise presents more than 30 essays from eminent women trailblazers.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>Kala speaks with Raymond Moody about his new book - Glimpses of Eternity. Glimpses of Eternity is the first book to talk about the phenomenon of 'shared death experiences.' Readers will discover deathbed moments when entire families see the light or the room changes shape. Others tell of seeing a film like review of a loved one's life and learning things that they could never have known otherwise. The stories are at once a comfort and a mystery, giving us a new understanding of the journey that we will take at the end of our lives.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ExploreYourSpiritWithKala/~3/YqRfKynL7lU/shows9.shtml</link>
            <description>Kala speaks with Chris Dunn and Arlan Andrews about the ancient technologies in Egypt. They also discuss Chris's new book: Lost Technologies of Ancient Egypt and the time that Chris and Arlan spent in Egypt. From the pyramids in the north to the temples in the south, ancient artisans left their marks all over Egypt, unique marks that reveal craftsmanship we would be hard pressed to duplicate today. Drawing together the results of more than 30 years of research and nine field study journeys to Egypt, Christopher Dunn presents a stunning stone-by-stone analysis of key Egyptian monuments, including the statue of Ramses II at Luxor and the fallen crowns that lay at its feet. His modern-day engineering expertise provides a unique view into the sophisticated technology used to create these famous monuments in prehistoric times.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

            <description>Kala speaks with Gillian Holloway, author of The Complete Dream Book: Discover What Your Dreams Reveal About You and Your Life. The average person will dream over 150,000 dreams in a lifetime--each one a complex web of imagery and deeper meaning. The Complete Dream Book uses the interpretation of 28,000 actual dreams from contemporary dreamers, just like you, to help you access the substance and meaning of your own dreams. Discover Who's who in your dreams, Which dreams recur during certain life stages, The true meaning behind your nightmares, Why you have certain dreams again and again, How to tell if a dream is worth interpreting--and if you've done it correctly and the phenomenon of precognitive dreams. The Complete Dream Book is the only dream interpretation book based on concrete data about real people's dreams and how the real events in their lives relate to their nighttime visions.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
