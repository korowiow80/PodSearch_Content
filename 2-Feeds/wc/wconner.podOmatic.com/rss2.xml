      <title>Tom Terwilliger candid audio</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1056166/600x600_2924822.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever had the opportunity to meet and talk to someone you really admire?

Someone you really look up to someone you wanted to be like growing up?

If you've ever met this person were you disappointed that this person wasn't the person you expected him or her to be?

The quote I've heard is, &quot;Never meet your idol because you'll be disappointed.&quot;

Someone I admired and looked up to growing up and working out in the gym was Mr. America Tom Terwilliger.  Recently I got to meet him over the phone when I interviewed him.  I was very nervous because this is someone I admired for years and let me tell you I was not disappointed at all.  In fact it was the exact opposite; he's one of the coolest guys I've ever spoken with.

When the interview was over, Tom and I just started talking and this is the conversation we had after we finished our interview together that lasted well over an hour.  I don't even know if Tom realized we were still recording.  This is great stuff because you can hear what a great guy Tom really is and how he went on and on talking with me and helping me and giving me his precious time.

This is unedited audio except I've cut out a few portions of the conversation because we do mention some people's names and some of the money figures that these people may be uncomfortable with.  You'll hear a short beeping sound when the audio is cut.  It's only about 20 minutes long but it really gives you an inside look at two guys just talking business.  Again we forgot we were being recorded so this is us without our business faces or public persona.

You'll also hear my kids in the background and me talking as I get ready to go out to dinner with my wife.  A few times it sounds like an out of breath but I'm trying to get ready to go out and I'm walking up and down stairs during our conversation.

Enjoy

      <title>Interview with Wayne</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1056166/600x600_2718523.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 42 minute coaching call I did with a gentleman named Wayne.  Wayne is 45 years old and he just wants to stay looking young.  He has a history of working out and wants information on supplements and how to increase his testosterone.  I go pretty fast in the beginning and give the names of several natural supplements that will help.  We also talk about diet, how to optimize your protein intake and sources of good, lean protein.  We discuss the pharmaceutical route of increasing testosterone with and without taking testosterone, which is considered an anabolic steroid and why you should not take your hormones by mouth.  I give him a bunch of good information during this coaching call about muscle soreness and what I do to help with that...how I work around injuries...some eating advice...how to easily tell the low fat cuts of red meat...the theory of the Adkins diet...what happens to your body if you take too much supplemental testosterone for too long...my stance on cholesterol and how it relates to your hormones...what is spot reducing and why it is a myth...and my little rant on performance enhancing drugs.</description>

The diet and exercise industry is a literal minefield of low fat, high fat, low carb, high carb, high protein, low protein, this product, that product, it goes on and on.

Who can you trust?

Which &#8220;diet&#8221; is going to work best for me?

If you go on a traditional &#8220;diet,&#8221; chances are you will gain ALL your weight back plus a couple extra pounds to boot.

In the free teleseminar, you will learn:

&#8226; How to eat to lose body fat
&#8226; What to eat to lose body fat
&#8226; When to eat to lose fat
&#8226; Why you eat this way

&#8226; Why losing fat and not osing weight is the goal
&#8226; Why eating Krispy Kreme donuts (my favorite), pizza, ice cream, fast food, and anything and everything you want will help you in your fat loss

I&#8217;ve been weight training and eating &#8220;differently&#8221; from my peers for over 25 years. I&#8217;ve tried virtually every supplement, workout routine, and diet out there. Finally, all that experience; coupled with my education of how the body works on a chemical, physical, and mental level; and a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, has provided me with the knowledge to find out what really works.
