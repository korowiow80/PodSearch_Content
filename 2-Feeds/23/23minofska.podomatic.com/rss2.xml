      <title>Freinds of Mine</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1263350/600x600_2540347.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fifth Thursday this month? You know what that calls for, right? A rules breakin' episode! How does this episode break all the rules? Well listen up, I'll tell you, but I'm also going to tell you some totally non-mind blowing stuff about ska and friends. So, once you've been a ska fan for long enough you make friends. I know I have, some friends for LIFE! But also some friends in bands. I was in a band (lots of horns, no ska beat, not very good) that played along side ska and power pop bands regularly, so you know &quot;inside the scene&quot; friends. Friends that when you'd see each other outside a local show at a Denny's or the local record shop or book store you'd stop and talk and hang out. You'd end up at the same parties and you were always glad to see them. You'd pay to go see them play if you weren't on the bill that night, but they'd get you in free anyway. Those kinds of friends. They might not help you move, but they'll always recognize you when they see you and will spend a few hours over drinks before either one of you moves far away from your hometown. Heck, they may even attend your wedding. There are bigger bands that have had, at one time or another, someone I know in them. There are also other bands that I got to know, who are totally cool, but we're more like acquaintances. Also, recently I've started making friends in bands again, but I've yet to meet some of these wonderful folks in person. So here it is, some true blue friends in legitimate ska bands! And even though I didn't move from Peoria, IL until I got out to Los Angeles, I did spend a lot of time in Madison, WI and Indianapolis, IN to get to know those guys. So, how am I breaking the rules? Some of these bands share members (sometimes the very guy in the band I knew) and that's something I try not to do in a series of episodes let alone one. I do it for variety of music's sake. But eff it! I just had my birthday and I wanted to listen to my friends' bands and share them with you!

      <title>May Mix Tape : Side B (part two)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1263350/600x600_6326271.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we are, at the end of our journey through out the 90s ska that made a huge impression on me as a young man. These songs are so classic! &quot;Direction&quot; is the first song off the first ska album I ever bought! You just can't beat the Toasters! Potshot seemed to be all over the place back then, but I don't remember many people talking about them. Mealticket and Inspecter 7 never really seemed to get the respect they deserved back then. I'm happy to see most people remember them quite fondly. The Slackers, one of the greats, not much more could be said about them. My Superhero are the nicest guys to eat at a Chicago Cracker Barrel with and talk about music. Let's Go Bowling was always one of my favorites and one of the few I never got to see live. And who didn't belt out &quot;Teen Idol&quot; out with their friends while driving around town from a local show the Denny's/Perkin's/Steak n' Shake? I know who did though, me, Timmy Dee and Joshy Tea, you couldn't stop us! There it is, this virtual 90min 90s ska tape is up!

the Toasters &#8211; Direction (Dub 56 &#8217;94)
Potshot &#8211; Someone to Lean On (Pots and Shots &#8217;97)
Mealticket &#8211; Lisa Marie (Lisa Marie &#8217;97)
Inspecter 7 &#8211; Cookin&#8217; (the Infamous &#8217;97)
the Slackers &#8211; Have the Time (the Question &#8217;98)
My Superhero &#8211; Going Somewhere (Solid State 14 &#8217;97)
Let&#8217;s Go Bowling &#8211; Sick Fish (Music to Bowl By &#8217;91)
Pharmaceutical Bandits &#8211; Teen Idol (Those Damn Bandits &#8217;97)

This is the final part of a 90min ska mix tape from the nineties that ran each Thursday throughout May.

If you don't know some of these bands, well, I feel sorry for you, because these are bands that would TEAR DOWN THE HOUSE LIVE! Ok, I haven't seen all of these bands live, but the ones I have, I can vouch for. Secret Society rocked the back room of the Peoria Pizza Works, Stretch Armstrong stole the show from Mustard Plug and Hepcat, doctormanette snapped me out a mid show stupor in at a Rockford skate park and then made the entire crowd at the Metro in Chicago forget that they were there to see the Aquabats, and seeing Unsteady at the Knitting Factory is flat out one of my personal life high-lights. The Scofflaws are a true classic in the ska scene, so check them out right away. Also hit up Punch the Clown who was always a ska compilation ringer, and when you get an album of theirs and hear how great all the songs are it is even more clear how great they were. Speaking of ska compilations, Insatiable and this song was the shining star on the &quot;Ska: the 3rd Wave Vol. II&quot; that just about everyone I knew had a copy of growing up. It was a decent comp, but that song was just killer! It's a excellent way to get us to the midway point of side B.

Secret Society &#8211; Did it Again (Can I Borrow Your Beard? &#8217;97)
Stretch Armstrong &#8211; Drool (Lollygag &#8217;94)
Punch the Clown &#8211; Leaving (the Secret Life of Punch the Clown &#8217;98)
the Scofflaws &#8211; Nude Beach (Ska in Hi-Fi &#8217;95)
doctormanette &#8211; Happiness (the Same Thing Over &amp; Over &#8217;99)

      <title>May Mix Tape : Side A (part two)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1263350/600x600_6326262.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more mid to late 90s ska excitement. Still in mix cassette form. As near as I can get in this digital age at least. This is the second half of the first side and maybe some of the names aren&#8217;t as big as were on the last one, but they run just a deep in my musical life as any of the rest. Heck, four of these bands I&#8217;ve seen live a hand full of times and they always brought the fun. Back when there was a ska show, just about every other week (where I grew up at least) bands that brought the house down live were what you wanted to go see, no questions asked, that&#8217;s what it was all about. A band just needed to get that crowd dancing, with punky excitement or steady grooves, it mattered not. If there were more people on the dance floor than standing with their arms crossed around the edges, if there were more soak through suits, dresses and t-shirts than there was dry, if there was hardly any barrier between the band and the crowd, well, you went and bought their tape or CD, you kicked in a few extra for some after show beers and you made sure to see them the next time they were near.

Johnny Socko &#8211; Vinnie&#8217;s Hooch (Oh, I do Hope it is Roast Beef! &#8217;95)
the Articles &#8211; Mr. Pink (Flip F&#8217;real &#8217;97)
the Insteps &#8211; Don&#8217;t Ask (Eleven Steps to Power &#8217;96)
the NY Citizens &#8211; Boxer Shorts (the Rude Awakening 2 comp &#8217;90)
the Aquabats! &#8211; Marshmallow Man (the Return of the Aquabats! &#8217;96)
the Robustos &#8211; Don&#8217;t Stay Away (Introducing&#8230; &#8217;97)
Save Ferris &#8211; Sorry My Friend (Introducing&#8230; &#8217;96)

      <itunes:summary>Even more mid to late 90s ska excitement. Still in mix cassette form. As near as I can get in this digital age at least. This is the second half of the first side and maybe some of the names aren&#8217;t as big as were on the last one, but they run just a deep in my musical life as any of the rest. Heck, four of these bands I&#8217;ve seen live a hand full of times and they always brought the fun. Back when there was a ska show, just about every other week (where I grew up at least) bands that brought the house down live were what you wanted to go see, no questions asked, that&#8217;s what it was all about. A band just needed to get that crowd dancing, with punky excitement or steady grooves, it mattered not. If there were more people on the dance floor than standing with their arms crossed around the edges, if there were more soak through suits, dresses and t-shirts than there was dry, if there was hardly any barrier between the band and the crowd, well, you went and bought their tape or CD, you kicked in a few extra for some after show beers and you made sure to see them the next time they were near.

      <title>May Mix Tape : Side A (part one)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1263350/600x600_6326261.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting older makes on nostalgic for their youth and instead of just wallowing in it, I'm taking you on that journey. Throughout May I'll be providing you with a 90min mix tape divided into 4 parts each Thursday. That's not all, but this mix tape will be set in the 90's, when mix tapes were still king. The average year will more than likely be 1996 or 1997 when we come to the end of it. This is filled with music that evokes those years more than any other and are all mix tape &quot;classic&quot; tracks tracks for me. I hope you enjoy this month's ride down memory lane for me. This is the stuff that got me into ska as a kid, it is my roots, and I don't care that they are showing.

After a few exchanges back and forth about music I came to learn about a ton of new bands that I'd missed and make a new online pal. Some of her suggestions were already mixed into the last episode, but this one was stuff she flipped me on to, or I was listening to while tracking some of this down. This ones of you Bezz, now rock out!

      <title>Special : Behind the Scene Vol 1 : Tazy Phyllipz of the Ska Parade</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1263350/600x600_6213253.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this episode I'm taking you a bit behind the ska scene such as it is, to people who have an imprint on the scene with out being in a band or running a label. In this episode I'm talking to Tazy Phyllipz of the long running ska radio show &quot;the Ska Parade&quot;. We talk about a lot of the bands that have been on &quot;the Ska Parade&quot; since it started in 1989. Not only that but we talk a lot about the upcoming &quot;Viva Ska Vegas&quot; ska show on April 28th. With Tazy and I being old ska guys we tell a lot of stories, and while my original intention was to fill this episode w/ a lot of music, I just couldn't bear to cut any of us talking (besides a few seconds at the beginning where were both like &quot;hello..?&quot; &quot;uh... hello?&quot; and a bit near the end where we talk about Madness that was dropped for time). I hope you enjoy it, we had a lot of fun talking, and I think it is good to get to know someone like Tazy just a little bit better.

Doing what you want, without a worry about shame. I don't care what people say and how they define ska music, I know what I know. There's nothing missing in any of these great songs, even if some would have you believe that there is. If you guess what is missing easily, then you've been paying attention. If you never figure it out because it is all such awesome music, then you're awesome too. If you are at pains to figure it out after repeating this episode time and time again, don't worry so much, it was never a contest anyway.

      <title>Interview : Jorge Pezzimenti</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1263350/600x600_6111531.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to talk to Jorge Pezzimenti and it was awesome! Jorge is better known as the Jorge of Jorge &amp; the Landladies or as a former member of the Pietasters. Jorge is hilarious! So get ready for a ton of laughing on my part. We talk a lot about the sound of his new album &quot;Monobound&quot; as well as Sunday morning albums, songs about hand-jobs and Mighty Mighty Bosstones cassette tapes. Jorge gives us some insight into the song &quot;Stop Locking the Front Door&quot; which plays at the end of this episode.

Check out Monobound from Whatevski : http://whatevski.org/releases/dip/23/Jorge-and-The-Landladies-Monobound
Also hit up the facebook page for Jorge &amp; the Landladies : http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jorge-and-the-Landladies/251497958252642

The intro for this episode is &#8220;Let's Not Rewind These&quot; by Jorge and the Landladies, off of the &#8220;Monobound&#8221;.

If you&#8217;re in a ska band and would like to be interviewed or have a song featured, please email me at radjose[at]gmail[dot]com.

      <itunes:summary>I got to talk to Jorge Pezzimenti and it was awesome! Jorge is better known as the Jorge of Jorge &amp; the Landladies or as a former member of the Pietasters. Jorge is hilarious! So get ready for a ton of laughing on my part. We talk a lot about the sound of his new album &quot;Monobound&quot; as well as Sunday morning albums, songs about hand-jobs and Mighty Mighty Bosstones cassette tapes. Jorge gives us some insight into the song &quot;Stop Locking the Front Door&quot; which plays at the end of this episode.

Check out Monobound from Whatevski : http://whatevski.org/releases/dip/23/Jorge-and-The-Landladies-Monobound
Also hit up the facebook page for Jorge &amp; the Landladies : http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jorge-and-the-Landladies/251497958252642

In this episode, me, James and Randy hang out and talk about some of the biggest ska shows we've been to and some of the best ska shows we've been to, all the while sharing songs. Why James and Randy? Why because, like me, they also run their own ska podcasts! So yeah, it is like a big ska podcaster meet up, and you the listener are rewarded! There was a LOT of stuff recorded for this and to tell the truth, I thought the finished product was going to be a lot more talk heavy, but as I was editing it all together this was starting to take shape and BAM! I knew it was the way to go!

Ok, except for food, drinks and good music, what do we all need? Friends, that's right, friends. So why do anything alone when we can do it with some good friends. And if we have enough, why not call over a few more? That's exactly what was happening here, some great groups producing some great music with that little something extra. That is, an extra special guest on the song.

      <title>Interview : Pressure Cooker</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1263350/600x600_5877213.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm the lucky guy who not only got to talk to not just one, not just two but three members of the legendary Boston reggae band Pressure Cooker! I spent most of my time talking to Jeffrey Eckman (Drums) and Robin Teague (Tenor Saxophone) about the formation of the band as well as their concert backing up some first wave ska luminaries. We are eventually joined by Adam Dobkowski (Guitar) and talk a short bit about the writing process that Pressure Cooker employees. We then shift gears to talk a bit about how their using kickstarter to raise money for their newest album! Only $800 left to go at the time this episode is getting posted! Not to shabby! We also discus a bit about the ups and downs of the ska scene in America through out the late '90s into the Twenty First Century. There's lots of laughing, you've been warned!

Check out Pressure Cooker&#8217;s website : http://www.PressureCooker.net

The intro for this episode is &#8220;One Kind of Love&quot; also by the Georgetown Orbits, off of their album &#8220;What She Wants&#8221;. The outro bit is taken from a live version of their song &quot;What She Wants&quot;.

We then shift gears to talk a bit about how their using kickstarter to raise money for their newest album! Only $800 left to go at the time this episode is getting posted! Not to shabby! We also discus a bit about the ups and downs of the ska scene in America through out the late '90s into the Twenty First Century. There's lots of laughing, you've been warned!

The intro for this episode is &#8220;One Kind of Love&quot; also by the Georgetown Orbits, off of their album &#8220;What She Wants&#8221;. The outro bit is taken from a live version of their song &quot;What She Wants&quot;.

      <title>How Pieces Move</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1263350/600x600_5836170.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step up to play! Life is a game, so have fun before the board gets folded up and put away. Somedays I can get so pretentious about life and music, but I just need to step back and remember how everything is supposed to be. Don&#8217;t get so hung up on things, remember life is what you make of it, don&#8217;t get hung up on things, learn how to move and play the game.
