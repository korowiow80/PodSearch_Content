            <title>You Are The Guest Show 90 - Escape From Iran</title>
            <description>Darius Radmanesh was born in the U.S. to an American mother and an Iranian father.  Darius has written a book based on the true life experiences that he and his family endured during the nine years they were held hostage in Iran until he was helped by the U.S. State Department to escape from Iran in 1987.  Darius tells about the day Hezbollah grabbed him off the street and sent him to fight in the Iran/Iraq war of the 1980&apos;s to show that an American had given his life for the Khomeini regime. Dar also describes how he was able to escape from the Iranian Army and how he lived in the mountains for a year with a nomadic people named the Qashqai.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 89 - Osama and Pakistan</title>
            <description>Imran Anwar is back to discuss Osama Bin Laden, Pakistan, India, Iran, nuclear weapons, and how they&apos;re all connected.  We talk about Osama&apos;s recent call for Pakistanis to rebel against President Musharraf, and what types of political and military actions may accelerate the Iranian nuclear situation.  Imran also talks about his recent visit to Pakistan and share his observations on what the political climate is there and how America is seen today.  Imran asks me who do I think the next President will be, what is my opinion on the bailout of the financial industry, and if it was a good thing for the Iranian president not to be invited to the recent Ground Zero ceremonies.</description>

            <description>Author and financial expert for XM Satellite Radio&apos;s 169 The Power, William R. Patterson, joins us to talk about the financial crunch in the housing market, credit card companies, and how to avoid the financial pitfalls that many people fall into.  William shares some of the horror stories that people have told him concerning today&apos;s housing and lending problems, and we discuss who is to blame for the problems facing the housing market today.  William asks me what things could have accelerated my success when I started my own business 5 years ago, if there was a major set back in my life that actually became a stepping stone to greater success, and what kind of a legacy would I want to leave behind in life and the world.</description>

            <description>Filmmaker Sondra Lowell joins us and talks about how she invented the Film Sleepy genre by making films that are made to put the audience to sleep.  Sondra talks about what makes a film sleepy and tells about her book How to Make a Movie That Puts the Audience to Sleep.  I ask Sondra the difference between a film that&apos;s boring and a film that&apos;s sleepy, and the difference between being a visionary and being crazy.  I also put the new film sleepy movie genre though a few common sense scenarios.  Sondra asks me how I would market a movie that puts people to sleep, how I promoted my podcast, and would I be open to watch a movie that puts the audience to sleep.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 85 - Why Liberal Talk Shows Fail</title>
            <description>Podcaster, blogger, and Internet radio guru Art Lindsey joins us from Peoria to share his thoughts on radio and politics.  Art shares his thoughts on what the vibe is politically around the country, why liberal radio talk shows seem to fail, and if the Democratic lead Congress and their poor performance record will hurt the Democratic nominee in 2008.  We also talk in length about 10 candidates for President in which he gives me a thumbs up or thumbs down rating on each.  Art  asks me why I stopped broadcasting, what is Fort Dodge like, and what do I see as the future for podcasting, terrestrial radio, and satellite radio.</description>

            <description>When the calendar hits July, it&apos;s time for our mid-year news in review with award winning journalist Vern Beachy.  Vern and I talk about the stories that count and discuss why news rooms shove the stories we don&apos;t want to hear about down our throats.  Topics include the biggest taxpayer and consumer rip-off, the most over hyped tech fad, and our Hosebag of the Year candidates for 2007.   I also get Vern&apos;s thoughts on 10 presidential candidates as he rates them on a scale of 1 to 10 on how they&apos;re doing so far.  Vern asks me if I will be getting an iPhone, what I think about the Iowa Caucus and the straw poll, and my opinion on how well Iowa news reporters have been covering the candidates as they stomp through Iowa.</description>

            <description>Alex and Lyndon are members of the band 3 Blind Mice and live in the heart of London.  Alex, Lyndon, and I talk about the relationship between the U.S. and Britain and the relationship between Tony Blair and George Bush.  But it&apos;s not all politics in this show, because we wander into 9/11 conspiracy theories, pop music, Michael Jackson, Homeland Security, tour stories, groupie stories, humor, and religion.  Our original conversation was 2 hours in length and this show serves as the halfway point in our conversation with the second half to be released in July 2007.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 82 - Understanding the ACLU</title>
            <description>Lynndi Maddox is a practicing attorney and teacher who has brought forth 2 ACLU cases most notably Maddox vs. Moore, which many would know as the 10 Commandments Case.  Lynndi tells about her litigation dealing with the religious monument and how it impacted her profession and her life.  Lynndi and I also discuss if the the ACLU is seeking justice or do they just have a political axe to grind, and we have a spirited discussion on attorney talk, the role of lawyers in lawmaking, and why the average American citizen distrusts attorneys in the lawmaking process.  I also ask Lynndi her opinion on 2 non-ACLU class action suits to find out why they would be considered good lawsuits and get her thoughts on 10 presidential candidates to see which ones she would consider ACLU friendly.  Lynndi asks me why gas prices are so high, what is my opinion of the death penalty, and what would it take to convince Al Gore to run in 2008.</description>

            <itunes:subtitle>Guest:  Lynndi from Mobile, Alabama</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Lynndi Maddox is a practicing attorney and teacher who has brought forth 2 ACLU cases most notably Maddox vs. Moore, which many would know as the 10 Commandments Case.  Lynndi tells about her litigation dealing with the religious monument and how it impacted her profession and her life.  Lynndi and I also discuss if the the ACLU is seeking justice or do they just have a political axe to grind, and we have a spirited discussion on attorney talk, the role of lawyers in lawmaking, and why the average American citizen distrusts attorneys in the lawmaking process.  I also ask Lynndi her opinion on 2 non-ACLU class action suits to find out why they would be considered good lawsuits and get her thoughts on 10 presidential candidates to see which ones she would consider ACLU friendly.  Lynndi asks me why gas prices are so high, what is my opinion of the death penalty, and what would it take to convince Al Gore to run in 2008.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Tom, the host of the &quot;Leftwing Nutjob Podcast&quot; returns for our second conversation about the left, the middle, and the right.  I ask Tom if he agrees or disagrees about the Democrats job rating vs. Bush, lobby reform, Democrats and the Iraqi timeline, and has President Bush held on to the wrong people for too long.  I also ask Tom his opinions about 10 presidential candidates and find out what Democrats he likes and which Republicans he&apos;s willing to give a listen to.  Tom asks me about my trusted news sources, if I stray away from certain sources because of bias, and if I think some good candidates get out of the presidential race too early.</description>

            <description>Imran Anwar back from his busy schedule of appearances on CNN and Fox News Channel to talk about the challenges the U.S. continues to face in the Middle East and the key countries who play a major role in either stabilizing the region or de-stabilizing it.  The cast of characters we discuss include Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Russia, China, and India.  Imran gives us his opinions on my list of 10 presidential candidates and how they will fare with the problems in the Middle East and how the Muslim world will see them.   Imran asks me if we are on the right track as a nation, has the Republican Party learned it&apos;s lesson from last fall, and what would I do if I woke up one morning and found myself married to Ann Coulter.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 78 - Views of America From Abroad</title>
            <description>Jon Peder is a 17 year-old high school student from Norway and is the Deputy Chairman of his country&apos;s socialist youth organization.   Jon Peder talks about his political involvement with his youth group and tells about a recent issue that they took action on.  I find out Jon Peder&apos;s impressions about America and Americans, and try to dispel some myths about the U.S. that seem to have been generated by his viewing of American mass media such as TV shows and films.  Jon Peder asks me what is my view on gay marriage, if I think a third political party will rise to prominence in the United States, if the KKK is gaining ground in America, and if Americans only care about themselves and don&apos;t care about what is happening in the rest of the world.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 76 - Political Apathy In America</title>
            <description>Wayne is a working artist and musician who joins us from Omaha, Nebraska.  In an e-mail that Wayne sent to the show, he wrote that he was not a very political person and had given up on the American political system.  During our conversation we talk about the root of his political apathy and I try to show Wayne that as Americans we all share a common thread to the American political system.  In our conversation I also try to explain that the thousands of dollars that we as American citizens spend in taxes each year is also worth an additional 20 minutes of our time a year writing to our congressional representatives via e-mail.  Wayne asks me if paparazzi should have press credentials, if Internet television will catch on and if that will be a good thing, and where do I think podcasting will be going including the potential for government regulation of podcasting.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mevio.com/&quot;&gt;  Mevio &lt;/a&gt;  {Mevio-60510edc4e46c02ca931643ec537d23e}</description>

            <description>Sam and Deidre are law partners from Alabama and I&apos;ve asked them to share both their personal and professional opinions on politics, lawyers, attorney ethics, and some potential legal issues surrounding the death of Anna Nicole Smith.  I ask their opinion concerning Howard K. Stern&apos;s ethical behavior as a practicing attorney and toss out various scenarios to find out if they think there could be grounds for a civil suit if someone wanted to pursue them.  Sam shares a couple of stories about how the state bar associations can be selective in who they allow to practice law and who they decide to go after.  I also ask Sam and Deidre to share their opinions on 5 Democratic and 5 Republican Presidential candidates.  Sam and Deidre ask me what are the three worst problems in the world today and what would I do to change them, why isn&apos;t there a larger demonstrative outrage about the Iraqi War, and what three things would I take with me if I were exiled for life to another country.</description>

Danny works for what he calls an &quot;evil HMO&quot; and gives us an insider&apos;s view to how one HMO tried to rally their employees during a closed-door company meeting.  You&apos;ll hear Danny&apos;s opinions about whether or not the U.S. government should be involved in a universal healthcare plan, and if the U.S. should do anything about high prescription drug prices. Danny and I talk about when the common everyday guy who decides to run for President, and Danny gives his opinions on 5 Democratic and 5 Republican Presidential candidates.  Danny asks me if buying and annexing Mexico would be an easier solution to the immigration problem, who my favorite Beatle is, and whether I prefer Hannity or Colmes.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 73 - Do Lawyers Make Good Politicians?</title>
            <description>With over 150 millionaires in Congress the average American may have this question in their mind: Regardless of their humble beginnings, is it possible today for these millionaires to genuinely be able to relate to what the average American citizen faces on a day to day basis?  Have they been isolated from average American life and lived in a circle of power and wealth for too long that they couldn&apos;t possibly have true empathy for the what the average American goes through today in 2007?  We talk about these questions with author Jeffery S. Miller who lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.   Since the majority of members of Congress are also lawyers, Jeffery and I discuss the connection between the bad public image that lawyers have with the bad public image that politicians have.  Jeffery also gives us his quick “average guy on the street” impression on 5 Democratic and 5 Republican candidates for President.  Jeffery asks me what I think we should do about immigration, do I think Congress will get anything done during this next session, and what do I think needs to be done to win the Iraqi War.</description>

            <description>Paul is on his nationwide tour of the Third World American Podcast and made a stop to talk with us in Fort Dodge, Iowa.  Paul and I have a good honest conversation about the homeless, poverty, and good and bad choices.  We take a few detours when Paul talks about his definition of good and evil, morality, stupidity, and what he saw as the injustice during the hanging of  Saddam Hussein.  As we wrap up our discussion we talk about a solution for trying to slow down economic poverty due to being heavily in debt.   Paul asks me why there isn&apos;t a war on poverty, and if the Presidential advisers are more important than the President.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.podcastalley.com/&quot;&gt; My Podcast Alley feed!&lt;/a&gt; {pca-b9e99cf9a760c4e1a98824b422e5cfe2}</description>

Paul and I have a good honest conversation about the homeless, poverty, and good and bad choices.

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 69 - 2006 Year in Review</title>
            <description>It&apos;s time for the 2006 Year in Review and it&apos;s always a pleasure to talk about the news, issues, and people from  this past year with Vern Beachy.  We talk about the usual topics like biggest news story of the year, Person of the Year, biggest taxpayer rip-off, and the biggest consumer rip-off, but we also talk about the biggest surprise of the year, the small story that needed more attention, and the biggest &quot;who cares&quot; news stories for 2006.  Vern and I also hand out the 2006 Hosebag of the Year Award.  Vern asks me what I&apos;ve learned from my interviews this past year, what was my worst interview of the year, and which was my favorite interview of the year.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 67 - A Million Dollars in Credit Card Debt</title>
            <description>Author Harrine Freeman from Washington D.C. is our guest to talk about an important holiday topic, the credit card business.  Harrine and I discuss why the credit card companies target undergraduate students and individuals who will most likely not pay their bills on time.  We talk about the root and the size of the problem in the U.S. and I dig into how credit card companies market and prey upon those individuals that are most vulnerable to interest fees and late charges, and you&apos;ll hear a credit horror story of how someone became $1,000,000 in debt.  We also discuss why the educational system in this country isn&apos;t doing enough to teach young people how to manage their finances, and what pitfalls some consumers fall into during the holiday season.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 66 - 6 Degrees from Truth: Michael Moore</title>
            <description>Filmmaker Adam Reuter from Baltimore, Maryland joins us to talk about his latest DVD, &quot;The 6 Degrees from Truth:  Michael Moore&quot;.  I ask Adam if Michael Moore is still a working class guy, and if his films are more personal essays than documentaries. We dig into the inconsistencies in two of Michael Moore&apos;s films, Bowling For Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11, and I play devil&apos;s advocate with Michael Moore&apos;s creative license on both of these films.  Adam and I also talk about the Teacher&apos;s Guide for Fahrenheit 9/11 and how a far left liberal view is being presented in some classrooms across America.  Adam asks me what was my most embarrassing teenage moment, if I had the choice what time period would I like to live in, and what was my favorite Christmas gift as a child.</description>

Midas Welby, their Presidential Candidate for 2008 is the main spokesperson during our conversation and he&apos;s supported by his Vice Presidential running mate Larry, and Dee who serves as the campaign manager.  I ask them why they are the catalyst for change in the U.S., details about their campaign, and about their solution for the healthcare crisis and the war in Iraq.  I also ask Midas, Larry, and Dee about international issues including the trade deficit with China and relations with Pakistan.  At the end of our conversation Midas explains their proposal for income tax reform which includes a 4 percent flat tax.</description>

            <description>Peter Reddy returns for another conversation on what is going on in Australia and the world, and how the world views the United States.  Peter and I discuss the recent comments by Muslim leader Sheik Taj el-Din al Hilaly, and discuss whether the U.S. has more friends or more enemies.  Throughout the discussion we talk about China, and how Chinese imports are ruining both the Australian and American economies.  Peter asks me if I think there will be a time when religion will no longer be relevant, if the world would be the same without art, and if I think the Internet will kill Television.</description>

Will asks me if I prefer ninjas or pirates, if I could sucker punch one person who would it be, and what is my favorite band of all time.</description>

Barry and I play true or false with a number of issues in the news today including North Korea, President Bush, Hillary Clinton, Mel Gibson, and George Washington.  We also discuss why the Muslims have given Osama Bin Laden a free pass, and I give my opinion on a trade to bring in Osama alive.  Barry asks me if money were not an issue what would I do for the rest of my life, what sporting event would I love to see, and who would make up the perfect rock band if I could choose the members.</description>

            <description>We&apos;ve asked Imran Anwar back from his busy schedule of appearances on CNN and Fox News Channel to talk about what is going on right now in North Korea, Iran, and Iraq.  First and foremost we talk about North Korea and  the country&apos;s intent on testing a nuclear weapon.  We discuss whether Osama Bin Laden is still alive or not, why the Muslim world has given Osama Bin Laden a free pass, and we take the gloves off over issues including whether President Bush is a religious zealot or not, the comparison between President Bush and Ronald Reagan, and what was the role that Congress played in starting the War on Terror.  I also ask if there has ever been a time when the Arab world hasn&apos;t hated the United States.  Imran asks me what I think the solution to Iraq is, will my solution make Iraq a larger breeding ground for terrorists, and is it a matter of time before members of Hezbollah attack the United States because of our support of Israel.</description>

            <description>Tom lives in the Detroit area and is the host of the Leftwing Nutjob Podcast.  Tom and I talk about how people form their political views and talk about how good it is to share opposing political views.  Then we get into the political views.  I ask what are the Democrats offering to make a voter say they&apos;re tough on terrorism, how the left views the Muslim world, and how the left is helped or hurt by Michael Moore&apos;s films.  I also ask if Hillary Clinton should give up her presidential aspirations.  Tom and I also get out the crystal ball and give our predictions for the Democratic and Republican tickets in 2008.  Tom asks me about Gregg Rolie vs. Jonathan Cain in a Journey showdown, what do I think have been the factors behind the decline of terrestrial radio, and if I was President Bush what would I have done differently in conducting the War on Terror.</description>

            <itunes:subtitle>Guest:  Tom, host of the Leftwing Nutjob Podcast</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Tom lives in the Detroit area and is the host of the Leftwing Nutjob Podcast.  Tom and I talk about how people form their political views and talk about how good it is to share opposing political views.  Then we get into the political views.  I ask what are the Democrats offering to make a voter say they&apos;re tough on terrorism, how the left views the Muslim world, and how the left is helped or hurt by Michael Moore&apos;s films.  I also ask if Hillary Clinton should give up her presidential aspirations.  Tom and I also get out the crystal ball and give our predictions for the Democratic and Republican tickets in 2008.  Tom asks me about Gregg Rolie vs. Jonathan Cain in a Journey showdown, what do I think have been the factors behind the decline of terrestrial radio, and if I was President Bush what would I have done differently in conducting the War on Terror.</itunes:summary>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 58 - September Sacrifice</title>
            <description>Mark Horner is the author of September Sacrifice, a fascinating book about the Girly Chew Hossencofft Murder case.  It&apos;s a true story about a decent, hard-working woman, her greedy soon-to-be ex-husband who is a master manipulator, and his new girlfriend/accomplice who believed that reptilian shape shifting aliens live among us.  Mark asks me what a person needs to start and maintain a successful podcast, if I think the future of traditional radio programming is threatened by podcasting, and if I wonder where my career would have gone had I stayed on-the-air as an announcer.</description>

            <description>Thom is the MC, writer, and co-creator of The Flying Cat Circus.  Thom talks about his show and how much trust is involved when he&apos;s sawing an apple in half with a chain saw while someone else holds it in their mouth.  Thom tells how he&apos;s been injured practicing his show, and Thom also shares a funny story about the worst gig he ever did from a Harley-Davidson dealership that also featured a guitarist from Warrant.  Thom asks me what podcasts do I listen to, what is my favorite tech toy, and if I was in a circus what would my act be.  Musical Guest is Farewell Redemption with their songs Release Me and Get By.</description>

            <description>Patrick is known as the Armchair President and has launched a non-traditional political campaign for President of the United States. Patrick and I discuss his non-traditional campaign in depth including his lack of political experience and his solutions for the problems that face our country today.  Patrick describes his view of how our Constitution has eroded, and shares whom he would choose as his Vice Presidential running mate if he received the Democratic Nomination for 2008.  Patrick asks me which episodes of this show is the most popular with our audience and which is my personal favorite, what I think about the War on Terror, and where would I like to see my podcast be in the future.</description>

            <description>Mike lives in San Francisco and is the host of the Cool As Hell Theatre Podcast.  Mike and I talk about the San Francisco Fringe Festival and some of the festival&apos;s featured artists and performances.  There are some strange ones at the SF Fringe Festival, including a performance based around a fictional suicide art movement, which begs me to ask the question if these performers are disconnected from the rest of the world.  We also talk about the arrest of John Mark Karr and what people in San Francisco are saying about it.  Mike asks me what would I tell the victims of Hurricane Katrina right now if I was the President, what makes me an advertising guru, and what three motorcycles would I take with me if I were stranded on a desert  island.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 53 - 9/11 Truth Movement</title>
            <description>Eddie is a 28 year-old native of  Dublin and hosts his own vidcast named TedPod.  Eddie describes what Dublin is like, and some tips for people who visit Ireland.  But the bulk of our conversation centers around Eddie&apos;s examination of the 9/11 truth movement and his theories as to who conducted the attacks on the World Trade Center, how they did it, and what their motive was.  Eddie talks about the face-less elite, puppet governments, remote control commercial airliners, passengers being gassed, phone calls from the planes being electronically recreated, and the conspiracy that would be conducted by the mass media if someone came forward with information on this plot.  Eddie asks me if I believe the attacks on the World Trade Center was an inside job, where do I see the world 10 years from now, and does money make you happier.  By the way, you can hear me pounding my head on the desk at the 41:45 mark.  Encore presentation from August 21, 2006.</description>

            <description>Samuel is a 19-year old blogger and podcaster from Canberra, Australia.  Samuel and I talk about forum bullies and he tells of his negative experience with another blogger.  Samuel describes the condition of Australia today, we find out what Australians are saying about the war between Israel and Hezbollah, and what is the biggest international concern of Australia.  Samuel asks me to share a weird dream that I had recently, what advice could I give to someone that wants to start their own podcast, and if I had the power to change one thing in the world, what would that be.</description>

            <description>Steve was our very first guest, and we&apos;ve brought him back to compare how his view on the world has changed over the past year.  We revisit the issues of high gas prices and terrorism, and we also talk about the recent war between Israel and Hezbollah.  I ask Steve what our country should be doing more of, Steve talks about the issues in Minnesota, and we get the crystal ball out and look at where Russia and Cuba will be in 10 years.  Steve also shares a funny radio story that includes you know who.  Steve asks me what was my favorite Mel Brooks movie, which musical performer influenced me the most, and where do I see myself in 5 years.</description>

            <description>Toby is the founder of NBX.com and we talk about the sports betting business.  And big business it is.  Toby tells us how big the sports betting industry has become, who is doing it, and who the big players are.  I ask Toby when did poker become a sport, and we talk about the recent arrest of David Carruthers, CEO of the online gaming company Bet On Sports.  For all you who play fantasy football, Toby gives some insights on how he picks his players for winning fantasy football season.  Toby asks me who invented the window envelope, if I think a porn star will ever become President of the United States, and if I think the current administration is the worst in history.  Then we start to talk politics.  Funny how the conversation always turns to politics on this show.</description>

            <description>Charley and Carol from Israelisms Podcast are back and give us an amazing insight to what is going on in Israel during the current war with Hezbollah.  You will find out what your not seeing when you watch the American and international news networks, who is covering the war the best and who is the worst.  Charley and Carol also describe how worthless the U.N. is, what everyday life is like since the war started, how they see the connection between Hezbollah, Syria and Iran, and why you should not be considered a civilian if you have bombs in your basement. Charley and Carol also have a special message for Americans and to our listeners around the world.  Charley and Carol ask me what is my favorite rock group of all-time, what daytime talk show host I would like to interview, and who I thought did the best news interviews.  By the way, you can hear the  fighter jets over Israel at the 26:45 mark, and the cicadas in Iowa at the 23:10 mark.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 48 - Imran Anwar, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran</title>
            <description>Imran Anwar is a frequent and popular media guest, including live interviews and appearances on CNN and Fox News Channel as an expert on global business strategy, socio political affairs, and South East Asia.  Imran and I go toe-to-toe on Pakistan and their association with North Korea and Iran.  Imran describes the terrorist movement in the Middle East, why North Korea has the most dangerous leader in the world, and why the world cannot afford a nuclear armed or an extremely wealthy Iran.  I also prod Imran to give me an example of one positive Muslim role model that the world can look up to today.  Imran asks me what the average American thinks of Muslims, do I think all Muslims are trying to do the west in or is it just a few, and what can we do as Americans to build bridges throughout the world.  By the way, count how many times the word nutjob is used in the show.</description>

            <title>You Are The Guest Show 47 - Bill Richardson, RC Gorman, and the FBI Confidential Files</title>
            <description>There are many unanswered questions about Governor Bill Richardson&apos;s relationship with famed artist RC Gorman.  In October of 1997, the FBI began collecting information regarding numerous suspected sexual relationships RC Gorman had with children that spanned over 20 years.  Did Bill Richardson know about RC Gorman&apos;s illegal activities that involved transporting children across state and international boundaries for illegal sexual activities? If he did know, why didn&apos;t Governor Bill Richardson do something about it?  Award winning journalist Vern Beachy, who conducted his own investigative news reports tells what he learned about RC Gorman back in 1999 and shares brand new information including the depth of Gorman&apos;s association with New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and several catholic priests.</description>

            <description>Brad works in the advertising field and lives in Sydney, Australia and is involved in many things from film making, broadcasting and politics.  Brad and I talk about Australian politics, the corruption surrounding the Australian Wheat Board, and we have a very healthy discussion on civil liberties.  I prod Brad throughout our conversation with the question of whether there are good people who make bad decisions, bad people who make the occasional good decision, or whether it comes down to just good or bad people.  Brad asks me what I&apos;m the most proud about the United States, what I&apos;m least proud about the United States, and what motivates me in my everyday life.</description>

            <description>Erika lives in Cary, Illinois where she started a nonprofit organization called Giving Real Opportunities to Women (GROW) with the goal to provide a holistic service model to help welfare and single mothers pursue a college degree.  Erika and I talk about many issues facing the welfare system, the recipients of welfare, and the social workers who provide counsel.  We also talk about a Kentucky Derby winner and it&apos;s winnings that are presumed buried in GROW&apos;s backyard.  Erika asks me what question I would want Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates to ask me, what do I feel is the biggest misconception about welfare, and what do I think is the biggest cause that is being overlooked here in the United States.</description>
