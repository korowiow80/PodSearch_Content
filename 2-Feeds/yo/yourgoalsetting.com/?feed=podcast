What is it that these high-achievers possess that the rest don’t?</p>
<p>Simple&#8211; they were instilled with a burning desire to set and achieve their goals. Where did this desire come from, and how is it possible to harness this type of raging desire?</p>
<p><strong>Refuse to Accept Limits</strong>. There are people out there who will judge, criticize, even ridicule you for dreaming big. Refuse the naysayers the satisfaction of being even close to correct. At the end of the day, to dream big takes no more effort than it does to continue to live a life unlived.</p>
<p><strong>Put Your Back to the Wall</strong>. Cut yourself from your safety net, and suddenly you are fighting tooth-and-nail for everything. The most unappealing opponent is someone who has absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain. In today’s society, where we are all afforded a relatively decent standard of living compared to many places in the world, it is difficult to get this kind of desperate hunger. Sometimes it means cutting loose a relationship or a career.</p>
<p><strong>Decide What You Are Willing to Sacrifice</strong>. What are you willing to give up? In other words, what are you prepared to do to achieve this goal? If you are not willing to sacrifice time or extraneous activities to achieve this goal it is safe to assume that this goal will continue to go unachieved. Is it time with your friends and family? Having to block off time from the people you love can be a painful trade-off, and this is something for each person to decide on their own. Does this mean having to give up painful habits? For many people, this problem can be solved with better time management. Allocating a specific amount of time per day to their goal—no more, no less—can be an excellent way to pick up the action habit.</p>
<p><strong>Acquire the Action Habit</strong>. Desire explodes exponentially the more we act. It is a perpetuating fire within us that is fed by the daily actions that we take in the name of our goals. It is easy to get lost in analysing our overall goal that we forget that the most important step is to act.</p>

But what about the other side? Isn&#8217;t it possible that there are reasons to not set goals?</p>
<p>Here is a quick list of nine tongue-in-cheek reasons that setting goals and achieving them may not be the path for you.</p>
<p>1. <strong>You Don&#8217;t Want an Easy and Proven Way to Learn What You Want from Life.</strong> Goal setting is an incredibly simple way to discover what you desire. It&#8217;s a time-tested and guaranteed method to bring you the results you want. But learning how requires a little bit of work, and who has the time these days?</p>
<p>2. <strong>You Don&#8217;t Want Purpose or Direction.</strong> People with goals tend to know where they are going, and how they are going to get there. They arm themselves with a comprehensive plan of action, and anticipate roadblocks and setbacks so that they aren&#8217;t derailed when they hit them. This isn&#8217;t you. You go from dream to dream, hoping to maybe achieve one of them, leaning on the good will of others or pure luck to achieve great things.</p>
<p>3. <strong>You Don&#8217;t Desire to be More Productive and Efficient.</strong> You don&#8217;t want to grow a keen sense of focus that pushes away anything and everything that clutters up your life. You&#8217;re okay with wasting time every day on things that you aren&#8217;t really passionate about. You&#8217;re fine watching time dwindle away to tasks and people that aren&#8217;t that important to you.</p>
<p>4. <strong>You Can Live Without Building Your Self-Confidence.</strong> Those who are proficient at goal setting tend to feel pretty good about themselves; they bounce from achievement to achievement, piling up their self-confidence to levels to where they feel like they could take on the world on a daily basis.</p>
<p>5. <strong>You Would Rather Not See What You are Capable Of.</strong> Setting goals and achieving them would mean that you&#8217;d have to challenge yourself, something you&#8217;d rather not do. This could be for a variety of reasons; fear of failure, fear of success, fear of anything that could possibly lead to you having a better life. You&#8217;d prefer not to see what you are truly capable of, and it&#8217;s in this comfort zone that you live in from day to day.</p>
<p>6. <strong>You Don&#8217;t Want to Improve the Quality of Your Work/Relationship/Physical Health.</strong> Not having goals in these areas, and going about them moment-to-moment, results in lower performance. According to David McClelland (1917-1998), a prominent American psychological theorist who specialized in achievement motivation, high achievers are those with a very high need to accomplish goals. This desire to accomplish goals means that there is a demonstrated willingness to improve their standard of living-whether it&#8217;s getting in shape, getting a promotion at work, or improving a relationship with a spouse.</p>
<p>7. <strong>You Don&#8217;t Want to Get Absurdly Motivated About Your Life.</strong> Setting goals and achieving them means getting excited about making positive and life-lasting changes to your standard of living. It means that you get pumped to work towards something meaningful, and it means that you get even more motivated to keep going down that path when you pass the road posts you set for yourself.</p>
<p>8. <strong>You Don&#8217;t Want to Open Yourself to Possibilities and Opportunities.</strong> When embarking on a new journey, most goal-setters pick up knowledge and abilities along the way that they never imagined. A web entrepeneur will pick up opportunities and ideas from other web entrepeneurs along his journey by association in forums, etcetera. This knowledge is closed off to those who assume that they know everything.</p>
<p>9. <strong>You Don&#8217;t Want to Develop a Strong Sense of Self-Accountability.</strong> Goal-setters tend to have a sharp sense of self-responsibility. They are aware of the things that ultimately come down to them, and that it is in their interest to take responsibility. You are happy to blame others for your failures. You refuse to look at yourself when things don&#8217;t go your way. The reason you failed at something you hoped to achieve lies with everyone else; your peers, your boss, your friends or even your family.</p>

However, to truly unleash the capability of this time-tested method requires a simple system to track your progress and to keep you motivated along your journey.</p>
<p>Using a goal book full-fills these prerequisites. Here are six golden rules for using this priceless tool to manage our goals:</p>
<p><strong>1. Be Consistent.</strong> When we first start out on the path to our big dream, it is easy to be consumed by motivation. We are so fired up, so amped to achieve this goal that means so much to us that we dive full-bore into it without regard or thought regarding pacing ourselves. It&#8217;s not true that slow and steady wins the race. It&#8217;s the rabbit who can pace himself and go quick and steady who ultimately wins.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don&#8217;t Beat Yourself Up When Things Don&#8217;t Go According to Plan. </strong>We fail on occasion, no matter how good our intentions. Whether it&#8217;s because we didn&#8217;t know what we were getting into, or someone else got into our plans, the reasons are as varied as our own specific experiences. Whatever the reason for our missteps, you must face up to what this failure needs to become&#8211; a learning experience. You can either walk away with your tail between your legs, or walk away stronger and more prepared.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Measure Your Progress. </strong>It is difficult to realize that the goal is not just the destination, but the journey. Along the way you will astound yourself, you will surprise yourself, and you may even disappoint yourself. What is important however, is that you measure this progress to not only see where you have been, but how to get to that crucial next level. By using your goal book on a consistent basis and viewing your growth and advancement you will impress and motivate yourself to forge on.</p>
<p><strong>4. Re-evaluate.</strong> Don&#8217;t be afraid to change course if it is absolutely necessary. Sticking to a plan that is not working until the very end isn&#8217;t demonstrating persistence, it&#8217;s displaying stubbornness. If something is not working, do not be ashamed to try a different route. In the end it doesn&#8217;t matter that you followed your plan to the letter, it matters that you got there!</p>
<p><strong>5. Keep It On You.</strong> Your goal book should become a part of your daily life. Best of all, it doesn&#8217;t take more than a couple minutes a day to check up on your progress. You should be able to reference it daily to see what has to be done, where you are at, or even simply to remind yourself to act.</p>
<p><strong>6. Use It.</strong> We&#8217;ve all heard about the Law of Attraction; that energy goes where your attention goes. The more time and energy you put into your goal book, the more energy and focus you will extend into your achieving your goals. Sounds simple, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>The truly elite have learned that successful goal setting isn’t as simple as wanting something. They know that to have a goal is more than just wishful thinking, they possess the keen understanding that it’s a process that has to be followed.</p>
<p>Much like the series of calculated steps that a space shuttle requires before lifting into space, successful goal setting entails following a procedure that will hurtle you into the next atmosphere of achievement. Lucky for you, these steps are simple, yet extremely powerful.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Pick Your Goals for the Right Reasons. </strong>If your goal is to be rich, think hard about why it is that you want to be rich. Is it so that you can float around the world on a yacht while drinking expensive champagne? Or is it so that you can have a comfortable standard of living and provide for your family? There is nothing wrong with either, but the latter will give you a deeper sense of purpose and meaning.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Focus on Your Strengths</strong>. Search out the opportunities in the areas that you are comfortable or familiar in already. Achieving great things is a hard enough process without having to jump into something that you know nothing about. Successful goal setting means continually utilizing your strengths to get you ahead while keeping a secondary eye on the weaker parts of your game.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Visualize Your Goal</strong>. Did you know that our brain doesn’t know the difference between a real or imagined experience? When you take the time to sit down and truly concentrate on your goal, imagining every nook and cranny of it, almost feeling and sensing it, your brain interprets this as reality. This is an immensely powerful technique that you can use to infuse yourself with the desire and motivation to get through the difficult periods along your goal-setting journey. Once you can almost taste that goal, you are that much more likely to put in the effort to get after it.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Focus on Your Goals instead of Envying Others</strong>. It’s easy to look at others who have achieved what we have and feel a deep sense of envy or even resentment. Focusing on the achievements and processes of others can provide a quick educational benefit, but in most cases, this educational insight quickly turns to jealousy. What works for one person doesn’t guarantee it will work for you. Successful goal setting means you enjoy knowing that your journey is unique and special to you.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Don’t Give Up too Soon</strong>. Often times the difference between successful goal setting and utter ruin is just that tiny extra bit of persistence. It’s stunning to see how often success is just on the other side of a failure. Recognize the setbacks in the road for what they are—opportunities for you to shine in the face of adversity.</p>
<p><strong>6. Our Biggest Dreams Should Haunt Us</strong>. It’s a thought that will never quite go away. It’s around every corner, giving us subtle reminders, waiting for us to get on it and achieve it. The fact is, you will expend more energy doing nothing, by getting down on yourself for not doing it, than actually acting out your desires. Funny thing about working towards our biggest goals is that it doesn’t really feel like work after a little while. Embrace this feeling, because it will push you.</p>
<p><strong>7. Evaluate!</strong> Constantly strive to see what is working, and what is not. Don’t restrain yourself from tweaking things that aren’t working as well as you’d like, and expand where you are doing things well. Set a weekly or monthly reminder to go over your progress and readjust where necessary. Sometimes the difference between successful goal setting and failing is a simple tweak or two.</p>
<p>Successful <a href="http://www.yourgoalbook.com/" target="_new" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.yourgoalbook.com/?referer=');">goal setting</a> skills are within your reach. The next step is to get started. The truth is, there is nothing you can&#8217;t accomplish tomorrow that you can&#8217;t start today.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People from all types of background have gone on to achieve success at staggering heights. We&#8217;ve all heard this song and dance before; that it doesn&#8217;t matter where you are from or what your circumstances were, but rather, where you are going.</p>
<p>Since success and background are independent, it begs the question, why do some people choose success, and why do some people choose not to succeed?</p>
<p>Success tends to be the result of a decision on our part. At the end of the day, whether or not we achieve success in our endeavours comes down to whether or not we choose to act. A failure to act may originate in a desire to take the path of least resistance, or perhaps it&#8217;s because we are unable to see past the roadblock before us. Whatever the case may be in your particular experience, see if any of the following have ever applied to you:</p>
<p><strong>1. We Choose Not To Be Determined Enough.</strong> We decide to listen to the naysayers, to allow doubt to creep into our thinking. We start looking around at other people&#8217;s experiences, and begin to slowly decide that perhaps we are not as up to the task as we initially thought we were.</p>
<p><strong>2. We View Defeats as Much Larger than What They Actually Are.</strong> We are unable to see past the current failure/roadblock/obstacle. We believe that when we fail or stumble that the entire plan is faulty, or that we were not destined to accomplish our goal. When we are confronted with these momentary hits of failure, we tend to over-react, believe things are truly much worse than they are. In these crucial moments we are unable to see the larger picture, the greater strategy. Many people will lose a battle and forfeit the war. The fact is, your success and dreams is larger than this one roadblock or failure, so why allot it this kind of importance?</p>
<p><strong>3. We Don&#8217;t Expect More from Ourselves.</strong> We decide that we are unable to give that extra effort because it is too much work, it&#8217;s not worth it anyways; it hasn&#8217;t worked for someone else, so why would it work for us. Whether it&#8217;s an expectation we get from someone else, or something that has been imbedded in us, we are falsely led to believe that there is a low ceiling to what we are capable of achieving&#8211; when in reality, when we focus on things we are more than capable of astonishing ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>4. We Lose Focus Early in the Process.</strong> It&#8217;s easy to be distracted in a world of constant social messages, emails, advertisements, and offers promising to be the miracle cure for one and all. The successful among us find a way to tune out this noise and focus intently on what they want to achieve, and nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>5. We Choose a Goal or Dream that Doesn&#8217;t Mean All That Much to Us.</strong> Is your goal something that keeps you up at night? Is it something that you think about with every available thought? Is it something that you plot and scheme about while you are having dinner with friends, punching in the clock at work, or driving? Your goal should be an inescapable thought, a dream that simply will not go away. Why? Because this means that no matter what, you will go to the farthest ends of the Earth to achieve it. Failures on the way will be swatted aside, excuses will be shrugged off, and no one would even dare voicing their opposition to you. This is how you should feel about your dream.</p>
<p><strong>6. We Choose to Give Up.</strong> The word &#8220;no&#8221; is something that causes a near visceral reaction. From the time we were kids we have been told no when we asked for something, when we desired something. This continues into adulthood. Tell a grown man &#8220;no&#8221; and most of the time he will relent. Learn to not accept the status quo, to challenge the time and tested, and find your own way.</p>
<p><strong>7. We Decide to Stray off our Plan when It&#8217;s Not Necessary to Do So.</strong> We&#8217;ll see a shortcut and take it. We will stray from our plans the first chance we get if there&#8217;s even a scent that it means that we&#8217;ll get a shortcut out of it. We&#8217;re designed to take the path of least resistance; it&#8217;s been hardwired into our brains for thousands of years. However, the path of least resistance doesn&#8217;t always hold the key for long-term success.</p>
<p><strong>8. We Win a Couple Battles, then Think We&#8217;ve Come Far Enough.</strong> This happens often; someone sets on a path to their ultimate goal, gets the first couple steps out of the way, and then suddenly for seemingly no reason whatsoever, abandon their goal. Why does this happen? Because we grow a sense of satisfaction from our little victories so bloated that it robs us of our desire to continue on to greater things.</p>
<p><strong>9. We Pick Negative Goals.</strong> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get fat.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be 40 and still alone.&#8221; These goals are self-defeating, in the sense that you are playing to not lose, instead of playing to win. There is a subtle but very distinct difference between having a positive goal and having a negative goal. Avoid staking your future on goals based out of fear.</p>
<p><strong>10. We Refuse to Make the Necessary Changes.</strong> Often times, the difference between the present and a future full of success is a couple changes. Whether it&#8217;s a habit that needs to change, or a fresh perspective, we often catch ourselves in our old, destructive habits. Sometimes this means that we have to learn something that we originally might have thought unnecessary, or it means finally abandoning that pesky habit that has kept us back.</p>

		<itunes:summary>People from all types of background have gone on to achieve success at staggering heights. We&#8217;ve all heard this song and dance before; that it doesn&#8217;t matter where you are from or what your circumstances were, but rather, where you are going.
Since success and background are independent, it begs the question, why do some people choose success, and why do some people choose not to succeed?
Success tends to be the result of a decision on our part. At the end of the day, whether or not we achieve success in our endeavours comes down to whether or not we choose to act. A failure to act may originate in a desire to take the path of least resistance, or perhaps it&#8217;s because we are unable to see past the roadblock before us. Whatever the case may be in your particular experience, see if any of the following have ever applied to you:
1. We Choose Not To Be Determined Enough. We decide to listen to the naysayers, to allow doubt to creep into our thinking. We start looking around at other people&#8217;s experiences, and begin to slowly decide that perhaps we are not as up to the task as we initially thought we were.
2. We View Defeats as Much Larger than What They Actually Are. We are unable to see past the current failure/roadblock/obstacle. We believe that when we fail or stumble that the entire plan is faulty, or that we were not destined to accomplish our goal. When we are confronted with these momentary hits of failure, we tend to over-react, believe things are truly much worse than they are. In these crucial moments we are unable to see the larger picture, the greater strategy. Many people will lose a battle and forfeit the war. The fact is, your success and dreams is larger than this one roadblock or failure, so why allot it this kind of importance?
3. We Don&#8217;t Expect More from Ourselves. We decide that we are unable to give that extra effort because it is too much work, it&#8217;s not worth it anyways; it hasn&#8217;t worked for someone else, so why would it work for us. Whether it&#8217;s an expectation we get from someone else, or something that has been imbedded in us, we are falsely led to believe that there is a low ceiling to what we are capable of achieving&#8211; when in reality, when we focus on things we are more than capable of astonishing ourselves.
4. We Lose Focus Early in the Process. It&#8217;s easy to be distracted in a world of constant social messages, emails, advertisements, and offers promising to be the miracle cure for one and all. The successful among us find a way to tune out this noise and focus intently on what they want to achieve, and nothing else.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you crafting your goals in the manner with which you are giving yourself the absolute best chance at succeeding? If you are having trouble mastering goal setting, it could something as simple as how you are phrasing your goals.</p>
<p>Silly as it may seem, but the very way that we phrase things has a large impact on how we feel and act towards them. By now you have heard about self-talk and it&#8217;s effects, but did you know that the way you phrase your goal has a significant amount to do with whether you achieve it or not?</p>
<p>Many goal-setters are better known as wishful-thinkers. They wish and hope for things. With this method of phrasing their goals they are leaving their goals to providence, to a higher power that will hopefully come along and grant them their hopes and dreams.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I really wish I lose twenty pounds this summer.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I hope I get that promotion.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>A level above them is the procrastinator. This person also has big hopes and dreams, but they are not leaving it up to the heavens, they are leaving it up to father time. <em>But wait</em>, you might be asking. <em>How exactly are they procrastinating? This person isn&#8217;t necessarily putting it off, heck, they&#8217;re even plainly stating what they want to do! </em></p>
<p>Sure, they are stating what they would like to do one day. They phrase their goals in a manner with which indicates a far-off achievement. Not today, not tomorrow, but one day. The main problem with this person is not even that they are pushing off their goals, it&#8217;s that they don&#8217;t even know they are doing it.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I want to be rich one day.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I want to lose weight this summer.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I want&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>They outline their desires, but they do it in such a way that it indicates that their goal lies somewhere out in the distance over the horizon. It implies that their goal is somewhere out there, and completely lacks the immediacy and urgency required to act on it presently.</p>
<p>But this is not the way the highly successful do things. They pull those goals out of their dreams, and into reality by phrasing their goals in the here and now. They refuse to leave things to a higher power or the good graces of time. They know that the accomplishment of their goals lies completely within themselves. In this spirit, they write out their goals in the following manner</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I choose to&#8230;&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Phrased in this manner indicates that the goal is already being acted out, that it is already being aggressively pursued. By jotting down your goals like this, you are choosing to live your goals.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the tangible benefits of goal setting. That it can give us purpose, that it has the benefit to alter the landscape of our lives. In that spirit here are six more awesome reasons to love goal setting &#8211; and, if you haven&#8217;t already &#8211; to consider using goals the next time you want to achieve something really cool.</p>
<p><strong>1. It&#8217;s the road map for a life you choose to live. </strong>It should be radically empowering to be able to look at your life laid out in front of you, at your fingertips. It should be calming and oddly powerful to be gaze out at what you plan on achieving in the future. Some people have crystal balls or psychic lines; you have your goal setting plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Your goals provide you with a resounding sense of focus.</strong> When you are in the &#8216;zone&#8217;, when you are dedicating your resources and time to something that you care about deeply and acutely, you can&#8217;t be bothered by distractions and the petty grievances of day-to-day life. When everything revolves around the couple things you care most about, everything else falls to the way-side. This type of laser-like focus is the vessel that carries us towards great things.</p>
<p><strong>3. It feels pretty darn good. </strong>Having purpose, and being on a road towards our dreams, getting ever nearer with each day, feels amazing. Knowing that you doing something productive on a daily basis towards achieving something that means the world to you fills you with hope of that amazing day when you can say, &#8220;I did this.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>4. Achieving things you set out to do inspires you to achieve even greater things.</strong> Once we set and then methodically destroy those first few goals, we look back and think, &#8220;Now, that wasn&#8217;t so bad.&#8221; Out of this thought we begin to dream of even bigger and better things that we want for ourselves, and even while thinking of these magnificent things, we know that they are realistic, because we have demonstrated the ability to get the things we want with a process that works.</p>
<p><strong>5. You learn the habit of not waiting. </strong>Once you pick up this habit of not waiting to get things done, of not waiting on anyone else, of not waiting for anything or anyone, you pick up an incredibly powerful skill-self-reliance. Not only do you start depending on yourself for more, you refuse to wait on others to take action for you. You waste less time, have less energy for those who would rather see you flounder, and tighten your grip on your own fate.</p>
<p><strong>6. You quickly learn who has your best interests at heart.</strong> Once you get comfortable in sharing your goal with your peers, friends and family, you&#8217;re likely to have your dream criticized by a couple people who believe they are doing you a favor by exposing your goal as crazy, pointless or simply dumb. They may do it under the guise of being your friend, or doing it for your own good, but what they are doing is exposing an ugly slice of jealousy or ignorance. It&#8217;s key that you view these people as what they are &#8211; insecure &#8211; and not let that little seed of doubt grow in your mind.</p>

<p>What if you were privy to the same techniques that billionaire-CEOs, professional athletes, and the highest achievers of any industry across the planet? What sort of happiness and success do you think you could glean from this knowledge?</p>
<p>What has set these ultra-performers apart from mere mortals is that they have developed a goal-setting ability that is unlike any other. They know what most don&#8217;t-that to achieve anything, whether it&#8217;s a profitable quarter, a national championship, or even a successful relationship, one must have a goal and the resulting plan and desire to see it through.</p>
<p>This process sounds simple. And it is.</p>
<p>But the reason that most people fail to live up to their potential is that they haven&#8217;t taken the time to understand and master the process of goal-setting. Imagine for a moment you had a skill with which you could wield to achieve anything you wanted. It should baffle and excite you to think of all that you could achieve if you were to master this process.</p>
<p>Goal-setting is the shortest way to get what you want from life. Once you set goals, distractions fall to the side. You build a level of focus and momentum that would be impossible were you bouncing from day-dream to day-dream.</p>
<p>Successful people do not float from achievement to achievement. Success isn&#8217;t something that we stumble into, and true success is not a matter of luck.</p>
<p>Success is not an accident. It is merely the end product of the goal setting process.</p>
