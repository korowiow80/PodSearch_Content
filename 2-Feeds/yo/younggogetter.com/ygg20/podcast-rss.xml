Every entrepreneur struggles when attempting to connect a good idea to the public, but there are a few tricks that can help fix this problem. We sat down with a group of successful startup founders and asked them “How do you reach your target market?” Here&#8217;s what they had to say.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connect with businesses in your market:</strong> After failing to reach customers directly, Judge.me pivoted to partner with other institutions in the same niche.
<p>“I target marketplaces and try to partner with them for their dispute resolution. I only just started selling this way, but the results so far are encouraging.”</p>
<p>By going to markets rather than attempting to attract one customer at a time, this startup was able to grow their user base much faster and see better traction. &#8211; Peter-Jan Celis (Judge.me)</li>
<li><strong>User Test, then user test again:</strong> It&#8217;s true, your marketing woes will be greatly diminished if you do a huge amount of user testing before launching. This is one of the easiest but most overlooked aspects of building a product. Let real people tell you how to build it and other real people will like the result.
<p>“It’s all about products. Our users love us. We give them tools to share the app and they do the rest. We are constantly in tune with our customers to make sure we are giving them what they want and the rest takes care of itself.” &#8211; Brett Martin (Sonar)</li>
<li><strong>Sponsor Events in your Field:</strong> Be active amongst the people who might use your product. A great way to do this is to be a supporter of big meetings; it&#8217;s simple enough to set up and doesn&#8217;t take a lot of work. A word of caution though, it&#8217;s not enough to simply write a check and hope for the best, you&#8217;ve got to be present at the events you&#8217;re sponsoring and show that your business really wants to connect.
<p>“Any time we can be at or sponsor an event, it’s a big win for us, because that’s when people need cards – when they are at there meeting.” &#8211; Ketan Anjara (CardFlick)</li>
<li><strong>Use Crowdfunding:</strong> Platforms like Kickstarter and Indie go-go are great ways to not only test the market, but also bring in some positive cash flow. It&#8217;s a simple process to list your idea, and if it resonates with customers you&#8217;ll get the “kickstart” you need.
<p>“Kicksarter is a way to get pre-orders for your game and find out how many people will like it. It’s also a great way to get traction and for people to hear about your business. &#8211; Richard James (Evertide Games)</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s an unspoken rule that many entrepreneurs buy into called the 80/20 rule – 80% marketing for every 20% time spent building product. Even if you make something awesome it will still need customers to become profitable. Have you had success using strategies to reach your target market?

Having the full ability to design your first office is definitely one of the best perks of being an entrepreneur. </p>
<p><strong>Showcasing the Face of the Business</strong><br />
An entrepreneur needs to remember that an office is considered the first phase of the business that a client gets to meet. The overall ambiance of an office can greatly influence the future of business as well as a client&#8217;s perception of business. This is why it is important to remember that an office is a place of business and not necessarily an extension of your home. </p>
<p>An office design should not be treated as a personal space and should not include an abundance of personal items. An office needs to have the access to stylish wastebaskets and clutter free furniture. This overall minimal look can ensure that a client will feel as if they are in a professional setting and in the hands of an experienced business. </p>
<p><strong>Relaxation in the Workplace </strong><br />
Even though a great amount of work may take place in an office setting is important to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics" target="_blank">create a sense</a> of comfort and relaxation in an office and among fellow employees. Choosing <a href="http://www.sitbetter.com/sorted/search/conference_room_chairs/" target="_blank">comfortable conference chairs for your office</a> ensures that employees will be comfortable during work hours and will continue to produce the best level of quality work. Personal touches can be added in an office if they are restricted to small items that do not distract from the overall design of an office. </p>
<p><strong>Completing a Design</strong><br />
With equipment and supplies ready to be set in place it is important to remember unique touches that can add to the overall feel of the offices design. Items such as attractive plan and simple window treatments can be extremely budget friendly while maintaining an overall eco-friendly theme in an office. The use of live plants can add to the overall atmosphere in the office as well as increase the energy level in the space. </p>
<p>An office needs to be designed in order to meet certain form and function criteria. There are definitely no rules when it calms to designing an office. It is definitely important to plan and analyze the nature of the business as well as your personal needs prior to jumping into any office design projects.  </p>

However, one quality stands out among others; a quality that is common among most entrepreneurs. In short, emotional intelligence is the special quality that can push entrepreneurs towards success.  </p>
<p><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong> </p>
<p>In order to understand the importance of this characteristic, it is vital to first delve into the definition of emotional intelligence. Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is a concept familiarized by Daniel Goleman, an internationally known psychologist, which is defined as one’s ability to understand and manage his or her emotions as they happen in themselves and others, while using this awareness to manage relationships effectively.</p>
<p>Emotional intelligence is a collection of four major skills: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Each of the skills fall under two primary competencies; personal and social competence. Personal competence is made up of self-awareness and self-management skills, which focus on the internal aspects of a person, especially their own emotions and behavioral tendencies. On the other hand, social competence is made up of social awareness and relationship management skills, which focuses on the individual’s behavior in relation to those around them.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it Vital for Entrepreneurs? </strong></p>
<p>Emotional intelligence empowers entrepreneurs the ability to relate to others, detect emotions and react accordingly. In addition, it also gives entrepreneurs the following abilities: </p>
<p>Decision Making:<br />
A major component of emotional intelligence is comprised of awareness and prioritizing; the ability to ability to stay aware of emotions in order to make unbiased decisions. During the course of starting and managing a business, individuals will constantly be bombarded with choices and decisions, many of which require a speedy response. A high degree of emotional intelligence will allow entrepreneurs to keep emotions at bay during critical moments. </p>
<p>Communication:<br />
When emotions and tensions run high, it may be difficult to handle arguments among team members or others. However, entrepreneurs with relatively high emotional intelligence, through the ability to perceive emotions, can mediate disputes and settle conflicts quickly. They not only are able to clearly express themselves, they also take into account the emotions of different parties and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Networking:<br />
Relationship management is another component of emotional intelligence, and determines the entrepreneur’s ability to use awareness of your own and other’s emotions to manage interactions successfully. With this skill, individuals are better able to network and connect with others, building relationships that can provide various advantages in the future. Whether for obtaining a mentor or finding partners for a future business, networking is a vital skill for any entrepreneur. </p>
<p>Customer Satisfaction:<br />
Entrepreneurs with emotional intelligence are able to manage relationships and pick up the emotions of others. Therefore, these qualities make them well equipped to handle issues of customer satisfaction. These individuals are able to emphasize customers and engage them with the solutions they need. For any business that relies on customers for its success, it is vital that individuals understand the importance of customer satisfaction. </p>
<p>For individuals without a high degree of emotional intelligence, never fear – unlike IQ, emotional intelligence can be trained. With enough emotional intelligence training, entrepreneurs can hone their skills, further improving the chances of success for their business. </p>

Universities such as <a href="http://www.degreescout.com/south-university/west-palm-beach/" target="_blank">South University West Palm Beach</a> offer classes such as finance, accounting and marketing that can truly help you in your endeavors as a young entrepreneur. </p>
<p>Even if you already have good business sense, it can&#8217;t hurt to take a few <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/09/most-innovative-business-school-classes-entrepreneurs-management-sustainable-tech-10-innovative.html" target="_blank">business-related classes</a>. Taking accounting classes, for example, can give you a better understanding of how to handle your payroll, taxes and other important financial paperwork. After you have acquired these valuable skills you can even cut costs by doing your accounting yourself instead of hiring an accountant.</p>
<p>Accounting and finance classes can also make it easier to understand the costs of running your business. The valuable skills that you learn from these classes simplify the process of cutting costs and budgeting your business expenses. Since minimal spending increases your profits, you may find that the minor tuition that you paid for your accounting and finance classes truly were worth the investment.</p>
<p>Marketing classes at a local college or university can help you to learn more about advertising. Advertising is obviously a fundamental aspect of any successful business. Even if you think that you know everything that there is to know about advertising and marketing, chances are good that you will learn even more from taking a few marketing classes.</p>
<p>If you are truly serious about your own success and the success of your business, there is truly no reason not to take business-related classes . It is always better to have the knowledge and skills that are necessary to make the best financial and business-related decisions. With this knowledge you will no longer have to depend on others when making important decisions, or running your business. It is best to look for a college that is well-known and well-respected. For the best results, you will also want to find a college that has a successful business program, such as <a href="http://www.degreescout.com/south-university/columbia/" target="_blank">South University Columbia SC</a> if you live on the east coast or South University West Palm Beach if you live on the east coast. </p>
<p>These universities and several others have turned out many young entrepreneurs who continued on to be highly successful. Whether you choose to complete a degree or simply take a class or two, you will find that this education will benefit you greatly in the business world.</p>

A good lawyer can help a business owner with leases, hiring, firing, drawing up contracts and incorporating. The challenge is for the business owner to find a good lawyer in the first place. One good way is through referrals from a former or current client of the lawyer who’s had a good experience with them. Another way to find a lawyer is through a <a href="http://www.martindale.com/law-firms.htm" target="_blank">law firm search from Martindale.com</a>, which provides lists of lawyers in the client’s area. The business owner can also consult the Yellow Pages or the local bar association. </p>
<p>Still, there are a few things that a business owner will need to know before they take on a new lawyer. They should ask those colleagues who were satisfied with their <a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Legal+Representation" target="_blank">legal representation</a> if they got good results, no matter what field the lawyer lawyer specialized in. For example, was any lawsuit settled to the colleague’s satisfaction? Was the contract the lawyer drew up beneficial to the business? Were their taxes lowered?</p>
<p>The business owner should also make sure that they can reach their lawyer. Too many lawyers are had to get hold of and don’t return phone calls as swiftly as they should. A lawyer should return phone calls within 24 hours. </p>
<p>The lawyer’s fees should also be reasonable, but the business owner should be wary of a lawyer whose rates seem a little too inexpensive. Cheap legal representation is probably not the best legal representation. </p>
<p>The business owner should also learn who does the real work in the law firm. Lawyers who work in big firms often shunt their work to underpaid and overworked associates. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as these associates can be quite brilliant and conscientious and their fees are considerably less than a senior partner&#8217;s. But they can also be inexperienced and even a bright young lawyer can make a mistake if they’re overstressed. The business owner should let the firm know that when it comes to serious or complicated cases, they’d like the person they hired to do the work. </p>
<p>When the business owner has a list of two or three lawyers that they’re interested in they should schedule meetings with them. These meetings should be thorough and may last a few hours. The business owner should make sure that they and the lawyer are a good fit, personality wise. They should make sure the lawyer knows what they expect. They should gather information about the lawyer’s background, ask for referrals and call those referrals. This initial meeting should be free. A lawyer who charges for this meeting is probably not the best lawyer a business owner can find. </p>
<p>When it comes to finding the best legal representation for your business, you never want to cut corners.  Find a great lawyer who has not only the proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_examination" target="_blank">credentials</a>, but also the reputation and know how that will allow him or her to best serve your business.</p>

You manage a budget. You manage processes. You manage people. But your most important management task is one that often slips under the radar. You need to know how to manage your time.</p>
<p>Time wasted is money lost. And unfortunately time can be a very easy thing to waste. Research has shown that workers generally use only about 60% of their time productively. When you apply this same figure to running your business, you can almost see those dollar bills flying out the window. And as a manager, you probably find yourself performing many different jobs during the day and wishing you had about twice as much time as you actually do. But don&#8217;t worry. You can do something about it. In fact, here are a few tips that can help you turn wasted time into productive time:</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate distractions.</strong></p>
<p>You have a lot of enemies in your battle to save time. Some of them are known by other names: telephones, email, Facebook, Twitter, the Internet, to name a few. Nothing is more tempting, or more of a time-killer, than net surfing, reading your email, or checking Ebay for the latest deals. If you add up all of the minutes that you spend doing these things, you would see why. The key is to set some boundaries. Make your email conform to <em>your</em> time schedule, not the other way around. Set aside set time periods during the day to read and answer your emails and to listen to and answer your phone messages. Allot yourself a specific amount of time during the day to engage in social media interactions. If you use some of these social sites to market or promote your products or services, get a social media management software tool (many good ones are free!) or better still, hire a college student to manage your social media sites for you.</p>
<p><strong>Set specific time-management goals.</strong></p>
<p>Make specific goals and write them down. Set realistic milestones for each of them. In this way, you can monitor your progress and see how you are doing. Know yourself well enough to realize what part of the day you are most productive. For example, are you a morning person? If so, schedule your most important goals for before lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Get organized!</strong></p>
<p>Lack of organization leads to wasted time. Think about it. When your desk is cluttered it takes longer to find something. When your computer files are unorganized, you probably find yourself doing numerous searches. First, eliminate the clutter from your surroundings. If something is not necessary, get rid of it. Then create a system for what is left. Use folders or files and code them by color or some other way. Organize your computer files into category folders. You will soon begin to notice that many of the things that used to take up a lot of your time are now simple and easy to do.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on one task at a time.</strong></p>
<p>Multi-tasking is something many small business owners feel they need to do. But having multiple responsibilities doesn&#8217;t mean you should be doing everything simultaneously! It&#8217;s a proven fact that focusing on one thing at a time increases your overall productivity. So set aside a chunk of time to focus intently on one thing. And don&#8217;t switch gears until that time period is over.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate the word &#8220;wait&#8221; from your vocabulary.</strong></p>
<p>Think about how much time we spend waiting for things&#8212;doctors, dentists, people who haven&#8217;t yet arrived for a meeting. Some of these waits can be unavoidable, but if you are idle during these waiting periods, you are wasting valuable time. Instead, always take something with you. Is there a report you need to read? Is there a schedule that needs to be planned? Never be without the tools you need to get stuff done when you need to wait. Bring that pad of paper, that notebook, that PDA, and/or that smart phone so that you can use that previously-wasted time productively.</p>
<p><strong>Let your workers work for you.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to be a one-man show. You need to delegate and/or outsource certain tasks so that you are not wasting your time doing what others could be doing just as well (or better!). Save your valuable time for the important things and the things that you do best. Remember that micro-management is inefficient management.</p>
<p>Time is easy to waste. And very often a lot of it is wasted without our even realizing it. Unless you know how to manage it and control it, it will fly right by before you know it. Fortunately, there are ways making your time work for you. When you learn how to manage your time, you will see how much easier it becomes to manage your business.</p>

You need to have an idea, a passion, <a href="http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Strategic-Growth-Markets/Nature-or-nurture--Decoding-the-DNA-of-the-entrepreneur---Entrepreneurs-share-core-traits" target="_blank">and a willingness to take risks.</a> You need to have strong business sense but an eye for creativity. You need to be diligent and determined, no matter how challenging the obstacles.</p>
<p>And, at the same time, you also need to be a salesman. Specifically, you need the capacity to sell your fledgling business – to consumers, to potential employees, and most importantly, to investors.</p>
<p>Pitching an entrepreneurial venture to investors can be a life-or-death proposition, at least as far as your startup business is concerned. If investors like what they hear, they will hopefully provide the capital your project needs to succeed. If not, your idea may very well fall prey to a lack of cash.</p>
<p>So it goes without saying that the investor pitch is a highly crucial one. But this appeal all too often comes in the form of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch" target="_blank">“elevator pitch”</a> – a pitch that needs to be made quickly, convincingly, and in a minimal amount of time. Whether you are speaking to people at a convention or sending off brief emails, it is essential that this pitch is both compelling and concise.</p>
<p>How can this be done? How can you appeal to investors when you have only a minute to make your case? It’s no easy task, that’s for sure. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>
<p><strong>-Stand out.</strong> There are two key ways that you can stand out in the mind of an investor: one, you can emphasize the credibility that your startup already carries, or two, you can focus on the unique potential that your business offers. Credibility can be achieved through receiving awards or grants, or by already having some big investors on board. Potential, on the other hand, is a reflection of your startup’s unique promise; for example, you may want to highlight the lucrativeness of the niche market you plan to enter.</p>
<p><strong>-Don’t tell a story.</strong> While the story of your business’s beginnings may matter to you and may sound impressive, most investors have heard tale after tale of inspired ideas and hardscrabble origins. Your story is likely to benefit you down the road, but it has little place in an elevator pitch.</p>
<p><strong>-It’s all about the numbers.</strong> So what, then, do investors want if they don’t care about your story? Numbers, of course. Specifically, they want to see budget and earnings forecasts and they want to know how such estimations were derived. While you probably won’t be handing over a spreadsheet during your elevator pitch, it’s important to keep some of your key growth numbers in mind.</p>
<p><strong>-Practice makes perfect.</strong> Finally, it goes without saying that an elevator pitch is not difficult to perfect – but doing so requires practice. Don’t hesitate to write out a pitch and present it to friends, business partners, or family members. You’ll later be glad that you did.</p>
<p>These are just a few tips to keep in mind when crafting an elevator pitch. For more advice you can always check out the business lectures available at <a href="https://www.opensesame.com/" target="_blank">OpenSesame.com.</a> If your startup company has potential but is lacking in capital, it’s always important to consider such advice and have an elevator pitch ready at all times</p>
