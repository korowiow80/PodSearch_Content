I then I saw the movie “Children of Men.” While the movie doesn’t explain why woman can’t have babies anymore, it reminded me of something Rosalie Bertell said to me 18 years ago. And then I realized the power of words…

But as the terrible shootings at Dawson College, Platte Canyon High School and the Amish schoolhouse so tragically demonstrated earlier this fall, we must learn to re-define what it means to create a truly safe environment for our children.

While we all want to spend less on home utilities, most of us don't know where to begin.The answer is clear. In the average home, heating and cooling costs account for at least 60% of your energy bill. An estimated 25% of all heat loss literally flies out the window.
