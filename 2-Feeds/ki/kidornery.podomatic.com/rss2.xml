      <title>The Sweatbox Sessions - Ornery Master</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/22166/600x600_642264.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I present to you - complete for the first time anywhere - 
the only studio album ever recorded by any version
of The Defenestration Unit anywhere...
Recorded under the guidance of Mr. Tim Kerr
at The Sweatbox in Austin - we spent the band fund on 
recording it - and then that version of the band broke up...
We were never quite sure what to do with it...
Well, I went and sequenced it tonight,
compressed it a bit, and &quot;screw&quot;ed around with one song
(you'll know it when you hear it)...

We recorded all weekend.
Tim had us record tracks of us making noise
and whooping and hollering and such
over the tunes when we were done...
I was so delirious by the time we got to
&quot;leroy's groove&quot; that they had to cut that track 
pretty early on as I became very obnoxious 
almost right away!
go me!

anyway,
this is not &quot;the definitive sweatbox sessions&quot;
because there probably never will be one,
but it's a version
of what that album may have sounded like...

1.  Asskicker Jones
2.  Earth
3.  HPW
4.  Space is the Place
5.  Caravan
6.  In 6
7.  I Put a Spell on You
8.  Leroy's Groove

TDU was:
Charlie Naked - Saxophones
Kid Ornery - Trombone
Jack Babylon - Trumpet
Jim Otterson - Guitar
Leroy Bell - Bass
Vaughan Boone - Drums

w/ Carl Smith - Sax on &quot;Space is the Place&quot; and &quot;Earth&quot;

enjoy!</description>

well, here it is.

It's all me, except for some drum samples of Vaughan Boone.

1.  1969

some tracks I'm happier with than others,

and now it is out there...

3.  Kid Ornery - Georgia - from the mythic and presumed lost &quot;accomodation&quot; sessions

5. Something to close with - synapse - synapse was Robert Pearson, David Maddox, Kid Ornery, and I think on this recording, Dan McMahon...

      <title>William Switzer - The Final Solo Recordings</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/22166/600x600_642274.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Switzer was Jason Bill and Mike Switzer (Kid Ornery's given name).
We released one CD - The Illusion of Technique - on Fleece Records...
The critics, well, they mostly ignored it, but some, well, some hated it.
The girl I dated for a brief period after we recorded it asked if we were depressed at the time, and if we were listening to what we were doing...
and of course we think it's a fun record, and we were listening as closely as either of us were capable of at the time...
This is our last duo session - probably recorded at the Charalambihouse.
I also have unreleased trio sessions with Dave Dove, and Heather Murray.  
Just got a call from a friend saying that Christina Carter will be on the next DJ Shadow record...
crazy...
I need to see if I can contact her about releasing some of the CCM recordings - Christina Carter, Charlie Naked, Mike Switzer - some of her earliest piano work and all kinds of interesting noises. 
But anyway, back to William Switzer...
We were awesome and sometimes unlistenable...but mostly awesome.
Jason went on to record with Jack Rose and Migrantes...
I went on to do all the crazy stuff you've been listening too on previous eps of this podcast...
and now - I'm directing a play - http://www.myspace.com/theaddingmachine
and Charlie Naked along with members of TDU, Free Radicals, Infant Mortality Rate and Friendship Bracelets (among others) are making the music for the show...
should be amazing...
blah blah blah...
just listen to the craziness already - 
4 tracks
various instrumentation

more TDU for you...
this time with our sister band - Fist of Kong
FOK is Charlie Naked and Danny McMahon -
with - Tom Zermeno, Robert Pearson, John Atlas, Rose Lange, Jim Otterson, Mike Switzer...
then we turn into TDU and add Jeff Miller and Kirk &quot;Monkeyboy&quot; Suddreath
we all play together for a bit of &quot;Space is the Place&quot; then nonTDU folks leave for the most part...though I think John and Rose kept playing with us.
The piece starts with Charlie and Danny doing their best Don Cherry, with Charlie on bamboo clarinet and Danny playing some kind of tiny harp...
anyway, check it out...
it was a good show...
and it was the night of the Gay Pride parade - hence the title...

This one is a little early because I'm thinking of a bonus non-TDU specific podcast midweek,
and then another TDU at the end of the week in preparation for our shows Saturday and Sunday.

anyway,
enjoy!

      <title>The Defenstration Unit - Live at Rudyards</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/22166/600x600_642279.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Defenestration Unit celebrates our 10 year anniversary this month...
so the rest of June will be TDU month here at the house of Ornery.

This recording comes from a brief period in the bands life when we played songs and had a singer.
She's under contract now, so I won't mention her name, but she's awesome...
We brought her in to do &quot;Theme de Yoyo&quot; and that sounded so good we added the Nina Simone cover - next thing ya know we were working up a set, and soon free jazz legends, TDU, were an R&amp;B/Soul band...

The picture is at least the right horn section, even if it is from a different gig...

next week classic TDU, something from Sweatbox, and a preview of the newest NEW TDU!!!

Track Listing:

1.  Feeling Good
2.  Theme De Yoyo
3.  Breath of Fresh Air
4.  All Mine
5.  Space is the Place/Transmission



ENJOY!!!</description>

      <title>Last Bastions - Tomorrow Never Knows</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/22166/600x600_642280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thought I'd combine the themes of the last two podcasts and give you what may be the last bastions only cover. This piece was comissioned by trombonist David Dove and later released in a private edition of 17.
It includes the quietest music we've ever played (the begining and end), a beatles cover (the whole thing) and us playing in front of people who were not expecting us (the horns were recorded on the streets of downtown houston on a Friday night.)
I'm pretty proud of this one.
Hope you enjoy it.</description>

      <title>Last Bastions - Points/Songs</title>

Last Bastions are Kid Ornery and Charlie Naked.
Songs were meant to have singers, but we never found any...
The &quot;Music for Bathing&quot; track has vocals which makes it as songlike as anything in our catalog...
You'll get points as soon as ya hear 'em...
very process oriented pieces...</description>
