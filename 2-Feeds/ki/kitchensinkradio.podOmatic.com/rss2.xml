      <title>That 70's Podcast</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1103844/600x600_6546206.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;101 minutes of music and clips from the 70's.

Disco, punk, soul, rock, pop, funk, and country are all represented in abundance.

This latest episode features (highlights) the diversity of music that made the 70's great.

From Devo to Waylon Jennings, from Marvin Gaye to Marvin Hamlisch, this episode is truly music for those who like it all.

And for those of you enjoy who a good read, may I suggest The Brueck Equation by Simmons Norwood (www.simmonsnorwood.com)</description>

      <title>POWER TO THE PEOPLE: A CELEBRATION OF LABOR</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1103844/600x600_4912645.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Labor Day approaches and the American worker finds herself/himself seemingly under constant seige, could there be a better time to comment on worker struggles with music?

From the Tea Party (THE CLASH &amp; THE REVEREND HORTON HEAT) to corporate America (SPINAL TAP &amp; FLYGUY) to the Progressive Left (RACHEL MADDOW &amp; KEITH OLBERMANN), all points of view have influence in this 100 minute episode, but in the end it's all about the encouraging, promoting and celebrating of all those hard working women and men out there.

Some six months after the last episode, The Kitchen Sink has returned with its BIGGEST EPISODE TO DATE.

You've heard them scattered throughout other episodes, now here's an episode dedicated solely to having nothing to say.  So in keeping with the theme,  everything is being kept to a minimum, EXCEPT the music...and SoCal derby info.

Southern California and TKS faves, UNPOPABLE (aka, Balloon Bass), reside inside.  You can find them online at www.balloonbass.com or on Facebook at http://facebook.com/addi.somekh.

Saturday, August 20th, at Skateworld in San Diego, San Diego Roller Derby host the Hidden City Heebie Jeebies AND &quot;The Gals&quot; of Long Beach Roller Derby.  FB 'em for info or check out my Events page for more details.

Thank you for your patience, even if you're not a doctor.</description>

      <title>LOVE, CALIFORNIA</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1103844/600x600_4090017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An episode in celebration of The Golden State, California.

Musical genres ranging from '60s surf guitar, '80s punk and all the way through to the local/&quot;indie&quot; music scene of the new century, ranging in styles from pop to punk and mild to wild, if it's even remotely associated with the California music scene, you're bound to find it here.

Check out the events page for yet even more roller derby info from San Diego &amp; Long Beach.  I've also added more links to some of my favorite local bands like Temper Tantrum, Unpopable, Willie Cash &amp; The Cashiers, Desperation Squad and The Abe Lincoln Story.

So break out your quads, boogie boards and volleyballs because this is an episode guaranteed to get you in a California state of mind.

Special thanks to LBRD's EMME SIXTEEN for the episode flyer!!

Up next?  The Kitchen Sink's 5TH ANNIVERSARY episode.  Stay tuned...</description>
