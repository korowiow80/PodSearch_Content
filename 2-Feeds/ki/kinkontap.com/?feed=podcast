    <li><a href="http://wiki.KinkOnTap.com/wiki/Kink_On_Tap_70" title="Help make our web site better by contributing to the Kink On Tap wiki.">Wiki page show notes for episode 70</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0ArYmNHuRadHbcC12cXAxTTZ1bHFjNkV3VjZWZll1Q1E" title="">See and suggest upcoming featured guests</a>.</li>
</ul><p>How is it that <a href="http://sexuality.about.com/od/glossary/g/BDSM.htm" class="sspg term" title="Look up this term.">BDSM</a> play is deeply connecting? What can we learn about how people in general construct intimacy with others in their lives by analyzing sadomasochistic communities? On this special episode of Kink On Tap, sociologist <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/stacinewmahr/Home">Dr. Staci Newmahr</a> joins us to discuss her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0253222850?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=kionta-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0253222850"><cite>Playing on the Edge: Sadomasochism, Risk, and Intimacy</cite></a>. Drawing on disciplines as far ranging as criminology to <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/glossary/term/3320" class="sspg term" title="Look up this term.">gender</a> theory and beyond, Dr. Newmahr offers a rigorous conceptual framework in which to understand &#8220;What It Is That We Do,&#8221; the value of risk itself, and even the fluidity of <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/glossary/term/3378" class="sspg term" title="Look up this term.">identity</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the typical fare of sexuality news and articles and a roundtable discussion, this time I sat down one-on-one with Dr. Staci Newmahr to talk about her ethnography of the people in &#8220;Caeden,&#8221; a public <a href="http://sexuality.about.com/od/glossary/g/BDSM.htm" class="sspg term" title="Look up this term.">BDSM</a> community in America, for the entire 2-hour show. The book—and, therefore, this show—has personal and sentimental meaning to me not only because it articulates in academic language much of <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2008/10/25/equating-passivity-with-sexual-submissiveness-is-a-stupid-mistake/">what I&#8217;ve been experiencing</a> in my time as <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2009/08/18/there-is-no-bdsm-mecca/">a part of numerous BDSM communities</a>, but also because Staci is a personal friend. Her book therefore chronicles some of my own time in &#8220;Caeden,&#8221; and offered me a window into <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2007/08/04/what-sexuality-might-taste-like-if-you-were-a-submissive-man-in-2007/">my own (often painful) past</a>.</p>
<p>Although Kink On Tap is still not returning to weekly shows, that doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t stuff coming up! First of all, if you have questions for Staci or comments about our conversation, leave a comment or fill <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/glossary/term/3532" class="sspg term" title="Look up this term.">out</a> <a href="http://kinkontap.com/feedback/">the Feedback form</a> on our website. Also, there are <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2011/02/26/march-events-and-a-segment-on-sexploration-with-monika/">a number of fantastic events scheduled where I hope you&#8217;ll say hi to me</a>, including <a href="http://wiki.KinkForAll.org/KinkForAll-Providence-2">KinkForAll Providence 2</a> in Rhode Island and the <a href="http://atlantapolyweekend.com/">Atlanta Poly Weekend</a> (where I&#8217;m slated to give a presentation on <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/2011/03/29/anti-censorship-best-practices-for-the-sex-positive-publisher-atlanta-poly-weekend-2011/">anti-censorship best practices for sex-positive publishers</a>) in Georgia.</p>
<p>Finally, if you like Kink On Tap or any of my other work, you can help me keep doing it by chipping a few dollars into the hat at <a href="http://kinkontap.com/donate/">the Kink On Tap Donate page</a>, or <a href="http://maybemaimed.com/about/">bringing me to speak with your students or community group</a>. Your contributions and invitations really do help a lot!</p>

Joining us for the first time is principal blogger of the <a href="http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/">Yes Means Yes</a> blog, Thomas Millar, whose razor-sharp intellect is matched only by his unabashed directness, for which we are personally very grateful.

		<itunes:summary>Evil anti-trafficking organizations turn to scapegoating Craigslist for political gain, Google has a not-so-secret censorship list, DADT is unconstitutional (duh), sex workers want to know what police consider prostitution, and US evangelicals partner with Chinese officials for their failing abstinence agenda when they should be taking a page out of the Dutch playbook.

Using inflated numbers, criminally shortsighted political capital, and a pervasive ignorance of technology, anti-trafficking activists are hijacking an important issue and turning it into a moral battleground, and real women with real lives and their own voices are paying the price. That&#039;s why we were so grateful to super-smart sex worker&#039;s rights advocate Audacia Ray for taking the time to help us understand the hysteria around the Craigslist sex-trafficking headlines. We were also joined this week by Reid Mihalko who, much to Emma&#039;s delight, got the time to geek out over the relationship between comic book superheroes and men&#039;s emotional health.

On a different note, I want to take a moment to highlight a simple new feature on this site, where many sexuality-related terms are linked to a definition. If you write about sex at a WordPress-powered website, consider installing the WP Simple Sex-Positive Glossary plugin (written by yours truly) to help raise awareness of the awesome glossaries at sites like Sexuality.About.com and Scarleteen.com. It&#039;s just one of my many small acts that I hope will help transform the world.
