</p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">In a mesmerizing one-man show, Darryl Van Leer channels historical figures such as Muddy Waters, Frederick Douglass, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr. and makes them come alive. Our kids loved how Van Leer set the stage as a folksy storyteller and then seamlessly shifted into each character using only simple props and the power of performance. Figures that feel as one-dimensional as the books they inhabit seemed to walk off the page and shake our kids hands, providing an exciting glimpse into our country&#8217;s history. The Power of Earth was a hit &#8212; Van Leer&#8217;s unique gift for not talking down to kids grabbed them, and his compelling performance held them rapt. Grab the chance to see this popular show, which tours the country and at The Geffen Playhouse for only one day.</p>

Watching All The President’s Men as a family opened up a conversation about how reporters follow a story and tell the truth, which makes this movie newsworthy in our household. It was front page news all over the world when Richard Nixon became the first American president to resign and the film, which won four Oscars in 1976, is a thrilling look at how the investigative reporters at the Washington Post became political heroes. We had fun bringing the headlines home with a tour of our local paper’s printing facility, where our kids watched robots load reams of paper on to four story-high printing presses and enjoyed a sneak peek of the weekend comics section four days before the Sunday paper landed on our doorsteps.</span></p>

Whether your kids are starting out with a pizza-pie wedge between their first skis or just biding their time until their next snowboarding trip to a serious mountain, getting some slope savvy at your local ski resort makes for a wonderful wintry weekend. There&#8217;s not a kid in the world who needs much of a push to slide down a hill, so get yours ready to sled or ski or snowboard by watching Snow Dogs on the drive to the slopes. Ours love this improbable tale that stars Cuba Gooding, Jr. as a Miami dentist who travels to Alaska to collect his inheritance&#8230; which turns out to be a team of sled dogs! </span></p>

<p style="line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">Butch Cassidy has plenty of gun play &#8212; the two heroes famously head out to their deaths in the last frame of the picture &#8212; and shows the men with prostitutes and drinking alcohol.

You&#8217;ll remember the plot turns &#8212; it&#8217;s just like riding a bicycle, which is exactly what Redford and Newman do with Katherine Ross to the tune of &#8220;Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head&#8221;.

</p><p class="MsoNormal">Cars is one of those great family films that lures everyone from Grandpa to toddler with its old-fashioned values, cool car stars, hilarity and history. Our kids loved Lightning McQueen, the red-hot rookie race car with a big ego, who pulls off the fast lane and learns that sometimes you have to slow down in order to get where you need to be in life. On his way to the most important race of his life, the Piston Cup, Lightning gets lost and rips up the main road in Radiator Springs, a forgotten town on Route 66. Trapped in the small town while he fixes the road, Lightning falls for a beautiful Porsche, makes a new friend, and unearths a secret about the town&#8217;s elder Statescar, Doc Hudson. In doing so, he learns about the value of friendship, the importance of keeping a promise, and what it means to be a winner. The movie&#8217;s fabulous soundtrack and goofy humor gave the kids all the mileage they needed for dancing and laughing in their seats.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Visiting a Car Museum with grandparents and kids in tow is a great way to bring the past alive and two generations together. Our kids have always loved the idea that a car could even be in a museum, and the shiny surfaces to be found in abundance will please even the youngest child. Our local museum has extensive collections dating back to the &#8217;20s, making it fun to track the evolution of the automobile. Kids who have grown up with car seats get their wheels blown off when they first see a rumble seat &#8212; and when they heard how long it took their grandparents to travel from one city to another (in the &#8220;olden days&#8221;). Older kids start to get a sense of how automobiles and freeways changed lives, and our country. Our son, who is obsessed with contemporary high-end sports cars, loved seeing the glamour cars of the past &#8212; while his grandpa whistled in amazement to hear how these cars have held their value over time. Just two boys lookin&#8217; at cars&#8230; some things never change.  <strong>Visit <a title="Kids Off The Couch Website" href="http://kidsoffthecouch.com/"><span style="color: blue">www.kidsoffthecouch.com</span></a> for even more tips, information and great conversation starters.</strong></p>

Our kids slept with their dinosaur books, memorizing each name &#8212; Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus Rex &#8212; and have always wondered what it would be like to meet a real life dinosaur. But wonder no more, because&#8230;they&#8217;re back! Walking With Dinosaurs is a live, theatrical show where science and animatronics meet imagination as 15 snarling, growling, life-sized dinosaurs roam the arena. Putting your kids face-to-face with a Stegosaurus, T. Rex and a Utah Raptor is not as scary as it sounds, though we don&#8217;t recommend the show for kids under six. To get your kids dinosaur-ready, we review &#8220;The Land Before Time&#8221; for little ones this week. If your bigger kids are stalwart, there&#8217;s nothing like &#8220;Jurassic Park&#8221; or the show upon which this traveling stage show is based, the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Walking With Dinosaurs&#8221;.</p>

Since there&#8217;s nothing as cozy after a long week of classes as a Family Movie Night, we have created a list of great films that will complement your kids&#8217; history courses. Take a moment to choose movies that help kids connect to their school curriculum. With these kid-tested and approved films, there&#8217;s no need to tell your children that these movies are educational. We promise &#8212; once you pop in Kit Kittridge: An American Girl or Seabiscuit when your child is studying Depression-era America, meaty conversations will ensue and your kids will naturally connect to what they have learned at school.</p>

<p style="line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">Staying connected to today&#8217;s busy kids who are balancing school, sports and social schedules, is a challenge most parents face. Two Middle School moms have launched a website, <strong><a href="http://www.kidsoffthecouch.com/"><span style="color: blue">www.kidsofftthecouch.com</span></a></strong> that gives parents great ideas for creating family time beyond soccer games and birthday parties. Sarah Bowman and Diane Shakin have spent years exploring the city with their kids, but what makes their ideas unique is that each of their adventures is inspired by a fantastic film. After screening “A Secret Garden”, they explored a real secret garden at The Descanso Gardens in Pasadena. After watching All The President&#8217;s Men with their Sixth graders, they toured the Los Angeles Times&#8217; printing facility and learned how the paper arrives on our doorsteps each morning.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">Every week, Kids Off The Couch introduces families to a new film and adventure, but also provides plenty of details for parents to go beyond the basics. For example, the moms suggest conversation starters about each film: “Freaky Friday” is a perfect conduit for discussing body image with pre-teen girls and “Goal: The Dream Begins” opened the floodgates to a conversation with young boys about the ambition and opportunities available to immigrants in Los Angeles and the U.S. In addition, Kids Off The Couch offers up book lists that relate to each film contributed weekly by “The Center For Excellence in Education&#8221;, Lucy Rafael.  If the adventure involves watching E.T. and visiting the planetarium, parents will find a well-edited selection of books on space - appropriate for kids in pre-school, elementary school and middle schoolers.</p>
<p style="line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">While it may sound unusual to advocate getting on the couch to get kids to unplug, Sarah and Diane insist that film opens the door to culture and family discussions. After a long week, it&#8217;s cozy to flop on the couch with a bowl of popcorn and watch a film that makes everyone happy. From husbands to grandparents, family film night has become a cherished part of these moms&#8217; family life. As the two moms are fond of saying, &#8220;sometimes you&#8217;ve got ON the couch with your kids - to get OFF the couch!&#8221;</p>
<p style="line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">Since launching the site, they have written about nearly 100 film and adventure pairings they&#8217;ve road-tested with their families. Past adventures are listed in the Archives section of the site, and if parents sign-up, they&#8217;ll receive a free, e-mail every week with a fresh idea to get kids off the couch and into their world.</p>
