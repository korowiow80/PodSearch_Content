This farm comprises approximately 91 acres and offers various investment potential. Nestled in the picturesque rolling countryside of the Town of Caledon, this property offers frontages on both Shaws Creek Road and Charleston Side Road. Whether you're looking for a business investment, a country escape, or a combination of both, 18522 Shaws Creek Road can certainly meet your needs. The property offers lush country views in every direction, with beautiful yards surrounding the house.  It also boasts a mature wooded area approximately 15 acres in size with a long wide trail cut-through offering two access points.

The barn itself has been maintained and offers the charm of yesteryear with broad axe shaped beams.  It has been in constant use for over 100 years and neighbours three large paddocks currently used for horses.  The expanses of fields currently has approximately 47 acres under cultivation, and offers the possibly of sand and gravel aggregate extraction. The driveway leads you over a rock-edged culvert which provides access during the spring runoff.  The water follows a defined path until it reaches a lower marsh area. The driveway then continues past the white fenced paddocks to the house, and finally to the drive shed and barn area.

While the Circa 1920 concrete block 2 story farm house and drive shed could benefit from some TLC, they have already received many repairs and updates. The house itself was fitted with new windows in 2001, a new high efficiency propane furnace in 2003, and both the house and barn were rewired in 2004.  The 3 bedroom house is 1558 sq. ft. which does not include a large summer kitchen and storage room.  The second level of the home also offers a large walk-in closet off the main hall that could be used as an office or storage area. 

The house, barn and approximately 10 acres of pasture and paddocks is currently occupied by a long term tenant who has expressed a desire to work out an agreement with a new owner. The current residential tenancy agreement generates a $1,350 per month income and does not include utilities. This rental agreement offers flexibility to the new owner as it is on a month-to-month basis and could be terminated with notice.

Permission was granted in 1994 for an area of the property fronting along the Charleston Side Road for a wayside pit operation and the extraction of 200 thousand metric tonnes of aggregate, however this operation was not carried out. Presently a large portion of the farm has been identified in the Town of Caledon Official Plan as a sand and gravel aggregate resource land. Regardless of the direction taken, the future owner will have a range of possibilities to choose from with respect to this property’s investment potential.
