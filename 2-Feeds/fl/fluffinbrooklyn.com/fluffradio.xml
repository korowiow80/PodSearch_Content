<title>Fluff Radio Review #67: THE END…or This Isn’t Goodbye, This is Banana Hammock</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>

Oh Boyz 2 Men! Why didn’t you explain to me how to actually SAY GOODBYE rather than just singing about how hard it is to do so?! One final show and one final party to send Ms. Annie off to CA in style…A crazy mess of a show with lots of love both from all of you fans, and FOR all of you fans. Fluff Radio Review is the most fun and rewarding creative project I’ve ever been a part of, and Brooklyn misses Annie something fierce. But don’t cry.

Okay…maybe cry a little.

We love each and every one of our listeners. Those who made themselves known and those who secretly grinned to our dumb antics on their headphones. Thank you thank you thank you for listening.

Hugs, Kisses, Spoons, Farts, and Crafts–
Ms. Colleen Ann Felicity Venable, 1/2 of the FFR

Musical Guest:
A screaming mash-up of various “Fluff Radio House Band” members

Tales of Wonder:

    * The Oracle of Raven
    * The Real Reasons For the Breakup
    * The Quest for the Party Foul Song
    * Goodbye Messages for Annie
    * We agree to do 1,000,000 more shows, but then there’s a fire and we all die. Yay!

Songs:

    * Earth Annie (read our incoherent lyrics here)
    * The Party Foul Song

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * “I’m responsible for helping get the internet to canada…one long pipe made out of straws.”
    * “We fluffed for years, drank many beers, and talked of our fart, fart-y-ness.”
    * “Keep that banana-pajamed.”
    * “Lookout california because I like to spoon, too.”

<title>Fluff Radio Review #66: The Second to Last One</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>

Nearly a year after show 66 was recorded, it has at last been edited, polished up, and prepared for your consumption. Will it be worth the wait? The only way to find out is to listen. I’m not saying Jimmy Hoffa is inside, but I am saying that it’s better than that time Geraldo opened his alleged tomb on live television.

Musical Guest:
The Fluff Radio House Band

Tales of Wonder:

Poopin’ at the Dentist
Make Your Own Dolphin
World’s Coolest Drumsticks
Sock Lobster!
Martial Arts Secret Weapon: The Blossom Attack!
Songs:

The Garbage Man
Six Degrees of Johnny Depp (actually it’s more of a game than a song!)
Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

“Dolphin bits inside as a little bonus!”
“I wish Flickr was actually called Flickr-Booger”
“You can have a party and give everyone a shaker egg, and everyone will have a good time.”
“Pregnancy test is my second favorite type of beer.”
“Whenever you need me, just shake, and I’ll be there.”

<title>Fluff Radio Review #62: Postal Pancakes</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
It’s time to fold up your beard and put away your flannel for another year, but we hope everyone had a great Lumberjack Day. In preparation for next year, we reveal an amazing secret that is SO secret that the government probably doesn’t want you to know about it! And I’m not talking about Children of the Unicorn, although the government probably doesn’t want you to know about them either, because if the awesomosity of their sonic vibrations hit the public at large, the world would probably implode with sexy coolness.

Musical Guest:
Children of the Unicorn performing “Night Shark” and “A Girl Like You”

Tales of Wonder:

Lumberjack Day Recap
Spontaneous Citizen’s Arrests
Colleen vs the Peach Martini
Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

“A Gentleman NEVER has tea before four!”
“Magellan’s where it’s at!”
“Most people have b.o… I have p.o.”

Want to know more about how to celebrate Lumberjack Day?

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
Well, it’s official… Fluff Radio is starting to get some gray hairs. That’s right, we’ve finally reached show number sixty. We are officially at Denny’s, eating dinner at 5pm, and getting ready to head over to bingo next. Don’t worry, though, fair listener. We won’t get too comfortable in our old age. In fact, I feel a late mid-life crisis coming on… yeah, screw bingo! And screw you, Moon Over My Hammy! We’re outta here! We’re gonna go buy ourselves a Mustang, CONVERTIBLE! And then we’re gonna drive on down to Mexico for some margaritas, top down, tops off, and saggy boobies flapping in the wind! Happy 60th, mutha-fluffa! Towandaaaaa!!Musical Guest:The Devil Makes Three performing “Old No. 7″ and “Graveyard”Tales of Wonder:    * Colleen gets a tattoo!    * Skymall Madness, round 2!    * Extreme Hot Air Ballooning!Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:    * “The last girl that passed out on my table, she peed!”    * “Basically, it’s for the golf-loving, skeezeball, dishonest person in your life.”    * “Wheels may be disassembled in case of extreme frustration.”    * “I ain’t never gonna dance again, unless it’s to that song.”

<title>Fluff Radio Review #59: Why Are We Building Such a Big Fort?</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
With the summer drawing to a close Annie and Colleen bring you some festive music, tales of whoooa, and juggling with clubs. First it was the Super Secret Lair. Then it was the Cloud Fortress. There’s a new recording studio in town (*cough borough*), and it’s painted all sorts of ugly colors! Call us to give the new studio a name, or to just say hi, or to freestyle rap about why you think blenders really DO need a “nudge” setting. 3 plus 4 equals 7, 22-Fluff!Musical Guest:Why Are We Building Such A Big Ship? performing “Firefly” and “Dance…”Tales of Wonder:    * Friendly Driving Techniques    * How to Make a (Terrifying) Baby    * Blender Settings Confuse Annie    * Can you start a sentence with “Why” and make it a statement?Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:    * “I know what you did last interstate.”    * “It’s like someone stuck them in a blender and hit ‘blender-ate’.”    * “I really want to collect people on the street and then spend my entire salary on fake babies.”    * “He looked like Mayor McCheese in Cop-drag.”

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
With only 12 days remaining until the final book, Annie and Colleen seem unable to think about ANYTHING other than Harry Potter…and David Hasslehoff, and candy dots, and celebrity fund-raisers, and that weird bunny-bird on the Pocky for “MEN” package, and the fact that there’s Pocky FOR MEN, and whether or not they got mr. ed to talk using peanut butter or other persuasive methods…um…yeah but it is mostly all about the Potter. Joined by music from super-awesome Harry and the Potters, The-Show-That-Must-Not-Be-Named must not be ignored.Musical Guest:Harry and the Potters performing “The Hogwarts Tonsil Hockey Team” and “Voldemort Can’t Stop The Rock”Tales of Wonder:    * Don’t Hassle the Hoff    * Surviving Company Picnics    * VOTE! Is Harry Going to DIIIIIE?    * The Real Meaning of “The Deathly Hallows”Impromptu Songs:    * Voldemort is Just Misunderstood    * Hermione Grainer (is Really the Hero)    * Nobody Likes Harry Potter    * Harry’s Evil Twin    * BONUS Medley of a bunch of them!Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:    * “Don’t let that bra be a Hassle. OFF!”    * “Well, either they have to have evil leg hair, or pit hair, or chest hair.”    * “Squirrel your best friend!”    * “And the precursor to the Harry Pooper is Lord Voldefart.”    * “Snape, Snape, he’s got a cape. I hope he doesn’t like to WHAT!”http://www.fluffinbrooklyn.com for more!

Missed Connection: Our Eyes Met on the F-Train-- dm4lw*

Our eyes met as we pulled up to the Jay Street/Borough Hall stop, yours a crystal blue, mine a slightly glowing red. If I still had a heart I bet it would have burst out of my chest and hit you smack in yours. Please don't think me sexist when I tell you that I was drooling just looking at you. It's not just your body I fell for, I could just tell you had a wonderful braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain... But then you ran off, kicking a part of me out of your life and out of the train doors. (Maybe you hadn't noticed that my hand had just fallen off.) I'll love you always and forever. Or at least until I meet a woman who can't run as fast. 

*dead male for live woman

Musical Guest: 

The Unbearables performing "Zombies, Unite!" and "Maybe Just One Bite" from their amazing Zombie Rock Opera: JUST ONE BITE 

Tales of Wonder:
The Fan Mail Bag (with a letter from Rob Pernermurdder!) 
Office Ghosts
Murderous and Murdering Finches
Alyssa, Annie, and Colleen Solve Homelessness and Cure No-Sense-Of-Direction Disease
Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:
"Dear girl in the office that curses at her computer a lot...I'm the ghost...Boo."
"Notice anything different?" "Oh, you mean the dead baby?" 
"Her laaaAAaady fingers." </description>

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #53: Anyone Want to Stop for Donut Burgers and Gas?</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>

Surprisingly, there are some things in the world so disturbing that even Annie and Colleen can't make them up. But don't worry, noble fans...there are still a whole lot of disturbing things that they DO make. At least now they can blame it on the puppy...

Musical Guest:

Ultraviolet performing "Gimme My Electro" and "Dead on the Dancefloor"

Tales of Wonder:

    * Superhero Phone
    * A Detailed Map of the Canadian Interstate System
    * The Donut Burgers!
    * Annie Can See the Future (she's just bad at psychic testing)
    * Signs of a good allergist

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Yes, I know there is an enormous bunny rampaging the town. *click*"
    * "He used to fart on me and now he farts on tv, or maybe he doesn't, now he clenches."
    * "If you can't imagine the "pineapple pants" I am imagining you're missing out."</description>

<description>

If there's one thing you learn from this week's show (other than how to really confuse a puppy) is that the only thing more fun than walking on clouds is walking on clouds with your feet cut off.

Her left nostril apologizes profusely.)    * First Recording in the Cloud Fortress    * Annie's Elephant in the Closet Joke    * Koosh Balls of Danger    * The "Colleen wants to cut off her feet and buy prosthetic feet" FundMost Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:    * "Instead of her fondling her possessions, for once she's looking at mine."    * "Wanger sounds like the dirty section of the airport."    * "Captain Hook. He's like a book. Boobs. Boobs. Boobs."</description>

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #51: Swiss Cheese</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>

Dear Swiss Cheese,

I am writing you today because there is something I must ask of you. Now, I know that you and I have had our differences in the past. We haven't always gotten along. In fact, of all the cheeses, you just happen to be my very least favorite, with your awkward holes and your mildly nutty flavor. So, you can imagine how difficult it is for me today to swallow my pride and ask of you a favor. You see, Swiss Cheese... I love my Ham. No, I mean, like, I REALLY love it... and lately, I've been getting this vibe from you that you might be trying to come between me and my Ham. Truth be told, Swiss Cheese, I just don't know if I can compete. If push came to shove, I don't know for sure if my Ham would pick you over me. I couldn't take it, Swissy, I just couldn't TAKE it if my Ham were to leave me! I'd die inside! Living a life without it's salty meatiness... bologna would just never suffice. So please, Swiss Cheese... I'm begging of you... please don't take my Ham.

Sincerely,
Annie

Musical Guest:

Me First and the Gimme Gimmes performing "Jolene" and "End of the Road"

Impromptu Songs:

    * Swiss Cheese
    * Danny's Song, as sung by Abe Lincoln and Jimmy AF Venable (deleted from actual show due to terrifyingness)

Tales of Wonder:

    * Annie and Colleen share their families' favorite traditional ways to stuff themselves silly during the holidays
    * The PARROT BAG!
    * The Cranberries' "Linger"- true meaning exposed!
    * Cool new fan art!

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Matchmaker, matchmaker give me a Mikey Give him big hair, make it all spikey!"
    * "Even though your nose is runny, I'm so in love with ya honey..."
    * "That's a great way to start your Christmas... with clam gas."

Dear Swiss Cheese,

I am writing you today because there is something I must ask of you. Now, I know that you and I have had our differences in the past. We haven't always gotten along. In fact, of all the cheeses, you just happen to be my very least favorite, with your awkward holes and your mildly nutty flavor. So, you can imagine how difficult it is for me today to swallow my pride and ask of you a favor. You see, Swiss Cheese... I love my Ham. No, I mean, like, I REALLY love it... and lately, I've been getting this vibe from you that you might be trying to come between me and my Ham. Truth be told, Swiss Cheese, I just don't know if I can compete. If push came to shove, I don't know for sure if my Ham would pick you over me. I couldn't take it, Swissy, I just couldn't TAKE it if my Ham were to leave me! I'd die inside! Living a life without it's salty meatiness... bologna would just never suffice. So please, Swiss Cheese... I'm begging of you... please don't take my Ham.

Sincerely,
Annie

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #49: Silver Parties and Acronymed Farties</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>

With Thanksgiving here, and Christmas just around the bend (by which I mean Dead Man's Curve), Annie and Colleen have been participating in a lot of "good cheer"! After all, nothing says "winter solstice" like a party dedicated entirely to the shininess of the color silver! So take a break from the relatives. Grab yourself a cup o' kindness and a cozy can of cranberry sauce, and cuddle up to the dulcet tones of this week's musical guest, Nouvelle Vague.

Oh yeah and the ROAST US contest isn't over yet! Send your best roast to 775-416-5492.

Musical Guest:

Nouvelle Vague performing "Ever Fallen In Love" and "Sweet and Tender Hooligan"

Tales of Wonder:

    * Relationship Fart Alert Levels Acronyms
    * Silver Party Recap
    * Alyssa cuts a hair!
    * Show 50 Ramp up

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Does Alyssa know that I have underwear everywhere? It was an explosion of my panties!"
    * "It's terrifying because the one girl's nostrils are floating separately for awhile until they find eachother, and they join together again, in harmony, on her nose."
    * "I won [a war with China]! China forfeited by not answering my emails subject "Re: War With You". "

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #47: Mothra vs. Miyagi</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird...it's a plane...no, it's Mothra! EEP! This week, Annie and Colleen are attacked late in the night by various wayward buggies, but don't you worry, Annie Sanders: Fly Assassin has her trusty chopsticks handy! Plus! A review of the new Bob "isn't dead yet" Dylan musical by Colleen (you know you've been dying to see it), a new Fluff fan challenge, and two songs by HUMANWINE (whose songs will certainly warrant a spot on that Halloween party playlist you've been working on all week).

Musical Guest:

HUMANWINE performing "Rivolta Silenziosa" and "Script Language"

Tales of Wonder:

    * A visit from Mothra!
    * Colleen's has a new favorite annoying noise. Can you guess what it is?
    * Why it's useful to be able to recognize the back of Twyla Tharp’s head
    * How to give a machine a stomach-ache

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Am I gonna murder something on air?"
    * "Jeff Goldblum was flying around our apartment..."
    * "Instead of ompa lompas he has genetically modified cows to do his bidding."
    * "It's the dreaded ax moth!"

October is upon us, dear Fluff fans, which can only mean lumberjacks, halloween, christian guilt, and an inability to walk around naked like you really really really want to.

    * "Instead of ompa lompas he has genetically modified cows to do his bidding."
    * "I think having a glass monkey head would still be weird."

Your cadaverous pallor betrays an aura of foreboding, almost as though you sense a disquieting metamorphosis as Annie and Colleen bring you yet another host of urban legends and scientific anomalies. What is fact and what is fiction, science fans? Are Annie and Colleen actually nutjobs, or is it just your imagination, hmmm? And consider this dismaying observation: this podcast has no logic and no seriousness. Which offers you this chilling challenge... to find a rational explanation! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Of course, there's always OUR way...

Musical Guest:

Dressy Bessy performing "Electrified" and "Who'd Stop The Rain"

Tales of Wonder:

    * A visit from the Very-Shallow-Water Shark
    * Two Wonderfully Horrifying NYC Transit Stories
    * Bingo with Murray Hill

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #44: 16 Bits of Fluff</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
Choose any of these four exciting characters to guide you through this week's show: Colleen AF Venable, Annie Sanders, Chris Dlugosz, or Mikey IQ Jones. Each has a special ability: Annie has brilliant facial hair and can jump very high, Mikey is very good at defying gravity, Chris can throw things quickly and is a very agile pianist, and Colleen is very unbalanced and smells a bit like the inside of a turkey. Good luck! I hope you make it to level 7 because that's totally the best one. Oh yeah, and should anyone try to interfere with your listening to Fluff Radio Show #44 they can be easily defeated by throwing items plucked from the ground. Like vegetables, other people, or spare trombones.

Musical Guest:

Chris Dlugosz, of PIXEL and ARMCANNON fame, performing "Original 03" and "Super Mario Bros-Underworld Contorted"

Tales of Wonder:

    * We'd Do Hanson If It Cured Cancer
    * Myth Bustin' with Mr. Bean
    * Life is Good in a Frogsuit
    * How to Play Crackman

Impromptu Songs:

      Tragic Birthday (music by Chris Dlugosz, words, screams, and creepy whispers by Annie, Colleen, and Mikey)

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Cheek implants." "Chicken plants?" "Yes. She got chickens implanted in her stomach so she'd never be hungry again."
    * "Streets on the China, never hurt um' before."
    * "The thought of the proverbial dangling quiche."
    * "It's a 'Turkey on Mr. Bean's Head' phone and to answer the phone you lift the turkey off Mr. Bean's head and put it over your own."

<description>
Greetings, science fans! I like that..."science fans"...it's like "sports fans," but for nerds. Today, Annie and Colleen bring you a first in audio technology. By melding together the present technology of podcast radio and the past technology of 3-D movies and Michael Jackson's hot dance moves, Annie and Colleen present: THE VERY FIRST 3-D PODCAST! Ok, so actually we just describe the reall cool 3-D Captain EO comic book we got, but it's still really...um...different.

May the dance be with you.

Musical Guest:

One Ring Zero performing two and a half songs from their As Smart As We Are album: "Radio" (words by Daniel Handler the Social and Literary Representative of Lemony Snicket), "Deposition Disposition" (words by Lawrence Krauser), and a clip of "M.C" (words by Michael Chabon in his rejection e-mail to the group)

Tales of Wonder:

    * One Year Anniversary!
    * Colleen Gives Annie the Awesomest Thing Ever: A 3-D Captain EO Comic Book
    * The Red Party
    * Fan Calls from Gwangi and Yanichka
    * Annie Goes to Lake Powell or "Welcome to the Jungle" in the Desert

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Did everyone bring their lesbians?"
    * "Slow in the head, easy in the bed!"
    * "We made an acronym, there's no going back now!"

<description>
Talk about a show with a whole lot going on! Annie, Alyssa, and Colleen fight their way through handbikes, giant hamster balls, a series of archived commercials made by a hyperactive eight-year-old Colleen, an self-interview by an awesome band, many mentions of racy things, piles of chest hair, and tennis ball bullets.

Tales of Wonder:

    * Twisties and the Chickenator
    * 1988 KCL Radio 1 (8 Year Old Colleen performs "Applejuice," "Excedrin," and "Interview With Kathleen Venable")
    * Latex Crazies and Documentaries
    * American Gladiators Explained
    * The Do's/Don't's of Chest Hair Shaving at Parties

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "It was like the Milli Vanilli of wine coolers"
    * "I sang but she fake pianasized."
    * "God my ass is hurting my fingertips!"

<description>
Long, long ago in a land we liked to call 2005 we started this here radio show without a single smidgen of an idea what we were doing. In honor of our 40th show we bring back our very first musical guest for a super special LIVE performance. Oooooooh! Tom Warnick believed in us back before everyone else did...or maybe he just really wanted that spray on tan we had promised him. The awesome Adam and Alyssa also join us this week, and in case you thought we were kidding, super secret show 39 is now floating around our ftp server. Yee be pirates and it be booty! Can you find it? I'll give you a hint: It totally won't be worth the effort!

Musical Guest:

Tom Warnick and The World's Fair performing "A Little Space" and "Kissing Stand" from his super brand new album "MAY I SEE SOME ID"

    * Show 39: The Shortest Show Ever
    * Dr. Ethan Frome and Larry King
    * Adam Knows Way Too Much About Video Games
    * The David Hasslehoff Store (the one on 17th)
    * Best Soap Opera Moments of All Time

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "You're welcome. That spray on tan you promised never arrived in the mail..."
    * "Link was Link and Princess Zelda was Zelda." "And they were brother and sister that were in love?!"
    * "It's like hot present potato."
    * "A precious sediment of burritto...sounds like you need Beano."
    * "Sitting on my vibrating chicken bridge."

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #36: Rumby Stick</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
Hallo, neighbor! What brings thee to this pre-Colonial neck of the woods? I see you are doing naught but sitting. An idle mind is the devil's playground, or so we say. Perchance I might interest you in a toy of rustic fashioning, a simple wheel propelled by a wooden rod. Yes, my friend, it is my rumby stick! Would you like to have a go at it? It may be difficult at first, but stay with it and soon you shall find yourself cavorting up and down the cobblestones with nary a care in the world! Why, just last week I sold one to old Thomas Payne, and what a time he had!

Musical Guest:

The Ditty Bops performing "Angel With An Attitude" and "Aluminum Can"

Tales of Wonder:

    * The Studio Is Haunted by Playground Ghosts (aka the Yates and the Malki!)
    * MOCCA Recap
    * Colonial Williamsburg is Embarrassing at 25 with your Parents
    * The FLUFF WHO Finalists are Announced!

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Putting on the Ritz...Cracker that is!"
    * "I'm full of cheese and ready for love!"
    * "La la la naked."
    * "Free high-fives, while supplies last."

They said if you send in your picture they'll make your head into a board game. Are you chewing gum? They said they could find out who my daddy is. I bet he's a baseball player. Or an astronaut.

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #31: Gilda</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
This is Gilda. Gilda Goldenstein.  I hope you are all planning on going to temple this weekend like the goodJews your mother and father taught you to be. My Bobbywill be there. He’s single now. Colleen turned him down. She doesn’t know what she’s missing. My mother always told me to keep a jag in the garage, a mink in my closet and a Jewish tiger in my bed, if you know what I mean. My Bobby will give you all three. So really, I think you should come to temple. Who knows, maybe my Bobby will like you. He especially likes girls with good noses. You can always tell a good cook if she has a good nose. And my Bobby loves a good cook. He once dated a woman who wasn’t such a good cook. I made sure he knew what he was gettng himself into. I cooked him every kind of kosher recipe I could find and brought it over every night, right after they ate dinner and before I got Bobby into his pajamas, just so he could see what he was missing. She didn’t last long. But I’m sure you’re a great cook. You should come to temple and meet my Bobby. He’s such a handsome boy. Take care, honey. And tell your mother I said hello.
-Gilda

    * Do things taste better when eaten through your nose? A Fluff Radio Exclusive

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

<description>
Get out your hands and feet and then somebody else's hands or feet (your choice) cause we just hit show number 30! This week's show is like the back of a highlights book where you have to figure out what's different. Can you figure it out? I'll give you a hint: it has nothing to do with the assembly of medival weapons or a lack of pants or the Cliffhanger fan club or the ghost of Peanuts Past or Annie's New Gold Tooth...still haven't gotten it? Well, I could give you more hints, but I've got a murder weapon to assemble.

Musical Guest:

Jason Webley performing "Dance While the Sky Crashes Down" and "Maps"

Tales of Wonder:

    * Tourist Season Begins
    * Catapult Assembly 101
    * Ear Patches are Sexy
    * If We Wrote "Cliffhanger" it Would Have Been A Much Better Movie
    * Business Squirrel Hunting)

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Everything's better on Roller Skates. I'm planning on getting that tattoo as a bumper sticker."
    * "That sounds like a fat lady looking at a chocolate empire state building."
    * "Those are animatronic bugs that are selling something. Those are animatronic bugs with purpose. Those are animatronic bugs with a career goal."
    * "The timing was so perfect that we totally shat little green apples."
    * "And there can be Planet Argo the Horse and Plant Joxer the kind-hearted bumbling idiot."

Listen to Annie and Colleen in "Caawfee Co'nuh," available for download now!

    * Exciting Toof Update
    * Secret Apartment Dancing

    * "I'm gonna Macarena you in the neck!"
    * "I'm never gonna be a full Brooklynite if I keep putting off this whole people killing thing."
    * I'm Luke (Skywalker), and I'm really upset! You hurt my feelings!"
    * "Master Luke, I'm a big anal retentive robot, which is weird, because I never had an anal phase, cuz I'm a robot!"

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #26: A Whole Lotta Malarkey</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
This week marks the official annoucement of the FLUFF HOTLINE where all you lovely folk can leave Annie and Colleen a voicemail message whenever your heart desires! Inspired by Scott Bateman's animation of our "I Don't Want To Be Your Friend on Myspace" song, we want all of you to call 718-304-7939 and leave us the worst pickup line or message you've ever received through myspace or any other site that attracts sketchy sketchy people that go by names like "Arms." If you have no myspace stories (lucky you!) feel free to call us and tell us any other story, perhaps even the one about the time you broke that million dollar vase in the Louvre and you TOTALLY blamed it on the old lady standing next to you.

Musical Guest:

Jubb and the Dirty Sleeves performing "Malarkey" and "More Sincere Than Elvis"

Tales of Wonder:

    * A Twister-ed St. Patrick's Day
    * Cultural Void of Food
    * Official Birth of the Fluff Hotline! 718-304-7939
    * The Seamonster in Colleen's Heart
    * Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Bam-Bam

Sketches:

    * Garrison Teaches Us About Britney and Trout

Impromptu Songs:

    * 718-304-7939 (It's EASY to Remember!)

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "My favorite is Beef-Jerky-Big-League-Chew Beaver."
    * "Kinda how Barney Rubble is always trying to steal Fred Flintstone's wife."
    * "There's a black hole in my butt." "Just sucking up your undies?"
    * "I finally pull my thumb out of my ass and you scare me about it!"

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>
This week we welcome several guests into the super secret lair studio, including Anya, Marianne, Abel, and extra-special guest Michael Lucid from the sketch comedy show Pretty Things! Unbeknownst to Colleen, Annie even sneaks in a few serious interview-like questions for Michael... but, unbeknownst to Annie, Colleen is perfectly capable of turning serious interview-like questions into discussions about loin-cloths.

Musical Guest:

Pretty Things performing "Str8 for a Minute," "Always a Bad Girl," and "Johnny Jimmy Joe" (click on to watch the videos)

P.S. Colleen strongly identifies with Bug Girl

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #22: Secret Tree Ninjas in Sexy Underthings</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>One score and two weeks ago, Annie and Colleen brought forth onto this continent a new podcast, conceived in hilarity, and dedicated to the pursuit of silliness. Some days, it's a good day to die, and some days it's a good day for Dennys' Grand Slam Breakfast... but most of the time, you can bet that it's a bad day to wear thong underwear. Join us this week as we discuss some post-Valentine's Day experiences that rubbed us the wrong way.

Musical Guest:

Keelay performing "We Can Make a Baby" and "America"

Tales of Wonder:

    * Proof that Colleen is NOT Sexy
    * Annie=Secret Tree Ninja
    * Colleen and the Killer Whales Save Sherlock Holmes from the Giant Crabs


Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "I guess that makes a little more sense than a compulsive arm eater."
    * "It's kinda like arts and crafts baby-makin'."
    * "Glue and staples aren't enemies. They're allies in the war against loose paper sheets and disorganization."

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #17: Ain't Nothing Like Red Bull, Sky Mall, and Hour Long String Cheese</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>An extremely scientific study as to whether or not a hyperactive person can explode due to Red Bull results in the the conclusion that Red Bulls taste like poop! Also, we aren't kidding about the kidding about the "If everyone donates 25 cents we'll install a gear shift on Colleen's toilet" thing! WE WANT TO DRIVE A TOILET (as well as world peace...world peace would be pretty cool, too, we guess.)

Musical Guest:

Amy Miles performing "Back to Bed" and "Heavy Packer"

Tales of Wonder:

    * "On The Run" and the Magic of String Cheese
    * Evan Dashevsky: Hero to the People (or at least the drunk ones on New Years)
    * The Magic of Sky Mall (including Mr. Treehead and A Downshifting toilet)
    * Baby Juices and Backwards Messages

Impromptu Songs:

    * Struffla (with Honey on Top!) 

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Yes, electrical string cheese with bifocals."
    * "it's not like you're going to instantaneously explode it's notlike cocaine or something." "People instantaneously explode from cocaine?!"
    * "It's gotta be really hard to do martial arts on a dog."
    * "You can make your own diner out of it! Serve hamburgers! Make Coldslaw! All with the power of BABY JUICE!"

    <title>A Very Fluffy Christmas 2005</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>This week we've got a special little Christmas show for you as Annie and Colleen sing Christmas Carols which you and all your family (seriously make SURE to put it on when all your family, especially when the really conservative ones or the ones who are dentists and hate all talk of carmelized popcorn, are listening).

Musical Guest:

The Fluff Radio Review House Band performing "We, Will, We Will, Grinch You," a rather pretty (well at least for like 45 seconds) version of "Greenselves," and the brand new, soon to be a holiday classic "Oh, Sweet Yummy" which you can download separately HERE because we think it's the most amazing song we've ever improvised and who CAN'T relate with the feeling of not getting the one gift you were secretly dreaming of all along. Tri-flavored popcorn...how I miss you.

Tales of Wonder:

    * How to dance the GrandMamba
    * Christmas Transit Wackiness: Colleen and Annie bike 26 miles in one day

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "SUUUUUUUUGAR it's in my system. It's making me want to run in place!"
    * "Nothing says 'I love you' at Christmas (no one loves me) like a nice big two-foot tin of the funky munchie. (Oh, yeah! I woulda liked) Honey, now (to be loved.) sexy, hardcore."
    * "I'd pour you over me like Gatorade at the end of the Super Bowl!"
    * "Are you giving them away for 'Eat Blue Food Day'?"

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #15: Meet the Presidents</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>Recorded from 3am to 4am, Show 15 doesn't always go the most coherent route (and just might contain the most annoying opening to a show ever) but it DOES prove that Annie Sanders is President of Knowing Weird Facts About Presidents and Colleen AF Venable always looks for any way to bring Dizzy Bat Baseball into conversations. *CLAP, CLAP, CLAP, CLAP, CLAP!*

Musical Guest:

Tigers and Monkeys performing "Fire Escape" and "Loose Mouth"

Skits:

    * Meet the Presidents

Tales of Wonder:

    * Awful Nicknames: From Boog to Beanies
    * Colleen's Got the (extra) Clap
    * Pedro Pietri's "Out of Order"

Improptu Songs:

    * Poppyseed Man (see the myth, the LEGEND, by clicking HERE)

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Her Native American name is "White Lady Who Likes Native Americans Too Much."
    * "Frips? That sounds like some sort of children's hospital."
    * "Awwwww, you're such a cute little masochistic dog f***ker!"

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #14: Consulting the Carrot Cards</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>Ahhh, very interesting. From the moment you stepped into my Fortune Teller parlor I felt a strong presence of spirits. Come, dearie, sit down and let me read your carrot cards. Let me see what the carrots have in store for you. Hmmmm very interesting? The priestess means you will have a good love life and find a cool brooch. The fortune card means you'll sell your brooch and occasionally some love for a good amount of money. The Death means..oh dear...well it's right here next to the Braces card...Have you been flossing?

Musical Guest:

Palomar performing "The Lost Freshman" and "The Planeiac"

Tales of Wonder:

    * How to Get Free Dental Work
    * Colleen Teaches You How to Cheat at Operation
    * Broken Up Bands That We Can't Get

Improptu Songs:

    * The Fluff Theme Song: Kazoo-zoo style

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "P.S.S. Oooh Maaaaaaaangalo."
    * "It sounds like an old lady who just had her ass pinched, like a whole bunch of old ladies and some guy who's got really fast pinching fingers."
    * "Poppin' Fresh Colleeeeeeeeeeeen!"

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #13: The Ashley and Chuck Norris Show</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>Show 13 (14 if you're the superstitious type) features our first ever less-than-30-people guest stars, Ms. Ashley, a good friend of Annie's for the past 20 years, as well as Chuck Norris, who, while quite silent during much of the episode delivered a fatal roundhouse to Colleen during her signature goodbye at the end of the show. She will be missed...(DIBS ON HER DDR MATS!) This show was our longest to date, editing it down from 64 minutes of audio goodness. So much good stuff was taken out we could have made TWO Fluff shows out of it! I suggest you listen carefully and keep an eye out for weevils, Norris, and soapy pasta.

Musical Guest:

Mad Caddies performing "Just One More" (via the Podsafe Music Network) and Deep Six performing "First Days of Summer"

Tales of Wonder:

    * Roadside Attractions of the South-West: Hey Baby, Nice (straight) Ass (road)!
    * The Worst Cooks in the World
    * "Making Friends 101" Taught by Professor Ashley
    * CNN Ticker Guy's Last Day on the Job
    *

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "There's a Margarita Festival that I saw on TV one time where they make this gigantic enchiladas...I mean Margarita."
    * "You know those black spots in the potatoes...that's not pepper. It's weevils."
    * "Jesus was Vice President of your kindergarten?!"
    * "It's the Botox. It's building up like a pimple!"

    <title>Fluff Radio Review #12: Delta Burke Cake</title>

    <itunes:author>Colleen AF Venable and Annie Sanders</itunes:author>

<description>In the aftermath of the 100th Comic and 10th Podcast Fiesta last week, there remained, among other things (such as tap shoes and a ukulele), a completely untouched ode to Delta Burke in the form of a chocolate frosted yellow cake. As the week progressed, large sections of the cake began to mysteriously disappear during the night. There could only be one explanation- Delta Burke was stealing our CAKE. This is our revenge...

Musical Guest:

SHEE performing "Work Clothes" and "My Girl (Kitty, Kitty)"

Tales of Wonder:

    * Mr. Bare-Cheeks Rides the Subway
    * Colleen's Terrible, Horrible, Very Bad Week

Most Memorable Lines Taken Out of Context:

    * "Coconut penalty!"
    * "I was in high school in college."
    * "The moral of the storal: Leg Hair Makes Paisleys."
    * "New York-The City That Doesn't Exfoliate."
    * "Some people are airsores."
