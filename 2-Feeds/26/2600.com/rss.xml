    <description>It was Friday, June 5, 1987 when we held the very first 2600 meeting at what was then known as the Citicorp Center in New York City. The meeting was modeled after the weekly &quot;TAP&quot; meetings which had been taking place in New York for many years, organized by the phone phreak newsletter which published from the early 1970s to 1983. We had a number of people turn up and it was decided that the meetings should continue. They eventually would expand into cities all over the world and the first Friday of the month became known as &quot;2600 Meeting Day&quot; amongst hackers, law enforcement agencies, and corporate boards everywhere.

    <description>It's currently the last day of May, which means that it's the last day for potential speakers at this year's HOPE conference to send in their submissions. Because of the huge number of entries this year, we cannot extend this deadline. After midnight (Eastern Daylight Time), we will no longer be accepting speaker submissions. So if you plan on giving a talk or throwing together a panel discussion, we suggest you drop whatever you're doing and put together an email that outlines your proposal, and send that on in to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:speakers@hope.net&quot;&gt;speakers@hope.net.&lt;/a&gt; You can find a list of guidelines &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hopenumbernine.net/speakers/tips-for-submitting-a-talk-to-hope/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;

    <description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.2600.com/spring2012.html&quot;&gt;Spring issue of 2600&lt;/a&gt; has been officially released in digital and paper versions worldwide. If you're a &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.2600.com/subscriptions.html&quot;&gt;subscriber,&lt;/a&gt; you likely already have gotten the Spring issue delivered to you. If not, it should be in your hands really soon. For those of you who get 2600 at bookstores or newsstands, you can start planning your trip to those places now, as we believe the issues are already on the stands. For those of you in the electronic world, your issues will be ready in a matter of seconds, or even less if you've got a Kindle subscription, as your copy will have already been magically beamed to your Kindle device.
We're still trying to get on the Barnes and Noble subscription list, but until that happens, you can pick up individual issues on their site.
