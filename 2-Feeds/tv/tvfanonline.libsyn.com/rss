<p>A date has been set for the 2012 Daytime Emmy Awards. Would Oprah be smart to air the Daytime Emmys on OWN?</p>
<p>The DC gang weighs in on The Bold and the Beautiful 25th anniversary celebration. Has B&amp;B lost sight of telling multi-layered storylines, in favor a single "A" storyline? Why is everyone so obsessed with Hope&rsquo;s sex life?</p>
<p>Will&rsquo;s coming out storyline on Days of Our Lives continues to be one of the best in daytime. Carrie takes on Abby after learning the truth. John and Hope&rsquo;s time in Alamania isn&rsquo;t something the DC crew is enjoying. Should DAYS spend more time on stories like Will&rsquo;s coming out and less time attempting to recreate the past?</p>
<p>General Hospital shocked fans with the revelation that Robin isn&rsquo;t dead, but instead very much alive. Does GH need to avoid Johnny having sex with Kate so that he doesn&rsquo;t end up with a stigma, like DAYS&rsquo; EJ and OLTL&rsquo;s Robert Ford?</p>
<p>The Young and the Restless&rsquo; ratings are falling fast and the shows terrible state sets Jamey off on an epic rant about what it has become. From Y&amp;R&rsquo;s double wedding to the Japanese cosmetics industry, he dissects everything that is wrong with the No. 1 rated soap. Has it become an All My Children nursing home?</p>
<p>All this and much more on today&rsquo;s show!</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #660: DC EXCLUSIVE: Ron Carlivati on Wrapping One Life to Live and Checking Into General Hospital </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-660-dc-exclusive-ron-carlivati-on-wrapping-one-life-to-live-and-checking-into-general-hospital-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>He gave up a career as a lawyer to pursue his true passion for writing soap operas. Now, some 15 years after first joining One Life to Live as a writer's assistant, the soap's last head writer Ron Carlivati joins Daytime Confidential's Luke Kerr, Jamey Giddens, Jillian Bowe, Regan Cellura and Melodie Aikels to dish having completed the daunting task of wrapping the iconic sudser up on ABC Daytime.</p>
<p>Hear from Carlivati himself on his thoughts about how the 43-year-old sudser came to a close. Would he have done things differently had he known OLTL wouldn't be moving online immediately following the ABC finale? Carlivati shares how it felt to be able to bring back such popular veterans as Jessica Tuck (Megan), Roscoe Born (Mitch), Fiona Hutchison (Gabrielle), Susan Batten (Luna), Ty Treadway (Troy), and more during the soap's Between Heaven and Hell arc during its final week.</p>
<p>He also clears up all those rumors surrounding the exits of Robin Strasser (Dorian) and Trevor St. John (Victor), the latter of whom made a surprise appearance in the series finale. Tune in to hear how Carlivati planned to bring Dorian Lord back in a story that would have had President Barack Obama watching his back!</p>
<p>Is Carlivati satisfied with the way things ended for such Llanview lovers as Clint and Viki (Jerry VerDorn and Erika Slezak), John and Natalie (Michael Easton and Melissa Archer), Todd and Blair (Roger Howarth and Kassie DePaiva), Rex and Gigi (John-Paul Lavoisier and Farah Fath)? He also shares what it meant to be able to finally reunite Cord and Tina (John Loprieno and Andrea Evans). Then the conversation shifts to Carlivati's next gig. He and his boss Frank Valentini are now serving as head writer and executive producer respectively of ABC's last daytime soap opera General Hospital. With Howarth, DePaiva, Easton and Kristen Alderson (Starr) all following Frank and Ron to Port Charles, should fans be worried about those rumors that GH and OLTL are merging? Hear Carlivati set things straight as only he can, revealing he's been a fan of General Hospital even longer than he was of OLTL. And of General Hospital, with the almost 50-year-old, one-time supersoap fighting for its life against Katie Couric, The Chew and The Revolution, does Carlivati feel added pressure to help keep GH on the air? This is one podcast no fan of One Life to Live or General Hospital can afford to miss, that is if you want to hear the real truth from the writer's mouth!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke Kerr, Jamey Giddens, Jillian Bowe and Melodie Aikels dive into all the latest The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless headlines and storylines, including:</p>
<p>Bill Spencer continues to manipulate of Liam and Hope&rsquo;s relationship on The Bold and the Beautiful. Should B&amp;B refocus on a Katie/Bill/Steffy triangle instead of Steffy/Liam/Hope?</p>
<p>Will&rsquo;s relationship with Marlena is a highlight of Days of Our Lives, but there are a lot of good reasons to be watching Salem&rsquo;s citizens in 2012.</p>
<p>The DC gang is counting the days until Ron Carlivati&rsquo;s episodes of General Hospital begin airing. They weigh in on Liz and Ewan, Scrubs and Michael revealing to Port Charles that Jax is still alive. We know Ted King and Michael Easton are hopping from OLTL to GH, but Jamey reveals that more OLTL stars could be on the way.</p>
<p>One Life to Live&rsquo;s prison break had the DC crew glued to their TVs. From Lindsay and Troy to Mitch and Alison Perkins, they dive into it all. Cole reunited with Star. Mitch held Natalie captive. Alison reveals a secret to Viki and Clint. Lindsay helped save Nora. It was must see TV.</p>
<p>The Young and the Restless signs Darnell Williams and plans to reunite him with Debbi Morgan in Genoa City. Why is Y&amp;R so intent on bringing on stars from low rated soaps, instead of focusing on its own characters? Was it appropriate for Harmony to refer to Phyllis as &ldquo;Miss Phyllis?&rdquo;</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-653-so-long-soap-killers]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s super-sized Daytime Confidential podcast Luke Kerr, Jamey Giddens, Jillian Bowe and Melodie Aikels react to Brian Frons stepping down at ABC Daytime and Jill Farren Phelps being removed at General Hospital. The DC gang looks back on these two executives show-killing history and discusses the state they are leaving GH in. The DC crew then weighs in on the announcement that Frank Valentini and Ron Carlivati are taking over at ABC&rsquo;s last remaining soap. What things could they do to signal to fans that a new day is dawning on Port Charles.</p>
<p>Jamey lays out which storylines should be rewritten immediately and which quadrangle could help spike ratings. Luke suggests an early sign to GH fans would be to announce the re-hiring of Lexi Ainsworth as Kristina. The DC gang explores which fan favorites should be brought back as soon as possible and debate which one One Life to Live actor or character they&rsquo;d love to see make the jump to Port Charles.</p>
<p>Even though ABC soap news dominated the week, the DC gang discusses Bryan Dattilo being spotted on the Days of Our Lives set, Will&rsquo;s coming out story and the fallout from EJ and Sami having sex. Jamey reveals which popular Salem resident he&rsquo;d kill off and give Alison Sweeney a meaty storyline. The Bold and the Beautiful&rsquo;s Katie isn&rsquo;t happy that Steffy is circling Bill again. Is it time for Deacon to leave Genoa City and come to Los Angeles to help his daughter Hope fight Steffy? Is it time for Jackie to leave the fashion business? Which pairing suggestion would bring a little love to Stephanie&rsquo;s life?</p>
<p>The DC crew loves having Nikki back in Genoa City, but will Deacon blackmail her into marrying him? Diane&rsquo;s murder mystery continues, but now Victor is protecting Nikki. What will Patty do next?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast, The Morning Jolt&rsquo;s Larry Flick graciously shares his interview with General Hospital&rsquo;s Jason Thompson. During the must-hear episode Flick asks Thompson to weigh in on GH&rsquo;s controversial decision to have Lisa (Brianna Brown) use Robin&rsquo;s (Kimberly McCullough) HIV positive blood as a weapon. Robin&rsquo;s status has been an important part of GH&rsquo;s legacy and he shares the concern he and McCullough felt, when they first learned what was going to happen.</p>
<p>Thompson and Flick then discuss the project that keeps him busy, when he&rsquo;s not on the GH set, Unknown Compelling Force. Uncovering the truth behind the true story of Russian hikers&ndash;whose mysterious deaths were listed as &ldquo;An Unknown Compelling Force&rdquo; and classified by the Russian government&ndash;has become a passion project for Thompson. Hear him recount some of the stories told by the hiker&rsquo;s families and why he and director Donnie Eichar want to help bring them closure. This is an interview you won&rsquo;t want to miss!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke Kerr, Jamey Giddens, Jillian Bowe, Regan Cellura and Melodie Aikles discuss the latest in All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>ABC soap fans protest the cancellation of All My Children and One Life to Live at ABC upfronts. Ryan (Cameron Mathison) and Madison (Stephanie Gatschet) lose their baby. General Hospital fired Bob Guza. What does this mean for Port Charles? Does anyone want to see a Kristina (Lexie Ainsworth) and Ethan (Nathan Parsons) redux?</p>
<p>Taylor (Hunter Tylo) ate some of those oh so special berries on The Bold and the Beautiful and had fantasies of Ridge (Ronn Moss) in a Speedo. Days of Our Lives fired Dena Higley and replaced her with former Passions&rsquo; writers Marlene Clark Poulter and Darrell Ray Thomas, Jr.. Will things get even crazier in Salem now? Matt Ashford is returning to DAYS.</p>
<p>Mad Marty (Susan Haskell) continues her reign of terror in Llanview. Jamey weighs in on Roger Howarth&rsquo;s return. Jamey is the only one of the DC crew who is enjoying Wes (Bree Williamson). Tucker (Stephen Nichols) fights for his life on The Young and the Restless. Adam (Michael Muhney) and Diane (Maura West) team up against Victor (Eric Braeden), but he still has a few tricks up his sleeve. All this and much more on today&rsquo;s show.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>He's BAAACK! That's right The Young and the Restless lovers, Michael Muhney aka the dastardly Adam Newman, returns to the Daytime Confidential podcast. Tune in to hear the passionate actor talk with Luke Kerr, Jamey Giddens and Jillian Bowe about the goings on in Genoa City and the rest of the soap game.</p>
<p>Now that his damsel in perennial distress Sharon (Sharon Case) is playing opposum, while hugging baby lambs on some farm off in God's country, who would Muhney like to see Adam paired with? His answer may surprise you, but not if you're capable of following the impressive actor's stream of consciousness poetic waxings.</p>
<p>What does Muhney think of the current state the daytime television industry finds itself in? Hear why he says soaps have to step up their game to stick around. Then Muhney goes IN about his views on the Daytime Emmy nomination process, taking NATAS to task for what he feels is a system that doesn't see the best and brightest of daytime receive the recognition it deserves. Fasten your seatbelts kiddies, we haven't had a podcast this hot-like-fiya in a long time!</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #618: TV Guide's Michael Logan Talks AMC and OLTL Cancellation</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-618-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke Kerr, Jamey Giddens, Regan Cellura, Jillian Bowe and Melodie Aikels are joined by TV Guide&rsquo;s Michael Logan to talk about the tragic news ABC has cancelled All My Children and One Life to Live.</p>
<p>In February, Jamey reported ABC would be making a major decision about its line up in April. On April 1 Logan took the story one step further, reporting ABC would likely cancel both AMC and OLTL. It was one report Logan wishes he was wrong about.</p>
<p>During the episode, Logan discusses with the DC gang how the industry came to this point in time, how several soaps' PR teams are not doing their jobs, whether-or-not we can ever believe an ABC press release again, what this means for the four remaining soaps and much more.</p>
<p>After the episode ends, hear more calls to the Daytime Confidential hotline by fans of AMC and OLTL as they share their reaction to the news.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #616: ABC Cancels All My Children and One Life to Live </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-616-abc-cancels-all-my-children-and-one-life-to-live-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke Kerr, Jamey Giddens, Jillian Bowe, Regan Cellura, Melodie Aikles and J Bernard Jones discuss ABC&rsquo;s decision to cancel two of its three soaps, All My Children and One Life to Live.</p>
<p>During the episode the DC gang shares their reactions to the sad news that the two long-running serials have been canceled. What path led to each show&rsquo;s cancellation? Who is responsible or shares in the blame? They recap the progression of reports since Jamey first reported, back in February, ABC would be making a major decision in April. Did All My Children throw its actors under the bus? Susan Lucci has been a class act through it all, while Robin Strasser&rsquo;s poignant hotline message to fans pulled at the heart strings. Might Oprah be interested in saving AMC and OLTL by bringing them to the OWN network?</p>
<p>Then each in the group reveals how they&rsquo;d like to see each soap wrap up its run. However, there are differing opinions on how to tie everything up on each of the shows. Melodie&rsquo;s ending for AMC is all about Erica Kane while you&rsquo;re not going to want to miss Jamey&rsquo;s tongue-in-cheek suggestion for Viki and Dorian on OLTL.</p>
<p>After All My Children goes off the air in September it will be replaced by The Chew, a cooking talk show hosted by Mario Batali, Clinton Kelly, Carla Hall, Michael Symon and Daphne Oz. When One Life to Live ends its run in January of 2012 it will be replaced by The Revolution, a show about health and lifestyle transformations featuring Tim Gunn and Kimberly Locke.</p>
<p>Readers and listeners have been calling the Daytime Confidential Hotline with their reaction to the cancellation news. We&rsquo;ve included some of those messages on this podcast, while the remaining calls will be attached to future podcasts. This is truly the end of an era.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jamey, Jillian, Regan and Melodie discuss the latest in All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>The news Roger Howarth is returning to One Life to Live. How will Howarth&rsquo;s return to Llanview impact the canvas? The Bullying story has brought the best in Farah Fath, John-Paul Lavoisier and Austin Williams. How should Jack Manning pay for what he&rsquo;s done? Vicki discovered Echo and Charlie in bed and wants Echo out of her life.</p>
<p>Days of Our Lives ratings are in trouble, but when will Corday do something about it? What did Jamey think of Bo and Hope&rsquo;s reunion? Fake Rafe tries to kill Fay. Vivian is manipulating Nicholas, much to Carly&rsquo;s frustration.</p>
<p>General Hospital puts Sean Blakemore on contract. Jillian and Luke love the idea of his character Shawn being a more &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; bodyguard for Carly. Jamey suggests GH recast Lucas with Van Hansis and pair Lucas with Matt. Luke Spencer continues to deny he has a drinking problem.</p>
<p>The Bold and the Beautiful&rsquo;s Ridge isn&rsquo;t happy with the Taboo Women&rsquo;s Line. Jamey is enjoying the Amber, Liam, Hope and Oliver storyline. Steffy and Bill&rsquo;s dynamic has Luke tuning in. Is B&amp;B too slow, too fast or does it have the right pacing?</p>
<p>What is the latest on the All My Children and One Life to Live cancellation rumors? The situation seems to change by the minute. Cara doesn&rsquo;t think that Jesse and Angie&rsquo;s baby is theirs. Griffin is framed for Diana&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Adam returns to Genoa City to try and keep Sharon from being sent to jail. Is it in bad taste for Malcolm and Sofia to get married where Cane was shot? Gloria and Chloe team up to try and get the goods on Jana.</p>
<p>NOTE: This podcast was recorded on Sunday before Jamey&rsquo;s sources gave him the latest information about that status of All My Children and One Life to Live.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #613: Double Standards</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-613-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jillian, Regan and Melodie discuss the latest in All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, General Hospital and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>It was a busy week of All My Children news. At the beginning of the week Deadline reported that All My Children could be in danger of cancellation, but by the end of the week actors were telling fans the rumors are not true. When a primetime series is in danger of being cancelled all the major entertainment bibles report the news, often inspiring fans to get motivated to try and help save their show. Why is there a double standard for discussing reports that a soap may be cancelled? We all know the genre is struggling, but can&rsquo;t such reports help motivate soap fans to try and save their soap?</p>
<p>Taylor tries to cause problems for Brooke and Ridge on The Bold and the Beautiful. Does Taylor need a home in Napa Valley, because she&rsquo;s been doing a lot of whining lately? Katie isn&rsquo;t happy with Bill. Steffy had better watch out.</p>
<p>Will Days of Our Lives do a gay storyline? If they do, should DAYS pursue a Chad and Will pairing or should they explore another couple? Luke can&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s beginning to enjoy EJ and Taylor like Jamey and Jillian do. What does everyone think of Dario?</p>
<p>The person responsible for baby Jake&rsquo;s death has been revealed. Would there have been more long term storyline potential if it had been Carly instead of Luke who was responsible? Jillian and Melodie debate whether Robin or Lisa would take each other out in a fight. Find out whose Luke and Regan come down on. Tyler Christopher is leaving General Hospital as Nikolas Cassadine. Elizabeth Taylor, the original Helena Cassadine, passes away.</p>
<p>One Life to Live is telling a ripped from the headlines bullying story. The show aired a suicide prevention PSA, which has Regan and Melodie worried about Shane&rsquo;s fate. Luke loves David and Dorian together again, but wants it to last. Nora gets most of her memory back as Rex closes in on the identity of daddy Ford&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>The Young and the Restless&rsquo; Victor Newman takes Newman Enterprises public. How will this impact the lives of Genoa City&rsquo;s leading citizens? Emily O&rsquo;Brien is out as Jana. Jillian is enjoying the heat between Adam and Phyllis, but Luke refuses to give up his love Adam and Sharon.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #611: Dishing the Soaps With TV Guide's Michael Logan</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-611-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast TV Guide's Michael Logan joins Jamey Giddens, Luke Kerr, Jillian Bowe, Regan Cellura and Melodie Aikels to discuss all the latest soap opera hot topics and news, including:</p>
<p>Soap Opera Digest reported that Bob Guza could be on his way out, before the story was later discounted by ABC. If Guza had left General Hospital, would it have been a good thing or bad thing for the show? Logan weighs in on GH&rsquo;s decision to kill off baby Jake and teases the fallout from the storyline.</p>
<p>Jamey asks Logan to provide insight into One Life to Live&rsquo;s continued red herrings about Roger Howarth&rsquo;s version of Todd Manning. Could Howarth still return to Llanview? ABC continues to develop talk shows, but will one of them replace an ABC soap? (Editor's Note: This podcast was recorded prior to Deadline.com's story about the possible cancellation of All My Children on March 21, 2011) Find out if Logan thinks All My Children should keep their current head writers.</p>
<p>Jamey is dreaming of DAYS with Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn back in Salem where they belong, thanks to a Soap Opera Digest article. Get Logan&rsquo;s take on whether or not they might return. Meanwhile, Jamey is warming up to Daniel and Jennifer (Shawn Christian and Melissa Reeves), but what where does that leave his love for Jack (Matt Ashford)? Logan ponders what the brass at  All My Children thought when they learned Tamara Braun was interested in returning to soaps and had signed on to DAYS.  Jillian is digging Natalia Livingston as Taylor.</p>
<p>The last time Logan dropped by the Daytime Confidential podcast no one was very happy with The Young and the Restless. Does the veteran soap journo think things have improved in Genoa City?</p>
<p>It appears Stephanie and Brooke&rsquo;s (Susan Flannery and Katherine Kelly Lang) truce is over on The Bold and the Beautiful, thanks to Thomas (Adam Gregory) tonguing his stepmommy down in Paris. Jamey wants to see Thomas and Brooke get it on more now than ever. Logan discusses his recent interview with Brad Bell and whether or not Thomas could still end up being gay.</p>
<p>The Daytime and Pop Confidential gang love Showtime&rsquo;s Shameless and it turns out the Logan does too! Also learn what he thinks about this season of Celebrity Apprentice, featuring former daytime divas Star Jones and Lisa Rinna, and so much more!</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #604: Good vs. Bad Soap</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-604-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jamey, Jillian, Regan and Melodie dish the latest All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>Oprah&rsquo;s must watch Legendary Soap Opera Spectacular. What did the DC gang think of Oprah&rsquo;s guests Anthony Geary, Genie Francis, Susan Lucci, Michael E. Knight, Debbi Morgan, Darnell Williams and Jeanne Cooper? Based on Genie Francis comments, did any of the DC gang ever expect to see her back on General Hospital? One of the loudest cheers from the Oprah audience came when Oprah mentioned Michael Nader as Dimitri Marick among Erica&rsquo;s ex-husbands.   Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if Dimitri returned to Pine Valley?</p>
<p>Last week Luke and Regan weren&rsquo;t happy with All My Children, but Jamey has been enjoying it. Hear what he thinks about the current state of Pine Valley.</p>
<p>The Bold and the Beautiful celebrates its 6000th episode with a special episode about lung cancer. While the story is poignant and relevant should B&amp;B be careful of becoming to preachy? Jillian weighs in on Thomas and Dayzee.</p>
<p>Jamey has been holding in a Days of our Lives rant for a while, but enough is enough. Jamey goes off on the abysmal state of NBC&rsquo;s last soap. From Jennifer&rsquo;s organ harvesting storyline to fake Rafe, nothing escapes his ire. Why isn&rsquo;t DAYS trying to get things in shape now, instead of worrying about it later when an axe is swinging over its head?</p>
<p>Who is sabotaging Brenda and Sonny&rsquo;s wedding on General Hospital? Regan comments on the fallout from the revelation of Michael&rsquo;s prison rape. Lucky gets shot in the head, which inspires Mel to start calling him UnLucky.</p>
<p>The Buchanan sister&rsquo;s wedding was ruined by the revelations of Clint&rsquo;s manipulations, but not all the DC gang enjoyed it. For the first time in years Michael Easton actually acted and made us feel sorry for John McBain. Luke is upset that Jack will be revealed as Shane&rsquo;s cyber bully. How will Farah Fath hold up opposite of Kassie DePaiva and Trevor St. John when the boy&rsquo;s parents face off?</p>
<p>Paul Rauch is out at The Young and the Restless. What does this mean for Y&amp;R, if anything? Wilson Bethel may return to Genoa City as Ryder. Mel comments on the fallout from Cane&rsquo;s death. Jamey loved Chloe telling Jana to get out of her house. Luke loved the Chloe and Nikki scenes at Glow Worm.  Ronan disappeared after the transplant. The DC gang shares their first impressions of Nate.</p>
<p>All this and much more on today&rsquo;s show.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #603:Transplants and Doppelgangers</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-603-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jillian, Regan and Melodie discuss the latest in All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>Why is All My Children destroying Annie in the process of writing the character out? Why couldn&rsquo;t they come up with a good exit for her? Kendall Hart&rsquo;s continued heart problems put new meaning in her last name.  AMC&rsquo;s Cameron Mathison and Rebecca will guest on ABC&rsquo;s Castle, but will the show cast current One Life to Live stars in guest roles?</p>
<p>The Young and the Restless&rsquo; Olivia popped up on The Bold and the Beautiful for Justin and Donna&rsquo;s wedding. Jillian and Luke enjoyed the wink wink scenes between Bill Spencer and Olivia. Donna isn&rsquo;t the only B&amp;B bride. Pam will be walking down the aisle soon to marry Donna&rsquo;s father. The engagement doesn&rsquo;t make Stephanie happy, but she&rsquo;s willing to bury the hatchet in support of her sister.</p>
<p>What is going on at Days of our Lives? The show cut into Jennifer to remove her heart and then put it back? Rafe is being held captive and fake Rafe has slipped into his life. There have been so many doppelgangers on soaps recently Luke&rsquo;s beginning to think he needs one. Regan and Jillian share their first impressions of former General Hospital star Natalia Livingston as DAYS&rsquo; Taylor.</p>
<p>Michael admitted he was raped while in Prison. The DC gang reacts to the powerful scenes between Michael, Jason and Carly. Regan dishes the latest on Brenda&rsquo;s baby. Is it Dante&rsquo;s or someone else&rsquo;s? Melodie isn&rsquo;t impressed with The Balkan.</p>
<p>The Buchanan twin&rsquo;s wedding kicked off, but it sure seemed a lot about Clint. Not that we minded. What will happen when John, Jessica and Brody find out the secrets Natalie have been keeping? Melodie loves Mad Marty, but is the character being written into a corner.  What are the DC gang's first impressions of Ted King as Tomas?  Is it smart for One Life to Live to be using Roger Howarth&rsquo;s picture so much or will it cause fans to get upset?</p>
<p>Sean Young is returning to The Young and the Restless as Meggie. Cane is shot on the steps of a church. Melodie, our film school grad, breaks down which movies Y&amp;R ripped off for their dramatic scenes.  Did Lily end up pushing her babies down the stairs? What did Jill do to deserve that ugly wedding dress?</p>
<p>All this and much more on today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast!</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-601-bye-bye-miss-american-becky]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential emergency podcast Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan dive into the shocking news that CBS has fired Barbara Bloom, General Hospital fired Rebecca Herbst and Shelley Hennig and Jay Kenneth Johnson are leaving Days of our Lives.</p>
<p>The DC gang delves into CBS&rsquo; decision to get rid of daytime executive Barbara Bloom. Jamey dishes what he&rsquo;s hearing about what led to the axe falling and recounts how a CBS representative called him furious for breaking the story. What will her departure mean for The Talk, The Young and Restless and The Bold and The Beautiful?</p>
<p>The other shocking news that Jamey broke on January 18 is that General Hospital had fired 13-year vet Rebecca Herbst. In statement, ABC later announced that the decision was &ldquo;storyline dictated.&rdquo; Jamey and Regan react, wondering what kind of storyline would dictate the departure of such a popular character. Why was Elizabeth wasted on Nikolas? Why couldn&rsquo;t Elizabeth be the one to reveal Siobhan&rsquo;s connection to the Balkan? What will happen to Elizabeth&rsquo;s children?</p>
<p>What is happening to Days of our Lives&rsquo; young adult cast? Last week it was announced Mark Hapka is leaving Salem and this week it was revealed Shelley Hennig and Jay Kenneth Johnson are also pulling up stakes. The departure of the four actors effectively wipes out Philip/Melanie/Nathan/Stephanie storyline. Should DAYS recast the characters or will the introduction of other characters fill the void?</p>
<p>With all of this week&rsquo;s crazy developments it&rsquo;s no wonder the DC gang is worked up!</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #599: Blueberry Yogurt</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-599-blueberry-yogurt]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan discuss the latest in All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>Jamey&rsquo;s report that ABC&rsquo;s Brian Frons has been allegedly courting former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish and is trying to convince her to return to the show.  The gang discusses the pro and cons of such a possibility. Maybe the problem isn&rsquo;t the writers, but executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers? Shannon Cane opts out of renewing with AMC. Luke is excited that former AMC star Alexa Havins has joined Torchwood.</p>
<p>The Bold and the Beautiful snaps up The Young and the Restless&rsquo; Tonya Lee Williams. Her character Olivia will be joining the wonderful world of Forresters, Logan and Spencers. Reportedly, Olivia will be related to Justin Barber. Amber has another pregnancy scheme up her sleeve, but can she pull it off? What is going on with Thomas and Brooke? Will Brooke appreciate Thomas&rsquo; advances?</p>
<p>Days of our Lives star Mark Hapka is leaving Salem and speaks out on Twitter about what led to his departure.  Jamey isn&rsquo;t happy that yet another Horton is riding off into the sunset. Bo and Hope go on the run. EJ and Nicole get engaged.</p>
<p>General Hospital is known for its well choreographed stunts, but has the bus crash lived up to previous &ldquo;events&rdquo;? The gang dives into how it all played out. Luke doesn&rsquo;t understand how all the passengers were able to all fly out of the bus so easily and why there was no apparent debris.  Will Jason and Sam&rsquo;s baby be a miracle pregnancy or will it be because of experimental medicine?</p>
<p>One Life to Live&rsquo;s feud between Natalie and Mad Marty is heating up and the DC gang loves it. Are these two the show&rsquo;s next great rivalry? Charlie turned tail and ran through Llanview hospital after Clint confronted him. What is it about that hospital that causes grown men to act the fool?  Tuc Watkins is back and has us cracking up.  Will he be able to escape his captors?</p>
<p>The National Urban League has joined Victoria Rowell&rsquo;s fight for diversity at Sony and The Young and the Restless. Jamey and Jillian weigh in on the hot topic.  Billy&rsquo;s search for a baby could have him adopting Daniel and Daisy&rsquo;s baby. After much pleading Jack and Nick investigate Sharon&rsquo;s claims of Adam&rsquo;s innocence and that Skye was in fact alive.</p>]]></description>

This also wouldn&rsquo;t be the DC year end podcast without our Most in Need of a Makeover, Most in Need of a Roll in the Hay, Most Tortured Couple, Glittery Hoo-Hoo, Biggest Ho Ho Ho, Magical Penis of the Year and Guy Whose Chestnuts We Want Roasted Over an Open Fire categories.</p>
<p>The DC crew then gets down to the biggest of the Best and Worst categories, taking on Best and Worst Storyline, Soap opera Scenery Chewer of the Year, The Charity Rahmer Award For Babies Who Don&rsquo;t Know Who They Are, The Megan McTavish Award for Special Achievement in Serial Drama Dismantling and Best and Worst Daytime Drama.</p>
<p>All these categories and more in this, Daytime Confidential&rsquo;s Best and Worst of 2010 podcast.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #595: Eileen Fulton Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-595-eileen-fulton-interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's Daytime Confidential podcast, she was television's first Super Bitch, Lisa Miller on As The World Turns for the better part of five decades, now the legendary Eileen Fulton is back to doing what she loves best, performing her sassy, fun cabaret act throughout New York City.</p>
<p>Luke and Jamey caught up with Fulton just in time to dish about her upcoming Christmas show I Remember...or At Least I Try this Friday night, Dec. 17 beginning at 7 pm. at Don't Tell Mama (343 West 46th Street) in New York City. Fulton offers a preview of the tunes and stories she plans to enchant her legions of fans with and also regales the DC boys with several of infamous soap stories, like:</p>
<p>The time she got hit in the face by a fan who hated Lisa.</p>
<p>What really fueled her clashes with ATWT creator Irna Phillips?</p>
<p>What it was like to take the character of Lisa from daytime to primetime to compete with ABC's Peyton Place on Our Private World?</p>
<p>Which ATWT scribe truly got what made Lisa tick?</p>
<p>And so much more. Fulton also sounds off on daytime execs maddening penchant for putting veteran performers out to pasture in favor of newbies. As if that wasn't enough, Fulton provides fans the opportunity to win tickets to her show via a Facebook contest. This podcast is the ultimate treat for As The World Turns fans still mourning the loss of their iconic soap!</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-590-slob-kabobs-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jillian, Regan and Belinda discuss the latest in All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>NBC renews Days of our Lives for two more years. With this renewal will the show figure out ways to make its storylines more appealing and not drag out as long? Vivian is free of the sarcophagus, but now she&rsquo;s holding Maggie captive in it. Sami and Nicole face off when Nicole tries to get access to Sydney. Chloe gives birth.</p>
<p>One Life to Live scores the headline grabbing Kourtney Kardashian for a guest spot. Reportedly, she will play a lawyer and mix it up with Cristian and Blair. Is this a good thing for OLTL? OLTL also cast former General Hospital star Ted King in a role that will be a love interest for Blair and we couldn&rsquo;t be more excited. More details have come out on how long Clint has known Rex is his son.</p>
<p>All My Children releases a webisoap to introduce Jordi Vilasuso, Kendall&rsquo;s new love interest. Did the DC gang enjoy it? Even though Luke was never a fan of Zach he did enjoy the Zendall flashbacks AMC aired.</p>
<p>Andrea Evans returns to The Bold and the Beautiful as Amber&rsquo;s mother Tawny. How will her return impact her daughter? Jack Wagner and Sherri Shepherd guest on Hot in Cleveland.</p>
<p>Carly has uncovered Brenda&rsquo;s secret, but what will she do with the information? Ethan and Maya get married in Vegas, but would have it been more hilarious if Tracey and Ethan had been the couple who ended up married? How will Edward&rsquo;s manipulations impact Ethan and Maya&rsquo;s marriage?</p>
<p>Jillian weighs in on the Victor and Meggie saga. Did anyone believe Meggie would pull one over on Victor? Should The Young and the Restless make Deacon more of a viable threat than they are writing him now? Daisy returned to Genoa City, supposedly pregnant with Daniel&rsquo;s baby. What does Jillian think of this latest development? Who should Diane Jenkins be with? Luke likes her with both Victor and Jack, but Jillian wants them to stay far away from her.</p>]]></description>

<p>All My Children&rsquo;s decision to kill off Thorsten Kaye&rsquo;s popular character Zach Slater. What will Kendall do without the love of her life? Should AMC bring in someone new for her, find someone already on canvas for her or let her become a strong independent woman?</p>

			<title>DC #588: Mixing it up on The Morning Jolt With Larry Flick</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-588-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Daytime Confidential/Pop Confidential&rsquo;s Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan returned to Sirius XM's The Morning Jolt With Larry Flick Friday, November 5 for two hours of daytime and pop culture dissection with Flick and his partner-in-snark Keith Price.</p>
<p>In the wild first hour, Larry let loose with several comments about General Hospital&rsquo;s Elizabeth Webber that had Jamey, Luke and Regan howling in defense of their sacred heroine, as DC's lone JaSam fan Jillian cheered. The return of Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo as Brenda Barrett was also discussed. Does the veteran Billboard writer and radio personality feel the story is limping along like the DC'ers?</p>
<p>The discussion shifted to One Life to Live, the show Larry previously said should be canceled the last time the gang appeared. Has the return of soap superstar Kim Zimmer as Countess Echo di Savoy helped change that opinion? What about All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Y&amp;R and DAYS? Don't worry, they all get plenty of raunchy, hilarious service!</p>
<p>During the second hour, Larry dives into Pop Confidential territory, taking Luke to task over his dislike of country's current teen queen Taylor Swift. Then, pop culture meets politics as Larry and Keith weigh in on the recent Pop Confidential podcast debate over former President George W. Bush saying Kanye West&rsquo; claiming Bush hated black people was the low point of his presidency. If you thought this crew was crazy by themselves, just wait 'til you hear Out Q's most outrageous duo added to the mix!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan discuss the latest in All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>All My Children casts former As the World Turns star Sara Glendening as Marissa. Luke isn&rsquo;t impressed by the news and Regan wonders why we even need Marissa? Former General Hospital and Port Charles star Eddie Matos joins AMC.</p>
<p>The Bold and the Beautiful&rsquo;s Ashley Jones is bumped to recurring. B&amp;B newcomer Kristolyn Lloyd earns contract status. The Bold and the Beautiful airs special episodes focusing on the homeless.  Former Guiding Light star Elvera Roussel drops in on B&amp;B.</p>
<p>Days of our Lives&rsquo; Louise Sorel previews Vivian&rsquo;s next move. Days of our Lives casts former General Hospital star Natalia Livingston as Nicole&rsquo;s younger sister.  What will Sami do when she finds out Ma Brady switched the paternity tests? The show&rsquo;s ratings go up.</p>
<p>General Hospital&rsquo;s Lulu uncovers Dante and Brenda&rsquo;s connection. Will the secret they share wreck Dante&rsquo;s credibility? Luke wants there to be a Dante and Brenda love child hidden away somewhere, but no one else on the podcast likes the idea.  Did anyone actually watch ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;classic&rdquo; episodes on October 28?</p>
<p>ABC is touting One Life to Live clobbering The Talk in the ratings. Hillary B. Smith reups her contract to keep her in Llanview. Susan Haskell is bringing it at Marty. Todd and Tea are reunited.  Who should Blair be with now that Todd and Tea are back together? The Hannah storyline collapsed in the scenes where she holds James and Starr at gunpoint.  Luke asks the DC gang what they think of Kim Zimmer&rsquo;s Echo now that she&rsquo;s been in town for a while.</p>
<p>Meggie&rsquo;s plot to get Nikki out of the way so she can get her hands on Victor is well on its way. Daisy returns to Genoa City, supposedly pregnant with Daniel&rsquo;s baby.  Abby and Victoria take on Victor, but can they steal Beauty of Nature?</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-586-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan dive into the latest in All My Children, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live, The Young and the Restless and Talk Show news and headlines, including:</p>
<p>The first week of The Talk, the CBS talk show that replaced As the World Turns on its schedule, is over. What did the DC gang think of it and will they keep watching?</p>
<p>All My Children has improved drastically since Chuck Pratt so why is it putting Regan to sleep and making Luke go numb when watching? No one wants Chuck Pratt back, but in its current state AMC inspires little passion for itself, good or bad. Are Ryan and Greenlee only a supercouple in Brian Frons&rsquo; head? Does Jamey still enjoy Stephanie Gatschet&rsquo;s Madison?</p>
<p>The Bold and the Beautiful continues to hit it out of the park with Stephanie&rsquo;s cancer storyline. Should Taylor be worried that Brooke might seduce her son? You might be surprised who thinks she has reason to be concerned. Amber steals designs from Forrester. Luke is enjoying the return of Amber&rsquo;s scheming ways on B&amp;B, but Jamey isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Days of our Lives&rsquo; Arianna found out Sami&rsquo;s secret, but what will happen when she dies? Is Sami the worst mother in soaps? Jamey used to think it was General Hospital&rsquo;s Carly, but now he believes Sami wears the unenviable crown.

			<title>DC #580: TV Guide's Michael Logan Returns to DC</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-580-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast TV Guide&rsquo;s Michael Logan returns to dish all the latest industry news and hottest storylines with Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan.</p>
<p>During the super-sized episode, the gang discusses the end of As the World Turns, if P&amp;G plans to create their own soap hub and where its stars will end up.</p>
<p>Logan weighs in on Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo&rsquo;s return to General Hospital as Brenda. Has it been a success or a bust? Find out which Brenda reunion Logan is looking forward to most. What will Sam McCall do when she comes face-to-face with Brenda? Logan also comments on Jonathan Jackson&rsquo;s latest storyline as Lucky impersonating the Irish assassin Ronan.</p>
<p>On paper, Vivian being buried alive on Days of our Lives looks like it should be entertaining. Find out what Logan thinks of DAYS&rsquo; new twist on one of its classic storylines. Many fans have been disappointed with how DAYS has written Crystal Chappell&rsquo;s Carly Manning since her return. Logan shares his thoughts on why fantastic actresses&ndash;like Chappell, Eden Riegel and Gina Tognoni&ndash;have been snatched up by various shows without much apparent thought on their character&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>All My Children has been making some major casting changes with the firing of Adam Mayfield, Brittany Allen and the casting of Daniel Cosgrove and Lindsay Hartley. Logan comments on the AMC casting shakeup and if the show&rsquo;s move to L.A. has been a success.</p>
<p>One Life to Live is bringing back Kim Zimmer as Echo. Will her return help provide Dorian and Viki with more storylines? Luke and Jillian are tired of the Ford brothers dominating air time so they get Logan&rsquo;s opinion of the Ford Brothers and the Llanview teen set.</p>
<p>Brad Bell is tackling a pretty intense topic by giving Stephanie stage four cancer on The Bold and the Beautiful. Can he pull it off? Logan weighs in on the front burner storyline, Scott Clifton as Liam and the new Thomas Forrester.</p>
<p>Last time Logan visited the Daytime Confidential podcast, he wasn&rsquo;t too happy about the state of The Young and the Restless, so the DC crew asks if he thinks things have improved at the No. 1 soap. Jillian and Logan bask in their common love for Nikki Newman.</p>
<p>As the podcast winds down, the DC gang wraps things up by asking about the soap genre&rsquo;s future and they get Logan&rsquo;s opinion on the web series The Bay and Venice.</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc-579]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast the DC gang drops in on The Morning Jolt with Larry Flick to discuss the latest in daytime and pop culture news, including:</p>
<p>The end of As the World Turns.  Do soap&rsquo;s executives and writers hurt their show&rsquo;s ratings by punishing characters for actor's behavior.  The Denver Post is reporting that OLTL will be picked up for two more years.  Does Brian Frons manufacture it so that General Hospital and All My Children always win? Larry questions why soap fans should tune into One Life to Live.  Is the Days of our Lives brand strong enough to jump to cable?</p>
<p>We then dive into the new and returning primetime shows of the season and the latest gossip.  Can Lone Star make it? Larry then asks Jamey why fans should care about a new Dallas series. Will No Ordinary Family be as good as Luke hopes? Is The Middle better than Modern Family? The gang weighs in on the return of Glee for its second season, but will it suffer from a sophomore slump? Larry then puts Jamey on the spot and has him belt out several popular songs. Are we beginning to get Betty White fatigue? Was the Katy Perry and Elmo segment on Sesame Street inappropriate for children?  Can Lindsay Lohan make a comeback or is she destined to be a &ldquo;has been?&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

<p>Vincent Irizarry&rsquo;s contract status at All My Children and the Who Killed David Hayward murder mystery that had David laid out on a morgue slab. Can&rsquo;t get enough of JR and Annie?

All this talk of Brenda has given Sam and Carly a lot to worry and each is handling it differently. What will these two do when Brenda arrives back in Port Charles? Robin punches the psycho Lisa and lets Patrick know it isn&rsquo;t about him, it&rsquo;s about their daughter. Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been nice if Anna or Robert had been the one to get Lucky to go under cover?</p>
<p>One Life to Live put out a casting call for Joey Buchanan. Luke suggests ATWT&rsquo;s Eric Sheffer Stevens while Jamey thinks ATWT&rsquo;s Michael Park is perfect for the role, especially if OLTL had been able to cast Jon Hensley as Kevin Buchanan. Will casting Joey fix Gina Tognoni&rsquo;s storyline as Kelly Cramer? Jamey reveals what he&rsquo;s been hearing about the Roger Howarth rumors.</p>
<p>Ronan shot Chance on The Young and the Restless, but is Chance really dead? Can soaps do crime mystery storylines well or she they focus on other things? Jamey&rsquo;s beloved Villy got married, but Jillian and Luke weren&rsquo;t feeling it. Luke suggests a Phyllis/Deacon/Nikki triangle would be smokin&rsquo; hot. Is Y&amp;R really implying with Nikki&rsquo;s storyline that the only way a woman can take on Victor is if she is drunk?</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #575: Amelia Earhart</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_575_amelia_earhart]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Belinda discuss the latest in All My Children, As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and headlines, including:</p>
<p>Luke and Belinda think All My Children&rsquo;s Annie choice of Scott over JR was a huge mistake. Who would have believed the day would come we&rsquo;d wish Zach eating Pine Valley alive like he used too? Trent Garrett makes his debut as Asher.</p>
<p>As the World Turns fan favorite John Dixon returns to Oakdale just in time to help Chris Hughes.  It looks as if Luke isn&rsquo;t going to have to make a choice between Reid and Noah after Reid gets hit by a train. Henry and Barbara finally say &ldquo;I Do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bold and the Beautiful pulled a fast one and now Bill Spencer is going to be Liam&rsquo;s father. Thomas defends Brooke to the Forrester family. Should Brooke and Thomas get it on after 90210 alum Adam Gregory makes his debut?</p>
<p>After month and months of waiting Days of our Lives&rsquo; Sami finally finds out the truth about what EJ did. The mystery surrounding Chloe&rsquo;s baby isn&rsquo;t who the daddy is, but who changed the paternity tests. Vivian tries to pull off another buried alive plot, but should DAYS be finding something better for her to do?</p>
<p>The DC gang goes in-depth on Brenda&rsquo;s return to General Hospital. Has it been well executed or is GH in danger of ruining the return of one of its biggest stars? Robin finds out that Patrick cheated on her and gives Kimberly McCullough an opportunity to deliver a fantastic performance. Do shootouts really make Jason and Sam horny?</p>
<p>Clint destroys David and Dorian&rsquo;s wedding on One Life to Live. Should David and Dorian fans have been left hanging or should they have given a hint of hope by having Dorian find a clue that sends her on the hunt to find Dorian? OLTL needs to play up its Blair/Todd/Tea triangle and figure out a way to give Viki and Dorian more scenes together. Everybody and their detective close in on Elijah. Should OLTL sign Lindsay Hartley on as Kimberly?</p>
<p>Jamey and Jillian weigh in on The Young and the Restless&rsquo; Kristoff St. John and Darius McCrary&rsquo;s visit to the Foxxhole with Jamie Foxx on Sirius radio and the explosive turn it took after former Y&amp;R star Victoria Rowell called in.  The sisterly feud between Jill and Lauren is heating up.  Victor pulls a fast one on Adam.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #573: Spam vs. Steak: Luke, Jamey and Jillian Return to The Morning Jolt With Larry Flick</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_573_spam_vs_steak_luke_jamey_and_jilian_return_to_the_morning_jolt_with_larry_flick]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Daytime Confidential/Pop Confidential peeps made their way back to The Morning Jolt With Larry Flick on Friday, Aug. 27, and man, woman, child was it a crazy time!</p>
<p>In between listening to the golden oldies Larry Flick and his partner-in-snark Keith Price spin on Flashback Fridays, Luke, Jamey and Jillian fielded questions about all the biggest stories happening in soaps and the rest of pop culture.</p>
<p>Which soap does Larry feel should have gotten the axe before As The World Turns? The answer makes the DC/PC peeps come out swinging! Has The Bold and the Beautiful really improved&mdash;as Jamey, Jillian and Luke maintain&mdash; or are they just so used to eating spam, they don't recognize steak anymore? What about the heavily-hyped return of "The Goddess" aka Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo to General Hospital. Is the slow build working, or are soap fans' attention spans simply too fried, dyed and laid to the side for dragging out a reveal these days?</p>
<p>In the second hour (That's right peeps, The Little Podcasters Who Could, got TWO HOURS on Sirius Radio!) Larry and Keith pick the DC/PC'ers brains about Lindsay Lohan's latest comeback possibilities, this weekend's Primetime Emmy Awards and Larry reveals he loves it when Jamey bursts out into song on podcasts. Doesn't everyone? After you listen, be sure to sign up for a free trial subscription to Sirius so you can sample this insanely funny morning show for a month! You can also follow Larry and Keith on Twitter. Take it from us, you won't be sorry!</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #572: Podcast on a Hot Tin Roof: Christian LeBlanc Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_572_christian_le_blanc_interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In what may be the wildest Daytime Confidential podcast episode since, well Michael Muhney (sidenote: What IS in the water in Genoa City?), Luke and Jamey welcome Christian LeBlanc aka bad boy-turned barrister Michael Baldwin from The Young and the Restless, who this Saturday night, August 28, 2010, will be hosting the hottest sketch comedy show in Los Angeles&mdash;ACME Saturday Night at the ACME Comedy Theatre (located at 135 N. La Brea Avenue in Hollywood).</p>
<p>Honey chile, the spirits of Tennessee Williams, Faulkner and Margaret Mitchell were all circling the roof of the "DC Studios", as Luke tried to keep up with two bad ol' boys from the South! When Jamey and Christian weren't cuttin' up, talking in affected, over-the-top Southern accents about sketch comedy, the theatre, the fine art of Southern fried put downs and sugar tits, Christian managed to reveal which of his 3,745 Daytime Emmys means the most to him. He also waxed poetic about the art of transforming a dastardly soap villain into a beloved hero. But does he miss "Evil Michael"? His answer may surprise you.</p>
<p>LeBlanc also talks about what it's like working with several of his lovely leading ladies, Tracey Bregman (Lauren), Michelle "The Staff" Stafford (Phyllis) and Lauralee Bell, who recently reprised the role of Michael's one-time stalking victim Christine "Cricket" Blair Grainger Romalotti Williams. He also discussed his thoughts on the Sarah Smythe storyline and Michael and Lauren's current scenes opposite the newly-christened Jill Fenmore (Jess Walton).</p>
<p>Is he excited about former As The World Turns' leading lady Maura West coming to Genoa City as Michael's former co-conspirator Diane Jenkins? You'll have to download the podcast to find out. Speaking of World Turns, what are LeBlanc's thoughts on the soap where he got his start, coming to an end this September?</p>
<p>The New Orleans native&mdash; who still owns property there&mdash; also speaks to the amazing resilience of his people, who are continuing to rebuild the Crescent City after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina five years ago. This Podcast on a Hot Tin Roof will go down as one of the most insanely-soaptasic hours Luke and Jamey have ever attempted to host.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #571: The Bay's Mary Beth Evans and Gregori J Martin</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/the_bay_s_mary_beth_evans_and_gregori_j_martin]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Soap superstar Mary Beth Evans may just be the hardest working woman in daytime. On the heels of recently reprising the role of Sierra on As The World Turns, one last time, Evans is set to return to her breakout role as Days of Our Lives' beloved Kayla this fall, but that isn't the only thing she'll be doing as the leaves begin to fall. Evans is also starring in and producing one of the most highly anticipated web soaps ever&mdash;The Bay.</p>
<p>On today's episode of Daytime Confidential, Luke and Jamey talk with Evans and Gregori J. Martin, the prolific creator of The Bay. The enterprising duo provide a sneak peak of The Bay's dysfunction-yet-delicious core family, the Garretts, headed by socialite Sara Garrett (Evans).  Evans reveals how Martin's intricately-woven back story for the characters he created hooked her on The Bay's mythology, and caused her to decide to sign on with the project.</p>
<p>Lifelong soap fan Martin, who got his career start working in production for Another World, reveals which soap supercouples inspired and informed him in creating The Bay. Hint: One Life to Live fans just might want to tune in when The Bay premieres in five weeks!</p>
<p>Evans also discusses in depth her storied career in daytime. From syndicated soap Rituals, to DAYS, World Turns and General Hospital, she's created memorable varied characters fans have adored. Can she do it again with Sara Garrett? After listening to this episode, we bet you'll come away hoping The Bay is as big a hit as the DC crew predicts it will be!</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_569_the_great_mangina]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential episode Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Belinda discuss the latest in All My Children, As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>Alicia Minshew returns to All My Children this week as Kendall, but why do they insist on using Kendall to pimp a couple AMC fans loathe like Ryan and Greenlee? Amidst a terrible storyline Debbi Morgan has been delivering standout performances. Belinda weighs in on the new dynamic at Chandler mansion. Is it even worth it to keep Scott Chandler in the mix?</p>
<p>The Young and the Restless signs As the World Turns star Maura West to play the role of Diane Jenkins. Molly calls off her wedding to Holden. Lucinda&rsquo;s master-plan of revenge against Craig is falling into place.</p>
<p>The Bold and the Beautiful&rsquo;s Hope is beginning to spin out of control as she grapples with what her mother and boyfriend did. Taylor, Stephanie and Steffy rip into Brooke. What will Steffy do now that Taylor has given her share of Forrester?</p>
<p>Days of our Lives ratings continue to sag, but what can they do to get back on track? Is their front burner Nighttime Hope storyline to blame or do they need to pick up the pace? Luke believes there is a lack of intensity to DAYS storylines and that they don&rsquo;t give fans a reason to be invested. After lasting way to long, but the Nighttime Hope storyline is beginning to wind down.</p>
<p>General Hospital&rsquo;s Brenda returns to Port Charles this week. Will her return be everything the network hopes or could her return kick off with a bang and then fizzle? Belinda doesn&rsquo;t think Brenda is the end all be all. Claire started out as such a good character, but now she&rsquo;s fallen for Sonny&rsquo;s charms. Could Claire end up sidelined like Kate Howard or Hannah?</p>
<p>Todd and Tea&rsquo;s wedding was great on One Life to Live, but was the picture of Roger Howarth foreshadowing something? If it wasn&rsquo;t, should it be? Jamey believes that Howarth&rsquo;s return is one of the few things OLTL could do to get a sustained ratings boost. The Elijah mess just keeps getting worse and worse. Why can&rsquo;t Blaire catch a break when it comes to men? OLTL says goodbye to Evangeline.</p>
<p>The DC gang digs into Maura West news. Is the role of Diane Jenkins the right one for West or is The Young and the Restless playing fast and loose with Diane&rsquo;s age? Jill betrays Billy yet again. Who won&rsquo;t she betray to get what she wants? Should Lauren be in jail for pushing Jill into the grave? Phyllis and Nick&rsquo;s marriage is crumbling, but Michelle Stafford is delivering great performances. Did Phyllis revert back to her old self after getting a haircut?</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #568: Michael Muhney Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_568_michael_muhney_interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Fasten your seat belts Daytime Confidential listeners. You're about to download one of our wildest podcasts ever! The Young and Restless game changer, Michael Muhney  drops by to chat will Luke, Jamey and Jillian about what it was like to takeover one of the most controversial and complex roles in recent daytime history, VIctor Adam Newman, Jr.</p>
<p>The veteran of primetime's cult hit Veronica Mars reveals what made him go out for a part on a soap in the first place, when so many actors see daytime as a "stepping stone". Muhney shares how any initial reservations were quickly snuffed out after a few days of working with such enormous talents as Eric Braeden, Eileen Davidson, Peter Bergman and others.</p>
<p>He also spills the tea about what he believes makes Adam tick, citing Shakespearean themes and psychological underpinnings that has the DC crew wishing Muhney were not only starring in a soap, but helping to write his storyline!</p>
<p>Muhney also gets real about the contract issues that almost led to his saying goodbye to Y&amp;R and Adam for good. What led him to stick with the role? You'll have to tune in to hear him tell it in his own words, that is when he isn't matching the gang snark for snark and Jamey, impersonation for impersonation.</p>]]></description>

<p>Angie and Jesse&rsquo;s What If episode opposite of One Life to Live&rsquo;s Starr Manning. Doesn&rsquo;t Angie&rsquo;s pregnancy and illness storyline remind us of Reva Shane&rsquo;s on Guiding Light? Is Stephanie Gatschet starting to act again?</p>
<p>The Paley Center says goodbye to As the World Turns. Holden and Molly&rsquo;s celebrate their engagement, but should Holden and Lily be together in the end?</p>

<p>Melissa Reeves returns to Days of our Lives as Jamey&rsquo;s beloved Jennifer Rose. DAYS&rsquo; casts Robin Mattson opposite of Stacy Haiduk. Gabriela Rodriguez is a goner. Why should they recast the role when they could make Chad and Will a couple?</p>

<p>The world closes in on One Life to Live&rsquo;s Elijah. Jamey argues for Blaire over Tea as the love of Todd&rsquo;s life against Luke, Jillian and Mel. Todd testifies for Cole.</p>

			<title>DC #565: Ilene Kristen Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_565_ilene_kristen_interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's episode of Daytime Confidential, Luke and Jamey welcome back one of DC's favorite soap scene stealers, Ilene Kristen. The DC boys get to the bottom of why we haven't seen much of Kristen's hilariously-heartfelt character, Roxy Balsom of late on One Life to Live,</p>
<p>Were Roxy and Ilene casualties of ABC's decision to "Kish off" her screen partner Brett Claywell and later Roxy's newfound son Schuyler (Scott Clifton)? Roxy's other son, Rex (John-Paul Lavoisier) was recently searching for his biological father and her daughter Natalie (Melissa Archer) is currently dealing with a "Who's The Daddy?" pregnancy predicament, yet Roxy has strangely been missing from those stories. Kristen says she's as confused by that as we are. Luke and Jamey also get the skinny on Kristen being cast in the most anticipated web sudser since Venice, Gregori J. Martin's The Bay, and find out what else the amazingly-talented singer-actress has been up to.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #564: The Franco Fiasco</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_564_the_franco_fiasco]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s Daytime Confidential episode Luke, Jamey, Regan and Jillian dish about the latest All My Children, As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>Should Robin Christopher return to All My Children now that her time on General Hospital is wrapping up? JR, Annie and Adam are all battling for control of Chandler and Skye&rsquo;s return might just up the intensity. Ryan suffers from an aneurysm and we&rsquo;re led to believe once again that Greenlee is the love of Ryan&rsquo;s life. Luke&rsquo;s convinced that AMC is trying to make him hate Greenlee.</p>
<p>As the World Turns revealed their plans for the upcoming tribute to Helen Wagner.  Lucinda is pleased when Sierra returns to Oakdale.</p>
<p>Scott Clifton made his debut on The Bold and the Beautiful. Steffy gets what&rsquo;s coming to her after all her manipulations of Brooke and Oliver. Luke was surprised to discover how much he enjoyed Ridge accepting Brooke&rsquo;s mistake for what it was and wanting to move past it. Jamey cannot believe B&amp;B is wasting a major talent like Sarah Brown. She shouldn&rsquo;t be on the back burner. She should be front and center.</p>
<p>Days of our Lives gives Lindsay Hartley the pink slip just when things were getting good. EJ and Arianna had great chemistry and showed potential. Jamey would like to see her end up on One Life to Live as Kim and have that character mix things up with Clint again. Night time hope tries to burn down the house around Bo.  Will Ty Treadway coming to Salem entice Regan to tune in?</p>
<p>The Franco Fiasco is really screwing up General Hospital and is laughable. Bring on the Cassadine storyline that was sidelined for the first Franco stint and give us something that isn&rsquo;t a joke.  Unlike the Franco debacle the shootout at the hospital was gripping. The DC gang weighs in on the Drew Garrett rumors that surfaced online about him possibly going to The Young and the Restless.</p>
<p>One Life to Live casts Billy Warlock in the role of Ross Rayburn.  Are both Jessica and Natalie&rsquo;s babies Brody&rsquo;s? Much like the Franco Fiasco on General Hospital the Bennett Thompson mess on OLTL just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Why did they have to turn a character with so much potential into a mustache twirler? Isn&rsquo;t there a better way to give Robin Strasser and Erika Slezak a storyline?</p>
<p>Welcome to a very Brady The Young and the Restless as the No. 1 rated soap casts Susan Olsen in a drive-by role.  Jillian weighs in on the debut of Malcolm&rsquo;s fianc&eacute; Sofia and shares her first impression. Cricket knows Ronan&rsquo;s secret, but will they keep it from Nina or will they tell her the truth?</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #563: Pay Cuts and Waivers </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_563_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s news-packed Daytime Confidential episode Luke, Jamey, Regan and Jillian discuss the latest in soap opera headlines, including:</p>
<p>The story Daytime Confidential&rsquo;s own Jamey broke about ABC asking the WGA for a waiver. What does this mean for the three ABC soaps and their writing teams? ABC is betting the house on Vanessa Marcil, but will she give them the ratings they need? How will All My Children and One Life to Live fans take having their show&rsquo;s being pre-empted for a Brenda marathon? ABC moved All My Children to L.A. to reduce production costs, but has it worked? Find out what Jamey is hearing.</p>
<p>The Wrap published an interesting analysis of the daytime genre and in it revealed that media buyers prefer soaps to other daytime formats. Valerie Bertinelli&rsquo;s talk show&ndash;in the running to replace As the World Turns&ndash;has reportedly failed to wow network executives.</p>
<p>The Young and the Restless&rsquo; Kristoff St. John clears up his status with the show. One Life to Live&rsquo;s Tika Sumpter chooses to go on recurring and Mary Beth Evans returns to Days of our Lives.</p>
<p>The DC gang also hands out grades for the first three What If webisodes ABC published online. All this and much more on today&rsquo;s show so stay tuned!</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_562_stacy_haiduk_interview_a]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today&rsquo;s episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey and Jillian are joined by former Young and Restless breakout star-turned Days of our Lives newcomer Stacy Haiduk.</p>
<p>In the interview, Haiduk talks about being let go from Y&amp;R, being snubbed by the Daytime Emmys, trying to balance Patty&rsquo;s insanity and with her humanity, whether-or-not Tracey Bregman&rsquo;s doppelganger storyline undermined the Patty and Emily story, sharing scenes with Peter Bergman and Doug Davidson and what it was like to work with that leading man of leading men, Mr. Kitty.</p>
<p>We then discuss how Days of our Lives managed to snap Haiduk up, her Salem role as the Warden and Jamey tries to find out if her character might end up being Kristen Blake DiMera as he Wishfully Cast.</p>
<p>All this and more in this must-hear episode of Daytime Confidential.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Daytime Confidential&rsquo;s Luke, Regan and Jillian are back after the 4th of the July holiday with a expanded episode discussing the latest in storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>From Erica to the Chandlers, everyone wants a piece of All My Children&rsquo;s Caleb. Who should Caleb be with, Erica or Krystal? Regan wants Jack and Krystal to be paired together.</p>
<p>Will and Gwen return to Oakdale to see Barbara, but she&rsquo;s still missing after Henry and Vienna&rsquo;s wedding. Would Colleen Zenk Pinter be a good candidate to play General Hospital&rsquo;s Bobbie Spencer if GH doesn&rsquo;t want to use Jackie Zeman? Should Katie be ashamed for betraying Henry the way she is?</p>
<p>Steffy pushes Brooke out of Forrester Creations on The Bold and the Beautiful, but why isn&rsquo;t Stephanie more involved? The Jackie/Owen/Bridget triangle heats up as Nick pushes Bridget aside.</p>
<p>Days of our Lives&rsquo; Nicole has uncovered the truth about EJ&rsquo;s involvement in the kidnapping, just as EJ and Sami&rsquo;s relationship grows stronger. Philip finds out Chloe is pregnant.</p>
<p>Regan and Luke are enjoying Franco&rsquo;s return more than his last run.  Sonny almost blows up his daughter Kristina on General Hospital. Why is GH destroying Scrubs and Spixie? Are Matt and Maxie showing more promise?</p>
<p>One Life to Live&rsquo;s actors shined this week, delivering many great performances. Dani finds out Tea is dying. Todd rescues Dani and Starr, but will he treat Dani&rsquo;s boyfriend better than he did Cole? OLTL pulled off a shocker by making Easy E Bennett Thompson, but is it something fans want to see? Poor Blaire, why can&rsquo;t she get a normal man for once?</p>
<p>Jillian weighs in on Jill and Lauren&rsquo;s relationship on The Young and the Restless. Abby&rsquo;s antics didn&rsquo;t turn out quite like she&rsquo;d hope, but the Abby and Nikki scenes were fantastic. Could Victor really beat up Billy Abbott? Jillian doesn&rsquo;t think so. After everything they&rsquo;ve been through Phyllis finally leaves Nick. Luke thinks Sharon should be with Adam and leave Nick by his lonesome.</p>
<p>Luke, Regan and Jillian also choose their performers of the week and honorable and dishonorable mentions.</p>]]></description>

Jamey shares all this and much before weighing in on the Brandon Buddy Twitter story and Stacy Haiduk being snapped up by Days of our Lives.</p><p>
After Jamey leaves to go in search of more scoop Luke, Regan J Bernard and Karen continue their discussion of Brandon Buddy and Stacy Haiduk. Luke believes Drew Garrett would make an excellent Cole recast if Buddy were ever to leave. </p><p>
Days of our Lives laid Alice Horton to rest this week. Luke reads some Daytime Confidential reader’s comments and shares how the storyline reminded him of his great grandfather’s passing.</p><p>
All My Children has cast Trent Garrett as Asher Pike, a love interest for Colby. Should Damon be worried now that he has competition or should AMC pursue a Damon and Liza romance? </p><p>
Jeff Branson made his The Young and the Restless debut this past week and Luke spotted chemistry between him and Eden Riegel. Can Branson’s character help make Chance more interesting than he is? </p><p>
Nick has found out about Bridget being pregnant with Owen’s baby on The Bold and the Beautiful and he isn’t taking it well. Will he be able to come around to Bridget, Jackie and Owen’s more “enlightened” family concept? Steffy has already figured out that Owen and Brooke had sex at Hope’s party, now all she has to do is prove it. </p><p>
As the World Turns is winding down with its wrap party, its final taping and the last cast photo. Luke and Bernard discuss what they’d like to see happen in the remaining episodes. </p><p>
General Hospital has cast Adrienne Barbeau as a character connected to Brenda. What is their connection to Franco and will Franco interact with more characters this time around? Regan enjoyed the scenes between Luke and his two sons Ethan and Lucky this past week. Karen weighs in on the immerging trend of fans loathing Lulu and Dante.

Guza’s dreams have come true. Vanessa Marcil is returning to General Hospital for the “foreseeable future” and Jamey is ecstatic.   What will happen to all the Brenda Bots?

Luke loves the clips, but as Jamey points out ABC knows how to make a good promo. One Life to Live signs Sabine Singh as Wendy your neighborly hooker.

David Hasselhoff returned to Genoa City as Snapper on The Young and the Restless. We love that NutMeg is back on As the World Turns and nuttier than ever. Isn’t it great to have her back? James Franco should take over as head of the country’s unemployment office since he seems to be able to get everyone a job on General Hospital.

            <description><![CDATA[On today’s super-sized Daytime Confidential episode Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan react to Disney’s shocking decision to axe SOAPnet in favor of Disney Jr. What does this mean for the three ABC soaps and specifically One Life to Live? How will it impact Days of our Lives and The Young and the Restless now that a revenue stream is drying up? Jamey reveals what multiple industry insiders are telling him about the true state of soaps and how much time the genre really has.<p>
The DC gang then dives into all the 2010 Daytime Emmy Nominations and react to some of the–dare we say it–“shocking” omissions. Find out which actors they think did and didn’t deserve to be nominated and listen as they discuss the Outstanding Drama nominations. </p><p>
Then it is off to General Hospital’s Pentonville to discuss whether or not Michael (Chad Duell) was actually raped and where this controversial storyline is headed. With the Sopranos off the air it seems Guza must be rewatching the entire series of Oz, but does he know his audience? ABC told One Life to Live fans that the reason Kish was scrapped was because it didn’t appeal to Middle America. Does Guza think that prison rape does? </p><p>
Finally, Jamey has the latest on David Hasselhoff’s return to The Young and the Restless as Snapper and drops a juicy spoiler about how it will impact Jill (Jess Walton). Can you guess which Genoa City resident she’s related to? Find out in this episode of Daytime Confidential. 
All these hot topics AND your Daytime Confidential Hotline calls reacting to the 37th Annual Daytime Emmy Nominations in this mega episode.

			<title>DC #553: Pop Confidential Preview Chat With If I Can Dream's Justin Gaston and Kara Killmer</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_553_pop_confidential_preview_chat_with_if_i_can_dream_s_justin_gaton_and_kara_killmer]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today's episode of Daytime Confidential Luke and Jamey are offering up a sneak peek at their upcoming spinoff podcast, Pop Confidential! Check out their exclusive podcast interview with Justin Gaston and Kara Killmer, two of the stars of one of the hottest shows on Hulu, If I Can Dream, from American Idol creator Simon Fuller.<p>
 
If I Can Dream is an interactive, 24-hour-a-day, docusoap following the lives of a group of aspiring singers, models and actors, all living together in a SoCal "Dream House". Did we mention the Dream House is equipped with 60 AXIS cameras, which follow the casts every move? This fact caused the Dream House to turn into a nightmare for one of the show's leads. On May 8, former NFL cheerleader and Playboy bunny, Amanda Phillips left the Dream House after declaring she could no longer deal with the show infringing on her personal life. We get reactions from Justin and Kara about how it felt to see their friend move out. The pair also dishes about what it's like to now be living with former American Idol contestant Alex Lambert, who recently moved into the house, adding a much needed bad boy to the mix!</p><p>
 
We also hear Justin react to gossip blogger Perez Hilton (who recently visited the house) saying he believes the public perceives the Pineville, Louisiana native and celeb blog staple as being merely the ex-boyfriend of MileyCyrus, who likes to take his clothes off and isn't very "bright". You'll wanna tune in to hear the former Nashville Star contestant address those claims and reveal how he's working to change people's misconceptions of him by focusing everything he has on his singing career.</p><p>
 
Gaston and Killmer also weigh in on how a pair of good, Christian kids from the South (Killmer is from Crowley, Texas, just a hop, skip and a jump from Jamey's hometown) manage to stay grounded in L.A., a town where sex, seduction and commercialism rule the day.  After you listen to the podcast, head on over to Hulu to watch this week's 30-minute installment of If I Can Dream, with special guest star Perez Hilton. To watch the talented, sexy inhabitants of the Dream House day or night, visit If I Can Dream's official website.</p><p></p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_548_victoria_rowell_returns_to_daytime_confidential]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[She's baaaaack! That's right Daytime Confidential listeners, Victoria Rowell returns to the podcast to dish with Luke and Jamey about her scandalously-hilarious new novel, Secrets of a Soap Opera Diva, in bookstores today. The former star of The Young and the Restless  shares what it feels like to finally have her long-awaited roman a clef (think: Valley of the Soap Opera Dolls) about the behind-the-scenes drama of a daytime sudser into the hands of the adoring fans who have supported her during her 25 years in daytime.<p>
 
Rowell gives DC listeners a sneak peek into the fictional world of Calysta Jeffries, the sexy, mocha starlet, who appears on daytime's top soap, The Rich and the Ruthless and answers if Calysta's panty-less arch rival Emmy Abernathy is patterned after anyone soap fans may know.<p>
 
Rowell also reacts to having her New York Times Best Selling memoir The Women Who Raised Me cited in the 10th Anniversary issue of O Magazine and shares her joy at Secrets of a Soap Opera Diva being selected an official book club pick by Essence.<p>
 
Then Rowell gets real, once again about the lack of diversity behind and in front of the screens of daytime television and weighs in on former costar Michelle Stafford's recent revelation to TV Guide Canada that the brass at Y&R knew all about Stafford's plan to spit water on Rowell in a scene, which The Staff refers to as "a spit take". If you guys thought Vicki was frank the first time around, you ain't heard nuthin' yet! ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On today’s episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan discuss the latest in All My Children, As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives, General Hospital, One Life to Live and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including: <p>

ABC reassures One Life to Live fans that it isn’t cancelling their soap. Cole beats the crap out of Todd in one of the most violent scenes we’ve watched in daytime. Will All My Children’s Greenlee get a miracle baby with David Hayward? Regan isn’t a fan of miracle pregnancies, but Luke doesn’t mind since it undoes some more of the Madden era. General Hospital’s Dante takes the stand and testifies at Sonny’s trial. <p>

The Young and the Restless signs former Guiding Light star Jeff Branson and lands Sean Young for a short stint. Why is Y&R bringing on guests like Sean Young when we rarely see Melody Thomas Scott? Mary Beth Evans returns to As the World Turns as Oakdale’s Sierra. Does anyone believe that Lily would keep the existence of Craig’s son a secret for all these years? Is The Bold and the Beautiful’s Bill Spencer manipulating Donna to get his hands back on Forrester or is he just trying to be a good brother-in-law? <p>

 Days of our Lives’ Dena Higley reveals where she found the inspiration for Hope’s latest storyline.  DAYS is making it hard for fans to choose between the Safe and EJami pairings, but should they introduce another woman to set her sights on Rafe and make Sami jealous? <p>

The DC gang chooses their performers of the week and discusses their honorable and dishonorable mentions. All this and much more on today’s show!

			<title>DC #546: Daytime Confidential Goes to Happy Town with Creator Josh Appelbaum</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_546_happy_town]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Daytime Confidential goes primetime for this special episode, featuring Josh Appelbaum, one of the creators of Happy Town, the spooky, primetime drama debuting tonight on ABC. Check your local listings. Download this episode to hear Appelbaum chat with Luke and Jamey about how his love for Twin Peaks informed the development of the kooky, fictional town of Haplin, Minnesota (where Happy Town is set), while explaining what sets his supernatural sudser apart from the classic, cult hit.<p>

Find out what it's like to create a series with one of your childhood best friends, which is what Appelbaum does with pal and Happy Town co-creator Andre Nemec, and how the duo came to team up with Happy Town's other co-creator, uber producer Scott Rosenberg (High Fidelity, Gone in 60 Seconds). Appelbaum also gives Luke and Jamey a glimpse into the Happy Town cast, featuring veteran actor Sam Neil, Steven Weber (Wings, Brothers &amp; Sisters) Geoff Stults (who starred in the trio's last ABC series October Road, as well as the long-running hit 7th Heaven), Lauren German and Ben Schnetzer, son of Another World alum Steven Schnetzer. Then the DC boys try to pry some scoopage out of Appelbaum concerning Mission Impossible IV, which the former Alias scribe has been tapped to write, alongside Nemec, based on a story treatment from JJ Abrams and Tom Cruise. Will Luke and Jamey be successful on their mission impossible? You'll have to tune in to find out! </p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_545_abc_snuggle_commercial]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today’s ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Regan and Bernard discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live storylines and news, including:<p>

The Daytime Emmys return to network TV and will air on CBS from Las Vegas on June 27. Is this a bright spot for the industry or ironic, considering CBS cancelled As the World Turns in 2009. Regan, Benard and Luke share who they most hope will get a nomination when nominations are announced on May 12.</p><p>

One Life to Live’s ratings hit an all-time low. Was this because of Kish’s departure or are other botched storylines causing fans to tune out? Marty loses her baby, but for some reason none of us care. Would developing a relationship between Natalie and Brody as their former loves drift father away save their respective storylines? How great would it be for Jessica to start getting her memories back, only to discover Natalie and Brody in bed? Tuc Watkins gets a contract with OLTL.</p><p>

All My Children says goodbye to three of its most noted stars, James Mitchell’s Palmer Cortlandt, Julia Barr’s Brooke English and David Canary’s Adam Chandler. How will the Chandler family war for control turn out with their patriarch gone? </p><p>

Vanessa Marcil is in talks with General Hospital, again.  Should fans take a “believe when we see it” attitude? Chad Duell makes his Port Charles debut, but has all the steam been sucked out Sonny’s trial because of the recast? </p><p>

            <description><![CDATA[On today’s CBS and Days of our Lives Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jamey and Melodie discuss the latest in As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives and The Young and Restless storylines and news, including:<p>
The Daytime Emmys return to a big three network as CBS announces they will air daytime’s biggest night on June 27. The DC gang discusses what this means for the industry and who would Jamey like to see host the show.<p>
Les Moonves wants a piece of The View’s action and is developing a talk show starring his wife Julie Chen and actress Sarah Gilbert. Other rumored co-hosts include former Days of our Lives star and Soap Talk host Lisa Rinna and one of The Real Housewives of New York City. What does this mean for CBS’s remaining soaps and can it actually take on The View? <p>
The Young and the Restless loses almost a half million viewers. How are the multiple doppelgangers, Adam’s presumed death and the other crazy storylines playing out on our screens impacting the No. 1 soap’s ratings?<p>  
Michelle Stafford tells TV Guide Canada she did a “spit take” in the now infamous scene between her Victoria Rowell.<p> 
Billy Warlock heads to As the World Turns, but are all these new characters just too much? Why aren’t we seeing more past characters and not so many newbies? Luke Snyder isn’t sure how to respond after Dr. Reid kisses him.<p>
The Logan family blames Stephanie for Beth’s death on The Bold and the Beautiful, but shouldn’t the focus of this story be on Brooke and not Donna? <p>
Days of our Lives’ Chloe and Philip hook up after they are led to believe their significant others are cheating on them. What is happening to Hope Brady? Is she reverting back to Princess Gina? <p>

All this and much more on today’s show!

            <description><![CDATA[On today’s CBS and Days of our Lives Daytime Confidential Luke, Jillian and Melodie discuss the latest in As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of our Lives and The Young and the Restless storylines and news, including:<p>
Henry and Vienna celebrate their engagement on As the World Turns and Barbara can’t take Henry being with another woman.  Paul isn’t happy to find out that Henry and Barbara have feelings for one another. Is Katie meddling too much? Does Simon need to return for Katie? It’s about time Carly tells Jack off. <p>
The Bold and the Beautiful’s Beth belly flops into the great beyond, will the Logan sisters blame Stephanie for their mother’s death? Was Beth’s death everything we expected it to be? Did B&B botch the Alzheimer’s angle of the story?<p> 
Days of our Lives drops Taylor Spreitler from the role of Mia. Excitement builds for the return of so many fan favorites to Salem.  DAYS is doing so much right lately and we’re surprised how good it’s getting. Nicole and Arianna face off over Brady.  Stefano and EJ struggle for supremacy. <p>
 The Young and the Restless’ ratings skyrocket during its worst week in years. Tonya Lee Williams says Maria Arena Bell wants to “pump up” the black storyline. Is this version of Malcolm the one Bill Bell really wanted? Do you like Nikki Newman as a blonde or a brunette better?
Are soaps really done, as P&G executive’s claim?

            <description><![CDATA[On today’s ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey and Regan discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live headlines and storylines, including: <p>
Zach and Kendall are back together on All My Children, but not for long. Kate Collins returns to Pine Valley as Janet From Another Planet. Find out what Jamey thinks of JR and Annie. Regan shares the latest scoop on Palmer’s funeral and the returns of Daisy and Nina. You’ll never believe where All My Children writers are getting storyline inspiration. </p><p>
Drew Garrett’s final General Hospital episode airs. Did GH make the right decision to recast Michael near the climax of its gripping story? Chad Duell debuts this week. Dante uses Morgan to get at Michael. Where will this leave Sonny and should GH keep Dante on the straight and narrow as a cop or should he go to the dark side and work for his father?  Is GH wasting Bradley Cole in the abuse storyline the same way they wasted Martha Byrne last fall? Regan shares a rumor about Kiefer’s mother.</p><p>  
One Life to Live’s last Kish episode together airs. We loved their final scenes, but is it still worth fighting for diversity in soaps or should fans be looking for it in primetime? Does OLTL’s musical seem a bit inappropriate? Regan and Luke think so, but Jamey disagrees.  Is OLTL cleaning house to make room for Thorsten Kaye to return?</p><p>
Have soaps run their course, as P&amp;G executives have said, or is there still hope for the genre?

            <description><![CDATA[On today's ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Regan and Karen from Wubs.net discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live storylines and news, including:<br><br>Alicia Minshew's Kendall returns to our TV screens and faces off with Greenlee. Does it make sense that Kendall didn't know Greenlee is alive? All My Children casts Michael Nouri as Erica's latest love interest. JR tries to take down Annie, but will he fall for his foe? Victor Alfieri debuts as a Fusion photographer. Natalia is boring Regan out her mind. <br><br>General Hospital's abuse storyline is beginning to move its focus towards Alexis and her killing Kiefer. Should GH have focused more on Kiefer before killing him off?&nbsp; Spinelli and Jason are closing in on the truth about Alexis's secret. Morgan testifies in court. Karen shares her on Drew Garrett's firing and the new Michael. Maya fights for her own identity at General Hospital. <br><br>One Life to Live's Ilene Kristen has been doing amazing work and kept us tuning in. Roxy supports her son Schuyler. With Scott Clifton out at OLTL should he go back to General Hospital as Dillon?&nbsp; The Kish storyline is almost over and there are so many more stories that could still be told. The Cole/Starr/Ford/Langston/Markko storyline is dragging on and is overshadowing OLTL's musical storyline featuring Danielle/Matthew/Destiny. <br>]]></description>

			<title>DC #537: Kodak's Jeff Hayzlett Previews 2nd Annual Streamys</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_537_kodak_s_jeff_hayzlett_previews_2nd_annual_streamys]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div>It's that time of the year again web series fans. That's right the 
2nd Annual&nbsp;Streamy Awards are being held this Sunday, April 11 in Los 
Angeles, and some of our faves like&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;Bannen Way</em>,<em>Venice</em>'s
 <strong>Crystal Chappell</strong>&nbsp;and <em>Buppies'</em>&nbsp;<strong>Tatyana
 Ali</strong>&nbsp;are all&nbsp;up for awards!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On this webtastic episode of the Daytime Confidential Podcast, Luke
 and Jamey chat with one of the most influential movers and shakers in 
the fast-growing&nbsp;world of digital video production, Jeff Hayzlett, chief
 marketing officer for Kodak, which is serving for the second year in a 
row as the Official Imaging Sponsor of the Streamys.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The personable, cowboy corporate exec talks with the DC boys&nbsp;about 
why it's been so important for Kodak to be on the forefront of 
entertainment consumptions transition from analog to digital. He also 
reveals that once again he will be tweeting live from the Streamys 
telecast, as he did during the Oscars, and recalls&nbsp;how cool it was to 
learn that even the likes of&nbsp;Mr. Bean was following his tweets.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hayzlett dishes&nbsp;about some of TV and the web's biggest stars like <em>How
 I Met Your Mother</em>'s&nbsp;<strong>Neil Patrick Harris</strong> and <em>One
 Life to Live</em> grad-turned <em>Castle</em> star&nbsp;<strong>Nathan 
Fillion</strong>, whose <em>Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-Long Blog</em> proved a
 game changer for web TV last year, and also reveals he will be 
presenting the Streamy Award for Best Ensemble. </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hayzlett also previews Kodak's red hot digital video cameras, the 
Zi8 pocket camera and the Kodak Playsport, both of which are serving as 
the Official Digital Cameras for this year's Streamys. You'll definitely
 want to listen in&nbsp;as he shares how cameras like these are being used by
 budding, young creatives to make their own web soaps, comedies and talk
 shows. Can Hayzlett convince someone as technologically challenged as 
Jamey (who still uses an old-fashioned tape recorder on the red carpet) 
that the Zi8 is even easy enough for him to use? You'll have to listen 
to find out. </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Be sure to&nbsp;log on to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.streamys.org/" target="_blank">www.streamys.org</a> to watch the live&nbsp;webcast this 
Sunday, April 11, 2010 at 5:30 pm PT/8:30 pm ET. To follow Jeff Hayzlett
 on Twitter go here. For more information on the Streamys, check out 
Tubefilter.tv and NewTeeVee.com For more on Kodak's Zi8 pocket camera 
and Kodak's Playsport, visit the official Kodak website, and remember 
the revoultion will be webivised!</div>]]></description>

			<title>DC #536: Walt Willey Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_536_walt_willey_interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Jackson Montgomery is back, and we've got him! On today's episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast, Luke and Jamey talk to All My Children veteran and all around nice guy Walt Willey, who recently reprised his signature role as Erica Kane's most enduring lover on the sudser. 
 
<br><br>This Friday, April 9 at 9 pm Willey will be appearing at SoCal's hottest spot for sketch comedy, ACME Comedy Theatre, where he will be hosting "Unscripted Hollywood Dream Role". Willey offers DC listeners a preview of his upcoming show, and gives his hilarious reaction to having witnessed the infamous Kato Kaelin hosting the show when he first visited ACME.
 
<br><br>"He's held up good since the white van days," Willey quips.
 
<br><br>Then the discussion shifts, of course, to what it's like for Willey to be back in Pine Valley— by way of Los Angeles instead of New York— and to be working again with the likes of Rebecca Budig, Vincent Irizarry, Julia Barr, and of course the unforgettable Susan Lucci. It's an interview Pine Valley lovers and comedy buffs alike won't wanna miss!
<br><br>If you are in the SoCal area be sure to go see Walt Willey in ACME Comedy Theatre's "Unscripted Hollywood Dream Role" this Friday night at 9 pm. ACME Comedy Theatre is located at 135 N. La Brea Ave Hollywood, CA 90036. For everyone else, you can watch the show being streamed live at www.acmecomedy.com. We will also be posting a reminder with the link on the blog before the show.]]></description>

			<title>DC #528: Brett Claywell Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_528_brett_claywell_interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In his first podcast interview since being kished to the curb. <em>One  Life to Live'</em>s Brett Claywell talks with Daytime Confidential.com's  Luke Kerr, Jamey Giddens and Jillian Bowe on the heels of his shocking  firing. The talented and passionate young actor, who moved across  country to assume the role of Schuyler Joplin, only to cede that role to  Scott Clifton, before being cast as nefarious lab tech-turned-gay med  student Kyle Lewis, talks about what it was like to find out from OLTL  show runner Frank Valentini that he was being let go from the series.<br /> <br />Hear Claywell in his own words as he shares his thoughts on the  powerful work he and leading man Scott Evans (Oliver Fish) accomplished,  and why he doesn't want to let any of the negativity surrounding their  exits take away from a story he says will stay with him for the rest of  his life. Claywell also addresses the myriad of allegations lobbied  against him and Evans in the media. Does he feel they are to blame for  OLTL's viewer erosion? What about their rumored misbehavior on set?  Claywell addresses it all. He also talks about if we will ever see him  reunite with Evans in a movie or web series, ala <em>Guiding Light'</em>s  Crystal Chappell and Jessica Leccia, who now star opposite each other in  <em>Venice</em>. This is the podcast interview every Kish fan has been  dying to download. &nbsp;</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #527: OLTL's Kish-tastrophy</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_527_oltl_s_kish_tastrophy]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's special episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey, Jillian and Regan weigh in on <em>One Life to Live's </em>shocking dismissal of <strong><a href="http://daytimeconfidential.com/news/brett-claywell">Brett Claywell</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://daytimeconfidential.com/news/scott-evans">Scott Evans</a></strong> and the end of the soap's popular, groundbreaking Kish love story.</p>
<p>From the quote about Kish not resonating "with the mainstream audience" that has outraged so many fans, to the multiple storylines that have contributed to OLTL's low ratings, DC digs into all the latest in this continuing saga.</p>
<p>The DG&nbsp;gang explores why OLTL seems to be cleaning house of its minority stars and young talent which has afforded the ratings-challenged sudser such critical acclaim. We pose the question, what has ahppened to the diversity&nbsp;Agnes Nixon created this show to reflect?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also ponder, should Brett and&nbsp;Scott return if ABC offers? Do TPTB&nbsp;really think they are giving the majority of the fans what they want, while destroying the show in the process?Jamey wonders, will the move to oust Kish be <strong>Frank Valentini's </strong>Maureen Bauer moment? What, if anything, can OLTL do to turn things around in Llanview?</p>
<p>No other topic since Daytime Confidential.com's inception, from <em>Guiding Light's</em> cancellation to <em>Victoria Rowell's</em> shocking tell-all interview, has received such a vocal response from Daytime Confidential readers and listeners. More podcast fans have called in to our hotline about OLTL's Kish-trastropy than about the firings of <strong>Drake Hogestyn</strong>,<strong> Deidre Hall</strong>, <strong>Mary Beth Evans </strong>and <strong>Stephen Nichols</strong> at <em>Days of our Lives</em>. Listen to fans voice their opinions about the controversy at the end of the episode. This is truly an episode Llanview lovers won't wanna miss.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey and Regan discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>Jamey's Blind Item news that former All My Children star Eden Riegel is going to The Young and the Restless. What does this mean for both soaps?

Is Annie return to crazy land a good twist or a desperate move? Should the role of Scott be recast so that AMC can play up the Camelot angle?</p>
<p>Regan has a major problem with One Life to Live's Ford and how he's turned Langston into a panty dropper. Is he smarmy or is he a classic soap character?

Did anyone care Melinda died?</p>
<p>Johnny takes on the Corinthos organization to try and make Sonny pay on General Hospital. Jamey believes GH needs to tell fans what illegal products Sonny and Jason are trafficking in. Claiming it's Cuban cigars isn't cutting it. Does Elizabeth have to many children? Patrick confronts Sonny and calls him out. Luke is tired of Spinelli's small dog syndrome. Give Spinelli and Maxie a better storyline. Helena manipulates the paternity tests.</p>]]></description>

<p>The fallout from Greenlee's return and almost wedding to David continues. Ryan kidnaps Greenlee as Erica holds David hostage. JR wants to make Marissa Little A's legal guardian if he dies. Luke believes All My Children needs to keep recasting Colby until they get the character right and makes a suggestion for who should fill the role. Jamey says Hayley needs to be recast. Luke suggests Maura West. Imagine the Chandler family with Jacob Young as JR, Robin Chrisopher as Skye, Maura West as Hayley, Marcy Rylan as Colby and Melissa Claire Egan as the evil stepmother Mrs. Chandler.</p>
<p>Robin Christopher returns to General Hospital as Skye, but should she be in Port Charles or Pine Valley? General Hospital's new opening credits debut on Tuesday. GH seems to be using Sonny's kids to rationalize his behavior. Morgan tries to convince Dante to quit being a cop and go to work for Sonny while Carly wants Dante to lie under oath. Regan reacts to the Valentine's episode. Was it what she'd hoped for. Who is the father of Elizabeth's baby? Is it Lucky or Nikolas?</p>
<p>Amanda Setton quits One Life to Live. Luke wants Kim and Clint to sleep together at least once before she leaves so that there is hope for a Buchanan baby if she were to return. Jillian attends OLTL's new studio event and shares stories from the gathering including interactions with Farah Fath, Florencia Lozano, Brett Claywell, Kassie DePaiva, Kelley Missal, Trevor St. John, Scott Clifton, Ron Carlivati and Frank Valentini.The DC gang discusses onscreen storylines as well. Jessica's brains are fried like a scrambled egg and she doesn't remember Brody, Natalie or her daughter. Stacy Morasco drowns, but is there a possibility she might return? Kelly, Bitchy Bangs and David were hilarious in Paris, France.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's CBS and Days of our Lives episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Jillian and J Bernard discuss the latest in storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>Damian runs for the hills on As the World Turns after NutMeg escapes. Carly invites Liberty to work for her. Will this give us more Carly vs. Janet? What is up with Mick and his obsession with Alison and helping Emily get pregnant? Luke wants the story to be over with, but not everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Zach Conroy debuts on The Bold and the Beautiful. Conroy and Brown have great chemistry as siblings and there is a spark between Hope and Oliver. Steffy vs. Hope heats up at Forrester, but shouldn't the Logan girls be worried that Thomas might try and come after them like he did Rick in the past? What do you think of Whip and Taylor?</p>
<p>Vivan tells Victor she's seen Laurence on Days of our Lives and he warns her to stay away from Melanie. Carly comes close to telling Melanie the truth. Is there hope for Rafe and Sami or will EJ get in the way? Arianna discovers Anna and her connection to EJ, but will she figure it out? Suzanne Rogers continues to hit it out of the park.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's ABC Daytime Confidential episode Luke, Jamey and Regan discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live storylines and news, including:</p>
<p>Greenlee is about to catch Ryan and Erica on All My Children. AMC needs to quit with the misleading promos. Ryan isn't Greenlee's true love and Greenlee isn't Ryan's. Leo is Greenlee's true love and Gillian is Ryan's. Should AMC bring back Esta TerBlanche as a Gillian look-a-like to be paired with Ryan?  Will Brooke's Pine Valley return help put things right?</p>
<p>Jonathon Jackson delivered an amazing performance on General Hospital. Did he just lay claim to the Emmy? With Jackson back Tyler Christopher needs to step up his game. Elizabeth is being written out of character, but Sam fans must be estatic. Dominic Zamprogna were fantastic during Friday's episode and we can't wait to see how the story the Dante/Sonny story plays out. What will happen to Sonny now? General Hospital needs to update its opening ASAP, their old one is more and more embarrassing with each passing week.</p>
<p>Jamey has the perfect idea for a One Life to Live/General Hospital crossover. John McBain goes to Port Charles to hunt down a serial killer and while he's there runs into Sam so that Michael Easton and Kelly Monaco can re-unite onscreen. How do you solve a problem like Marty Saybrooke? Jamey has a suggestion that just might make the character interesting. Who is going to get custody of Stacy's baby if she dies? OLTL has needs to give poor Jessica a break. If she's re-paired with Cristian where does that leave Layla? Would Ford and Layla make a good couple or should the Ford/Langston/Marrko triangle keep going? Should Evangeline return to Llanview? When did Dorian become Snoop Dogg? The Starr and Danielle scenes were the best part of the previous week.</p>]]></description>

			<title>DC #497: Daytime Confidential Celebrates 500th Episode With Ron Carlivati</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_497_daytime_confidential_celebrates_500th_episode_with_ron_carlivati]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In honor of the Daytime Confidential podcast's 500th episode (okay,this is actually 497 but who's counting?), Luke and Jamey chat with One Live to Live head writer extraordinaire, Ron Carlivati. In his first podcast interview, the George Washington University graduate, who left a career in law to pursue his dreams of writing for his favorite soap opera, shares with Luke and Jamey how his then-employer, former attorney David Baldacci selling his first novel, Absolute Power, inspired Carlivati to move to New York and follow his true passion.



<br/><br/>Carlivati talks in depth about what it was like to go from being Dorian (Robin Strasser) and Viki's (Erika Slezak) biggest fan, to creating their storylines day in and day out. He shares what it meant to him to see the first confrontation he ever penned for the legendary duo air on television.<br/><br/>Carlivati also reveals why it was so important for him to restore Llanview's rich history and how he managed to return the soap opera to the diverse landscape creator Agnes Nixon first envisioned over four decades ago.



<br/><br/>The talented scribe also explains in great deal why he felt the payoff of having Todd Manning (Trevor St. John) romance his amnesiac, one-time rape victim Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell) made the controversial story worth it in the end. He also shared how it made him feel to see Haskell win her second Emmy earlier this year for the storyline's climax, and explains why he feels two smart, flawed women like Tea Delgado (Florencia Lozano) and Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) are drawn to Todd.
<br/><br/>Carlivati also talks about his love for great sitcoms growing up and how that influences his storytelling. He also provides Daytime Confidential listeners a sneak peek of what's next for his soap's top couples like Bo and Nora, Rex and Gigi and of course Kish. Will daytime's most realistically-drawn gay couple get a real love scene? You'll have to listen to this episode to find out. It's an interview you don't wanna miss!]]></description>

			<title>DC #491: As the World Turns is Cancelled</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_491_as_the_world_turns_is_cancelled]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On December 8th, 2009, less than three months after Guiding Light went off the air, CBS cancelled As the World Turns. Daytime Confidential’s Luke, Jamey, Mike, Jillian, Melodie and Bernard share their initial reactions to the saddening news and discuss the similarities between the cancellation of Guiding Light and As the World Turns. 



How should ATWT spend their remaining months? Do they need to cut out the dead weight and zero in on the stories fans want to see most? Should Martha Byrne return as Lily Snyder for time it has left? Will ATWT go for broke with Luke and Noah? Do Jack and Carly need to be reunited? Should ATWT let Roger Howarth out of his contract “for the greater good” so that he can return to One Life to Live and help it stay on the air? 

Where does ATWT's cancellation leave OLTL as the last New York soap? Is it the next to get cancelled or has Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal put Days of our Lives in danger? 



What chance does OLTL have in its fight for survival? Why doesn’t it promote itself and its stars more? All My Children, General Hospital, Days of our Lives and The Young and the Restless stars appear on red carpets, entertainment TV shows and magazine articles all the time, but we rarely see the same for OLTL stars.



Daytime Confidential readers and listeners share their reaction to ATWT's cancellation. 



This and much more on the state of the soap opera genre on today’s episode.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_490_pine_valey_podcast_returns_to_dc]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today's ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke and Jamey are joined by The Pine Valley Podcast's hilarious hosts Ashley Mendoza and Jordan Hudson. <br/><br/>In this super-sized ABC episode they discuss Chuck Pratt's firing and the impact Lorraine Broderick will have on the show. What is there left for her to work with? It has too many &quot;dead behind the eyes&quot; younger actors and not enough vets are making the move to L.A. Should AMC recast the role of Kendall Hart Slater? What do Ashley and Jordan think of Stuart's murder? Can All My Children pull of a General Hospital karaoke episode or would it end up being Dancing With the Stars dance lessons and stripper poles?<br/><br/>Speaking of General Hospital, Ashley believes there has been something missing from Franco's stint in Port Charles and Jamey agrees. Franco couldn't pull in ratings for General Hospital, but the Spixie non wedding did. That has to mean something doesn't it?<br/><br/>One Life to Live has been on fire with mid week cliffhangers and Mitch Laurence's return to torment Llanview. How could AMC's move to L.A. impact OLTL's production team? <br/><br/>Has SOAPnet become the Lifetime channel knockoff with its reruns and original programming? Could soaps survive if they had a channel actually dedicated to them and encouraging their development? <br/><br/>Crystal Chappell's new web series Venice has premiered and Jordan shares his reaction to the anticipated series.<br/>]]></description>

			<title>DC #486: Chuck Pratt is Fired!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_486_chuck_pratt_is_fired_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today’s ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Regan and Eye on Soaps’ Belinda discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live storylines and news, including: 

Get the party started! All My Children fired Chuck Pratt! The gang reacts to the news and discusses Pratt’s reign of terror.  Where does this leave Pine Valley now and what should AMC focus on to get it back on track? Can things be repaired in time for the 40th anniversary? Would it be smart to try a General Hospital: Night Shift season two strategy and bring back a popular character with lots of connections to canvas to reboot the storylines? Luke suggests bringing back Robin Christopher as Skye or letting Janet From Another Planet (Kate Collins or Robin Mattson) loose on Pine Valley. Regan thinks re-centering the show around Erica by bringing back Bianca (Eden Riegel) and doing what it takes to keep Alicia Minshew as Kendall. Who should replace Pratt as head writer? Speaking of Janet From Another Planet, why isn’t she in town trying to take down David Hayward? Would Janet really put up with what how he’s treating her daughter?

Friday was supposed to have been about James Franco’s General Hospital debut, but All My Children stole a bit of his thunder by firing Chuck Pratt.  Regan and Luke share their first impressions of his premiere. From his rearranging the cooling bodies at the shoot out to whether or not he will (or can) win out over Jason and Sonny, they discuss it all. Why do the promos have his character and Maxie kissing? Luke doesn’t like it one bit that GH is causing problems for Spixie already.

The DC gang has been impressed with One Life to Live’s Kelley Missal as Danielle Rayburn and this past week Todd met her. How long will it be before he learns that she is his daughter?  What will happen to Tea now that Ross has found out that Danielle isn’t his daughter? Schuyler discovers Stacy’s fake baby bump.  Mitch is back in town and continues to stir up problems for Llanview’s citizens. 

Regan missed the Performer of the Week episode so she hands out her picks for Performer of the Week and honorable mentions.

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_484_abc_grave_robbers_and_skeletons]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today’s ABC episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast Luke, Regan and Eye on Soaps’ Belinda (The View From the Recliner’s Edge) discuss the latest storylines and news for the week of November 9, including: 

More fan favorites return to All My Children for the 40th Anniversary. Julia Barr, Eden Riegel, Eva La Rue, Leven Rambin and more are set to return. The question becomes, can Chuck Pratt whip AMC into shape so that lapsed fans who tune in will have reason to stick around? Is there someone missing from the line up of returnees who you want to return? BethAnn Bonner makes her Pine Valley debut. Is it hard to watch and believe the Zach and Kendall storyline knowing that Thorsten Kaye isn’t making the move to L.A.?  Annie pretends to fake the loss of a baby only to find out she’s actually pregnant. How original. 

Chad Brannon is returning to General Hospital for one episode. Luke is sick of the smug, spoiled Michael Corinthos III, but Regan loves this Michael. What do you think of him? Jonathan Jackson has had some time to settle back into the role of Lucky, but Regan isn’t sure she’s liking this version of Lucky. Hear her explain why. Is Dante’s secret identity the worst kept secret in town or would that be Jake’s paternity? Everyone and their mother seems to know–or will soon find out–who he really is. 

Bass ass Mitch Laurence has returned to shake up the citizens of Llanview’s lives. Were Jessica and Natalie’s reaction to over-the-top? The DC crew was disappointed with how the revelation that Mitch is Rex’s father played out.  Couldn’t it have waited until Rex returned to Llanview so that we could see more people’s reaction all at once? Marcy gave birth to her miracle baby in a dramatic scene, but we’re happy she finally has a child.

All this and much more on today’s show!

			<title>DC #466: Jonathan Reiner Gets Real About Future of Soaps</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_466_jonathan_reiner_gets_real_about_future_of_soaps]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[With reality television becoming more and more popular, as production of scripted fare dries up, it's good these day to be a jack of all genres. That's exactly who Jonathan Reiner is. The veteran reality show producer (Starting Over, Big Brother), who got his start as an intern at Theater Week magazine, which led to him meeting the legendary Soap Opera Weekly editrix Mimi Torchin, and a career covering soaps, drops by Daytime Confidential to chat with Luke and Jamey about the differences and similarities between soaps and reality shows.
<br/><br/>Reiner reflects on what it was like to work on daytime's first and only reality soap, Starting Over, co-created by the late Mary -Ellis Bunim, and offers a fresh perspective on why network television dramas seem to be struggling so much. He also ponders the question, why didn't Procter and Gamble seek out producers with reality television experience before embarking on their risky production model shift for the now-cancelled sudser Guiding Light? It's an interview you won't soon forget.

            <description><![CDATA[On today's ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey, Jillian, Melodie and Bernard discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live storylines and news, including:<br/><br/>All My Children's David continues to manipulate Amanda and Jake. AMC finishes taping in New York City on December 11. Jamey gives an update on Brian Frons' visit to New York City and what he's heard about which AMC stars are moving to L.A. Should a daytime soap be like Melrose? Jamey doesn't think so.<br/><br/>Did General Hospital's special carnival event breathe new life into the show? The DC gang discusses whether or not Claudia saw Kristina in the rubble. Liason's brief scenes warmed Jamey's heart. What will happen to Jax and Carly's marriage when it is revealed that Jax knew about what Claudia and Jerry did? Would General Hospital's ratings go up if it fired its six biggest stars like Days of Our Lives' have? <br/><br/>If One Life to Live had the PR and push that General Hospital and All My Children get would it be ABC's highest rated soap? Jamey believes that if soap fans only watch one soap it should be OLTL. OLTL figured out a way to incorporate a mob storyline that didn't eat the show and involved core characters, but its ratings didn't go up. Why didn't it work for OLTL when it does for GH? Patricia Mauceri talks to Fox News. Is Roscoe Born returning to OLTL? If so, what might his storyline include? <br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Sean Kanan has brought the sexually-charged swagger of bad boy Deacon Sharpe back to daytime, only this time Big D isn't taming Beverly Hills cougars on The Bold and the Beautiful. He's too busy sexing and scheming his way through Genoa City on B&amp;B's sister sudser The Young and the Restless!<br/><br/>Daytime Confidential's Jamey finally met one of his favorite actors face-to-face on the red carpet at last weekend's 36th Annunal Daytime Emmy Awards and invited him on for today's episode of the podcast. Tune in to hear Kanan share his thoughts on this year's show, and what it's been like recreating his crazy, raunchy, dirty character on a second soap. You'll hear how Kanan was able to pick back up where he left off with B&amp;B leading lady Adrienne Frantz (Amber) and how being paid to make out with his pal Thad Luckinbill's (JT) very pregnant wife Amelia Heinle (Victoria) makes him blush.<br/><br/>Kanan also praises his former boss Brad Bell, who last Sunday accepted B&amp;B's historic first win for Outstanding Drama Series, and reveals how Bell's speech being cut out of the broadcast made him feel. Kanan also shares what it was like to finally meet his new boss, Brad's sister-in-law, Maria Arena Bell at the Daytime Emmys.<br/><br/>Kanan also weighs in on the recent tragic passing of DJ AM, and reveals to Jamey and Luke just how much his own sobriety and second chance in daytime, provided by uber producer Paul Rauch, means to him.]]></description>

<br/><br/>O'Neil and Branco, himself a veteran of awards show coverage, also weigh in on whether or not Susan Lucci finally winning the Daytime Emmy for Best Lead Actress and/or Oprah Winfrey taking herself out of the race for Best Talk Show Host, cost the Daytime Emmys in terms of much-needed, mainstream buzz.



<br/><br/>Along the way, Luke, Jamey and Nelson handicap this year's race, providing their thoughts on who should win, as opposed to who will win. It's an episode you won't wanna miss. Then, be sure to check out Nelson Branco, Soap Opera Digest's Stephanie Sloane and our own Jamey Giddens on the hour-long Daytime Emmy pre-show Live From The Red Carpet, hosted by The Insider's Lara Spencer and Entertainment Tonight's Kevin Frazier, airing just before the Emmys.

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_443_cbs_and_days_making_it_worth_watching]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today&rsquo;s CBS and Days of Our Lives episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey, Mike and Jillian discuss the latest in As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, Guiding Light and The Young and the Restless news and storylines, including: <br />
<br />
Tamara Tunie is returning to As the World Turns so that Jessica can usher Bonnie off screen. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if she stuck around? Would Jessica and Dusty make a good couple? How did One Life to Live&rsquo;s Tika Sumpter&nbsp;end up in a conversation about Tunie&rsquo;s return? ATWT has to pull it out if it wants to survive. Watching what is happening to ATWT is d&eacute;j&agrave; vu of what happened to Guiding Light last year. Could ATWT avoid cancellation if they stepped it up?<br />
<br />
Guiding Light filmed its last episode ever this past week. Jamey believes no soap in its end game has ever created a couple with as much buzz as Otalia. The show has nothing to lose, why not give fans what they want? It really takes some doing to piss off Daytime Confidential&rsquo;s J. Bernard, but Guiding Light figured out a way to do it. We didn&rsquo;t know it was possible. <br />
<br />
The rivalry between Forrester Creations and Jackie M. heated up as both fashion houses competed for bragging rights. Would Jillian buy anything from either collection? Should The Bold and the Beautiful hire a fashion consultant? Does B&amp;B have a hit on its hands with Brad and Katie?<br />
<br />
Wally Kurth returned to Days of Our Lives as Justin Kiriakis. Jamey reacts to his return while Luke questions if Justin was making eyes at Hope. Jamey wants Judi Evans back in Salem as Adrienne asap. <br />
<br />
Devon and Tyra had sex on The Young and the Restless. Did anyone actually want to see it or enjoy watching them grope each other? Tatyana Ali stole the scenes and she can act. Y&amp;R needs to figure out how to keep her around. Y&amp;R needs to integrate the Winters family better. Should Rafe and Heather become Y&amp;R&rsquo;s Will and Grace? Is the JT we remember back? Mike and Jamey want Mary Williams to return. Mike is upset about how Sharon is being written. Jamey has a shout out for a Lane fan listener. <br />]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_442_abc_executives_in_glass_houses]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today’s ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey and J Bernard are joined by guest David Ozanich–one of the authors of Likely Story: Red Carpet Riot– to discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live news and storylines, including:



<br/><br/>Rumors continue to swirl around which All My Children stars will or will not be making the move to L.A. The DC gang discusses the latest dish.Could Susan Lucci and Thorsten Kaye be staying in New York? What would be the impact on One Life to Live if they jumped to Llanview? Is Thorsten Kaye the star of AMC?



<br/><br/>Network executives in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. Brian Frons comments on the cancellation of Guiding Light to the Wall Street Journal.



<br/><br/>Kelly Monaco re-upped with General Hospital, but you’ll notice we never see casting calls for male characters. Jamey remedies this oversight with casting calls for some of ABC’s most popular male characters. Olivia tries to protect Dante on GH. Jamey believes that GH made the right decision by not going with Tom Pelphrey in the role of Dante. Bernard believes that Brandon Barash is one of GH’s new secret weapons. Is Morgan the real son of Sonny Corinthos?



<br/><br/>David shares news about a special reading of his novel, Likely Story: Red Carpet Riot, done by OLTL's Robin Strasser, Jason Tam, Brittany Underwood and John-Paul Lavoisier as part of OLTL's Fan Clu Weekend. He also tells the DC'ers a hilarious story involving Strasser, a wheelchair and a boat.



<br/><br/>Tuc Watkins returned to Llanview as David Vickers and stole the show with classic lines. Layla and Fish had sex. What will Layla do when she finds out that Fish is gay? Who is haunting Jessica? Who is sending Jared and Natalie discs of Nash’s death?

			<title>DC #440: Mimi Torchin Returns to Daytime Confidential</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_440_mimi_torchin_returns_to_daytime_confidential]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On this very special edition of the DC podcast, the founding editor of Soap Opera Weekly, who recently clicked her laptop back on to cover Guiding Light's endgame for TV Guide Canada's &quot;The Soapgeist,&quot; tells Luke and Jamey how she really feels about such hot soap opera topics as Guiding Light's cancellation and All My Children's upcoming move to Los Angeles. Does Torchin believe AMC's move is a good thing for the industry, or will it hasten the death of soaps?



<br/><br/>It's no surprise to anyone who has been reading her GL coverage that Torchin spends a good bit of time on this episode discussing her current, fave soap couple Olivia and Natalia (She's not a fan of squish names!) on GL. Why does this couple have Torchin both fascinated and utterly frustrated? Torchin is hoping Venice, the new web series co-created by the woman she calls &quot;the best actress in daytime&quot;, Crystal Chappell, and costarring the likes of Jessica Leccia, Hillary B. Smith and Jordan Clarke, will show daytime soaps how it should be done! Torchin also fills Luke and Jamey in on what she's been up to since the last time she visited DC, namely her breathtaking photography work featuring her two beloved islands—Manhattan and Martha's Vineyard—all chronicled at www.mimitorchinphotography.com.



<br/><br/>Torchin weighs in on what soaps like The Young and the Restless and One Life to Live are doing right and what they are doing wrong, and shares a Cruz and Eden memory that is sure to bring back memories of fans of Soap Opera Weekly's groundbreaking early days and the iconic super soap Santa Barbara. All this and much more on this jam-packed edition of Daytime Confidential.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_438_abc_kisses_contracts_and_moving_to_l_a_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today’s ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey and Jillian discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live news and storylines, including:



<br/><br/>Now that Jamey's initial report about All My Children moving to Los Angeles has been confirmed by ABC , Jamey reveals the latest tidbits about what he ' s hearing from his sources. What does AM ' Cs move to L.A. really mean? Is it a vote of confidence in a three-soap lineup, as ABC claims? Is ABC’s investment in HD an investment in OLTL and AMC or just a capital investment in the studios where they are filmed? Susan Lucci is All My Children. When people think of soap operas they think Susan Lucci. Will ABC face a PR crisis if she decides not to make the move? It is unlikely that many older AMC veterans will make the move, but what happens if Thorsten Kaye, Alicia Minshew and Cameron Mathison choose to stay in New York ? The group speculates on whether or not Brian Frons would let them join OLTL?
<br/><br/>With AMC moving to L.A., One Life to Live is getting a bigger, improved studio, but how close to cancellation did OLTL really come? Does the new studio give OLTL and Frank &amp; Co. a fighting chance? The DC gang discusses Kish’s kiss, OLTL’s tribute to Grey Gardens and the double wedding of Clint and Nora and Viki and Charlie. Is Crystal Hunt finally stepping up as Stacy and making Jamey a fan?<br/><br/>&nbsp;Is Kelly Monaco leaving General Hospital? Soap Opera Digest is reporting that the show has sent out a casting call for the character of Sam McCall, but Nancy Lee Grahn and Steve Burton rebuffed the report on Twitter. If Monaco leaves GH where does that leave the JaSam pairing? Should the character of Sam be recast? Jamey suggests which soap she could go too, if she does end up leaving Port Charles. Spinelli asks Mac for Maxie’s hand in marriage. Dante is an undercover cop investigating Sonny and the mob. Knowing that he is Sonny’s son, is this a brilliant twist? Could Dante’s job as a cop provide an opportunity for the show to finally strengthen the role of the police in Port Charles? Jillian reacts to Dante catching his mother Olivia having sex with Johnny.
<br/><br/>All this and much more on today’s ABC episode of Daytime Confidential.

            <description><![CDATA[On today’s CBS and Days of Our Lives episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey, Mike, Jillian and Melodie discuss the latest in As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, Guiding Light and The Young and the Restless news and storylines, including:



<br/><br/>Louise Sorel is returning to Days of Our Lives as Vivian Alamain, which means Jamey and Luke are in Salem heaven. They discuss what Sorel’s return means for DAYS and Jamey reminisces about her role Augusta Wainwright since the 25th anniversary of Santa Barbara just passed. Salem is getting another familiar face to NBC soap fans. Lindsey Hartley is joining DAYS, taking over the role of Rafe’s sister. 



<br/><br/>Lynn Herring makes her debut on As the World Turns, as Henry Coleman’s mother. Mike and Mel give their first impressions of her and Janet’s new sister Teri. Margo and Casey continue to lie to Tom about Riley being Adam. Mel believes that ATWT is actually getting better, do her co-hosts agree? 



<br/><br/>Ridge and Taylor are pronounced Man and Horse on The Bold and the Beautiful, which has Jillian and Jamey in stitches. Steffy and Thomas team up to try and stop Brooke from interrupting the wedding. Is Steffy finally living up to her grandmother’s name?



<br/><br/>Jeffrey returns to Springfield, but does anyone care? David Andrew MacDonald returns as (insert name), but did anyone actually believe he was dead? Mike didn’t. The best thing about Guiding Light last week didn’t even air on TV; it was Mimi Torchin’s interview with Maureen Garret. Jamey reveals the “truth” behind how, when and where Ellen Wheeler’s failed vision for GL came from.



<br/><br/>The Daytime Confidential gang weighs in on the controversial Deacon, Amber and Daniel triangle storyline. Should Eric Braeden take a paycut? Is Billy Abbott Genoa City’s next Victor Newman? If so, who could be his Jack? Luke suggests Deacon Sharpe. Jamey thinks Victoria and suggests Sarah Brown as Victoria vs. Billy would be dynamic. Sarah Brown’s contract with General Hospital is up in 2009. Should The Young and the Restless try to snag her away from Port Charles?<br/><br/>&nbsp;All this and much more on today’s “visionary” episode of Daytime Confidential.

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_436_abc_moves_all_my_children]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today’s ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Jamey and J Bernard discuss the latest in All My Children, One Life to Live and General Hospital news and storylines, including:



<br/><br/>All My Children picking up roots and moving to LA. In this episode, recorded before ABC confirmed Jamey’s report on Tuesday, Jamey predicts that the announcement would happen this week and discusses in depth what he is hearing from his sources. He discusses the impact this shakeup will have on AMC’s veteran actors, where this leaves One Life to Live as ABC’s only New York soap and why General Hospital gets a pass because of it being the “Luke and Laura soap.” Is ABC’s solution only a band-aid until they can develop a talk show?



<br/><br/>J Bernard shares his theory about the Who Killed Adam storyline and why he believes everything isn’t as it seems.



<br/><br/>General Hospital re-signed popular actors Steve Burton and Leslie Charleson, keeping them on canvas. Is Drew Garrett the next Tom Pelphrey or Steve Burton and could he surpass them? GH needs to cast Michael a love interest ASAP and do whatever it takes to avoid a pairing him with his sister Kristina. Luke sees chemistry between Lulu and Dante, but J Bernard doesn’t. What does it say about GH that it takes two of Luke’s sons to beat up the son of Sonny Corinthos? Is Alexis covering up Kristina’s involvement in Claudia’s car crash out of character or is it right in line with the Alexis we know and love? Martha Byrne is a great actress, but Jamey believes needs to be on As the World Turns and not a one note Port Charles villain. 



<br/><br/>One Life to Live was gearing up for the double wedding as Matthew blackmails Bo and Nora. Matthew seems to be channeling his grandfather Asa. Should OLTL turn Matthew into this generation’s Asa? The Tea, Todd and Blaire triangle has Luke and Jamey on opposing sides. Luke wants Tea with Todd while Jamey wants him with his Blair. If Crystal Hunt could act and didn’t appear bored with the role, Stacy Morasco could be a “hellified” role. Jamey believes OLTL should set up a Who Killed Stacy Morasco murder mystery since there are already more than enough possible suspects. It could be a blockbuster story.

			<title>DC #424: ABC OLTL Casting Shocker</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_424_abc_oltl_casting_shocker]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[It was the news that rocked the soap-o-sphere this weekend—One Life to Live's Patricia Mauceri (Carlotta) was fired, replaced by Sopranos and Guiding Light actress Saundra Santiago, after allegedly demanding re-writes of a scene showing her character as gay friendly. Daytime Confidential's Jamey Giddens, who broke the story, joins Luke, Regan and Karen from WUBS to discuss the shocking turn of events.In other One Life news, Robin Strasser revealed on her hotline ABC has offered her a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; deal, and the soap superstar proclaims One Life executive producer Frank Valentini will save daytime.



OLTL wasn't the only ABC soap with behind-the-scenes drama exploding all over the Internet this past week. All My Children star Beth Ehlers (Taylor) recently gave an explosive interview to Stardish Radio where she accused AMC head writer Chuck Pratt of &quot;writing camp&quot; and complained about allegedly having to &quot;hedge her performances&quot; due to being paired with real-life and reel life war hero JR Martinez (Brot) whom Ehlers claims &quot;is not an actor&quot;. The group sounds off on Ehler's interview.



On the General Hospital front, Regan slams ABC's flagship soap for the lackluster exit of Rick Hearst (Ric), while Luke and Jamey react positively to Sonny the Patriarch and Carly asking the Q's for help. Then Karen provides a helping of her juicy spoilers. It's an episode you won't wanna miss!]]></description>

<br/><br/>Jean Passanante gives a quote that has everyone scratching their heads, trying to figure out what she means. Is she talking in circles in order to not say anything? Is As the World Turns in a defeatist mode? Emily is obsessed with finding her eggs. Bonnie and Dusty kiss. Parker is beginning to realize what is going on with Carly, while&nbsp;Meg and Damian go on a date.



<br/><br/>Donna and Pam go to the set of The Price is Right. Was this a thumbs up or a thumbs down moment on the show? Find out which members of the Daytime Confidential gang enjoyed it and who didn't. Did&nbsp;the crossover just&nbsp;shed more&nbsp;light on the fact that The Bold and the Beautiful's&nbsp;ratings are&nbsp;diving?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Owen out for Jackie's money or does he love her? Ridge's drug problem&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;cause problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;



<br/><br/>Mark Hapka debuts on Days of Our Lives. The NBC soap's ratings keep going up. Is it still a contender because its fans are the most loyal in daytime? Stephanie slaps EJ.&nbsp; Jillian and Jamey react to Wally Kurth's return to Salem. Alison Sweeney is taking the reigns of her storyline&nbsp;and going with it. We are looking forward to the scenes where she finds out her daughter is alive. 



<br/><br/>Rafe finds out about Olivia and Natalia's relationship on Guiding Light. James Spaulding got off the hook.&nbsp;Melodie goes on a rant about an upcoming storyline involving Phillip. Is this the type of storyline that shows a TV&nbsp;icon respect? Should Ellen Wheeler go to another soap?



<br/><br/>Adam's goose is almost cooked on The Young and the Restless. Where can&nbsp;the&nbsp;storyline&nbsp;go from here?&nbsp;Adam and Rafe are going to have sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;Desperate for cash, Jill Abbott goes back to her roots. Nina digs into Cane's past and uncovers a secret.&nbsp;Lily is about to face a medical crisis.&nbsp;Chloe is impressing Melodie with her scenes opposite of Billy.

All My Children's &quot;who shot Stuart&quot; murder mystery is in full swing and
everyone and their mother are suspects. The story has given us several
good performances, but didn't Pine Valley's residents discover Stuart's
identity really fast? Chrishell Stause re-signed through September. <br/>
<br/>
James Stenbeck is returning to As the World Turns, but is it worth
having a super villain return when using the &quot;realistic&quot; filming
format. Rosanna was once a vegetable, now the once mighty Rosanna Cabot
of Cabot Motors is weeding vegetables. Why is it all these super rich
soap characters are losing their fortunes suddenly? Doesn't anyone use
an accountant any more?<br/>
<br/>
The Taylor and Ridge show on The Bold and the Beautiful doesn't work.
What does Ridge have going on to make women act like they do? Bridget,
Bridget, Bridget. Could Spencer and Katie be where this story is
headed, or will Spencer work his way through all the Logan women?<br/>
<br/>
The Kiriakis versus DiMera feud is heating up on Days of Our Lives, but
Owen isn't cutting it. Surprisingly Shelly Hennig is doing a really
good job in this storyline,&nbsp; a throw back to her parent's storyline.
Jillian makes a shocking revelation that moves her out of the EJami
camp.&nbsp; Is the Rafe and Sami romance a classic NBC soap plot twist?<br/>
<br/>
General Hospital has finally made it impossible for Jamey to defend
Sonny's claim on Michael. Even Jamey wants Michael to live with the
Quartermaines now. Michael waking up has re-energized Edward and
Monica. What is up with General Hospital fashion this week? Sex on a
couch isn't sexy, but it looks like the summer will have a lot more
love in the afternoon. Emma Samms returned as Holly Scorpio.<br/>
<br/>
CBS moved the Save Guiding Light rally fans out of the sight of&nbsp;
cameras.&nbsp; The Edmund murder mystery is heating up, even though there
aren't very many suspects. Jamey hopes Reva is the killer.<br/>
<br/>
The KAD killer story is wrapping up and it's provided some great scenes
for One Life to Live fans. Are Blair, Tea and Marty all still in love
with Todd, in their own way? Marty and Blair share a wonderful scene.
Natalie and Jared reveal that Starr's baby is alive to their family.
Where does Bess keep those black glasses so she can pull them out at
will? Is Rex a dumb character? <br/>
<br/>
Chris Engen quite The Young and the Restless. What does this mean for
the actor, the character of Adam Newman and for the show? Thom Bierdz's
return is confirmed as Phillip Chancellor III. What does this mean for
Cane and Lily? <br/>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's ABC episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Regan and J. Bernard discuss the latest in All My Children, General Hospital and One Life to Live storylines and news, including: </p>
<p>Adam&nbsp;was shot on All My Children. Everyone is a suspect, but did Adam deserve to die? How many guns are floating around Pine Valley? Did&nbsp;the whole thing&nbsp;look like an 80's B movie and was it to much? Babe's twin is running around town. We like the actress, but why did Babe need a twin? Stephanie Gatchet joins All My Children, as the DA's wife. Why didn't they cast her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of a core family?</p>
<p>Michael Corinthos III woke up, but did the ABC promo department ruin it for the viewers? Why was it Lulu who was there when Michael woke up? Why couldn't it have been Bobbie, when we've seen more of her in the past week than in the past six months. Carolyn Hennesy's Cougar Town has been picked up by ABC. Congratulation to her.</p>
<p>The Pussycat Dolls shook some booty on One Life to Live and&nbsp;Matthew Buchanan must have been happy. Todd, Tea, Blair and Marty were held hostage. Is One Life to Live trying to keep Roger Howarth out of the flashback scenes? Lola on LSD was fantastic. Why is that actors do their best job when they're being written out?</p>

because Noah's dad is returning to As the World Turns. Luke was just kidnapped by 
The Wonder Twins, can't Luke and Noah get a break?&nbsp;Meanwhile Lily Snyder is 
running around town like Little Red Riding Hood. Something excited Jillian on As 
the World Turns, now what could have made that happen?<br/><br/>The Bold and the 
Beautiful's Ridge Forrester is turning into the Six Million Dollar Man, facing 
down a private jet and running to stop Rick from marrying his daughter. Jackie 
and Owen got it on. Does it make sense for Jackie&nbsp;to be pushing Owen off? Now 
that Rick and Steffy are broken up she may be paired with Marcus. 
<br/><br/>Phillip Kiriakis was shot on Days of Our Lives and provided an 
opportunity for Shelley Hennig to shine or falter, which was it? The Kiriakis 
versus DiMera rivalry finally has a motivation. Could this be a good storyline? 
Jamey doesn't believe that Dena Higley is responsible for Days of Our Lives' 
improvements. He believes that Gary Tomlin is responsible. <br/><br/>Paul Anthony 
Stewart is returning to Guiding Light.&nbsp;Could his return usher back in the 
mob?&nbsp;BethAnn Bonner is joining the cast, but it isn't as Michelle. Who could she 
be and what is her motivation? Bill and Lizzie will be facing problems, leading 
up to their wedding. Shouldn't Bizzie be able to have some happiness until they 
say their vows? Frank needs to buy a clue. He's a cop and he can't even figure 
out what Natalia is thinking. <br/><br/>The Chipmunk Chronicles are over on The 
Young and the Restless. Ashley is going crazy, but why is she wondering around 
the woods? Gloria, Jeff and Jill are teaming up to take on the all powerful 
Victor Newman.&nbsp;Do they even have a chance? The one thing that might give them an 
edge is that - love her or hate her - Gloria's got hustle. ]]></description>

			<title>DC #392: Beth Chamberlin Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_392_beth_chamberlin_interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[As fans of the 72-year-old Guiding Light reel from news that CBS has canceled daytime's grande dame, one of the serial's most popular heroines, Beth Chamberlin is doing the work of her career. As tortured heroine Beth Raines Spaulding, Chamberlin is turning in one gritty, emotive performance after another as the character she's played on and off since 1989 grieves for her late, younger lover Henry Cooper Bradshaw (John Driscoll), while dealing with the return of the love of her life, Phillip Spaulding (Grant Aleksander), whom the last time he was in town, kidnapped her children in a manic spree. On today's episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast, Chamberlin visits with Luke and Jamey, offering her heartfelt reaction to news of GL's cancellation. Does Chamberlin see a future for Guiding Light on the web, or on cable?

<Br><br>

Chamberlin shares how the close-knit cast and crew of Guiding Light are handling being cancelled in the midst of a creative renaissance for the soap opera. She also reveals what it's been like having Aleksander, whom she calls one of her closest friends, back in Springfield, and discusses her real-life bond with actress Tina Sloan, who portrays her mother Lillian Raines on the show. Chamberlin also provides personal memories of three of the young women who have inhabited the role of Phillp and Beth's daughter Lizzie— Hayden Panettiere, Crystal Hunt and now Marcy Rylan, revealing her pride in the success each young woman found on and off the sudser. Did she ever think she'd see Panettiere on primetime hits like Ally McBeal or Heroes? Has she had a chance to see Hunt as Stacy on One Life to Live? What's her and Rylan's process for making Beth and Lizzie's mother/daughter connection come across so relatable? What about Beth's former stepdaughter Susan, is Chamberlin still in touch with Brittany Snow? What does she think about the young actress landing the lead role in the Gossip Girl spinoff Lily? She answers these questions and much more. The soap star also comments on the newest edition to the Spaulding family, breakout teen hunk Zack Conroy, who plays Phillip and Beth's youngest son James.

<br><br>

Then Chamberlin talks about her other passion, The Kettle Bell Way, the fitness regimen that finally helped the actress/wife/mother/author get the body she's always wanted, without having to stick to a strenuous diet or spend her life at a gym. This is a super-sized episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast Guiding Light fans won't want to miss.]]></description>

He's been cheating on Daytime Confidential. Lately, whenever 
he wants a hilarious, juicy, balls-to-the-walls podcast about the goings on in 
All My Children's fictional Pine Valley, he downloads an episode of the Pine 
Valley Podcast. On today's episode of Daytime Confidential, for the first time 
ever, Luke and Jamey sit down with the crazy, sexy Boricua pair behind PVP, 
Ashley Mendoza and Jordan Hudson!<br/><br/>Poor Luke has to hang on to his seat as 
Ashley and Jamey match each other, wacky soap character-voice-for-voice and 
Jamey bows down to soap's true historian Jordan, who actually recalls when Phil 
called Tara &quot;funny face&quot;. But it isn't all fun and games. This foursome, all who 
adore All My Children, spend plenty of time discussing just what has happened to 
this once stellar show. They talk about it's rich history and debate whether or 
not current head writer Chuck Pratt is actually worse than Megan McTavish. We 
could tell you more, but we don't want to spoil the surprises! This is truly an 
interview/round table you won't wanna miss! We could tell you more, but we don't 
want to spoil the surprises!<br/>]]></description>

			<title>DC #373: Castle Preview With Seamus Dever</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_373_castle_preview_with_seamus_dever]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Seamus Dever knows a thing or two about playing bad guys. After all, it was his 
character Dr. Ian Devlin who accidentally shot young Michael Corinthos on 
General Hospital. On ABC primetime's Castle, premiering tonight at 10/9C, Dever 
finally gets a chance to play one the good guys. He plays Irish cop Kevin Ryan, 
sharing screentime with Stana Katic, Jon Huerta and fellow ABC daytime grad 
Nathan Fillion (ex-Joey, One Life to Live), who portrays the title character, 
Richard Castle, a best-selling crime novelist suffering from writer's block, who 
decides to shadow NYPD detective Kate Beckett (Katic) for inspiration.<br/><br/>On 
this episode of the Daytime Confidential Podcast, Dever chats with Luke and 
Jamey about his role on the highly-anticipated midseason show, his first as a 
primetime series regular. Dever shares that although Castle is being likened to 
80's comfort food TV programs like Moonlighting or Scarecrow and Mrs. King, he 
sees more of a parallel between the series and the popular screwball comedies of 
the 30's and 40's, which he says sets Castle apart from other primetime crime 
procedurals. He also reveals whether or not he believes there is more pressure 
for the show to suceed considering ABC's recent cancellations of such 
high-profile shows as Dirty Sexy Money, Eli Stone, Pushing Daisies and Life on 
Mars. <br/><br/>Then Dever looks back with Luke and Jamey about his brief, but 
memorable stint on General Hospital. He reveals how he felt when he learned the 
antihero doctor he signed on to play, was being turned into a mob assassin, and 
what role the 2007-08 Writers' Strike played in that plot twist. Dever talks 
about what it was like working with Sebastian Roche, Tyler Christopher, Jason 
Thompson and Sarah Brown, whom he still considers a pal, and reveals if he and 
Nathan Fillion swap soap stories on the set of Castle. Dever also provides a 
sneak peek of Ready or Not, his upcoming Direct-to-DVD buddy comedy. It's an 
episode you don't wanna miss. ]]></description>

Would Belinda and Regan buy New York and Company clothing based on what All My Children stars are wearing?<br/><br/>The &quot;What if Maxie died&quot; episode was supposed to be really good. Did it live up to the hype? Many major characters were missing in this alternate Port Charles and would Robin really be a robot? Should we be thanking our lucky stars that General Hospital has Maxie and not BJ? Sonny and Jason have reunited. The romance of ages, Jason and Sonny has reunited, but does anyone care about the regurgitation of this &quot;dynamic&quot; duo? <br/><br/>David Vickers and the Buchanan's found out that David is Bo's son, but where does the show go from here? In the long run is it better that David is Bo's son or should he have remained Asa's long lost son? Belinda can't seem to decide whether or not she enjoys the Blair/Todd/Marty/John storyline or if she doesn't.<br/>]]></description>

when she announced she was making the transition from soap star to porn star. 
McCarty's new Direct-to-DVD adult film Flawless: From Beauty Queen to Porn Queen 
is on sale now from Vivid Entertainment. From TMZ, to Perez Hilton, to 
Entertaiment Tonight, everyone in Hollywood was talking about McCarty. On 
today's episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast, McCarty reveals all about 
her controversial career move to Luke and Jamey.<br/><br/>McCarty talks with DC 
about what led to her embarking on such an uncharted career path. She tells how 
she pitched the idea for Flawless, and served as a co-writer on the project. 
McCarty explains why she strove to make Flawless the type of adult film that 
appeals to women, as well as men. She admits to being nervous about how her new 
venture will be perceived. Will her Passions fans be receptive to Flawless? Did 
the current state of the U.S. economy and lack of roles for actors facing a 
streamlined pilot season and a potential SAG Strike play a factor in her 
decision to do porn? Most importantly, what would Passions' Edna (Kathleen 
Noone) have to say?<br/><br/>The soap vet shares her brief encounters with late 
Passions creator James E. Reilly, and weighs in on the poignance of Passions 
being cancelled shortly before his death. Is McCarty still in touch with any of 
her daytime costars like Galen Gering or McKenzie Westmore, both of whom have 
returned to soaps, if so, what are their thoughts on Flawless? Is McCarty afraid 
her adult film turn will prevent a possible return to daytime in the future? Her 
answers might surprise you.<br/><br/>The Miss USA 1991 then offers her perspect on 
the pageant mom phenomenon, made notorious by the Jon Benet Ramsey Case, as well 
as movies like Little Miss Sunshine and the upcoming WE reality show Little Miss 
Perfect. Finally, McCarty talks about her stint tonight, hosting ACME this Week, 
the popular sketch comedy show, that has boasted Ilene Kristen, Bryan Datillo, 
Tichina Arnold (Everybody Hates Chris) and Arianne Zucker as recent hosts. Will 
McCarty spoof her soap career? Her pageant career? Her porn career? All of the 
above? It's an interview you won't want to miss. Then for those of you in Los 
Angeles, head on over to Acme Comedy Theatre, located at 135 N La Brea Avenue, 
L.A., 90036, at 8 pm to catch the show. ]]></description>

Will we be tuning in for his return and will it be enough to help save the show? Is a Cyrus, Lizzie and Bill triangle worth watching or should it just be the Bill and Lizzie pairing?<br/><br/>The expected death of Brad Carlton has arrived. Will Colleen be able to hold her own against Victor and is it make or break time for her? The gang discusses where they would like to see Don Diamont end up. <br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

the unexpected news brought Luke, Mike, Jamey and Jillian together for a second 
Days of Our Lives emergency episode in the past six months.<br/><br/>They discuss 
the impact the firings of these veteran actors will have on the show. 
They talk about what this means for the remaining actors over forty still on the show and 
speculate who Ken Corday might axe next. They answer a reader's question of 
which is worse, to watch vets like Nichols and Evans get fired and keep the Days 
of Our Lives sets or have the show end up with a production model like Guiding 
Light. Luke asks if these latest firings could all be apart of Corday's scheme 
to get Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn back later in the year. Mike, Jamey and 
Jillian weigh in on if they think it is a realist possibility.<br/><br/>Fans of Patch and Kayla 
and Days of Our Lives call in with their reaction to the surprising firings and 
vent their frustrations at the decisions by NBC, Corday, Higley and the other 
executives at the show.]]></description>

unimaginable. For 13 weeks, GH's cable spin off told powerful, 
multi-generational tales of love, hope and mortality, all primarily set in the 
soap's historic hospital. The series was truly a Valentine to long term fans of 
GH and beautifully explained to newer fans why iconic veterans like Tristan 
Rogers (Robert), Finola Hughes (Anna) and Antonio Sabato Jr. (Jagger) are so 
beloved. While making GH: Night Shift a success was a collaborative effort, it 
was one novice soap opera writing's vision of telling stories featuring the 
characters he grew up loving, as well as introducing an Indian doctor and 
telling a gay love story, that set Night Shift apart. That writer was Sri 
Rao.<br/><br/>On today's episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast Luke and 
Jamey have a conversation with Rao, A Wharton Business School graduate who gave 
up his high-powered career in Manhattan, to follow his true passion for being a 
writer and director. Rao offers a refreshingly unjaded perspective about 
everything from the use of veterans in daytime to the politics behind gay 
storytelling.<br/><br/>Rao shares the process he and his writing team embarked 
upon in giving larger-than-life superhero Robert Scorpio an all-too-real 
Achilles Heel in the form of cancer. He reveals how supportive ABC 
Daytime/SOAPnet head honcho Brian Frons was in allowing him the freedom to tell 
his stories and talks about the other projects his Sri Rao and Company are 
working on, including a teen drama series inspired by his boyhood love for My So 
Called Life called What Goes On and the Bollywood thriller New York. Rao also answers the question fans of 
Night Shift are dying to know: Would he ever consider bringing his passion and 
prowess over to daytime?]]></description>

and SOAPnet blogger David Ozanich join Luke and Jamey on today's Daytime 
Confidential podcast to dish about their fun Likely Story series of teen books. 
Written under the joint pen name David Van Etten, Likely Story and its sequels 
All That Glitters and Red Carpet Riot (on sale July 9, 2009) tell the story of 
Mallory, just your typical teenage girl living in SoCal–except that her mother 
is an over-the-top soap opera diva and she's caught up in a hot love quadrangle 
with a teen soap hunk. After an explosive confrontation with the aforementioned 
diva (Mal's mom is so fab, her name is never mentioned!), Mallory blogs about 
how ridiculous and unbelievable the soap opera her mother stars on can be. Mal 
writes about how if she had the chance to write a soap, it would be realistic 
and find its drama in real life situations, in other words a likely story. 
Imagine Mal's surprise when the network gets wind of the blog post and decides 
to cancel their long-running daytime drama and greenlights a new teen soap based 
on Mallory's premise! Did we mention the soap the network cancels is the one 
Mal's Mommy Dreariest stars on?<br/><br/>You'll want to tune in to hear Van Etten, 
Levithan and Ozanich talk about how the Likely Story book series came into 
being. Learn how OLTL ultimately facilitated Van Etten and Ozanich becoming 
writing partners when the soap hired Ozanich an intern. Find out how at a Gotham 
party one night, Levithan, author of such teen classics as Boy Meets Boy and 
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (with Rachel Cohn) and editor of the smash 
hit The Babysitters' Club novel series for Scholastic, became intrigued by the 
idea of helping the pair bring Mallory's story to life.<br/><br/>You'll learn what 
it's like to write a book series with not one, or two authors, but three. Van 
Etten and Ozanich, while swearing none of the characters are based on anyone 
they've met in their soapy pursuits (Talk about a likely story!), reveal how 
their day jobs did in fact help color Mallory's world. Is Mallory speaking for 
every disgruntled soap opera fan with the impassioned rant she posts on her 
blog? What about when she actually lands her dream job? As Mallory quickly finds 
out writing a daily soap opera, while dealing with temperamental divas, a 
reluctant hottie leading man and network interference, isn't as easy as she once 
believed, are we getting a glimpse of what it's really like for the harried men 
and women who bring us our favorite soaps five-days-a-week? What about Van 
Etten, do he and other real life soap scribes ever log on to blogs like DC or 
message boards to read what we're saying about their work? If so how does it 
effect the writing process?<br/><br/>Ozanich, also an acclaimed playwright (The 
Lightening Field) shares how he's dealt with some of the sticky situations 
Mallory finds herself facing in the Likely Story books, such as having to let 
down friends who thought they were a shoe-in for a role in one of his dramatic 
works. Onzanich also runs hilarious, SNL-worthy interference for his pal Van 
Etten, when Jamey and Luke try to pry a few juicy spoilers about ABC Daytime's 
hottest soap out of the Emmy-winning breakdown writer. <br/><br/>Levithan, an 
admitted novice to the wonderful and wacky world of daytime soap operas, talks 
about how he brought to the table the basic tenets of characterization and story 
to help make even Mallory's more larger-than-life adventures ring true. The 
editor for Scholastic's PUSH imprint shares how the coming of age tale, despite 
its soapy flavor, is quite universal. Levithan also tells us how he feels about 
the success of the big screen adaptation of Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, 
and gives other writers a bit of advice on how to make their books readily 
adaptable for film. Speaking of adapting literary works for the screen, could a 
Likely Story television series or film project be in the works? Tune in to find 
out. Then go to Amazon.com to purchase the Must Read Likely Story and All That 
Glitters. You can also pre-order Red Carpet Riot. ]]></description>

On this very special episode of the Daytime 
Confidential podcast we discuss the winners of the 2009 Soap Opera Spirit 
Awards. Luke and Jamey are on hand to announce the categories, while TV Guide 
Canada's Nelson Branco reveals the winners, as well as the science behind why 
each was chosen. As if this wasn't reason enough to tune in, for the first time 
in DC history, both of the driving forces behind our favorite web series 
Imaginary Bitches, Eden Riegel (Bianca, All My Children) and her husband, series 
creator Andrew Miller are here together. You don't wanna miss the explosive 
confrontation between Emmy-winner Eden and Jamey when it's announced who wins 
the SOS for Outstanding Performer in a Podcast/Webisode/Soap-Related Series. 
There's nothing imaginary about it, these two get down right bitchy! 
<br/><br/>&quot;What did she do beside talk to herself?&quot; Jamey asks in a 
huff.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you Jamey for sucking just enough for me to squeeze 
through!&quot; Eden blasts back.<br/><br/>Andrew shares how many takes it took for his 
pal Greg Rikaart (Kevin, The Young and the Restless) to get the memorable m 
asturbation scene for his SOS-nominated IB guest stint down pat. Is Greg a 
method actor?<br/><br/>Eden is thrilled when two of her leading ladies, Elizabeth 
Hendrickson (ex-Frankie/Maggie, AMC; Chloe; Y&amp;R; Liz, IB) and Tamara Braun, 
aka Jamey's pick for the best Carly Corinthos EVER!! (Oh yeah, and she now plays 
Reese on AMC) are both presented SOS awards, but which one thrills Eden more? 
Should Andrew be worried? More important, should BAM fans spearhead a Rianca 
Kiss Ban?<br/><br/>Later in the episode, Eden speaks poignantly about All My 
Children and One Life to Live creator Agnes Nixon when she accepts the Irna 
Phillips Spirit Award For Outstanding Contribution To The Serial Art Form on 
behalf of the television legend. She also relays fond memories of the late 
Eileen Herlie, whose Myrtle Fairgate served as a surrogate grandmother to Binks 
and the rest of Pine Valley—except for Luke's beloved Greenlee (Rebecca 
Budig).<br/><br/>Nelson himself speaks on behalf of the late Beverlee McKinsey 
(Iris, Another World/Texas; Alexandra, Guiding Light) whom TVG Canada awarded 
one of two Douglas Marland Memorial Awards. The other accolade went to the late 
James E. Reilly (legendary head writer of Days of Our Lives and creator of 
Passions). Canada's biggest cheerleader (Yeah, yeah, yeah we get it, their syrup 
is better than ours and they produced Jennifer Finigan, big whoop! We lay claim 
to Britney Spears bitches... real and imagined!) asks Jamey to talk about the 
prolific writer's impact on the genre. This episode is a Must-Hear for soap fans 
young and old. ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On today's CBS and Days of Our Lives episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Mike, Jamey and Melodie discuss the latest in As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, Guiding Light and The Young and the Restless news and topics including...<br/><br/>A new day has dawned for Luke and Noah on As the World Turns after they finally had sex. Was it what the DC gang expected and was it worth the wait?<br/><br/>Things are shaping up to be really interesting on The Bold and the Beautiful as someone at Forrester is giving out secrets to Nick and Jackie. Is it possible that B&amp;B is making a comeback?<br/><br/>Marlena and John's days in Salem are drawing to a close, but it's sad to know we'll be watching Marlena push John's wheelchair into the sunset instead of them riding off into the sunset, happily ever after. Will their departure have Jamey voting with his remote or will his love for the show and the dedicated actors who remain be enough to keep him tuning back in?<br/><br/>Talk of Guiding Light's cancellation is picking up steam, but can an Olivia and Natalia pairing play a part in saving the show?<br/><br/>The DC gang reacts to The Young and the Restless Daytime Emmy prenominations snub of Eric Braeden and Melody Thomas Scott. Luke makes a surprising admission. <br/><br/>Conde Nast is reporting that CBS is dramatically slash the licensing
fees it pays out for the Bell and P&amp;G soaps. What impact will this
have? With Guiding Light already on a bare bones budget and production
model what else can it do if it loses even more money?<br/>]]></description>

Laura Allen joins Grey's Anatomy as McRambo's former love interest. <br/><br/>General Hospital enters the Internet age, streaming episodes at ABC.com.

Robert Scorpio via General Hospital: Night Shift and Daytime Confidential named 
him our Male Entertainer of 2008. <br/><br/>On today’s show Luke and Regan visit 
with Rogers about his amazing year and what it was like to portray Robert 
Scorpio, whose battle with cancer forced him and the fans to accept the reality 
that he was no longer the indestructible super-agent we’d grown accustomed to 
seeing on our screens. Rogers shares how seeing his former penthouse recreated 
on Night Shift was spooky and how it brought back so many memories for him and 
Finola Hughes. We ask Rogers about what it was like to work with Sri Rao and his 
popular writing team at Night Shift and get his thoughts on what role Rao may 
yet play in daytime. <br/><br/>The wedding of Patrick and Robin would not have 
been complete without Robert Scorpio to walk his daughter down the aisle so we 
talk to Rogers about how important it was for him to be a part of the momentous 
occasion, what his favorite moments from the wedding were and how sentimental 
the wedding was for Finola, Kimberly McCullough and himself. <br/><br/>Roger’s 
online series Tristan Rogers Unscripted gave fans behind-the-scenes glimpse into 
Night Shift that fans rarely see in daytime and he shares what it was like to 
get everyone to appear on the series. The economic crisis facing the country is 
having an impact on daytime and Rogers discusses can and needs to be done to 
help save the genre. <br/><br/>Rogers gives an update on the auctions at 
TristanRogers.com in support of the charity Project Cuddle and tells us how much 
money his fans raised for the worthy cause. <br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[We've given The Young and the Restless a lot of love lately, but in light of the fantastic way that One Life to Live has rebounded after the rapemance we thought we'd better record a special emergency episode to talk the great things going on at the ABC soap.<br/><br/>Join Luke, Jamey and Melodie as they discuss all the major storylines and the one or two things that One Life to Live still needs to work on. You're going to want to listen to this episode and watch One Life to Live. <br/>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_343_cbs_and_days_mike_goes_off]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On today's CBS and Days of Our Lives Daytime Confidential episode Luke, Mike, Jamey and Jillian discuss the latest&nbsp;news and recaps for As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, Guiding Light and The Young&nbsp;and the Restless including...&nbsp;



<br/><br/>Predictions on how much Grant Alexsander's return will bump ratings up or down. Melodie has an update on her spoilers from December. It's not Kim Zimmer's fault that Guiding Light has gone down hill, should she have to take a pay cut during this next go around? Could GL survive without Reva (Kim Zimmer) if she didn't accept pay cuts and left the show?



<br/><br/>As the World Recasts is systematically breaking Douglas Marland's rules on how not to wreck a soap and it's making it hard to watch so many new faces. 



<br/><br/>Who knew that all it took to have a successful fashion show was Donna&nbsp;in a&nbsp;knit bikini? Mike goes ballistic and isn't going to take it from The Bold and the Beautiful&nbsp;anymore. Kyle Lowder and Ronn Moss pop up on The Soup. Rick and Steffy are so cliche it hurts. 



<br/><br/>What is up with The Young and the Restless trying to put almost every boring character in one scene? Neil's wedding featured Karen and Victoria, not to mention a the character castrated JT all in one scene. Gloria discovers Katherine in jail. Jamey thinks that Maria Arena Bell has a check list of all of LML's debacles and is fixing everything one, by one by one.
<br/><br/>Could Daniel and Chloe be the next big Days of Our Lives couple? Jamey seems to think so. Imagine if Dena Higley was writing your life ala Stranger Than Fiction?

            <description><![CDATA[On the first ABC episode of 2009 Luke, Jamey and Melodie discuss all the latest in All My Children, One Life to Live and General Hospital news and recaps. <br/><br/>Lisa De Cazotte is now with All My Children as part of the production team and we discuss what type of impact she may have on Pine Valley.&nbsp; Jamey talks about how he doesn't agree with many people's opinion of the Bianca and Reese romance. Josh's heart goes to Kendall. Do we care or should Pratt get kudos for cleaning up the &quot;biggest&quot; mistake in recent All My Children memory? Melodie talks about how it isn't the same seeing Beth Ehlers on AMC as it was watching her on Guiding Light.<br/><br/>Soap Opera Weekly reported that Vanessa Marcil is back in discussions about returning to General Hospital. Would her return be worth it or has this &quot;I want to come back, no I'm not coming back&quot; tug of war wearing thin? Luke wants to hear the listener's reaction to Spinelli's new &quot;geekette.&quot;<br/><br/>One Life to Live is on fire with Alex Olanov, Dorian Lord, David Vickers and Asa's return and we can't get enough. David talks about going to the Ashram. Was this a nod to CBS rival for best soap The Young and the Restless? The gang discuss the payoff of having Marty get revenge on Todd and how One Life to Live has brought back true cliffhangers. <br/><br/>All this and much more on today's show. <br/>]]></description>

became a billion dollar empire that firmly cemented Zane as the Queen of 
Erotica. With a slew of raunchy novels and short story collections, complete 
with saucy titles like The Heat Seekers, Chocolate Flava and Dear Mr. G-Spot, 
this self-publishing sensation-turned-New York Times Best Selling 
author/publisher has proven she isn't bashful about giving her rabid fans the 
type of unapologetic, sexually-empowering, female-focused fiction they've been 
starved for in a sea of formulaic chick lit. Zane's books aren't about women 
finding Mr. Big, her heroines are more concerned with achieving the Big O, two 
or three in one night if they're lucky, and on their own terms.<br/><br/>This year 
marks Zane's foray into the world of television. Luke and Jamey caught up with 
the mulitasking mogul who has been busy penning scripts for her new Cinemax 
prime time soap Zane's Sex Chronicles, based on two of her best-selling books 
(Sex Chronicles: Shattering the Myth and Getting' Buck Wild: The Sex Chronicles 
2) airing every Friday at midnight. Zane shares with them how the cable network 
contacted her when they decided they wanted to bring urban erotica to 
television. She also shares exclusive news about her upcoming 
telenovela-inspired five-day-a-week soap opera for BET based on her novel 
Afterburn, as well as plans already in the works to turn yet another of her 
steamy reads, Addicted, into a major motion picture. It's an interview you won't 
wanna miss.<br/><br/>Check out Zane's Sex Chronicles every Friday at Midnight on 
Cinemaz. You can find Zane online at www.eroticanoir.com or her brand new social 
networking site www.planetzane.net. You can also be a part of he always topical 
discussions the author/entrepreneur has going at her official My Space profile

			<title>DC #327: Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn Fired</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_327_deidre_hall_and_drake_hogestyn_fired]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Mouths around the soap world collectively dropped this weekend as the 
unthinkable happened. The recently-renewed Days of Our Lives, fired its biggest 
supercouple Deidre Hall (Dr. Marlena Evans) and Drake Hogestyn (John Black). In 
this special episode of the DC podcast Luke, Mike and Jamey invite veteran soap 
journalist Nelson Branco (TV Guide Canada's The Suds Report) and former Days 
writer Tom Casiello to weigh in from the perspective of industry 
insiders.<br/><br/>Reactions to the shocking news are gauged from the panel, 
including: Branco, who reveals Days of Our Lives was the first soap he ever 
watched and how he first fell in love with the ravishing Hall even before 
discovering Andrea Evans and One Life to Live; and Casiello, who during his last 
few months on the soap before the Writers' Strike, was part of a team under 
Hogan Sheffer that was forced to script out the soap's &quot;Big Four&quot; (Hall, 
Hogestyn, Kristian Alfonso and Peter Reckell) due to their reported astronomical 
salaries and ultimately made the decision to kill of the wildly-popular 
character of John Black— since they were prohibited from using Hogestyn— only to 
see executive producer Ken Corday panic about fan response and order them to 
bring the character and actor back.<br/><br/>The DC gang also give their 
perspective based on their varying histories with the show. Jamey, who has been 
watching the show for the better part of three decades, reveals his dismay that 
lower level stars like Molly Burnett, Shelly Hennig, Josh Taylor, Thaao 
Penghlis, Leanne Hunley and Shawn Christian weren't cut first before the show 
even considered touching the Big Four; Mike, who watched in the early 80's and 
only recently tuned back in, conveys he still can't believe the show hired Josh 
Taylor, who once played Roman and Marlena's pal Chris Kositchek as a recast for 
Wayne Northrop's Roman, with Branco adding that move was a &quot;Jump The Shark&quot; 
moment for him as well before noting that Taylor is good friends with Corday; 
Luke, who has watched Days sine the 90's, speculates the brass could be moving 
to strategically weed out most of the show's veteran performers to repackage 
Days for an eventual sale to ABC or SOAPnet.<br/><br/>The discussion then moves to 
what this means for the future of Days of Our Lives and the genre as a whole. If 
an international superstar like Hall isn't safe, who could be next? Reckell? 
Alfonso? Sweeney? Taking it a step further, will other soaps start to think 
their top stars are expendable? Could we see a day when the headline is &quot;Susan 
Lucci Out&quot;, or &quot;Eric Braeden Axed&quot;? This is an episode of Daytime Confidential 
you don't want to miss.<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On today's CBS &amp; DAYS episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Mike, Jamey and Jillian discuss all the latest in CBS soap and Days of Our Lives news including...<br/><br/>The saviour of Guiding Light, Grant Aleksander, returns to Springfield to shake things up and help stave off the cancellation of the oldest soap. The gang give their take on what this could mean.&nbsp; <br/><br/>Lucinda's new love Brian kisses Luke and needless to say the gang can't help but feel sorry for poor Noah. The poor boy can't get a break. What is up with Carly and Lily putting aside their rivalry so quickly? It makes no sense but Jamey believes there is a Sex and the City connection. What or what is the point of fake Jennifer?<br/><br/>Word has it that Phoebe is being killed of The Bold and the Beautiful and Luke believes that Phoebe's funeral would provide the perfect time for Rick to sing opera, to which Jamey has a coronary. Brooke proved once again that no Logan does sex tease than her. Luke wonders how exactly Donna could confuse Eric and Stephanie. <br/><br/>Jillian is doing a happy dance over Erin Sanders leaving the role of Eden while Jamey is fantasizing of Vanessa Marcil in the role. Jeanne Cooper is hitting it out of the park as Marge and Katherine but does the &quot;death&quot; of Katherine really do anything but postpone the battle between Jill and Katherine? The gang talks about the idea of Andrea Evans returning to The Young and the Restless as Amber's mother. <br/><br/>Find out which Days of Our Lives actress Jamey thinks needs acting training wheels and how did Sarah Palin end up being talked about in relationship to Salem. The gang discusses whether or not daytime can afford to have young actors and actresses who don't know what they are doing on the front burner when so many soaps are in ratings decline. Nick is Trent's killer but why would or should any of us care? Luke is still enjoying Sami and Rafe but the others think that it is just recycling scripts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

			<title>DC #314: Bryan Dattilo Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_314_bryan_dattilo_interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Days of Our Lives’ Bryan Dattilo drops by Daytime Confidential to visit
with Luke and Jamey about hosting ACME This Week on Saturday October
25, 2008 at 8pm. <br/>
<br/>
Bryan talks about sneaking on stage with the General Hospital cast at
this year’s Daytime Emmys and how he enjoys taking dares on the Salem
set. <br/>
<br/>
We discuss what it was like for him to work with the James E. Reilly,
who recently passed away. Dattilo shares his memories of the storylines
that Reilly wrote for him and Louise Sorel and how Reilly provided the
peak of Lucas’ character and story development during the
Carrie/Austin/Sami/Lucas quadrangle. We talk about his current pairing
with Nadia Bjorlin’s Chloe and how Nadia and Brandon Beemer are
daytime’s Brad and Angelina.<br/>
<br/>
Bryan talks about his son Gabe, and how being a father has impacted his
onscreen role as a father to his and Sami’s son Will. He shares how he
coaches his son’s pee wee flag football team and how his son has picked
up on his father’s hip hop roots.<br/>
<br/>
We ask Bryan about the rumor that Lucas’ days in Salem may be numbered and he tells us what he knows about the rumor.<br/>
<br/>

			<title>DC #292: Victoria Rowell Interview, So Hot It Couldn't Wait For The 300th Episode</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_292_victoria_rowell_interview_so_hot_it_couldn_t_wait_for_the_300th_episode]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="ArwC7c ckChnd" id=":10e">






<div>


<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(Editor's Note</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">:<i>
This episode of Daytime Confidential featuring Victoria Rowell
(ex-Drucilla Winters, The Young and the Restless) was set to air as our
special 300th episode, however after completing the interview, we
realized we couldn't sit on it. Download now to find out why!</i>)</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">From her unforgettable debut in 1990 as Drucilla Barber the street smart niece of Mamie, the Abbott maid, on</font><i> <font face="Arial" size="2">The Young and the Restless</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">, through today as a world-recognized advocate for foster children and a</font><i> <font face="Arial" size="2">New York Times</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">
Best Selling author, few actresses in the history of daytime television
have made the kind of impact of Victoria Rowell. Who better then than
Rowell to help Daytime Confidential celebrate our 300th episode?</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rowell speaks to Luke and Jamey from Atlanta, GA, where she is busy doing press for her hugely successful memoir</font><i> <font face="Arial" size="2">The Women Who Raised Me,</font></i> <font face="Arial" size="2">as well as writing her juicy first novel</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">–</font><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Secrets of a Soap Opera Diva</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rowell talks about the experience of
being out on the road for the past 17 months &quot;pressing flesh&quot; with the
droves of fans who have adored watching her on the big (</font><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Distinguished Gentlemen, Eve's Bayou</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">) and small screen (</font><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Y&amp;R, Diagnosis Murder</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">) for the past 25 years.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">She talks passionately about her work
with foster children, via the foundation she started almost 20 years
ago, the Rowell Foster Children's Positive Plan (RFCPP). She elaborates
on how her other passion</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">–</font><font face="Arial" size="2">ballet</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">–</font><font face="Arial" size="2">helped
her to carve a niche for herself in the world as a 17-year-old girl,
fresh from the foster care system and why the RFCPP strongly utilizes
the arts to teach its students discipline.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rowell then provides a revealing and sometimes shocking glimpse into her time on</font><i> <font face="Arial" size="2">The Young and the Restless</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">,
where she rose to fame as the insurmountable Dru. She remembers how it
felt to work with the legendary Bill Bell, whom she shares she was as
&quot;thick as thieves&quot; with. She tells how the daytime pioneer allowed her
to help shape many storylines for the Barber-Winters family over the
years, including Dru's ballet storyline and the
Congressionally-recognized foster care storyline which helped win
Bryton McClure (Devon) the Emmy and how that spirit of collaboration
and trust died with Bell.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">She reveals how it feels to have never
won the Emmy herself (she was nominated twice and boasts 11 NAACP Image
Award) and why she feels a &quot;gang mentality&quot; exists among much of the
cast of daytime's number one show in terms of Emmy voting. She tells
how on set popularity is measured above actual talent when it comes to
making the all-important list of pre-nominees.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rowell goes on to respond to remarks made by former Y&amp;R costar Peter Bergman (Jack Abbott) in an interview with</font><i> <font face="Arial" size="2">TV Guide Canada</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">'s
Nelson Branco. Rowell reveals just why she feels Bergman is absolutely
right, she wasn't &quot;playing with a full deck&quot;, but not in terms of her
sanity, in terms of onset equality. </font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">She talks about what it was like working
opposite Michelle Stafford (Phyllis Newman) and why an onset violation
resulted in Sony Pictures Studios (which co-owns the CBS soap with Bell
Dramatic Serial Company) having to get involved to facilitate an
apology.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2">She answers a Daytime Confidential
reader's question about why Lily (Christel Khalil) doesn't seem to have
her mother's spirit and responds to questions about when and if she
will ever return to Y&amp;R. It's only fitting that this, our 300th
episode, is Daytime Confidential's most revealing, poignant,
jaw-dropping, interview</font><i> <font face="Arial" size="2">ever</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">. </font></p>

			<title>DC #273: Joseph Mascolo Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tvfanonline.libsyn.com/dc_273_joseph_mascolo_interview]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[News that <i>Days of Our Lives</i> supervillain Stefano DiMera wouldn't
be coming out of his coma caused fans of the iconic character and his&nbsp;
portrayer Joseph Mascolo to quickly mobilize. Soon after came the
announcement that the Phoenix would indeed rise again from the ashes
and more pointedly, from the coma Marlena (Deidre Hall) put him. <br/>
<br/>Recently Luke and I&nbsp; had the chance to speak with Salem's most
famous puppet master Joseph Mascolo, aka Stefano DiMera himself, about
his history-making run on <i>Days</i>. We find out what led to the
decision to put Stefano on ice and why Mascolo firmly believes it was
the fervent outcry of his friends (he doesn't like to use the word
fans) who demanded The Powers That Be thaw Stefano out.<br/>
<br/>In the revealing interview Mascolo weighs in on how he feels
Stefano should deal with his enemies-namely Marlena, his onetime &quot;Queen
of the Night&quot; and John, his ultimate Pawn. We find out if he's worried
about whether or not Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) has become the new
kingpin of Salem and if he believes The Phoenix should find love this
time around.<br/>
<br/>&nbsp;We also compare and contrast the role of Stefano with Mascolo's
memorable turn as Ridge Forrester's biological father Massimo Marone on
<i>The Bold and the Beautiful</i>. You'll never guess Massimo and Stefano's surprising link!&nbsp; This is an interview <i>Days</i> and <i>Bold and Beautiful</i> fans won't soon forget. We hope you enjoy listening to this industry giant as much as we did.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[On today's CBS and Days of Our Lives episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Mike and Nicki discuss the Max becoming a genius, Kate's illness and why Days of Our Lives shouldn't try to be General Hospital or Grey's Anatomy. Marlena is back and what will happen with this summer's teen storyline. <br/><br/>Do Heather and Adam on Young and Restless equal one character or are they both lacking even as a couple? Why are we watching such petty stuff as Jack and Nick arguing over tattoos? Why isn't Young and Restless going back to what it does best, Jack vs. Victor?<br/><br/>Texas Battle is making his mark on Bold and Beautiful but is his character really Donna's son? What if he isn't? The Forrester power struggle continues to make no sense and we have no idea why we should care?<br/><br/>Do you think that Guiding Light has become the G show? Our own Nicki seems to think so. Marcy makes a great drunk and at least she didn't sleep with Remmy. Our Guiding Light challenge. How many minutes per episode are wasted on scenery, singing and doing nothing?<br/><br/>Carly and Holden attend camp while Emily and Casey are sneaking around. The Hughes vs. Stewart rivalry is renewing and we're enjoying it. What is it about Janet that makes the character so hard to read? Does she have designs on Jack? Does she have designs on Brad? Or does she just fly by the seat of her pants and have no real motives? We're not sure.<br/>]]></description>

Marty is back and rumors abound about possible storylines and we're discussing them. Shouldn't John McBain have bled to death? <br/>]]></description>

We discuss the possibility. <br/><br/>Michael Damian is returning to the Young &amp; Restless for another visit and we discuss how the show seems to be going nowhere fast. Victoria vs. Adam, is this rivalry worth the hype?<br/><br/>As the World Turns' Brad Snyder found out he's a father and is a bit insecure while we're finally starting to see Katie mature. We're loving Emily and Casey and wonder if they could end up being a couple. If so does this play on the show's history?<br/><br/>It is being reported that Joe Moscolo has been fired by Days of Our Lives and we're discussing what impact this news might have on the show's ratings. Have the writers written Chelsea into a corner by making her barren? What does this mean for the long term viability of the character? Robo John testified about EJ and Sami's relationship and reveals that there might be more to their relationship than either realizes. <br/><br/>In case that isn't enough for you in this super-sized episode there is a fairly heated discussion about this year's Emmy Nominations.<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On today's show Luke and Jamey interview Patrick Cronen and Josh Folan of Amsterdam Artists, the production company producing the upcoming film &quot;Stray&quot; featuring All My Children's Jacob Young and Guiding Light's Marcy Rylan. <br/><br/>&quot;Stray&quot; is the story of 

Best friends Jude and Alex know everything about women, except how to make them stay. When the end of a relationship leaves Jude heartbroken, Alex vows to impart what he knows. As they pursue new romances, the pair soon discovers that the path to love and sex rarely runs smooth, and happiness comes at a price.

Fast-paced and witty, Stray is an “unromantic comedy? that explores the crude wisdom of single men. A realistic portrayal of twenty-something life, it is the first love story ever told completely from the male perspective.

Jay's thoughts on Tamara Braun's Ava. What is going on between Max and Nick.<br/><br/>As always, the topic of Gloria vs. Genoa city is a hot topic and we're wondering who TPTB might pair Felecia up with. Could it be Brad or Nick or do Jamey and Mike have other possibilities in mind?<br/><br/>As the World Turns' is selling off the Snyder farm but we're more worried about where the Walsh mansion and Lily's mansion are. Could this be a blatant plot point to bring Mike back into the picture? Julie Pinson joins As the World Turns but it doesn't look like it will be as Molly and we're a bit bummed.<br/><br/>The Bold and Beautiful's Susan Flannery finds herself smack dab in the middle of an AFTRA/SAG battle over the potential Actors Strike and our predictions of what is going to happen in the fast developing Pheobe/Rick/Taylor triangle and why is it that almost every character on the show is acting as if they are in heat? <br/><br/>It's been a few weeks and Guiding Light's new filming format is beginning to reveal the flaws in the system. We love the out door scenes but the indoor scenes need some improvement. Gus bit the dust in a motorcycle accident and we discuss Olivia receiving his heart.<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[TV Guide Canada's Nelson Branco joins Luke and Jay for an in-depth discussion of the soap industry, all the latest gossip, his interviews with Michelle Stafford and Katherine Kelly Lang, his Emmy prediction, how the industry could reinvent itself with additional programming and much more. <br/><br/>We talk about his belief that fans watch for the &quot;little moments&quot; and that soaps have been dumbed down. What is going on with the Proctor and Gamble soaps, including Guiding Light's use of its couples, the &quot;Nuke&quot; controversy and letting go of Martha Byrne.<br/><br/>Branco predicts that Victoria Rowell will return to the Young and Restless by April or May and discuss the rumors of Jeanie Cooper leaving the venerable soap.<br id="ok4j"/><br/>We learn why there isn't more diversity on the Bold and Beautiful, which character was supposed to have been gay, and who might soon appear as a recast Thomas Forrester.<br/><br/>Could Cady McClain's return as a ghost for May sweeps end up being more? The real reason why Susan Lucci lost the Emmy so many times. All My Children is using its veterans more often and how Nelson believe it is emblematic of the industry.<br/><br/>Will Days of Our Lives be canceled? Where could Brandon Beemer and Martha Madison pop up next. Might Kyle Lowder be returning to Salem and will Deidre Hall get a Emmy nomination.<br/><br/>]]></description>

today's show Tina from Primetime Pulse, Danielle, and special guests
Foxy and Jay join Luke to choose their first Performer of the Week for
2008 and discuss the latest ratings. Isn't it interesting that Days of
Our Lives has jumped from 7th to 4th and why is it that One Life to
Live's ratings are still the lowest when its the best soap? Could it be
that One Life to Live or ABC fans don't have a taste for really good
writing? Tune in for this in more on our first episode of 2008.]]></description>
