        <description><![CDATA[Weekly reviews of some of America's most popular or critically acclaimed scripted TV shows as well as discussion about other TV related topics such as show renewals, ratings speculation and events related to shows.

TV Weekly is hosted by a complete TV geek with a cute voice (she keeps begging me to erase that), an Indian chick who would surprise you with her knowledge of American TV and, once in a while, a special guest host or two.

We review TV shows like Gossip Girl, Mad Men, Chuck, Heroes, How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, My Boys, LOST, Grey's Anatomy, The Office, Friday Night Lights, Dollhouse, Private Practice, Ugly Betty, Damages, Scrubs, 30 Rock, Parks and Recreation, House and more. During the summer we will also review classic episodes of Veronica Mars, Firefly, Supernatural and more.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The very first episode of our podcast. This week we talked about Sit down, Shut up, Gossip Girl, Chuck, Heroes, My Boys, Greys Anatomy, The Office, Parks & Recreation, Private Practice, Dolhouse, Friday Night Lights. We also talk about some of the fun we had at the Dollhouse Paley Fest :)

We should mention that Leslie did most of the talking in this episode because we talked about a bunch of shows that she watches. Next week Minoti will be talking about more shows including House, Scrubs and others. Also,

*SPOILER WARNING* Minoti refrenced the previews for next weeks episode of Gossip Girl. If you haven't seen the previews and don't want to know what happens next week, you probably want to skip the Gossip Girl part (which is within the first 15 minutes of the 'cast).
