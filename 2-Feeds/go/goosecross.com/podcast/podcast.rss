            <link>http://napavalleywineradio.com</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>With New Year's Eve rapidly approaching, what better time for a crash course in how sparkling wine is made? We looked into the history of Champagne in episode 31, so we know that sparkling wine, like table wine, was discovered by accident. </p>

<p>Now, we recommend that you get yourself a glass of bubbly and settle into a comfortable chair as Nancy Hawks Miller, our Director of Education, takes us through the nuts and bolts of capturing those bubbles in the bottle.
<br /> 
<br />All of us at Goosecross wish you a very happy and healthy 2009. Cheers!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do old vines make better wine? When you see "old vine" on the label, do you assume that the quality will be higher or the flavor more intense?

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Every industry has its lingo and, being immersed in wine every day, we sometimes forget that our jargon isn't second nature to everyone else. In this episode, we try to clarify the meaning for some of the lingo that turns up in print, at social gatherings that include food and wine, in restaurants, or you'll hear as tasting room banter.</p>

            <link>http://napavalleywineradio.com</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We were fascinated by a recent report stating that 50% of family-owned wineries on the west coast will change hands by 2017. The findings of the survey and report were released by Rob McMillan of <a title="Silicon Valley Bank Wine Division" href="http://www.svb.com/svbank/wine/" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Bank</a>, and Deborah Steinthal of <a title="Scion Advisors" href="http://www.scionadvisors.com/" target="_blank">Scion Advisors</a>.</p>

<p>David Topper and I (Nancy Hawks Miller) were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to meet with Rob and Deborah and discuss what they learned. In this <em>second and final segment</em> we'll talk about the factors influencing owners to sell or pass the business along to the next generation and how greatly the industry has changed in recent decades.</p>
