In this GoGogh.com Radio Show, Neal L. Rowland, ITIL, PMP examines the Law of the Vital Few, or most commonly referred to as the Pareto Principle.  Listen to how this principle can be applied to many areas of your work, life, and play.  This is a principle often referred to in IT and project management, but is just as prevalent in Human Resources, Sociology, Economics, Quality, Agriculture, Sales and Marketing, and many others.  The same principle that points out that 80% of your web traffic seems to originate from the same 20% of sources is the same principle that Wal-Mart uses to decide which CDs to place on their floors. ]]>

I think it a very prominent retailer that sells goods on the web said that for an hour of downtime they could theoretically lost more than a million dollars in revenue.   Now that is a lot of money.  Not many people in a life time will make a million dollars.   So, you are in charge of device called a web server.  You need to find a way to make sure that you have at least 99.9% uptime.  You want to do it relatively cheap and also have something that is reliable.  Well NLB (Network Load balancing) comes into the picture.

                    <![CDATA[ In this radio show, we talk about how to deliver high service availability by eliminating or minimizing the causes of unplanned VM down time.      Unplanned down time is caused by the failure of a server. By virtualizing workloads, we can minimize or eliminate unplanned VM down time by using VMware High Availability clusters to reassign VMs to new hosts and boot them up - automatically whenever a physical host fails      By employing VMware Fault Tolerence, we can eliminate unplanned down time completely. Fault Tolerence duplicates a running VM in real time. If the host running the Fault Tolerent VM fails, the duplicate FT VM is simply scheduled to run on a secondary ESX server. The cut over completes with no loss in service and no loss of I/Os or data.       ]]>

Unplanned down time is caused by the failure of a server. By virtualizing workloads, we can minimize or eliminate unplanned VM down time by using VMware High Availability clusters to reassign VMs to new hosts and boot them up - automatically whenever a physical host fails.      By employing VMware Fault Tolerence, we can eliminate unplanned down time completely. Fault Tolerence duplicates a running VM in real time. If the host running the Fault Tolerent VM fails, the duplicate FT VM is simply scheduled to run on a secondary ESX server. The cut over completes with no loss in service and no loss of I/Os or data.       ]]>

If there are any flaws in the design, there will be flaws in the implementation, which is expensive to fix. ER model collect the Entity, Attribute and Relationship from given requirements to draw diagram. This design/diagram can easily be mapped to tables for implementation using any DBMS software.</itunes:summary>

This discussion focuses on how we can move from being an Alice in the scenario described by the Cheshire Cat of having paths that lead ‘somewhere’ to more of a Dorothy on a path which actually gets to the Emerald City.  Not that ITAM will lead us to an Emerald City, but these key points will help us to navigate some common risks in implementing ITAM while we have some fun along the way in a metamorphosis of sorts between fictional characters. ]]>

This show answers these questions and more, with useful tips that will serve you well when coding your own SELECT statements. Carl Eric Johnson discovered this by accident once, when he coded his first OUTER JOIN syntax and created a very long-running query.

One of the new features of Oracle 11g will eliminate this overhead and it can be implemented automatically with no changes to your code as well as being able to be manipulated for each and every session or call.
