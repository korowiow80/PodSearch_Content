<p>A recent TIME Magazine cover opens with a story titled &#8220;How to Die&#8221;. In this story, the author, Joe Klein, tells of how he managed to deal with caring for both of his parents after they fell sick in the latter part of their lives. He also shares the lessons that he learned about life and death while taking care of his elderly parents. </p>
<p>Like Joe Klein&#8217;s parents, we all have a set day when we are going to die. That date and time is unknown to us, but it is known to God. Death is a scary thought for many people, but yet, it remains an inescapable part of life. It is a part of life that we all, at one point or another, must face. Whether it is our own death, or the death of a family member or friend, we have or will have to come to grips with the inevitable reality of the end of life. </p>
<p>All people enter the world the exact same way &#8211; as infants incapable of taking care of themselves. And all people leave the world the exact same way &#8211; through death. Unfortunately, thousands of people die everyday without really knowing how to die. You may be asking, how to die? Charles H. Spurgeon said, &#8220;When the time comes for you to die, you need not be afraid, because death cannot separate you from God’s love.&#8221; Dear friend, God wants you to know that He loves you. You and I are but one step away from death everyday. All God has to do is lift His life-giving hand away from our bodies and we would drop dead; and there is nothing that any doctor or emergency technician can do about it. Dear Friend if you were to die today would you be ready and would you be sure that you would go to heaven? If not here&#8217;s how. </p>

<p>&#8220;Born This Way&#8221; is a popular song released by Lady Gaga in 2011. In this song, the pop artist expresses her view that the way you are now is the way you were born and nothing you or anybody else does can change that. The song has been used to promote the belief that homosexuals are &#8220;born that way&#8221; and that there is nothing they can do to change their lifestyle.  </p>
<p>It is true that there are some things about yourself that you cannot change. These are things you were born with. For example, you cannot change your race or skin color. You cannot change your DNA. You cannot change your natural gifts and talents. You cannot change who your parents are. However you can change your behavior. In other words, you can stop doing things if you wanted to.</p>
<p>In a sense, homosexuals are &#8220;born that way&#8221; because they are born with the perverted sinful nature that we all are born with that leads us to wrongdoing. For example, there are many heterosexuals who engage in sex outside of marriage which is wrong. The reason why we are born with such a sinful nature and a perverted mentality is because our ancestors &#8212; fathers, mothers, grandfathers, and grandmothers &#8212; passed their sinful, perverted nature down to us. Let me be perfectly clear, God did not make us with this sinful mentality, therefore God is not responsible for us being the way we are. Ultimately, we choose to do evil and we must take responsibility for the evil that we do even though we have inherited a sinful nature from our forefathers that makes it easier for us to do the evil that we do. It all began in the Garden of Eden when the first humans, Adam and Eve, decided to sin against God. Ever since then, every person born into the world has naturally had a sinful, perverted mentality.</p>
<p>Romans 3:23 says, &#8220;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&#8221; This chapter of Romans also states: &#8220;There is none righteous, no, not one&#8230;there is none that doeth good, no, not one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of our sins, we are all destined to spend eternity outside of the kingdom of God in a place of punishment and torment called Hell.<span id="more-546"></span></p>
<p>1 Corinthians 6:9-11 says, &#8220;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.&#8221; Notice this verse in Revelation 21:8: &#8220;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bible clearly states that homosexuality is an abomination. Leviticus 20:13 says, &#8220;If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.&#8221; Notice the word &#8220;abominable&#8221; in Revelation 21:8 above. Leviticus states that anyone who engages in homosexuality is committing an abomination, therefore that makes the person who is committing homosexuality an &#8220;abominable&#8221; person and, thus, that person is included among those listed in Revelation 21:8 who will be going to the lake of fire.</p>
<p>This sinful, perverted nature will prevent you from entering God&#8217;s kingdom. The good news is that you don&#8217;t have to stay the way you are. You can be born again. Simply because we are born with a sinful nature that is bent towards lying, stealing, cheating, adultery, homosexuality, immorality, etc., does not mean it is okay for us to do those things. Just because you are born one way does not mean that you have to live the rest of your life that way.</p>
<p>In the Bible, there was a man named Nicodemus who realized that he needed to do something about the way that he had been born. He went to see Jesus Christ about his dilemma. Do you know what Jesus told him? Jesus said, &#8220;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221; </p>
<p>You see, our sin and our sinful nature have separated each of us from God, our loving Creator. The only way for us to be reunited with God is to be born again. Nicodemus asked Jesus, &#8220;How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother&#8217;s womb, and be born?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Jesus was not talking about a physical re-birth. He was talking about a spiritual re-birth. A spiritual re-birth will cleanse us of our sin and give us a new nature &#8212; a nature that will help us to resist sin, evil, and perversion. How do we get this kind of nature? How can we be born again? Listen to what Jesus Christ told Nicodemus: &#8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&#8221; </p>
<p>That is how you can be born again &#8212; by believing on God&#8217;s Son so that you will not perish (or be condemned) because of the result of your sin, but will instead have eternal life. Do you want to believe on God&#8217;s Son &#8212; Jesus Christ &#8212; so that you can be born again and be given a new nature? Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<p>First, you must realize and admit that you are a sinner, and that you have broken God&#8217;s law. Your naturally sinful nature is the reason why you sin. The Bible says in Ecclesiastes 7:20: &#8220;For there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good, and sinneth not.&#8221; Romans 3:23 reads: &#8220;For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.&#8221; </p>
<p>Second, you must understand that there is a penalty for sin. The Bible states in Romans 6:23: &#8220;For the wages of sin is death&#8230;&#8221; As the verses we read just a few minutes ago stated, sinners cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Third, you must understand that you are on the road to hell because of your sins. Jesus Christ said in Matthew 10:28: &#8220;And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.&#8221; The Bible says in Revelation 21:8: &#8220;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Fourth, you must accept the fact that you cannot do anything to save yourself! Nothing you can do will change your nature. The Bible states in Ephesians 2:8,9: &#8220;For by grace are ye saved through faith: and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Fifth, you must accept the fact that God loves you more than you love yourself, and that He wants to save you from hell. Remember what Jesus Christ told Nicodemus in John 3:16, &#8220;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#8221; Jesus Christ is God&#8217;s only son who was sent into this world so that you and I can have a chance to gain eternal life. It is through Him that we can be born again.</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, the next step you must take is to repent of your sins, turn your back on your old, sinful, perverted nature, and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to save you and come live inside of you giving you a new nature. Pray and ask Jesus Christ to come into your heart and save you this very moment. The Bible says in the book of Romans 10:9, 13: &#8220;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&#8221;  &#8220;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8221;  </p>
<p>If you are willing to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to deliver you from your sin nature and give you a spiritual re-birth, please pray the following simple prayer: Heavenly Father, I realize that I am a sinner and that I have done some bad things in my life. I do not want to stay the way that I am. I want to live a new life like your Word promises to give through Jesus Christ. I want to be born again. So for Jesus Christ&#8217;s sake, please forgive me of my sins. I now believe with all of my heart that Jesus Christ died for me, was buried, and rose again. Lord Jesus, please come into my heart, take away my old sinful nature, save my soul and give me a new life today. Amen.   </p>
<p>Congratulations on doing the most important thing in life and that is accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour!</p>
<p>Believe by faith. Share the faith. And keep the faith! God Bless You!</p>

<p>In 2011, superstar pop singer, Lady Gaga, produced a hit song titled &#8220;Born This Way.&#8221; In this song, she expresses to her legions of fans that the way they are is the way they were born, and that they cannot do anything to change it nor do they need to try to change it. This song has been used to embolden young people who are homosexuals or who struggle with homosexuality. It subtly tells people who practice homosexuality, that they were &#8220;born this way&#8221;, and that there is nothing they can do to change this behaviour or lifestyle. Lady Gaga invokes God to support her view by saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m beautiful in my way / &#8216;Cause God makes no mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In some ways, when applied to a more proper context, some of the lines to this song are true. God did not make any mistakes when He created us. For example, there are some things that show we were &#8220;born this way&#8221; and that we cannot change. For example, we cannot change where or how we were born. We cannot change who our parents are. We cannot change our fingerprints. We cannot change our DNA, or our skin color.</p>
<p>However, just as there are things we cannot change, there are some things that we can change. We can change the way we behave. We can change our attitudes. We can even change our sexual behaviour. For example, if a person is a fornicator, he can stop; if a person is an adulterer, he can stop; if a person is a homosexual, he can stop that behaviour as well. If a person accepts Christ into his heart, he can become born again this way, and God can help him to stop sinful, unproductive behaviour. We cannot change how we were born physically, but we can change once we are born again.</p>
<p>In John 3, we are told of a certain man named Nicodemus who came to Jesus at night seeking to know more about Him. Jesus told him in John 3:3, &#8220;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221; Jesus knew that Nicodemus could not do anything about his physical birth, but he could do something about his spiritual birth. He had to be born again this way &#8211; through Jesus Christ. Like Nicodemus, I, too, had to be born again, and Jesus Christ turned my life around. Allow me to read a poem that was written by my daughter that describes what happened to me over 30 years ago:</p>
<p>I gave my heart to Jesus<br />
On a blustery, winter day.<br />
A man showed me Jesus loved me<br />
And I was born again this way.</p>
<p>I used to have no need for God<br />
Never minded what preachers say.<br />
But through the Bible, I saw the light<br />
And I was born again this way.</p>
<p>I could&#8217;ve continued on my sinful path<br />
And if I did, I&#8217;d have to pay.<br />
But God&#8217;s light shone down into my soul<br />
And I was born again this way.</p>
<p>You can give your heart to Jesus too<br />
No matter if you&#8217;re a liar, fornicator, or gay.<br />
All you must do is believe on Him<br />
And you can be born again this way.</p>
<p>Dear friend, all of us have sinned. We have all broken our fellowship with God. Adultery, fornication, homosexuality, lying, cheating, and every wrong thing that we have ever done in life has separated us from God. Yes, you were born with a sinful nature but you can be born again through Jesus Christ. Allow me to show you how:</p>
<p>In John 3, Jesus didn&#8217;t just tell Nicodemus that he had to be born again, He showed him how in John 3:16. It reads, &#8220;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For God so loved the world&#8221; means that if you are in this world, God loves you. No matter what you have done. It does not matter what sins you have committed or how messed up you are on the inside, God loves you. Nicodemus was a sinner too, but God loved him.</p>
<p>&#8220;that He gave His only begotten Son.&#8221; His name is Jesus Christ. He suffered, bled, and died on the cross for your sins and for mine, and He was buried and rose again. Jesus Christ died for all sinners &#8211; adulterers, cheaters, liars, homosexuals, murderers. Jesus Christ shed His blood so that all sins, whatever they are, can be covered once and for all.</p>
<p>&#8220;that whosoever believeth in Him&#8221;, the word &#8220;whosoever&#8221; means anybody at anytime. &#8220;believeth in Him&#8221; means to trust in Him, to depend upon Him, to rely on Him, or to have faith in Him for your salvation. You are not required to do anything else but believe on Jesus to save you.</p>
<p>&#8220;should not perish&#8221; where? in hell. Nicodemus was on his way to hell before he met Jesus Christ. I was on my way to hell before I met Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&#8220;but have everlasting life&#8221; in Heaven with God. Nicodemus is in heaven today. I am going to heaven and will have everlasting life there because I believed in Jesus and he saved me. You can do the same thing today &#8211; just believe on Jesus Christ and He will save you once and for all. He will deliver you from your past lifestyle and help you to live for him.</p>
<p>The Bible also says in Romans 10:9 and 13: &#8220;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved&#8230;. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear friend, if you are willing to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation, please pray with me the following simple prayer: Heavenly Father, I realize that I am a sinner and that I have done some bad things in my life. For Jesus Christ sake, please forgive me of my sins. I now believe with all of my heart that Jesus Christ died for me, was buried, and rose again. Lord Jesus, please come into my heart and save my soul and change my life today. Amen.</p>
<p>Congratulations on doing the most important thing in life and that is accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour! John 10:10 states, &#8220;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&#8221; Jesus Christ died so that you could live and you have life more abundantly right now by being born again through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Believe by faith. Share the faith. and Keep the faith! God Bless You!</p>

<p>The Bible asks this question, “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (Mark 8:36) You might be debt free or even financially successful; however, the Bible states that you are in debt to God. “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one&#8230;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;” (Romans 3:10, 23) Your debt to God must be paid. </p>

<p>Mothers are a very special part of God&#8217;s creation. The world would not be what it is today without mothers, especially those mothers who have faithfully and successfully raised their children with love, care, nurture, discipline, and in the ways of the Lord. A mother&#8217;s world is filled with the awesome responsibility to train up the next generation of young men and women to be servants and citizens of good moral character and integrity. Mothers take special pride in their children reaching their goals and accomplishing great things. We often see football players and basketball players thank two people after a major victory &#8211; God and their mother. Statistics show that nearly 50% of people consider their mothers to be the single most important influence in their lives. </p>
<p>Mothers are there to comfort, guide, and nurture; to love us unconditionally; to encourage us and support us; and to help create a positive environment for us to grow up in. Mothers also help to shape their children&#8217;s worldview of God, themselves, and other people. Motherhood is the single most important contribution that a woman can make to society. When God Himself sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth as a baby, God made sure He had a mother to take care of Him. Above and beyond all of the cooking, cleaning, playing, story-telling, and all the things that many mothers do, the most important thing a mother can do for her children is pray for them. Many children have turned out to be great servants of the Lord because their mothers made it her business to pray for them. </p>
<p>Susannah Wesley, the mother of the great preachers John and Charles Wesley is said to have prayed two hours each day for her children. St. Augustine&#8217;s mother, Monica, prayed that her son would serve God and he later become bishop of Hippo in North Africa. Hudson Taylor&#8217;s mother prayed that God would use her son one day and he turned out to be the greatest missionary to China. We could go on, but down through hundreds of years, mothers have taken to their prayer closets to pray for their children. These Godly mothers prayed earnestly for their children, God heard them and answered their prayers. These mothers had a deep and abiding relationship with God. They knew God for themselves and they made sure that their children knew Him as well. </p>
<p>If you are a mother and you do not know Jesus Christ for yourself, why not get to know Him on this Mother&#8217;s Day? It is the best thing you can do for yourself and your children. Allow me to show you how:</p>

<p>At some point in life, everybody finds himself or herself searching for something. </p>
<p>When we are young, we search for meaning and purpose. We search for the perfect job or the right occupation that will make us feel fulfilled. We search for a husband or wife to spend our lives with. We search for the best college or university to attend. We search for the best way to live a healthy and long life. </p>
<p>The British singer and songwriter Melanie Chisolm said, &#8220;I just feel, in life, I&#8217;m searching for something I can rely on, something that&#8217;s constant and something that&#8217;s going to guide me through.&#8221; These words describe the greatest search that any of us will ever undertake. </p>
<p>If you are like Melanie Chisolm, and you are searching for something you can rely on, something that&#8217;s constant, and something that will guide you through life, I can honestly tell you that all of those things can be found in Jesus Christ. If you find Jesus Christ, you will have all three of those things. </p>

<p>In Acts 9, the Bible relates to us the conversion of Paul. Verses 1-7 reads, &#8220;And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.&#8221; </p>
<p>Paul, one of the greatest writers in the Bible, met Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus which is located in Syria. Syria is going through a very difficult time right now and many of the people there are looking for a transformation just like Paul had. </p>
<p>The uprising in the Arab nation of Syria began on January 26, 2011. For over a year, this ongoing internal violent conflict has waged on where protestors are demanding that the current President Bashar al-Assad resign from power so that nearly 50 years of Ba’ath Party rule can end. Since the violence and protests started, the Syrian army has been deployed to try to stop the uprising, several cities have been besieged, and to date, nearly 16,000 people have been killed including over 500 children. Reports say that an additional 400 children have been arrested and tortured in Syrian prisons. To try to escape the ongoing violence, thousands of Syrian refugees have fled the country. The Arab League, United States, European Union, and other countries have condemned the violence and have attempted to develop a peace plan and ceasefire for the country. To date, none of that has worked the violence has not ceased. Assad is still in power and thousands of Syrians continue to long for a Saviour to deliver them. </p>
<p>My friend, apparently, no one on earth is choosing to stop the violence, the fear, and the anguish that is spread abroad across Syria. Apparently, no one on earth is choosing to stop the bloodshed or wipe away the tears of the mothers whose children have been killed or lost. Dear friend, the only hope for Syria and the only hope for this sin-cursed world is Jesus Christ. Syria and much of the world is in constant turmoil right now over multiple issues, and the truth of the matter is, the government is powerless, the president of the United States is powerless, and the politicians and other governmental leaders are powerless. The only hope for peace in Syria and in the world is for the Prince of Peace to come. Jesus is the Saviour of the world and He wants to save every person who wants to be saved right now. And like the Apostle Paul saw the bright light of Jesus that day on the Damascus road, you need to see the bright light of Jesus as well. </p>

<p>Right now, the United States is in a presidential election season. Two men are running for the highest office in the land. Your family and friends have probably asked you &#8216;who will you vote for?&#8217; Pundits want to know who you will vote for. Pollsters want to know who you will vote for. And of course, the candidates simply say, &#8216;vote for me.&#8217;</p>
<p>But right now, I want to let you know that there is an election going on that is more important than the presidency of the United States. In this election, two candidates are vying for the highest place in your heart. And yours is the only vote that matters.</p>
<p>One candidate promises you pleasure right now. But he doesn&#8217;t tell you that there will be pain later. This candidate will let you stay right where you are in life and let you keep on doing whatever you want to do. This smooth-talking candidate looks sharp and sounds smart. He will tell you whatever you want to hear to get you to cast your vote for him. This candidate&#8217;s name is Satan.</p>
<p>The other candidate tells you upfront that life will not be a bed of roses for you. But after your life, you will spend eternity in a place full of peace and harmony. This candidate will change your life and rock your world. He may not tell you everything you want to hear, but at least he will tell you the truth. This candidate&#8217;s name is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Both of these candidates want your heart. Both of these candidates want your soul. I want to encourage you to cast your vote for Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>On April 14, 1912, one of the greatest maritime disasters in history occured. Just a few days before, The Titanic &#8212; a ship that was declared to be &#8220;unsinkable&#8221; &#8212; set sail from England on its way to New York City. The Titanic was the greatest ship ever built up to that point in history. This was her maiden voyage. 2,223 people were on board for the celebratory journey. Only 710 people would survive.</p>
<p>On the night of April 14, 1912 a lookout cried out &#8220;Iceberg! Iceberg ahead!&#8221; But it was too late. The ship was going too fast. The partially submerged iceberg ripped into the hull of the Titanic which caused the bottom of the ship to flood with water. The sad thing about this event was that in the twelve hours preceding the crash, the Titanic had received five warnings of icebergs. The sixth warning from the lookout came too late for anyone to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Many people on the ship did not realize the tragic magnitude of the event. They still believed the &#8220;unsinkable&#8221; Titanic would sail on. Some people continued eating and drinking. Others retired to their beds. Some even went on deck to have snowball fights and to dance. However, reality soon set in &#8212; the reality that the ship would indeed sink and the worse reality that there were not enough lifeboats on the Titanic. The builders of the Titanic had decided not to include as many lifeboats as they were supposed to. After all, the Titanic wasn&#8217;t supposed to sink.</p>
<p>So many of us live our lives like the creators and passengers of the Titanic. We think that we are invincible, that our plans are waterproof, and that things will go our way. It would be alright to think this if we were perfect. But we&#8217;re not perfect. Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve all done bad things in our lives. And each of us is on a ship &#8212; a ship called Sin. Oh, yes, sailing with Sin is fun and enjoyable for a little while, but soon we will awaken to the reality that Sin is a sinking ship and that if we stay on it, we will suffer and die.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s the solution? A lifeboat, of course. Because God knew that we would need to be saved from Sin, he sent his Son Jesus Christ to be our lifeboat. The Bible says in John 3:16: &#8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#8221; 1,514 people perished in the icy waters of the Northern Atlantic because they didn&#8217;t have a lifeboat to get into. Those who had lifeboats were saved. That&#8217;s why God sent his Son &#8212; to save us from sin and the punishment of sin which the Bible says is death.</p>

<p>Today, people all around the world are commemorating the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. From visiting the ship&#8217;s birthplace in Belfast to hosting public exhibitions to walking through the Titanic Memorial Garden, many people all around the world are finding a way to remember what happened on that tragic day 100 years ago.</p>
<p>The Titanic was on its maiden voyage in April of 1912. The biggest, most luxurious ship you could ever imagine was built and it was ready to grace the ocean. Not only was it luxurious, but it was by far one of the largest vessels ever made. Every safety feature known at that time was on the Titanic. It was a fast vessel and to many people, it was considered to be unsinkable. In fact, one of the ship&#8217;s designers said &#8220;Not even God could sink the Titanic.&#8221; On a quiet, peaceful April morning in 1912, the luxurious ship set out from Liverpool, England headed to New York Harbor. It carried 2,223 people including some of the wealthiest people in the world. Passengers from all around the world were on board the Titanic for its maiden voyage. They enjoyed good food, fine entertainment, and many other pleasures that the ship offered. However, nearly halfway through its maiden voyage, the ship hit an iceberg and immediately started to sink. As the crew raced to get people into lifeboats, they were only able to get 710 people off the ship. Within two and a half hours, the entire ship was under water, everybody else on board drowned. This day started out like any other day, but when the Titanic sank, it resulted in the deaths of 1,514 people. This sinking of the Titanic is considered one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.</p>
<p>Dear friend, the people on the Titanic did not know that the Titanic would sink on that day. They were simply going about their business, enjoying their family and friends and the fine pleasures that the Titanic offered. The sinking of the Titanic shows us clearly the uncertainty of life and why we all must be ready to meet Jesus Christ at anytime. Jesus tells a parable in the book of Luke of a rich man who has many possessions and he says to his soul, &#8220;Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.&#8221; Luke 12:20 states, &#8220;But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?&#8221; When the crew members of the Titanic realized they had hit an iceberg, they immediately began sending out warnings to the passengers. Those who took heed to the warnings were saved. Those who ignored the warnings were not saved. Dear friend, you may feel like your life is sinking in sin, but you can be saved if you heed the warning and the call of Christ. Right now, Jesus Christ is inviting you to believe on Him today, to respond to His call, to let Him into your heart and to allow Him to save you from sin and hell. Do you know Jesus Christ for yourself today. If not, allow me to show you how.</p>
