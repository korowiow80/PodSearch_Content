      <itunes:summary>MEETS		
Emery Wang
Proving atheism to be false wouldn&apos;t prove Christianity to be true.
Absolute truth		
Atheism or agnosticism? Is atheism even possible?		
You cannot know all evidence for or against God, therefore you cannot say there is no evidence for God.
You could claim that there is no gold in China, but the claim could not be proven to be true unless you have searched the entire country yourself. Pink unicorns / Screaming Blue Ants.
Do children need punished for doing wrong? Focusing on God only being good (flood, disaster, etc.) seems to hide that.
He is also righteous and just? Good isn&apos;t good without righteousness.
Losing religion vs. losing a relationship		
Persecution is inevitable for true Christianity (Paul writing to Timothy - 2 Timothy 3:12)

CLOSING		
Prayer Requests		
Pray for Emery and other atheists, as they continue to attempt at proving God to be useless in their lives. Also pray that we may be more bold, relying on God to show us how to love them

Everyone can adjust their schedule. Making time is not the problem.
The problem we all have is that in order to put our faith into practice we must come to terms that God is God - priority number one.
What if we had to keep our other gods a secret?			
My challenge to you is that God is well worth being excited about. There&apos;s nothing else that desires our praise like He does!

Background and purpose of your podcast		
Give me a few topics you both see yourself disagreeing on the most and why?
Do you give your children rules and expect them to obey?
By marrying someone are we simply sharing life or do we find ourselves fulfilled when with someone else?
What are your beliefs in adultery?		
Homosexuality is obviously an abomination in God&apos;s eyes, how do you see it? Leviticus 20:13 and Romans 1:27
Have you found meaning in life without any point of reference or assistance?
What do you take from the global response of Christianity over time?
Richard Dawkins (Wired magazine) is saying that atheism is a movement, with near 30 million non-religious people in the US. Why hasn&apos;t it grown until recently?
Why do atheists, like Dawkins, believe Christians are less intelligent?
Dawkins seems angered that an atheist hasn&apos;t and couldn&apos;t get elected to Congress?
Albert Einstein - &quot;Uncertainty Principle&quot; was God does not play dice - Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.
