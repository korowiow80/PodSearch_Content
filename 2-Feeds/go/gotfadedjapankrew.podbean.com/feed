		<itunes:summary>Ep87 Got Faded Japan Podcast
Johnny spies a train turd while Shank speaks of shrunken people and the shrinking population. Fattest prefectures rankings released, man beats father to death while changing diaper, man pranks police 109 times…in a row, mother dies and son stabbed multiple times in murder-suicide case, middle-schooler dies while huffing butane, enough potassium cyanide to start a culling goes missing, and vending machine their foiled by cops? Nope, by snow.
The Got Faded Japan Podcast gives listeners a glimpse of the seedy side of Japan's news, culture, politics, parties, and all around mischief and mayhem. Hosted by Johnny and Shank who add their own opinions and otherwise drunken bullshit to the mix.  Send us an email on FB/twitter Got Faded Japan, to gotfadedjapan@yahoo.co.jp or go to gotfadedjapan.com to buy a t-shirt to support the show.
