<p>I heard Henry as he was walking to his car and wondered why he was so down on himself. Henry is a hard worker, I see him at least once a week hitting balls on the practice range. I&#8217;ll be going to the first tee with a Golf Made Simple class to do our on-course Instruction and there will be Henry banging balls on the practice range - one after another – &#8220;looking for the magic&#8221;.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow – do we have some exciting news for you! Today we’re proud to announce Golf Made Simple’s newest location at <strong><a title="South Florida Golf Schools" href="http://golfmadesimple.podbean.com/admin/www.GolfMadeSimple.com/South-Florida-Golf-Schools-Instruction.html" target="_blank">Heron Bay Golf Club in South Florida</a> right between Boca Raton and Ft. Lauderdale!</strong></p>
<p>After years of being in Northeast Florida, followed 4 years ago by an expansion of GMS to Southern California, then last year with the opening of our Gulf Coast of Florida location in the Tampa area, and then earlier this year into Lake Tahoe, California – we’re now ready to give you South Florida!</p>
<p>If the name Heron Bay Golf Club ‘rings a bell’ – it was formerly known as The TPC at Heron Bay – which held the <strong>PGA Tour’s Honda Classic Golf Tournament for 6 years from 1997 to 2002.</strong> With winners such as Vijay Singh, John Daly and Lee Janzen – the Honda Classic was a formidable tournament held the week after Doral and the week before Arnold Palmer’s tournament in Orlando! So you know that the quality and conditioning of this golf course, along with the practice facilities - has to be top-notch!

Marc starts to speak about what the best Golfers do to become more consistent and Henry is eagerly awaiting his answer.</p>
<p>We have done what could be termed as a brisk amount of <a title="Golf School Rates and Dates" href="http://www.golfmadesimple.com/rates-dates.html" target="_blank">Golf Made Simple Gift Certificates</a> that are being given to loved ones, business associates and good friends. I can just imagine the excitement when the Golfer receiving their Certificate for 3 days with Golf Made Simple in either Florida or California – opens the envelope to see what they’ve received.</p>
<p><a title="Golf School Testimonials" href="http://www.golfmadesimple.com/golf-schools-testimonials.html" target="_blank">Testimonials from GMS Golfers</a> that have continued to improve dramatically after visiting Golf Schools by Golf Made Simple!</p>
