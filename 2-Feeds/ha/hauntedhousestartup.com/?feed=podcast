		<itunes:summary>Here is our fifth haunted house podcast. In this episode we go over what it takes to haunt a cornfield. You will learn the differences in having an outdoor haunt compared to an indoor haunt along with many other tips. On this episode I have Drew Dominguez who is a friend who I have been working with for about 2 years now. We recently went to the cornfield maze convention where Drew gave a presentation on haunted cornfields. Below is an image of what we discussed in the podcast as far as layout of a simple cornfield haunt would look like.

		<itunes:summary>(http://hauntedhousestartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/haunted-house-how-to.jpg)Welcome to our third Haunted House Startup podcast. In this episode we cover what we have been up to recently and then jump right into this episodes theme which covers twisted fairy tales and more. Our Haunt Business section dives into some social media topics and then Haunt Safety covers health concerns and the need and reasoning  behind having disclaimers posted all over your haunt. Finally we touch on Haunt World Magazine and talk briefly about our current survey that is up on the site and once again ask for you support by taking a minute or two out of your day to answer 5 simple yes or no questions so we can get feedback on what everyone who follows us is interested in learning more about. If you have any topics you would like to hear us cover please leave a comment and we will get it added to the list.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>(http://hauntedhousestartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/haunted-house-how-to.jpg)This is our second podcast and we have a new layout for it so there is a little more structure to it. We will cover the same segments for the next couple episodes to see how it runs and how people like it and then try a new one out if needed. For now we will cover some current news then move on to a haunt theme and ideas segment where we will pick a theme and cover some ideas for rooms, props, actors and decorations. After that I will cover a haunt business topic then a safety topic. The final segment is a haunt review segment where we will talk about a product of some sort rather a book or dvd. Then we will cover anything we may have that does not fit anywhere else and that will conclude the podcast. If any of you have an idea for another segment or field for us to talk about let us know and we will see what we can do.</itunes:summary>
