&#8220;It&#8217;s wondrous what a hug can do.
A hug can cheer you when you&#8217;re blue.
A hug can say, &#8216;I love you so,&#8217;
Or &#8216;Gee, I hate to see you go.&#8217;
A hug is &#8216;Welcome back again.&#8217;

<p>&#8220;A professor stood before his class and wordlessly picked up a large empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks about 2&#8243; in diameter.</p>
<p>He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.</p>
<p>The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the rocks.</p>
<p>He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.</p>
<p>The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now,&#8217; said the professor, &#8216;I want you to recognize that this is your life. The rocks are the important things &#8211; your family, your partner, your health, your children &#8211; anything that is so important to you that if it were lost, you would be nearly destroyed.</p>
<p>The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car.</p>
<p>The sand is everything else. The small stuff.</p>
<p>If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.</p>
<p>Take care of the rocks first &#8211; the things that really matter. The rest is just sand.&#8217; &#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Several years ago I was at a train station in Amsterdam waiting in line to buy a ticket. As I stood there I saw a young homeless man asking people for money so he could buy breakfast. It was early in the morning and most of the travelers simply ignored the young man or gave him a dirty look.</p>
<p>There was one exception though &#8211; an older, well-dressed businessman who looked as though he was from the middle-east. When approached by the panhandler, the gentleman looked straight into his eyes and quietly asked ‘How much will you need?’ I couldn&#8217;t hear what the young man said but watched as the older man pulled several bills from his wallet and calmly placed them in the young mans&#8217; hands.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if the young man actually used this money for breakfast or for some other purpose. What I do know is that I witnessed two completely different reactions to the same situation. I saw people who were either afraid or annoyed or distrustful. And then I saw this man who was not afraid and treated the homeless man as though he were a brother. I decided then and there that, even though we have to be careful in this world, I would rather be like him.</p>
<p>May this day bring us many opportunities for kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One day a father and his rich family took his young son on a trip to spend a few days on a farm of a very poor family with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be. When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, &#8216;How was the trip?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Very good, Dad!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Did you see how poor people can be? And what did you learn?&#8217; the father asked.</p>
<p>The son answered, &#8216;I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden; they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars. Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.&#8217;</p>
<p>When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.</p>
<p>His son added, &#8216;Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!&#8217;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it true that it all depends on the way you look at things? If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude toward life, you&#8217;ve got everything!</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t buy any of these things. You can have all the material possessions you can imagine, but if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing&#8221;</p>

The Law of the Garbage Truck!
I hopped in a taxi and we took off for the airport.
We were driving in the right lane
when suddenly a black car jumped out
of a parking space right in front of us.
My taxi driver slammed on his brakes,

<p align="center">The Law of the Garbage Truck!<br />
I hopped in a taxi and we took off for the airport.<br />
We were driving in the right lane<br />
when suddenly a black car jumped out<br />
of a parking space right in front of us.</p>
<p>My taxi driver slammed on his brakes,<br />
skidded, and missed the other car by just inches!<br />
The driver of the other car whipped his head around and<br />
started yelling at us.<br />
My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy.<br />
And I mean, he was really friendly.</p>
<p>So I asked, &#8216;Why did you just do that? This guy<br />
almost ruined your car and sent us to the hospital!&#8217;<br />
This is when my taxi driver taught me<br />
what I now call, &#8216;The Law of the Garbage Truck.&#8217;<br />
He explained that many people are like garbage trucks.<br />
They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment.<br />
As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it<br />
and sometimes they&#8217;ll dump it on you.<br />
Don&#8217;t take it personally.  Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on.<br />
Don&#8217;t take their garbage and spread it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that successful people do not let<br />
garbage trucks take over their day.<br />
Life is too short to wake up in<br />
the morning with regrets, so ..<br />
&#8216;Love the people who treat you right!<br />
Pray for the ones who don&#8217;t!&#8217;</p>

10 Ways on HOW TO STAY YOUNG
~ George Carlin
1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctors worry about them. That is why you pay &#8216;them.&#8217;

<p>2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.</p>
<p>3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle</p>
<p>4. Enjoy the simple things.</p>
<p>5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath.</p>
<p>6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person, who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be A LIVE while you are alive.</p>
<p>7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it&#8217;s family, pets, music, whatever. Your home is your refuge.</p>
<p>8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.</p>
<p>9. Don&#8217;t take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, even to the next county; to a foreign country but NOT to where the guilt is.</p>
<p>10. AND ALWAYS REMEMBER:<br />
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.</p>

<p>Today’s tip-</p>
<p>When you see a butterfly, our thoughts may be…what a beautiful creature! How wonderful to fly about freely, bringing beauty to whomever’s path it crosses. We don’t think about the journey that butterfly took to become this awesome display of nature.</p>
<p>This butterfly was once a creeping and colorless caterpillar. Who, may or may not survive harsh weather, a landscaper’s freewheeling tool or just simply the process it must undergo to become that beautiful butterfly.</p>
<p>And that cocoon- some say how they wish they could be in a cocoon. They see it as a “safe” place, a warm and comforting place. But, like the butterfly of this quote, it could also be construed as a dark place, a lonely place, wondering how long before the “light” shines through.</p>
<p>The hope of becoming that beautiful butterfly can inspire. If a little caterpillar can transform into a beautiful butterfly- what are our possibilities? The “transformation” part may be difficult. It may be a quick transformation, it may take longer.</p>
<p>BE PATIENT! Like a butterfly, there is beauty in all of us. When you shed your cocoon and spread your beautiful wings, the world will be waiting.</p>

<p>Junior high school students in Chicago were studying the Seven Wonders of the World. At the end of the lesson, the students were asked to list what they considered to be the Seven Wonders of the World.</p>
<p>While gathering the papers, the teacher noted that one student, a quiet girl, hadn&#8217;t turned in her paper yet. So she asked the girl if she was having trouble with her list. The quiet girl replied, &#8220;Yes, a little. I couldn&#8217;t quite make up my mind because there were so many.&#8221; The teacher said, &#8220;Well, tell us what you have, and maybe we can help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl hesitated, then read, &#8220;I think the Seven Wonders of the World are:</p>
<p>1. to touch&#8230;<br />
2. to taste&#8230;<br />
3. to see&#8230;<br />
4. to hear&#8230;<br />
5. to feel&#8230;<br />
6. to laugh&#8230;<br />
7. and to love.</p>
<p>The room was so quiet, you could have heard a pin drop.</p>
<p>May this story serve as a gentle reminder to all of us that the things we overlook as simple and ordinary are often the most wonderful &#8211; and we don&#8217;t have to travel anywhere special to experience them.</p>
<p>Enjoy your gifts!</p>

<p>We convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another. Then we are frustrated that the kids aren&#8217;t old enough and we&#8217;ll be more content when they are.</p>
<p>After that we&#8217;re frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are able to go on a nice vacation, when we retire.</p>
<p>The truth is, there&#8217;s no better time to be happy than right now.</p>
<p>Your life will always be filled with challenges. It&#8217;s best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway.</p>
<p>One of my favorite quotes comes from Alfred D Souza. He said,<br />
&#8220;For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin &#8211; real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have.</p>

<p><font size="3"><font face="Arial">The next time you are feeling stressed and your mind is working over time with stressful thoughts, remember this story about “Rule Number 6” written by Benjamin Zander.</p>
<p>“Two prime ministers are sitting in a room discussing affairs of state. Suddenly a man bursts in shouting, stamping and banging his fist on the desk. The resident prime minister reminds him: ‘Peter, kindly remember Rule Number 6,’ whereupon Peter is instantly restored to complete calm, apologizes, and withdraws. The politicians return to their conversation, only to be interrupted yet again twenty minutes later by an hysterical woman. Again the intruder is greeted with the words, ‘Marie, please remember Rule Number 6.’ Complete calm descends once more, and she too withdraws with a bow and an apology.</p>
<p>When the scene is repeated for a third time, the visiting prime minister addresses his colleague: ‘I’ve seen many things in my life, but never anything as remarkable as this. Would you be willing to share your secret of Rule Number 6?’</p>
<p>‘Very simple,’ replies the resident prime minister. ‘Rule Number 6 is <em>Don’t take yourself so darn seriously.’</em> ‘Ah,’ says his visitor, ‘that is a fine rule and what may I ask, are the other rules?’ The prime minister replies ‘There aren’t any.’”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>~ Written by a young girl who is dying if cancer and had only six months to live.</p>
<p>Have you ever watched kids on a merry-ground?<br />
Or listened to the rain slapping the ground?</p>
<p>Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flights?<br />
Or gazed at the sun into the fading nights?</p>
<p>You better slow down.<br />
Don’t dance so fast.<br />
Time is short.<br />
The music won’t last.</p>
<p>Do you run through each day on the fly?<br />
When you ask ‘How are you’ do hear the reply?</p>
<p>When the day is done do you lie in your bed with the next 100 chores<br />
Running through your head?</p>
<p>Ever told your child we’ll do it tomorrow?<br />
And in your haste, not see his sorrow?</p>
<p>Ever lost touch, let a good friendship die<br />
Cause you never had the time to call and say “Hi?”</p>
<p>You better slow down.<br />
Don’t dance so fast.<br />
Time is short.<br />
The music won’t last.</p>
<p>When you run so fast to get somewhere<br />
You miss half the fun of getting there.</p>
<p>When you worry and hurry through your day,<br />
it is like an unopened gift…thrown away.</p>
<p>Life is not a race.<br />
Do take it slower and hear the music<br />
Before the song is over.</p>
