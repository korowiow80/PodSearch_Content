			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On my way to work this morning I heard the song &#8220;If It Makes You Happy&#8221; by Sheryl Crow.  And it got me to thinking.  In the chorus of the song Ms Crow sings, &#8220;If it makes you happy, it can&#8217;t be that bad.&#8221;  This is kind of a Western world mantra isn&#8217;t it?  Haven&#8217;t most of us grown up believing the idea, <i>&#8216;If it makes you happy then what&#8217;s the problem?&#8217;</i></p>
<p>The problem is if we truly believe this then there can be no absolutes.  Think about the following: Killing might make a serial killer happy.  Stealing might make a kleptomaniac happy.  Squashing the small mom and pop stores might make the capitalist happy.  But does the fact that these people might be happy make it right?</p>
<p>Ok the above are extreme situations.  Most of us are not serial killers or kleptomaniacs or extremist capitalists.  But what about things like loose talk making the gossiper happy?  Or sexual conquests making the adulterer happy?  Just because something may make us feel happy, it doesn&#8217;t mean it is right or good.  </p>
<p>Sin can make us feel happy &#8211; hard drugs, casual sex, excessive booze, and so on.  Let&#8217;s face it, if sin wasn&#8217;t fun and make us feel happy we probably wouldn&#8217;t do it.  But according to God&#8217;s Word sin is wrong, and no matter how happy or great we might feel whilst sinning, sin is bad.  </p>
<p>Listen to what God says in Galatians 5:19-21,</p>
<ul>&#8220;When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,  idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,  envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.&#8221;</ul>
<p>Over the years I have committed many sins.  But the more I follow God, the more I put my faith in Him.  The more I read His Word and pray and seek Him, the more I find myself seeing sin for what it is &#8211; self gratification that goes against God&#8217;s laws and ways, and is often done at the expense, or to the detriment of others.  </p>
<p>But there is a better way&#8230; </p>
<ul>&#8220;&#8230;If we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.  If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth. But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.&#8221; 1 John 1:7-9</ul>
<p>Following God has never been about happiness.  Joy, yes.  But joy and happiness are not the same thing.  The Apostle Paul, sitting in a prison cell with his back red raw from a severe beating, was probably not feeling happy.  But he was still filled with joy enough to sing God&#8217;s praises (Acts 16:22-25).  </p>
<p>A lot has been written on this subject and a lot of people have concluded that joy and happiness are one in the same, or that happiness is a part of joy and Joy and part of happiness.  Other sources say that joy comes from within while happiness is triggered by external events.  I like the latter.    Happiness depends on what&#8217;s happening without, whereas joy depends on what&#8217;s happening within.  Therefore, if the Spirit of God is within us then the joy we experience should come from Him.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying we can&#8217;t know happiness, or be happy in this life, let&#8217;s face it we don&#8217;t need any more of those self-made, depressive, &#8216;woe-is-me&#8217; Eeyore type martyrs in the church.  Conversely, let&#8217;s not make the mistake of making happiness our number one goal in life.  Instead let us pray that we can know the kind of inner joy that the Biblical prophets and disciples knew, the same kind of spiritual joy that comes from God&#8230; the type of joy that&#8217;s still inside of us even though life&#8217;s circumstances may dictate we should feel otherwise.  </p>
<ul>&#8220;Light is shed upon the righteous and joy on the upright in heart. Rejoice in the LORD, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.&#8221; Psalm 97:11-12</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have been thinking a lot about what it means to be a Christian&#8230; a Christ follower.  As such I have been reading and re-reading the Gospel accounts trying to fully understand why we as Christians do what we do, say why we say, believe what we believe.</p>
<p>I have looked at why Christians give &#8211; Recently a friend turned me on to the idea that we give not because we have to or because it&#8217;s demanded, but we give because God gives.  There is a recurring promise in Scripture that when we give, God gives back&#8230; see Malachi 3:10 and Luke 6:38.  (I think the Bible is not just referring to money here but blessing of all kinds &#8211; physical and spiritual).</p>
<p>I have looked at why Christians pray &#8211; Jesus prayed so we pray. Everyone in Scripture prayed, so we pray.  And down through the history of the church God&#8217;s people have prayed.  And so we pray.  There&#8217;s a great mystery to prayer in that God knows what we need before we ask and yet He still invites us to pray.  God&#8217;s Word tells us that we are to pray all the time and with all kinds of requests.  I don&#8217;t think prayer should ever devolve into a shopping list of our wants and desires, but we are invited to pray for our needs to be met and trust God that will come through for us.  I think understanding prayer is to understand something of our God and King that we can get from nowhere else &#8211; that God simply desires to have a relationship and converse with us, and that is why we are invited to pray.</p>
<p>I have looked at why Christians read The Word &#8211; The Bible is not intended to be boring or a cure for insomnia.  It&#8217;s the Living Word!  The reason why Christians must read and study God&#8217;s Word is because it contains God&#8217;s heart &#8211; it reveals His passion, His will, and the extent of His love.  If we want to know God there is no better place to start than in His Word.  We are to read and study His Word because it&#8217;s the Truth&#8230; not a truth, but THE TRUTH!  The Word is not simply God&#8217;s opinion, it&#8217;s His revealed truth!  Also faith, love, and this life in general can be hard sometimes and God loves us enough to provide us with an &#8216;instruction manual&#8217; for life that can help us in times of need, to comfort us in times of grief, to counsel us in times of confusion, to give clarity when life is unclear, and to give us joy in times of hardship.</p>
<p>I have looked at why Christians have faith &#8211; Faith is described in Scripture as &#8216;Being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.&#8217; Hebrews 11:1.  Faith is the key to believing in the Trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  We are told that in Hebrews 11:6, &#8216;without faith it is impossible to please God&#8217;.  It is by faith we read the Word and believe.  It is by faith that we pray and receive.  It is by faith we give, knowing that if we are faithful in our giving God will bless our lives.  </p>
<p>I have looked at so many things &#8211; why Christians go to church and fellowship, why Christians are to try not to sin, why Christians are to love, and so on.  And I must say that it has been a great journey of discovery.</p>
<p>And yet, the biggest, most amazing discovery I have made (re-made) is something so very simple.  That through it all Christians need Jesus.  Not just some of Jesus, but all of Him &#8211; His birth, His life, all of His teachings and ways including all the hard ones, His death, and His resurrection.  In short, we need Jesus.  And without Jesus it is impossible to live the Christian life.  Let&#8217;s face it without Jesus what&#8217;s the point of Christianity in the first place?  </p>
<p>There is a beautiful song that has the lyrics, &#8216;Jesus be the center, be my source, be my life, Jesus.&#8217;  And it&#8217;s absolutely true.  In a Christians life Jesus should be, no He needs to be at the absolute center of everything we do.  </p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.hardcorefaith.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/20120417-121957.jpg"><img src="http://www.hardcorefaith.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/20120417-121957-e1334706510978.jpg" alt="" title="Jesus Center" width="550" height="280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6673" /></a></center></p>
<p>The other thing I am re-discovering is that what Jesus teaches is so very vital for us to read, study, and understand.  In the words of Jesus we find out who He is, why He came, and why He loves us so much.  In His words we learn about death and life, sin and grace, love and hope.  The words of Jesus are powerful to say the least&#8230; there&#8217;s a reason why they are in red in some Bibles <img src='http://www.hardcorefaith.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>And yet the truth of Jesus&#8217; words are fast becoming more and more alien to us.  In this day and age where many are trying to soften the Good News and make it more palatable, much of what Jesus taught and did is considered extremely &#8216;hardcore&#8217;.  And some don&#8217;t like the idea of a &#8216;hardcore messiah&#8217;.  The thing is, none can deny that Jesus was definitely unswerving, dedicated, and uncompromising, three definitions of what it means to be hardcore.  </p>
<p>Lately it has been bought to my attention that some &#8216;Christians&#8217; are questioning the relevance of some of what Jesus taught.  There are those in our midst who say that teachings such as the Sermon of the Mount (SOTM) including the Lord&#8217;s Prayer, have no relevance for us today.  The proponents of this line of thinking say that the SOTM was never intended for the New Covenant church, but Jesus&#8217; Jewish audience.  </p>
<p>Needless to say, I have HUGE problems with the idea that we can cherry pick through the words of Jesus.  All of Jesus&#8217; words are beautiful and filled with life, hope, and love.  Consider who Jesus is&#8230; Hopefully to those who consider themselves Christian, He is God.  Jesus is God.  I believe that Jesus has always been God &#8211; The same yesterday, today and forever.  To that end, I consider His words as recorded in Scripture, all of them including all of the so-called hard words, to be of intrinsic value for my faith walk.  </p>
<p>And yet it seems some are gravitating to the idea of a softened, more palatable Jesus, even if it means ignoring some of what He said and taught.  And why?  Maybe it&#8217;s because these &#8216;Christians&#8217; haven&#8217;t truly grasped what it means to be a Christian.  </p>
<p>Jesus first.  There can be no higher authority in a Christians life.  Jesus be the center!</p>
<p>Secondly, unless we have wrestled through the texts of Scripture, especially the words of Christ Himself, I don&#8217;t think we can truly know God.  Someone once told me that we learn more about God in the teachings we consider to be hard.  And I agree.  For the most part it is not through the nice, easy, comfortable times in my life when I have drawn closer to God, but through the struggles and hard times.  So it is with His Word.  </p>
<p>Thirdly, the truth is truth.  And there are no truer words than those recorded in Scripture, especially the words spoken by Jesus.  The whole of Scripture is therefore to be taken seriously and studied.  It&#8217;s not up to us to cherry pick what we want to believe.  Obviously, we are to study and seek God for interpretation, but let not avoid the hard teachings of Scripture because we don&#8217;t like what it&#8217;s saying.  Some don&#8217;t like the idea of hell, but does that make hell any less real?  Some don&#8217;t like the Ten Commandments, but does that make them any less relevant for our lives?  </p>
<p>And finally, many in the church of the Western World have one thing on their lips and minds&#8230; &#8216;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8217;  This is evident in the amount of books available in our Christian bookstores that are nothing more than &#8216;Christian&#8217; self help guides.  Some may consider me fundamental (I think hardcore is a better way of describing me) but I totally get goosebumps whenever I hear the song Look What You&#8217;ve Done by the South African CCM band Tree63.</p>
<blockquote><p><center>&#8220;What can I do for You my Lord,<br />
I want you to know my heart is Yours,<br />
It&#8217;s not a question of what You can do for me,<br />
What Can I do for You my Lord?&#8221;</center></p></blockquote>
<p>God has given us everything in Jesus.  When the world needed a Savior our Father in Heaven sent His Son. And Jesus taught, healed, cared, prophesied, rose the dead, and loved.  </p>
<p>Why am I a Christian?  Because of Jesus.  I am a Christ follower.  I will read, listen to, and heed everything Jesus taught, including the tough stuff.  And I will teach others everything I have been taught and encourage them to obey Gods Word and all of His ways.  </p>
<p>In Him<br />
Chris</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many, Easter is a time, like Christmas, to have some time off work, spend time with family and friends, and eat chocolate eggs.  For the believer however, Easter should be so much more.  </p>
<p>One of the things that symbolizes Easter for me is the Cross.  The Cross, an implement of execution &#8211; possibly one of the cruelest ways a person could die.  Why?  Well, read on and you&#8217;ll begin to get a picture as to what crucifixion entailed.  </p>
<p>So, what is crucifixion? A medical doctor provides this physical description: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The cross is placed on the ground and the exhausted man is quickly thrown backwards with his shoulders against the wood. The legionnaire feels for the depression at the front of the wrist. He drives a heavy, square wrought-iron nail through the wrist and deep into the wood. Quickly he moves to the other side and repeats the action, being careful not to pull the arms too tightly, but to allow some flex and movement. The cross is then lifted into place.</p>
<p>The left foot is pressed backward against the right foot, and with both feet extended, toes down, a nail is driven through the arch of each, leaving the knees flexed. The victim is now crucified. As he slowly sags down with more weight on the nails in the wrists, excruciating, fiery pain shoots along the fingers and up the arms to explode in the brain&#8211;the nails in the wrists are putting pressure on the median nerves. As he pushes himself upward to avoid this stretching torment, he places the full weight on the nail through his feet. Again he feels the searing agony of the nail tearing through the nerves between the bones of his feet. As the arms fatigue, cramps sweep through the muscles, knotting them in deep, relentless, throbbing pain. With these cramps comes the inability to push himself upward to breathe. Air can be drawn into the lungs but not exhaled. He fights to raise himself in order to get even one small breath. Finally carbon dioxide builds up in the lungs and in the blood stream, and the cramps partially subside. Spasmodically he is able to push himself upward to exhale and bring in life-giving oxygen.</p>
<p>Hours of this limitless pain, cycles of twisting, joint-rending cramps, intermittent partial asphyxiation, searing pain as tissue is torn from his lacerated back as he moves up and down against the rough timber. Then another agony begins: a deep, crushing pain deep in the chest as the pericardium slowly fills with serum and begins to compress the heart. It is now almost over&#8211;the loss of tissue fluids has reached a critical level&#8211;the compressed heart is struggling to pump heavy, thick, sluggish blood into the tissues&#8211;the tortured lungs are making a frantic effort to gasp in small gulps of air. He can feel the chill of death creeping through is tissues&#8230; Finally he can allow his body to die.</p>
<p>All this the Bible records with the simple words, &#8220;And they crucified Him.&#8221; (Mark 15:24). What wondrous love is this?&#8221;<br />
<em>(Adapted from C. Truman Davis, M.D. in The Expositor&#8217;s Bible Commentary Vol. 8.)</em></p></blockquote>
<p><center><img src="http://www.hardcorefaith.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/eastercrossmain.jpg" alt="" title="eastercrossmain" width="400" height="208" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2616" ></center></p>
<p>To think that Jesus, the Son of God, was willing to die upon a cross is just mind boggling.  To think that he was willing to die this extremely painful death in my place is beyond words.  Some say that he could do it because he was God.  However, we often forget that he was fully human as well as fully God.  He laughed like you and me.  He cried like you and me.  He felt pain like you and me.</p>
<p>A few years ago I was throwing rocks on the beach with my kids.  Being the show off that I sometimes am, I grabbed the biggest rock I could lift and swung it backward to give me some momentum with which to launch the big rock.  I didn&#8217;t get as far as throwing the rock because one of my fingers got caught between the rock and the tree trunk I was sitting on.  The pain was indescribable.  All of time and space stopped in that moment and it was if my entire being was focused on that one point, my freshly squashed finger.  </p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s unsure as to what Jesus went through would do well to watch the movie <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>.  This movie changed the way I viewed the crucifixion forever.  Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to envision just what happened to Jesus by reading a handful of verses in the Bible.  However, Mel Gibson took these few verses and made a movie that depicts some of what Jesus went through.  Be warned, the movie is brutally graphic and filled with gore, but I have yet to meet someone who wasn&#8217;t affected by it.  </p>
<p>And the same is said of the Cross itself.  For when one looks upon the Cross and truly contemplates that a perfect, blameless, sinless man was crucified in their place, one cannot help but be forever changed.  Especially when they realize that the One upon the Cross is God.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Easter story no one stands out to me as much as Barabbas (apart from Jesus of course).  Barabbas was a condemned criminal, probably an insurrectionist and murderer; scholars believe him to be a member of the Zealots, a group of Jewish revolutionaries (maybe terrorist would be a more fitting description) committed to fighting the Roman occupiers.</p>
<p>Believed to be a very violent and cruel man, Barabbas would not have been a candidate for the people&#8217;s choice award.  And yet, when Jesus was bought before Pontius Pilate to be examined, the people call for the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus &#8211; if you recall Pilate offers to release one criminal as an act of good will and they call for Barabbas.  It&#8217;s highly possible that Barabbas was the only known criminal being held at that time and as such the people called out the only name they knew other than Jesus.  </p>
<p>Think about this, Barabbas is sitting in a prison cell, his hands and feet in irons.  He&#8217;s done some really bad things and now he finds himself awaiting his execution; those deemed political prisoners were often executed with a very brief or no trial.  From the place where he is being held he hears the crowd calling out.  He strains to hear what they are chanting.  And then he hears it&#8230; his name.  The people are calling his name.  With widening eyes and sweat beginning to form on his brow he can only think of one thing, they are calling for him to executed.</p>
<p>Suddenly his life flashes before his eyes as he begins to fear his demise at the hands of those he had sought to overthrow.  He had probably seen a thousand crucifixions and knew it wasn&#8217;t pleasant.  The approaching footsteps mark the beginning of the end as Roman soldiers come closer and closer and stop outside of his holding cell door.  The squeak of the lock as it is unlocked signals that indeed they have come for him.  The door opens and there before him stand several Roman guards.  They move quickly to enter the room, get Barabbas to his feet and proceed to march him down long, dark corridors to where he knows life is about to get extremely unpleasant.  </p>
<p>Barabbas hears the call of his name getting closer as he is taken from the prison out into the light of day. The suns light temporarily blinds him and it takes him a few moments for his eyes to re-adjust.  And there he finds himself standing before a huge crowd.  He looks around and sees his arch-enemy, Pilate, sitting on his judgment seat staring in disbelief at him.  With a wave of his hand, Pilate orders the soldiers to unlock the chains around Barabbas&#8217; wrists and ankles and then informs him he is free to go.  He is informed that the people were not calling his name to have him executed, but released.  </p>
<p>Barabbas, not believing his ears wastes no time in walking away from his captors, but not before looking past Pilate to the man standing next to him.  &#8216;I know that man,&#8217; he thinks.  &#8216;I&#8217;ve seen him around&#8230; I wonder what he has done to deserve execution?&#8217;  And then without another thought he runs into the crowd to disappear from sight.</p>
<p>Not a lot is known about Barabbas both before or after this event in his life.  Obviously the narrative above is just an idea of how he may have been feeling, what he may have been thinking, and so on&#8230; nothing is mentioned in Scripture but the crowd calling for Barabbas to be released and his release (Matthew 27:15-26, Mark 15:6-15, and Luke 23:13–25).  But whenever I read about this event I always pause and wonder what Barabbas was feeling at this moment?  </p>
<p>Whatever the case, the account of Barabbas being released instead of Jesus is the story of us all.  Like Barabbas we have all done wrong.  And like Barabbas we deserve punishment for those sins.  But as Jesus was willing to allow Barabbas to go free (He could have fought back and pleaded his own case, but He didn&#8217;t), He is always willing to allow us to go free.  In fact, some theologians have concluded that this account sums up salvation so beautifully &#8211; Barabbas represents all those who have done wrong (all of us) and his place upon that old rugged cross was taken by another.  He deserved death, but was given the gift of life, the same gift that is still on offer today if we will just accept it.  </p>
<p>Some would argue that Barabbas was released not by God&#8217;s choosing, but by man&#8217;s choosing.  To this I would humbly suggest that the entire chain of events that happened that first Easter were orchestrated by the Spirit of God according to the Father&#8217;s plan, including the release of Barabbas.  I sometimes wonder what became of Barabbas.  After his release he disappeared from secular and biblical history and was never heard of again.  I like to think that his heart and life were changed the moment he looked into the eyes of Jesus expecting to see hate and resentment, yet seeing nothing but love.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week at church I spoke on expectations based on what Jesus said in Luke 12:48, &#8220;Much will be required of everyone who has been given much. And even more will be expected of the one who has been entrusted with more.&#8221; (HCSB)  I spoke about how being faithful is God’s business. And yet He expects us to also be faithful with what we have been given. Elsewhere the Bible declares, “Give as freely as you have received!” (Matt. 10:8 – NLT)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind admitting that over the years I struggled with giving, especially when it came to the area of giving money. However, a few years ago I had a major breakthrough in that I found the more I gave the more I received by way of blessing, both physical and spiritual. Personally, I don’t think there’s a magical formula we can follow to get blessed financially, physically, or spiritually.  And I most certainly don&#8217;t subscribe to the whole Health and Wealth &#8216;American Dream&#8217; Gospel message.  But the more I study Scripture the more I find that I cannot escape the fact that with regards to giving there is a promise of blessing. </p>
<p>In The Book of Malachi God talks about formal giving. &#8220;Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my Temple. If you do,” says the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, “I will open the windows of heaven for you. I will pour out a blessing so great you won’t have enough room to take it in! Try it! Put me to the test!&#8221; (Malachi 3:10 &#8211; NLT)</p>
<p>In The Book of Luke Jesus says, “Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.” (Luke 6:38 – NIV) </p>
<p>Give, and it will be given… GIVE, AND IT <u>WILL</u> (not might) BE GIVEN! God expects us to give and in return He will give. </p>
<p>From what I can make out our giving is intended for a number of things:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our giving blesses others.<br />
Proves we are following in the ways of the Master &#8211; as He gives we also give.<br />
Helps us stay mindful as to our mission here on earth &#8211; to go and make disciples, clothing the naked, feeding the hungry, and so on.<br />
Provideds us an opportunity to store up treasures in Heaven.<br />
To learn the great truth that giving is an act of worship and obedience.<br />
To advance the continued work of Christ in this world.<br />
To share in the responsibilities of supporting Christian ministries including the local church.<br />
To develop an attitude of self denial.</p></blockquote>
<p>God loves to give and wants to bless us.  But the Bible says that if we can&#8217;t be trusted with what He has already blessed us with, why would he give us more? (Luke 12:41-48)</p>
<p>A few years ago, (I was in my early 20′s) I was working voluntarily for a childrens home.  One day we took the kids out for ice cream as we did about once a week as a treat for good behavior.  We had just bought our ice cream cones when all of a sudden a girl of about 4 years old, who had been served only moments before us, dropped her ice cream cone on the ground. She began to cry as her mother told her she couldn&#8217;t afford to buy another. To my amazement one of the kids in our group, Tessa, went over to the little girl and without a second thought handed over her own ice cream cone saying, “there you go, have mine.” The little girl smiling from ear to ear, wiped the tears from her face, took the ice cream cone, thanked Tessa, and then proceeded to messily eat the ice cream as only a 4 year old can.  The other kids in our group hadn&#8217;t given a second thought to the little girls loss, and by this time they had all but devoured their ice cream cones.  I asked Tessa why she gave her ice cream cone away.  &#8220;It&#8217;s just ice cream,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And she needed it more than me.  And I&#8217;ll get one next week.&#8221;  I was so impressed that I went right back to the ice cream truck and ordered the biggest ice cream cone they had with all the extras (we didn’t worry about diabetes back then <img src='http://www.hardcorefaith.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ). Needless to say, Tessa was extremely thrilled with her new “fully loaded” ice cream cone.</p>
<p>Giving is a heart issue.  Hopefully it&#8217;s not too much to assume, given His own example, that Jesus expects His followers to be givers?  He gave&#8230; so we should give. Read again what The Word tells us&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.” (Luke 6:38 – NIV)</p></blockquote>
<p>The question is, are we givers? Do we hold tightly to the blessings we have been given, refusing to let them go?  Do we trust in our own resources or trust God?  We must have full confidence that if we give with the right heart, not from a place of greed but need, God will make good on His promises and further bless our lives and make them “fully loaded.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to coffee we are spoiled for choice.  Even where I live on the Sunshine Coast, where there is nary a Walmart in sight, we have several coffee houses including the big boys like Tim Hortons and Starbucks.  And as any coffee connoisseur will tell you, the quality of the coffee varies from coffee house to coffee house.</p>
<p>Personally I like Starbucks.  I can&#8217;t always afford to go there, but IMHO they have great coffee.  I know they have had a lot of competition over the past few years, but Starbucks coffee is tastier, richer, and definitely stronger than any other coffee house I have tried.  </p>
<p>However, Starbucks always feels a little more like a business than a smaller, more homey, coffee shop.  And so, if it&#8217;s atmosphere you&#8217;re after you might prefer an &#8220;off the map&#8221; coffee shop owned by local business people rather than a main street coffee palace owned by a large corporation.</p>
<p>This morning I was watching a video on big churches vs small churches.  I have always been interested in the various dynamics when it comes to church size &#8211; fellowship, teaching, intimacy, worship, and so on.  And I have mixed feeling when it comes to both.  </p>
<p>Below are some of my thoughts pertaining to small churches and large churches, and I invite you to join the conversation by sharing your experiences and preferences re: church size.</p>
<p>1. Small churches seem to have more in the way of fellowship, in that attendees tend to know one another, whereas big churches often seem impersonal and one can easily get lost in all the hustle and bustle of people coming or going.  However, many big churches have an excellent cell groups setup.</p>
<p>2.  Small churches have more intimate worship times, whereas in big churches the worship can feel like a concert.  However, big churches have more access to talented musicians and as such the quality of the sound and musicianship is far better in most cases.  </p>
<p>3.  There is a belief that preachers in big churches are better that the small church Jo&#8217;s, but that is not the case, as many great preachers are to be found in small churches.  And while it is true that big churches tend to hire only the best orators available, from my experience there are less &#8220;self-help&#8221; and &#8220;warm-fuzzy&#8221; messages spoken in smaller churches.</p>
<p>4.  Smaller churches are often running on a thin line of bank credit, often dipping into the red to make ends meet.  However, Bigger churches while seen to be making more money have way more bills.  Many big churches are running at a loss, hence the increase on financial and stewardship sermons, and less emphasis on the whole of Scripture.  </p>
<p>5.  Bigger is better is often not true.  A lot of big churches have a huge turnover of volunteers, whereas many volunteers in smaller churches tend to stick with ministries that need help.  However, the burnout rate seems to be higher in small churches because it&#8217;s 10% of the people doing 100% of the ministry all the time&#8230; bigger churches have way more cannon fodder <img src='http://www.hardcorefaith.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>6.  When it comes to outreach potential big churches would seem to have the upper hand.  However, from my experience it is often the small churches that are found out in the community.</p>
<p>7.  It may seem that small churches have more infighting, whereas big churches are more concerned with the almighty dollar.  However, I know of many large churches that have so much infighting I often wonder if they should start &#8220;fight clubs&#8221; and small churches that are fixated on finances.</p>
<p>8.  Small churches can be closed off groups, whereas big churches seem to be open to all comers.  However, I have experienced just the opposite.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but the truth is that all churches have their strengths and weaknesses.  I would be interested in getting feedback on this issue, as well your insights and comments.  So feel free to use the comment section below and let&#8217;s get this conversation going.</p>
<p><em>Note: I have purposefully left out the medium size church, because what one community would class as a small church another may class as a big church.  As there are no definitions of what constitutes a small/large church I will let you decide.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a quiet town in Germany where once a year the good, hard working people of that town dress up and wear masks.  Nothing unusual, you might say, lots of people dress up and wear masks for parties, Halloween, and so on.  However, the difference is in their intention.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this town don&#8217;t dress up and wear masks to celebrate some holiday or someone&#8217;s special day, they do so to hide who they are from one another.  Why?  Because once a year the adult inhabitants of this town send the kids off to camp or nearby relatives so that they can spend an entire day doing whatever they fancy with whomever they want.  Adultery, gambling, orgies, binge drinking, all is fair game and anything goes, save one thing, murder.  </p>
<p>To one extent or another we all wear masks to hide who we really are and what we&#8217;re all about.  Have you ever met someone in church who you know was not being totally honest and open with you?  But ask yourself, were you totally honest and open with them?  Maybe in your workplace you have someone who wears one mask around the bosses and then another when they are with the other workers.  Maybe that person is you?</p>
<p>One of the main reasons people are turned off by the church, and Christians for that matter, is because they see them as hypocrites.  The word hypocrite comes from the ancient Greek word <em>hupocrits</em> which denotes someone who pretends or plays a part, as in an actor.  In ancient times actors would often hold a double sided mask, one side representing comedy, the other, tragedy.  And they would act with these masks covering their faces.  A modern example of this would be an actor who wears prosthetic makeup to hide who they are to play a part, as in the case of Jim Carrey playing <em>The Grinch</em>.</p>
<p>Believers are called out to make a difference, to live the life, to follow after Jesus, and not to compromise their faith.  We need to understand that our family, friends, work colleagues, towns, cities, and the world, are watching us to see if we&#8217;ll make it or not, to see if we are true to our word.  </p>
<p>We say we love Jesus and then forsake those in need.  We say we are part of an extended &#8220;church family&#8221; and then bitch and whine about our so-called brothers and sisters.  We point accusing fingers when someone fails, instead of reaching out hands of love and healing.  We moan instead of praying.  We push away and exist primarily for ourselves, gorging and fattening ourselves on &#8220;church-ianity&#8221;, instead of getting out into the world and doing what the Word says, and living as Jesus instructed (Matthew 28:18-20).  </p>
<p>It may seem that I&#8217;m taking a bit of a hard-edged stance against hypocrisy &#8211; I am.  However, I realize that when I talk about hypocrisy I may have one finger pointed away from me and yet, there are three fingers pointing back at me, <em>&#8220;wretched man that I am.&#8221;</em> Romans 7:24</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the answer?  I think that a true believer desires nothing else than to be conformed into the image of Christ, to become like him in all that they say and do.  And I believe that the more we become like Jesus, the less we will need our masks, as we will have nothing left to hide.</p>
<p>Remember the town in Germany.  Once a year they gave in to their wicked lusts and desires in a no-holds-barred day of depravity.  And yet, every year the Salvation Army, along with the faithful believers of that town, set up a stand right in the middle of town with a banner above it declaring, <em>&#8220;God see&#8217;s behind the mask.&#8221;  </em>  </p>
<p><em>God see&#8217;s behind the mask,</em> a sobering fact to say the least.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while back I watched the classic Disney movie <em>Pete&#8217;s Dragon</em> with the family.  At one point during the movie I thought to myself, <em>they don&#8217;t make them like this anymore.</em>  Not that the movie is technically brilliant, I&#8217;m sure for it&#8217;s day it was; but the simplicity in this movie is what stood to to me&#8230; and the innocence.</p>
<p>It seems that movies today have become somewhat cynical.  Even movies such as <em>Enchanted </em>and <em>Ella Enchanted</em> have an air of cynicism to them.  And while I don&#8217;t mind movies that have a tongue in cheek element to them, as I watched <em>Pete&#8217;s Dragon</em> I marveled that the movie seemed so out of place with today&#8217;s new breed of movies.</p>
<p>There was once a time when my faith was so simple; I remember a time when I wasn&#8217;t all bogged down with ideas and theologies and ideologies and philosophies&#8230; and yet, here I am now with my head buzzing and reeling with all kinds of &#8220;faith&#8221; stuff.  </p>
<p>In Scripture Jesus talks about the faith of a child being a better way (Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17).  And why?  Because the faith of a child is simple.  A child believes his parents when they tell him something, and I&#8217;ve noticed that children have no problem believing in Santa, elves, the Tooth Fairy, and even God.  The older we get the more cynical we become, and whereas children don&#8217;t always require proof, we adults usually want proof.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s where faith comes in.  In my early days as a Christian I had great faith, yet now I find myself longing more and more for the proof.  My prayer is that I can once again have that all trusting faith, the kind of faith that doesn&#8217;t need mountains of CSI type evidence, but believes despite the seeming lack of hard facts&#8230; </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;So what is your view on the endtimes?  Does the rapture happen pre, mid, or post tribulation?&#8221; </p>
<p>This was a question I was asked a few weeks ago by a friend over coffee.  I thought for a moment, smiled, and simply answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m a pan trib kind of person&#8230; </p>
<p>&#8220;Pan trib?&#8221; my friend perplexed friend asked, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of pan trib before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yeah,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Pan trib simply means it&#8217;s all gonna pan out in the end.&#8221;  </p>
<p>My friend just smiled back at me and said, &#8220;Funny guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing I took away from this conversation is that sometimes we take something that is so easy and make it so difficult to understand.  My friend was trying to get some answers as to when Jesus might come back; before, during, or after the tribulation period as described in the Book of Revelation.  Now I could have gone all theological on him, taken out my M. Div blackbelt, and whooped him with some Biblejitsu.  I could have presented the three different views and argued for, or against them all.  I could have&#8230; but I didn&#8217;t.  Why?  Because Jesus said that no person will know the day or hour he will return &#8211; FACT!</p>
<p>All I know for sure reading Revelation is that in the end God claims the ultimate victory and that His people will be saved from this dark world of pain, grief, and despair.  Revelation 21:3-4 tells us,</p>
<blockquote><p>Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.</p></blockquote>
<p>So again, it&#8217;s all gonna pan out in the end!  Thank you Jesus!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey y&#8217;all, </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while.  Life sure has been busy&#8230; busy but good.  As some of you know I have been working as a pastor in the coastal town of Sechelt, BC, working behind the scenes to develop people and the church services.  To be honest I am very much liking my current job.  Not only do I get to hang out and have coffee (tea for me) with some really neat people, but I also get to preach every week, which as anyone who knows me knows is my passion in life (and hey, you guys get to benefit as I upload all of my sermons right here on HardcoreFaith.com <img src='http://www.hardcorefaith.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  ).  </p>
<p>I am still working on several writing projects as well as an online project called Naked Christianity (<a href="http://nakedchristianity.com" target="_blank">NakedChristianity.com</a>) that will include Bible based back-to-basics teaching, both print and digital guides for both group and individual study, and thought provoking video presentations.</p>
<p>As you can tell I am also currently working on updating HardcoreFaith.com  Since it&#8217;s launch in 2008 this blog has reached out to over 400,000 users and had over 750,000 page views.  </p>
<p>Anyways, I may be working my tail off right now, but I&#8217;m back.  I am going to be posting one new FaithBlog every week, so keep checking back.</p>
<p>Chris</p>
