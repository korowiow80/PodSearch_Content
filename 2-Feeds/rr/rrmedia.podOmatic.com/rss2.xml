He joined the popular music ensembles Grupo Guaco and Oscar D'Leon, where he enjoyed widespread worldwide exposure. Besides being known for his skillful timbale work, Luisito also plays congas, bongos, drum set, djembe, dundun and a wide variety of assorted percussion instruments. His technique on all of these instruments is masterful and unparalleled. Luisito has worked with , Jack De Johnette, David Sanborn, George Benson ,Joe Sampler, Bill Cosby, the late Celia Cruz and Tito Puente, Eddie Palmieri, Marc Anthony, Gloria Estefan, Richard Bona, Ravi Coltrane, Claudia Acuna, Giovanni Hidalgo, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Willie Colon and countless other high-profile music acts. Quintero is comfortable working in any genre of music from Symphonic to Jazz and from Latin to House. One of his most recent projects finds him as musical director for Louie Vega and the Elements of Life Band as well as extensive work with Jack DeJohnettes Latin Project. He is also co-musical director and percussionist for Kevin Jones and Tenth World. He is one of the most sought after percussionist in the country at this time and will continue to build his legend as time goes on.

      <title>Life In Music Podcast Episode 8 / Interview with guitarist Dominic Kanza</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1084338/600x600_707277.png&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the pleasure of catching up with my good friend and great musician Dominic Kanza.  Here is a part of his bio.

The multi-cultural Kanza has performed with a wide and diverse variety of artists, such as Zairean pop idol Papa Wemba, and Jazz legends Pharaoh Sanders, Michael Brecker and Bill Laswell. He has also worked extensively with singer-songwriter Paul Simon, with whom he has collaborated on events such as President Bill Clinton's inaugural ball and Simon's annual &quot;Back at the ranch&quot; concert series, sharing the stage with performers such as Billy Joel, James Taylor, Jimmy Buffet, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Jose Feliciano and others.

Dominic Kanza has also recorded with friend/composer Bob Telson (Bagdad Cafe), and has worked with him on numerous projects, including the Broadway musical &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot;.

As a composer, Dominic has been active in television, writing the score for a National Geographic TV documentary film, &quot;Zaire River&quot;. He has recorded numerous jingles and also wrote one of the theme songs for the &quot;Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

Dominic toured and performed with the singer Harry Belafonte, appearing in a PBS television concert entitled &quot;An evening with Harry Belafonte and friends&quot;, which was released on video and CD.

In 1993, Dominic received the Award of Excellence from the United Nations Writers Association. He was one of only 25 recipients worldwide, a group which included Mikhail Gorbachev and Vanessa Redgrave.

Most recently he performed at the &quot;Blues&quot; concert at Radio City Music Hall with artists as diverse as BBKing , Buddy Guy, Aerosmith and The Neville Brothers. He is pictured at the event in the August issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in the &quot;Room Full Of Blues&quot; section.

Dominic's debut album &quot;All these years&quot; reflects his multi-cultural experience. Into a stew of Soukous, he throws in spices of his international experience to produce a rich and exciting musical hybrid. A Southhampton critic writing an exuberant review concluded: &quot;The only people with regrets Sunday morning about Saturday night's concert were the people who heard about the show and had to kick themselves for missing it &quot;.

      <title>Life In Music Podcast Episode 7 / Interview with CEO of AIM TV Robert Rose</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1084338/600x600_707278.png&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert G. Rose is the CEO of AIM Tell-A-Vision Group, a division of Artist and Idea Management, Ltd. and Executive Producer of all AIM TV programming. A media veteran, Rose&#8217;s career in the industry spans over 15 years and includes a combination of success in general market and Latino-targeted television.&#8232;&#8232;In 1996, after a successful career in English-language television, Rose moved to New York from his native Tennessee and joined Univision Television Group, the nation&#8217;s premiere Spanish-language network. While at Univision, Rose played a vital role in convincing many Fortune 500 and &#8220;general market&quot; advertisers to effectively reach out to the growing and untapped U.S. Latino market. Also while at Univision, Rose recognized the opportunity for advertisers to reach the &#8220;larger half&#8221; of the Latino market, U.S.-born Latinos, via English-language television. Rose officially began Artist and Idea Management, Ltd. in February 2000.&#8232;&#8232;&#8220;Simply put, reaching young U.S.-born Latinos is not a language issue but a cultural relevance issue. What&#8217;s relevant programming to Latinos who are born elsewhere and migrate here is just not relevant to their sons and daughters, who were born in the U.S. and now make up the majority of the U.S. Hispanic market. These are two distinct markets and should be treated as such,&#8221; says Rose.&#8232;&#8232;In 2001, Rose and company brought to life and independently produced the first successful English-language, weekly syndicated television program targeted to Latinos, Urban Latino TV (ULTV). The historic program began as a local cable show in New York then went on to air nationally for two successful seasons. The show won critical acclaim and won back to back Imagen Awards in 2003 and 2004 for &#8220;Best National Informational Program,&#8221; beating out programming from networks, such as Univision, HBO, Telemundo, Fox Sports and more.&#8232;&#8232;In 2003, Rose formed television production banner, Maximas Productions with Renzo Devia, the Senior Producer of Urban Latino TV. In addition to having produced ULTV, the award-winning production team of Rose and Devia currently produce American Latino TV (2005 Imagen Award Winner), a culture and lifestyle program celebrating Latin culture in America; LatiNation (2004 Telly Award Winner), the first English-language program to target young Latin males; Sonidos, a quarterly series of music specials, The American Latino Presents specials and Play More TV (Fall 2006).&#8232;&#8232;Rose&#8217;s executive produced programs can be viewed weekly on English- language broadcast stations in over 100 markets across the U.S., on targeted cable networks and via DVDs available at major retailers. His programming set the standard for culturally relevant television and pioneered the model of English- language programming for U.S. Latinos by attracting major media outlets and an impressive list of Fortune 500 Advertisers.&#8232;&#8232;As CEO, Rose oversees The AIM Tell-A-Vision Group, which is a vertically integrated company responsible for developing, financing and managing all aspects (distribution, production, marketing and advertising sales) of AIM TV programming. Rose serves as an industry spokesperson in presenting a more accurate portrayal on how Latinos are depicted on U.S. television and how marketers and media should better target the underserved American Latino audience.&#8232;&#8232;Rose, Devia and their team at AIM Tell-A-Vision and Maximas Productions are continuously developing a slate of new projects geared towards breaking barriers and stereotypes by presenting positive and entertaining images of the melting pot that is modern-day America.&#8232;&#8232;Rose has been featured presenter, panelist, and keynote speaker at many industry conferences and has been extensively quoted in the trade &amp; consumer press for his pioneering role in reaching young U.S. Latinos.&#8232;&#8232;Rose is an active member of NATPE (National Association of Television Programming Executives), NATAS (National Academy of Television Arts and Science) and IRTS (International Radio and Television Society).</description>
