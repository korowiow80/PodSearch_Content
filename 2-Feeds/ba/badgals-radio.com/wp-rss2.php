<p style="text-align: justify;">WE Support Ending the Stop and Frisk Units.  People are INNOCENT and have no need to be molested in general by misused laws. The statistics prove that the practice is based entirely on Racial Profiling.  It&#8217;s time the Stop and Frisk Laws were put in the trashcan.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">No one in this country should stand by and watch as others are harrassed just because they are in a particular area. This is why the prison population in america quadrupled within 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>The Mothers of New York are Calling for an End to Stop and Frisk</strong></p>
<p><object width="480" height="270" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZF57c7G1cWs?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="480" height="270" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZF57c7G1cWs?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did you realize that most people who are arrested under Stop and Frisk are forced to take plea deals for small amounts of Marijuana ?  In NY the prison population is made up of 3/4 non violent offenders &#8211; mostly people who are in jail for small amounts of marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>This is what&#8217;s going on in Detroit &#8211; arbitrary application of Racial Profiling</strong></p>
<p><object width="480" height="360" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yGE9bgedLzY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="480" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yGE9bgedLzY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can you imagine being a driver or worker being accosted while standing at a stop light, or working ? Presently there are more than 20 people who are involved in a mass lawsuit, because the Detroit Police are openly twisting the law. There has to be an end to this type of harrassment to people who are doing nothing wrong. Sitting on your own porch is not a crime; and neither is driving through an area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this year we spoke about the problem in Detroit. There are several notable cases pending in the Detroit courts.  Most stem from the DPD issuing tickets and arresting people who were just driving through a particular intersection.  That means that in essence you give up your freedom if you decide to go to a store or restaurant; a doctors office, or even your local house of worship;  if you haopen to enter into one of these unnamed and constantly moving Stop and Frisk Zones.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s time that this irrational and illegal police action stop everywhere. People are not criminals.  Police should focus on crime; not racial profiling.  We support the NAACP&#8217;s campaign to stop the Racial Harrassment known as Stop and Frisk.</p>

<p> <img src="http://badgals-radio.com/re-sig.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Reality,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year in New York City, police stopped and interrogated black men and boys between the ages 14 and 24 a total of 168,126 times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The total population of black men and boys aged 14 through 24 in New York City is 158,406.<br />
That means the amount of times police stopped black men and boys in this age group exceeds the total number living in the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, last year, more than 85% of the 685,000 people stopped by the NYPD were African American or Latino, most of them children and young adults. This is up from less than 100,000 stops a decade ago. Then, like now, 90% of those stopped are completely innocent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this adds up to nothing less than the most aggressive street-level racial profiling program in the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On June 17th, we&#8217;re demanding an end to this alarming and abusive practice. The NAACP is holding a silent march in New York City to call for an end to New York&#8217;s notorious &#8220;stop and frisk&#8221; program. Our marchers won&#8217;t be speaking, so I need you to write the messages that will serve as their voices during the march.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Help the NAACP end the abuse of stop and frisk. Create a message for the banners, signs, and posters carried by thousands through the streets of New York on June 17th:</strong></p>
<div><a href="http://action.naacp.org/page/m/474a345f/7999cfca/7d076cec/2f610c72/1057003226/VEsE/" target="_blank"><img src="http://action.naacp.org/page/-/NAACP%20stop%20and%20frisk%20message.jpg" alt="Submit your end Stop and Frisk message" width="450" align="middle" border="0" /></a><br />
<strong><a href="http://action.naacp.org/page/m/474a345f/7999cfca/7d076cec/2f610c72/1057003226/VEsF/" target="_blank">http://action.naacp.org/<wbr>silent-march-message</wbr></a></strong></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In contrast to previous demonstrations, we will march in silence as an illustration of both the tragedy and serious threat that stop and frisk and other forms of racial profiling present to our society. The silent march was first used in 1917 by the NAACP &#8211; then just eight years old &#8211; to draw attention to race riots that tore through communities in East St. Louis, Illinois, and build national opposition to lynching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, 95 years later, we will use this powerful protest to shine a light on the great injustice of stop and frisk and begin rebuilding national opposition to racial profiling. The march will be the first step in a nationwide federal and state-level campaign to address the problem of racial profiling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because we will remain silent as we march, your words will be especially important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re outraged that police, security guards and even community watch volunteers in so many neighborhoods continue to treat young people of color differently, or if you&#8217;re concerned for your children, or your neighbors&#8217; and friends&#8217; children, then channel these emotions into a message of 15 words or less and share it with us today. We will pick five messages to print for the march.</p>

<p>And America is thought to be a friend ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maurice Bishop was murdered during the seige on St Georges on October 19, 1983 when thePrime Minister Bishop and senior members of his People’s Revolutionary Government were executed at the fort after being deposed in a power struggle with seperatist guerillas.</p>
<p><strong>This is Grenadas&#8217; View of the Revolution -</strong></p>
<p><object width="480" height="360" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/aI45fixtxLU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="480" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/aI45fixtxLU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p><strong>This is the story according to history :</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The People’s Revolutionary Government, which had deposed Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy in March 1979, had become divided by late 1982.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As factions loyal to Bishop struggled with those of his deputy Bernard Coard, Bishop was placed under house arrest on October 13, 1983. On October 19, a large crowd released him and marched to the army compound at Fort Rupert.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Troops under the command of General Hudson Austin shot an unknown number of protesters then captured and executed Bishop and seven loyalists, including his education minister Jacqueline Creft, foreign minister Unison Whiteman and housing minister Norris Bain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The United States military entered Grenada too late to save Maurice Bishop and the others who were executed along with him. This incident was one of the bloodiest in Grenadas&#8217; history.  We believe the theory that Maurice Bishop was the intended target, which is why the US Military didn&#8217;t arrive in time to rescue him &#8211; as requested.  The US was asked several times to come to the aid of the Bishop government; yet Reaganism and the cold war that was still going on in the minds of the US Military delayed their arrival until they were sure that Maurice Bishop was dead.  This is not our theory, but a time line of the events based on Ronald Reagans Cold War Military Strategy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ST GEORGE’S, Grenada, Wednesday May 30, 2012 – The location of the mortal remains of slain Grenada Prime Minister Maurice Bishop seems destined to remain a mystery following exhumations by forensic experts in an area of a public cemetery pinpointed as the most likely last resting place of Bishop and seven of his colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bones unearthed at the site were not the remains of those killed in the 1983 coup, according to the Grenadian ecumenical organisation leading the search.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The group found remains, they found bones, but they were easily identified as not belonging to those who were shot on the fort that day,” said Father Seon Doggett, spokesman for the Grenada Conference of Churches (GCC) which is leading the project to determine what happened to the bodies of Bishop and an unknown number of civilians who were executed at the army’s headquarters Fort Rupert, subsequently renamed Fort George.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a two-week period that ended last week, a team of forensic anthropologists exhumed remains from a part of the St George’s Cemetery that was identified by witness testimony as the probable location of the bodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is possible that they might be just outside of that location that was searched. A future search may yield more positive results, but would involve resources well beyond the scope of the Conference,” Father Doggett stated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He went on to say that the experts are certain the remains are not those of Bishop and the slain seven but took the bones for further testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ecumenical group has been trying to bring closure to the events of October 19, 1983 when Prime Minister Bishop and senior members of his People’s Revolutionary Government were executed at the fort after being deposed in a power struggle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The GCC, the umbrella organisation for Grenada’s religious community, in collaboration with the Grenada government and St. George’s University, enlisted the services of a nine-member team of forensic anthropologists to conduct a search for the remains of the murdered men and women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Father Doggett said experts with extensive experience in anthropological research and international crime scene investigations conducted a search on the edge of St George’s Cemetery closest to the National Stadium. The area had been pinpointed by the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and from other testimony as the most likely location of the remains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“These testimonies include persons who worked with the undertaker at the time of the tragic events,” Doggett said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Marcella Sorg, leader of the team that conducted the search, will prepare a comprehensive report which will be a permanent record of the history of Grenada, according to Doggett.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The GCC spokesman added that that the GCC is currently in discussions with the victims’ relatives to ascertain their interest in exploring “other possibilities”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“These possibilities might include some form of memorial, a national event, and/or a monument of some kind that will help to bring closure to this painful period of Grenada’s history,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The People’s Revolutionary Government, which had deposed Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy in March 1979, had become divided by late 1982.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As factions loyal to Bishop struggled with those of his deputy Bernard Coard, Bishop was placed under house arrest on October 13, 1983. On October 19, a large crowd released him and marched to the army compound at Fort Rupert.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Troops under the command of General Hudson Austin shot an unknown number of protesters then captured and executed Bishop and seven loyalists, including his education minister Jacqueline Creft, foreign minister Unison Whiteman and housing minister Norris Bain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six days later, on the request of Barbados and neighbouring Eastern Caribbean leaders, the United States invaded Grenada and together with regional police and troops restored the country to civilian rule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coard, Austin and other civil, political and military figures, who were among 17 people convicted for the killings, were released in 2010 after their death sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Grenada 17” claimed they gave no orders for the executions and could not be held responsible for the deaths. They also denied knowledge of where the bodies of Bishop and his ministers and several others were located, suggesting they were buried by invading American troops.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only Austin has remained silent about his role in the slaughter.</p>

<h2>Liberia:  <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201205170266.html" target="_blank">Taylor &#8211; Prosecute George Bush, Too</a></h2>
<p>BY PAUL YEENIE HARRY, 17 MAY 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Former Liberian President Charles Taylor, now convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity in relations to atrocities committed in Sierra Leone, has stressed the need for former US President George W. Bush to be prosecuted for similar crimes. Taylor made the call in his first post-verdict special statement he read before judges of the Special Court for Sierra Leone Wednesday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said he agreed with the judges&#8217; statement that the April 26 historic judgment reinforces the new reality that Heads of State will be held accountable for war crimes and other international crimes, that with leadership comes not just power and authority, but also responsibility and accountability, and that no person, no matter how powerful, is above the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, Taylor, who sees unfairness in his prosecution in comparison to the scot-freeness of ex-President Bush, states: &#8220;President George W. Bush not too long ago ordered torture and admitted to doing so. Torture is a crime against humanity. The United States has refused to prosecute him. Is he above the law? Where is the fairness?&#8221;</p>

This should be no suprise. It however makes us sad to think that they experimented on Michael Jackson. Wonder if Dr Murray gets any kudos for the new discovery of a one shot fast killing drug.</p>
<p><strong>And they say this is Humane.. Yeah for who ?</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://badgals-radio.com/re-sig.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57440903/propofol-drug-that-michael-jackson-odd-on-to-be-used-in-missouri-executions/" target="_blank">Propofol, drug that Michael Jackson OD&#8217;d on, to be used in Missouri executions</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ST. LOUIS &#8211; The same anesthetic that caused the overdose death of pop star Michael Jackson is now the drug of choice for executions in Missouri, causing a stir among critics who question how the state can guarantee a drug untested for lethal injection won&#8217;t cause pain and suffering for the condemned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last week the Missouri Department of Corrections announced it was switching from its longstanding three-drug method to use of a single drug, propofol. Missouri would be the first state ever to use propofol as an execution drug.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;This is very, very concerning with a drug that we don&#8217;t know, and seeing the problems of the one-drug method,&#8221; said Kathleen Holmes of Missourians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until recently, the 33 states with the death penalty used a virtually identical three-drug process: Sodium thiopental was administered to put the inmate to sleep, then two other drugs stopped the heart and lungs. But makers of sodium thiopental have stopped selling it for use in executions. Supplies mostly ran out or expired, forcing states to consider alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most states have retained the three-drug method but turned to pentobarbital as a replacement for sodium thiopental. Pentobarbital, a barbiturate used to treat anxiety and convulsive disorders such as epilepsy, has been used in roughly 50 executions over the past two years, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But its use may be short-lived as its maker also opposes selling it for use in executions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement announcing the change in Missouri said the decision was &#8220;due to the unavailability of sodium thiopental&#8221; but did not elaborate on why propofol was chosen. The protocol change was administrative and did not require legislative approval. The Corrections Department declined interview requests, but spokesman Chris Cline said Wednesday in a one-sentence statement, &#8220;Working with expert guidance, we are confident that this new one-drug protocol will be effective and appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It wasn&#8217;t clear when propofol would get its first use in an execution. None are scheduled in Missouri despite Attorney General Chris Koster&#8217;s request last week that the Missouri Supreme Court set execution dates for up to 19 condemned men whose appeals have run out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Litigation over Missouri&#8217;s new protocol is possible. Attorneys for death row inmates told The Associated Press that they are still gathering information on the new process and no decision has been made on whether to seek an injunction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Between 1989, when executions resumed in Missouri, and 2005, the state put to death 66 convicted killers. But in the seven years since, only two men have been executed &#8212; Dennis Skillicorn in 2009 and Martin Link last year. Use of the death penalty has declined sharply in recent years nationwide. The U.S. had 98 executions in 1999 but just 43 last year. Nearly 3,200 people remain on death row.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Propofol, made by AstraZeneca and marketed as Diprivan, gained notoriety following Jackson&#8217;s death in 2009. Spokespeople for AstraZeneca and its U.S. marketer, APP, declined comment on its use in executions. But Dieter questioned if enough research has been done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Any drug used for a new purpose on human subjects should certainly be tested very, very carefully,&#8221; Dieter said. &#8220;I can only imagine the things that might go wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding to the concern, some say, is Missouri&#8217;s written protocol which, like the one it replaced, does not require a physician to be part of the execution team. It states that a &#8220;physician, nurse, or pharmacist&#8221; prepares the chemicals, and a &#8220;physician, nurse or emergency medical technician &#8230; inserts intravenous lines, monitors the prisoner, and supervises the injection of lethal chemicals by nonmedical members of the execution team.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jonathan Groner, an Ohio State University surgeon who has studied lethal injection extensively, said propofol is typically administered by either an anesthesiologist, who is a physician, or a nurse anesthetist under the physician&#8217;s direct supervision. Improper administration could cause a burning sensation or pain at the injection site, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Groner said high doses of propofol will kill by causing respiratory arrest. But the dosage must be accurate and the process must move swiftly because propofol typically wears off in just a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;If they start breathing before the heart stops, they might not die,&#8221; Groner said. That would force the process to be restarted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Critics also question the safety of the single-drug method. Missouri becomes the third state with a single-drug protocol, along with Arizona and Ohio. Three others &#8212; South Dakota, Idaho and Washington &#8212; have options for single- or multiple-drug executions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. California and Kentucky are exploring a switch to the one-drug method.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Concerns were raised after a one-drug execution last month in Arizona. Thomas Arnold Kemp, a 63-year-old convicted killer, shook for several seconds upon receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The debate over the administration of lethal drugs has angered some capital punishment advocates who suggest that death row inmates &#8212; largely convicted killers &#8212; seem to get more compassion than their victims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Carol Angelbeck has spent years urging Missouri officials to pick up the pace on executions. Angelbeck&#8217;s 24-year-old daughter, Mindy Griffin, was raped and strangled by Michael Worthington, who broke into her suburban St. Louis condo in 1995. Worthington is awaiting execution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> &#8221;If they can&#8217;t find a drug they like, go to hanging,&#8221; Angelbeck said. &#8220;Maybe they should feel some pain and others would think twice about killing someone.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We Cannot Forget the lessons taught to us by Malcolm x and today we share a few words and videos that will remind you &#8211; in case you&#8217;ve forgotten.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A revolution is bloody. Revolution is hostile. Revolution knows no compromise. Revolution overturns and destroys everything that gets in its way. And you, sitting around here like a knot on the wall, saying, “I’m going to love these folks no matter how much they hate me.” No, you need a revolution. Whoever heard of a revolution where they lock arms, as Reverend Cleage was pointing out beautifully, singing “We Shall Overcome”? Just tell me. You don’t do that in a revolution. You don’t do any singing; you’re too busy swinging. It’s based on land. A revolutionary wants land so he can set up his own nation, an independent nation. These Negroes aren’t asking for no nation. They’re trying to crawl back on the plantation.”</p>

You bleed for white people. But when it comes time to seeing your own churches being bombed and little black girls be murdered, you haven’t got no blood. You bleed when the white man says bleed; you bite when the white man says bite; and you bark when the white man says bark. I hate to say this about us, but it’s true. How are you going to be nonviolent in Mississippi, as violent as you were in Korea? How can you justify being nonviolent in Mississippi and Alabama, when your churches are being bombed, and your little girls are being murdered, and at the same time you’re going to violent with Hitler, and Tojo, and somebody else that you don’t even know?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <span style="text-align: justify;">If violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad. If it’s wrong to be violent defending black women and black children and black babies and black men, then it’s wrong for America to draft us and make us violent abroad in defense of her. And if it is right for America to draft us, and teach us how to be violent in defense of her, then it is right for you and me to do whatever is necessary to defend our own people right here in this country.</span><span style="text-align: justify;">”</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">RIP Donna Summer Sudano</h1>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/large_lightbox/hash/1337371420_donna%20summer%203.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>She Was One of the Original BadGals, and will always be remembered as The One Who Worked Hard For Her Money.</em></strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.clickondetroit.com/image/view/-/13461566/medRes/1/-/pndr9mz/-/Donna-Summer-Dead-at-63-After-Cancer-Battle.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Donna had for many years lived in a Manhattan apartment near Ground Zero. This is where she was during the 9/1/2001 terrorist attacks. As was the case with many New Yorkers, Donna said that she was constantly exposed to airborne particles for the many months she lived in her apartment after the tragedy. This is what she believed caused her Lung Cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Friends and acquaintances say that after 9/11, Donna Summer became paranoid. Sources close to the diva said that she constantly sprayed disinfectant in the air, and used silk sheets to prevent dust from entering her New York apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually it all became too much. She sold her New York Apartment and relocate to Key West Florida &#8211; where she passed away this week; surrounded by family and close friends.</p>
<p><strong>Her family issued this statement after her passing :</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith. While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy. Words truly can&#8217;t express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><strong>We Remember Donna Summer &#8211; a voice for every season</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer" target="_blank">From the Donna Summer Wikipaedia</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LaDonna Adrian Gaines</strong> (December 31, 1948 – May 17, 2012<sup id="cite_ref-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>), known by the stage name <strong>Donna Summer</strong>, was an American singer-songwriter who gained prominence during the <a title="Disco" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco">disco</a> era of the late 1970s. She had a <a title="Mezzo-soprano" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> vocal range, and was a five-time<a title="Grammy Award" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award">Grammy Award</a> winner. Summer was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the U.S. <em><a title="Billboard 200" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200">Billboard</a></em> chart, and she also charted four number-one singles in the United States within a 13-month period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Diagnosed with <a title="Lung cancer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer">lung cancer</a>, Summer died on the morning of May 17, 2012, at her home in<a title="Key West, Florida" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West,_Florida">Key West, Florida</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer was born Ladonna Adrian Gaines on December 31, 1948 in <a title="Boston, Massachusetts" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> to parents Andrew and Mary Gaines and was one of seven children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She and her family were raised in the Boston neighborhood of <a title="Dorchester, Boston" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorchester,_Boston">Dorchester</a>. Her father, Andrew Gaines, was a butcher, and her mother Mary, was a schoolteacher.<sup id="cite_ref-biography1_1-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-biography1-1">[2]</a></sup> Summer&#8217;s mother later recalled that from the time she could talk, Summer would often sing: &#8220;She literally loved to sing. She used to go through the house singing, singing. She sang for breakfast and for lunch and for supper.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-biography1_1-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-biography1-1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer&#8217;s performance debut occurred at church when she was ten years old, when she replaced a vocalist who had failed to show up.<sup id="cite_ref-biography1_1-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-biography1-1">[2]</a></sup> Her priest invited Summer to perform, judging from her small frame and speaking voice that she would be an &#8220;amusing spectacle&#8221;, but instead Summer&#8217;s voice recalled a voice older than her years and frame.<sup id="cite_ref-biography1_1-3"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-biography1-1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer herself recalled that as she sang, &#8220;I started crying, everybody else started crying. It was quite an amazing moment in my life and at some point after I heard my voice came out I felt like God was saying to me &#8216;Donna, you&#8217;re going to be very, very famous&#8217; and I knew from that day on that I would be famous.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-biography1_1-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-biography1-1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer later attended Boston&#8217;s Jeremiah E. Burke High School, where she performed in school musicals and was considered popular.<sup id="cite_ref-biography1_1-5"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-biography1-1">[2]</a></sup> She was also something of a troublemaker, skipping home to attend parties, circumventing her parents&#8217; strict curfew.<sup id="cite_ref-biography1_1-6"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-biography1-1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1967, just weeks before graduation, Summer left for New York where she was a member of the <a title="Blues-rock" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues-rock">blues-rock</a> band, Crow. After they were passed by every record label, they agreed to break up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer stayed in New York and auditioned for a role in the <a title="Counterculture" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture">counterculture</a>musical, <em><a title="Hair (musical)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_(musical)">Hair</a></em>.  When <a title="Melba Moore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melba_Moore">Melba Moore</a> was cast in the part, Summer agreed to take the role in the <a title="Munich" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich">Munich</a> production of the show. She moved to <a title="Munich, Germany" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich,_Germany">Munich, Germany</a> after getting her parents&#8217; reluctant approval.<sup id="cite_ref-biography1_1-7"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-biography1-1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer eventually became fluent in <a title="German language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">German</a>, singing various songs in German. She participated in the musicals <em>Ich Bin Ich</em> (the German version of <em><a title="The Me Nobody Knows" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Me_Nobody_Knows">The Me Nobody Knows</a></em>), <em><a title="Godspell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godspell">Godspell</a></em> and <em><a title="Show Boat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_Boat">Show Boat</a></em>. Within three years, she moved to <a title="Vienna, Austria" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna,_Austria">Vienna, Austria</a> and joined the<a title="Vienna Volksoper" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Volksoper">Vienna Volksoper</a>. She briefly toured with an ensemble vocal group called FamilyTree, the creation of producer Guenter &#8220;Yogi&#8221; Lauke. In 1971, Summer released her first single, a cover of <a title="The Jaynetts" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jaynetts">The Jaynetts</a>&#8216; &#8220;<a title="Sally Go 'Round the Roses" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Go_%27Round_the_Roses">Sally Go &#8216;Round the Roses</a>&#8220;, from a one-off European deal with <a title="Decca Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decca_Records">Decca Records</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-donna-tribute1_2-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-donna-tribute1-2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1972, she issued the single, &#8220;If You Walkin&#8217; Alone&#8221; on <a title="Philips Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_Records">Philips Records</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-donna-tribute1_2-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-donna-tribute1-2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1974, she married Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer and had a daughter, Mimi, the following year. Citing marital problems caused by her affair with German artist (and future live-in boyfriend) Peter Mühldorfer, she divorced Helmuth. She kept his last name, but Anglicized it to &#8220;Summer&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She provided backing vocals on producer-keyboardist Veit Marvos on his 1972 Ariola Records release, <em>Nice to See You</em>, credited as &#8220;Gayn Pierre&#8221;. Several subsequent singles included Summer performing with the group, but she often denied singing on any of the Marvos releases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The name &#8220;Gayn Pierre&#8221; was also used by Donna while performing in <em>Godspell</em> with Helmuth Sommer during 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-donna-tribute1_2-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-donna-tribute1-2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2>1970s</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While singing background for the hit-making 1970s trio <a title="Three Dog Night" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Dog_Night">Three Dog Night</a>, Summer met producers <a title="Giorgio Moroder" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Moroder">Giorgio Moroder</a> and <a title="Pete Bellotte" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Bellotte">Pete Bellotte</a>. She eventually signed a deal with the European label Groovy Records and issued her first album, <em><a title="Lady of the Night (album)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Night_(album)">Lady of the Night</a></em>, in 1974. The album was not released in America, but found some limited European success on the strength of the song &#8220;<a title="The Hostage (song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hostage_(song)">The Hostage</a>&#8220;, which reached number one in <a title="Belgium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium">Belgium</a> and number two in the <a title="Netherlands" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1975, Summer approached Moroder with an idea for a song she and Bellotte were working on for another singer. She had come up with the lyric &#8220;love to love you, baby&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moroder was interested in developing the new sound that was becoming popular and used Summer&#8217;s lyric to develop the song. Moroder persuaded Summer to record what was to be a demo track for another performer. She later said that she had thought of how the song might sound if <a title="Marilyn Monroe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> had sung it and began cooing the lyrics. To get into the mood of recording the song, she requested Moroder turn off the lights while they sat on a sofa with him inducing her moans and groans. After hearing playback of the song, Moroder felt Summer&#8217;s version should actually be released.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The song was then sent to <a title="Casablanca Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_Records">Casablanca Records</a> president <a title="Neil Bogart" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Bogart">Neil Bogart</a> in hopes of getting an American release. Bogart informed Summer and Moroder he would release the song (now called &#8220;<a title="Love to Love You Baby (song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_to_Love_You_Baby_(song)">Love to Love You Baby</a>&#8220;) but requested that Moroder produce a longer version for discothèques. Moroder, Bellotte, and Summer returned with a 17 minute version and Casablanca signed Summer and released the single in November 1975.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shorter version of the single was promoted to radio stations while clubs regularly played the 17 minute version (the longer version would also appear on the album).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Casablanca became one of the first record labels to popularize the 12&#8243; single format. By early 1976, &#8220;Love to Love You Baby&#8221; had reached <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 on the US <a title="Billboard Hot 100" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100">Billboard Hot 100</a>, while the <a title="Love to Love You Baby" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_to_Love_You_Baby">parent album of the same name</a> sold over a million copies. The song generated controversy due to Summer&#8217;s moans and groans and some American and European radio stations, including the BBC, refused to play it.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup> &#8221;Love to Love You Baby&#8221; found chart success in several European countries, and made the Top 5 in the United Kingdom despite the BBC ban.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other upcoming singles included &#8220;Try Me, I Know We Can Make It&#8221;, US <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 80; &#8220;<a title="Could It Be Magic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Could_It_Be_Magic">Could It Be Magic</a>&#8220;, US <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 52; &#8220;<a title="Spring Affair" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Affair">Spring Affair</a>&#8220;, US <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 58; and &#8220;<a title="Winter Melody" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Melody">Winter Melody</a>&#8220;, US <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 43. The subsequent albums <em><a title="Love Trilogy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Trilogy">Love Trilogy</a></em> and <em><a title="Four Seasons of Love" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Seasons_of_Love">Four Seasons of Love</a></em> both went gold in the US.</p>

<p><strong>Summer in the recording studio, 1977</strong></div>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1977, Summer released the concept album <em><a title="I Remember Yesterday" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Remember_Yesterday">I Remember Yesterday</a></em>. This album included her second top ten single, &#8220;<a title="I Feel Love" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Feel_Love">I Feel Love</a>&#8220;, which reached number six in the US and number one in the UK. Another concept album, also released in 1977, was <em><a title="Once Upon a Time (Donna Summer album)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_(Donna_Summer_album)">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, a double album which told of a modern-day <a title="Cinderella" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella">Cinderella</a> &#8221;rags to riches&#8221; story through the elements of orchestral disco and ballads. This album would also attain gold status.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1978, Summer released her version of the <a title="Jimmy Webb" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Webb">Jimmy Webb</a> ballad, &#8220;<a title="MacArthur Park (song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacArthur_Park_(song)">MacArthur Park</a>&#8220;, which became her first US number one hit. The song was featured on Summer&#8217;s first live album, <em><a title="Live and More" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_and_More">Live and More</a></em>, which also became her first album to hit number one on the US <a title="Billboard 200" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200">Billboard 200</a> chart, and went platinum selling over a million copies. Other studio tracks included the top ten hit, &#8220;<a title="Heaven Knows (Donna Summer song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Knows_(Donna_Summer_song)">Heaven Knows</a>&#8220;, which featured the group <a title="Brooklyn Dreams (group)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Dreams_(group)">Brooklyn Dreams</a> accompanying her on background and <a title="Joe Esposito (singer)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Esposito_(singer)">Joe &#8220;Bean&#8221; Esposito</a> singing alongside her on the verses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer would later be romantically involved with Brooklyn Dreams singer <a title="Bruce Sudano" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sudano">Bruce Sudano</a> and the couple married two years after the song&#8217;s release.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also in 1978, Summer acted in the film, <em><a title="Thank God It's Friday" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_God_It%27s_Friday">Thank God It&#8217;s Friday</a></em>, playing a singer determined to perform at a hot disco club. The film met modest success, but a song from the film, titled &#8220;<a title="Last Dance (song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Dance_(song)">Last Dance</a>&#8220;, reached number three on the Hot 100 and resulted in Summer winning her first <a title="Grammy Award" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award">Grammy Award</a>. Its writer, <a title="Paul Jabara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jabara">Paul Jabara</a>, won an <a title="Academy Award" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award">Academy Award</a> for the composition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1979, Summer performed at the world-televised <a title="Music for UNICEF Concert" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_for_UNICEF_Concert">Music for UNICEF Concert</a>, joining contemporaries such as <a title="Abba" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abba">Abba</a>, <a title="Olivia Newton-John" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Newton-John">Olivia Newton-John</a>, the <a title="Bee Gees" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Gees">Bee Gees</a>, <a title="Andy Gibb" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Gibb">Andy Gibb</a>, <a title="Rod Stewart" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart">Rod Stewart</a>, <a title="John Denver" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Denver">John Denver</a>, <a title="Earth, Wind &amp; Fire" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth,_Wind_%26_Fire">Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</a>, <a title="Rita Coolidge" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Coolidge">Rita Coolidge</a> and <a title="Kris Kristofferson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a> for an hour&#8217;s TV special that raised funds and awareness for the world&#8217;s children. Artists donated royalties of certain songs, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bad Girls</em> and the break from disco</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer began work on her next project with Moroder and Bellotte, <em><a title="Bad Girls (album)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Girls_(album)">Bad Girls</a></em>, an album that had been in production for nearly two years. Summer based the whole concept on prostitution (revisiting the theme for 1974&#8242;s <em>Lady of the Night</em>), even dressing as a <a title="Street prostitution" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_prostitution">hooker</a>herself on the cover art. The album became a huge success, spawning the number one hits &#8220;<a title="Hot Stuff (Donna Summer song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Stuff_(Donna_Summer_song)">Hot Stuff</a>&#8221; and <a title="Bad Girls (song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Girls_(song)">the title track</a> and the number two &#8220;<a title="Dim All the Lights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_All_the_Lights">Dim All the Lights</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With &#8220;MacArthur Park&#8221;, &#8220;Hot Stuff&#8221;, &#8220;Bad Girls&#8221;, and the <a title="Barbra Streisand" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> duet &#8220;<a title="No More Tears (Enough is Enough)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_More_Tears_(Enough_is_Enough)">No More Tears (Enough is Enough)</a>&#8220;, Summer achieved four number one hits within a thirteen month period. Those aforementioned songs, along with &#8220;Heaven Knows&#8221;, &#8220;Last Dance&#8221;, &#8220;Dim All the Lights&#8221;, and &#8220;<a title="On the Radio (Donna Summer song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Radio_(Donna_Summer_song)">On the Radio</a>&#8221; (from her upcoming double-album) would give her eight US Top 5 singles within a two year period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Hot Stuff&#8221; later won her a second Grammy in the <a title="Best Female Rock Vocal Performance" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Female_Rock_Vocal_Performance">Best Female Rock Vocal Performance</a>, the first time the category was included. That year, Summer played eight sold-out nights at the <a title="Universal Amphitheater" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Amphitheater">Universal Amphitheater</a> in Los Angeles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer released <em><a title="On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I &amp; II" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Radio:_Greatest_Hits_Volumes_I_%26_II">On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I &amp; II</a></em>, her first (international) greatest hits set in 1979. The double album reached number one in the US, becoming her third consecutive number one album. A new song from the compilation, &#8220;On the Radio&#8221;, reached the US top five, selling over a million copies in the U.S. alone.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">1980s</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the release of the greatest hits album, Summer wanted to branch out into other musical styles in addition to disco, which led to tensions between her and Casablanca Records. Sensing that they could no longer come to terms, Summer and the label parted ways in 1980, and she signed with <a title="Geffen Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geffen_Records">Geffen Records</a>, the new label started by <a title="David Geffen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geffen">David Geffen</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer&#8217;s first release on Geffen Records was <em><a title="The Wanderer (Donna Summer song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wanderer_(Donna_Summer_song)">The Wanderer</a></em>, which replaced the disco sound of Summer&#8217;s previous releases with more of the burgeoning <a title="New Wave music" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_music">New Wave</a> sound and elements of <a title="Rock music" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music">rock</a>, such as the material being recorded at this time by <a title="Pat Benatar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Benatar">Pat Benatar</a>. The album achieved gold status in the US, and the title track (released as the first single) peaked at <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 in the US, though subsequent singles were only moderate hits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer&#8217;s projected second Geffen release, entitled <em><a title="I'm a Rainbow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_a_Rainbow">I&#8217;m a Rainbow</a></em>, was shelved by Geffen Records (though two of the album&#8217;s songs would surface in soundtracks of the 1980s films <em><a title="Fast Times at Ridgemont High" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Times_at_Ridgemont_High">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</a></em> and <em><a title="Flashdance" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashdance">Flashdance</a></em>). Summer reluctantly parted company with Moroder after seven years working together as Geffen had recruited <a title="Quincy Jones" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones">Quincy Jones</a> to produce her next album, 1982&#8242;s <em><a title="Donna Summer (album)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer_(album)">Donna Summer</a></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The album had taken a lengthy six months to record. The album&#8217;s first single, &#8220;<a title="Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Is_in_Control_(Finger_on_the_Trigger)">Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)</a>&#8220;, became an American top ten hit on the Hot 100, followed by more moderate hits &#8220;<a title="State of Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Independence">State of Independence</a>&#8221; (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 41 pop) and &#8220;<a title="The Woman in Me (Donna Summer song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_in_Me_(Donna_Summer_song)">The Woman in Me</a>&#8221; (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 33 pop). Problems then increased between Summer and Geffen Records after they were notified by <a title="Polygram Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygram_Records">Polygram Records</a>, Summer&#8217;s former label Casablanca was by then a wholly owned subsidiary, that she needed to deliver them one more album to fulfill her contract with them. Summer delivered the album, <em><a title="She Works Hard for the Money" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Works_Hard_for_the_Money">She Works Hard for the Money</a></em>, and Polygram released it on its <a title="Mercury Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Records">Mercury</a>imprint in 1983.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The title song became a hit reaching number three on the US Hot 100, and would provide Summer with a Grammy nomination. The album also featured the <a title="Reggae" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae">reggae</a>-flavored UK Top 20 hit &#8220;<a title="Unconditional Love (Donna Summer song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconditional_Love_(Donna_Summer_song)">Unconditional Love</a>&#8220;, which featured the British group <a title="Musical Youth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Youth">Musical Youth</a> who were riding high from the success of their single &#8220;<a title="Pass the Dutchie" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Dutchie">Pass the Dutchie</a>&#8220;. The third US single, &#8220;Love Has A Mind of Its Own&#8221;, reached the top forty of the Billboard R&amp;B chart. The album itself was certified gold.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In late 1984, with her obligation to Polygram complete, Summer returned on Geffen Records with her next release. Geffen, wanting to keep the momentum going, enlisted <em>She Works Hard for the Money&#8217;</em>s producer <a title="Michael Omartian" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Omartian">Michael Omartian</a> to produce <em><a title="Cats Without Claws" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_Without_Claws">Cats Without Claws</a></em>. The album, however, was not as successful as <em>She Works Hard for the Money</em> and failed to attain gold status of 500,000 copies sold in the US, becoming her first album since her 1974 debut not to do so. It did include a moderate hit in &#8220;<a title="There Goes My Baby (The Drifters song)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Goes_My_Baby_(The_Drifters_song)">There Goes My Baby</a>&#8220;, which peaked at <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 21.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Controversy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the mid 1980s, Summer was embroiled in a controversy. She had allegedly made anti-gay remarks regarding the then-relatively new disease, <a title="AIDS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a>, which as a result had a significantly negative impact on her career and saw thousands of her records being returned to her record company by angered fans. Summer, by this time a <a title="Born-again Christian" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-again_Christian">born-again Christian</a>, was alleged to have said that AIDS was a punishment from God for the immoral lifestyles of homosexuals.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-5">[6]</a></sup> However, she denied that she had ever made any such comment and, in a letter to the AIDS campaign group <a title="ACT UP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_UP">ACT UP</a> in 1989, she said that it was &#8220;a terrible misunderstanding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was unknowingly protected by those around me from the bad press and hate letters&#8230; If I have caused you pain, forgive me.&#8221; She went on to apologize for the delay in refuting the rumours and closed her letter with Bible quotes (from Chapter 13 of <a title="First Epistle to the Corinthians" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians">1 Corinthians</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-6">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also in 1989, Summer told <em><a title="The Advocate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Advocate">The Advocate</a></em> magazine that &#8220;A couple of the people I write with are gay, and they have been ever since I met them. What people want to do with their bodies is their personal preference.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-OutSmart_7-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-OutSmart-7">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A couple of years later she filed a lawsuit against <em><a title="New York (magazine)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)">New York</a></em> magazine when it reprinted the rumours as fact just as she was about to release her album <em>Mistaken Identity</em> in 1991.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-8">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">European success</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1987, Summer returned with the album <em><a title="All Systems Go (Donna Summer album)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Systems_Go_(Donna_Summer_album)">All Systems Go</a></em>, which did not sell well, becoming her second consecutive album not to achieve gold status. It featured the single &#8220;<a title="Dinner with Gershwin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner_with_Gershwin">Dinner with Gershwin</a>&#8221; (written by <a title="Brenda Russell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Russell">Brenda Russell</a>), which was only a minor US hit, though it peaked at <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 13 in the UK. The album&#8217;s title track, &#8220;All Systems Go&#8221;, was released only in the UK where it peaked at <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 54.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Summer&#8217;s next album, Geffen Records hired the British hit production team of <a title="Stock Aitken Waterman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_Aitken_Waterman">Stock Aitken Waterman</a> (or <em>SAW</em>), who had enjoyed incredible success by writing and producing for such acts as <a title="Kylie Minogue" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a>, <a title="Dead or Alive (band)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_or_Alive_(band)">Dead or Alive</a>, <a title="Bananarama" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananarama">Bananarama</a>, and <a title="Rick Astley" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Astley">Rick Astley</a> among others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, Geffen decided not to release the album, entitled <em><a title="Another Place and Time" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Place_and_Time">Another Place and Time</a></em>, and Summer and Geffen Records parted ways in 1988.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The album was released in Europe in March 1989 on <a title="Warner Bros. Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>, which had been Summer&#8217;s label in Europe since 1982. The single &#8220;<a title="This Time I Know It's for Real" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Time_I_Know_It%27s_for_Real">This Time I Know It&#8217;s for Real</a>&#8221; had become a top ten hit in several countries in Europe, prompting the Warner Bros. subsidiary company <a title="Atlantic Records" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records">Atlantic Records</a> to sign Summer in the US and pick up the album for a North American release soon after.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The single peaked at <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 7 on the Hot 100 in the US, and became her twelfth gold single there. It was also Summer&#8217;s final Top 40 hit on the American pop charts, though she scored two more UK hits from the album, &#8220;<a title="I Don't Wanna Get Hurt" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Wanna_Get_Hurt">I Don&#8217;t Wanna Get Hurt</a>&#8221; (UK <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 7) and &#8220;<a title="Love's About to Change My Heart" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love%27s_About_to_Change_My_Heart">Love&#8217;s About to Change My Heart</a>&#8221; (UK <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 20).</p>

The album achieved Gold status in the UK, where &#8220;State of Independence&#8221; had been re-released to promote it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1991, Summer released the <a title="New jack swing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_jack_swing">new jack swing</a> style album <em><a title="Mistaken Identity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistaken_Identity">Mistaken Identity</a></em>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of Summer&#8217;s dance releases including &#8220;Carry On&#8221; (her first collaboration with Moroder in a decade) and &#8220;<a title="Melody of Love (Wanna Be Loved)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_of_Love_(Wanna_Be_Loved)">Melody of Love (Wanna Be Loved)</a>&#8221; charted on the US Dance Chart, with &#8220;Melody of Love&#8221; reaching number one on that chart and also reaching number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer, in a 2008 interview with <em><a title="The Daily Telegraph" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></em>, claimed that one month before the <a title="September 11 Attacks" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_Attacks">September 11 Attacks</a> she had a <a title="Premonition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premonition">premonition</a>that they would occur.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer was living in Manhattan at the time of the attacks. In the same interview she said for a period of time after the attacks she was so depressed she was unable to leave her bedroom and left her blinds closed.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer#cite_note-9">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2004, Summer was inducted to the <a title="Dance Music Hall of Fame" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Music_Hall_of_Fame">Dance Music Hall of Fame</a> alongside the <a title="Bee Gees" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Gees">Bee Gees</a> and <a title="Barry Gibb" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Gibb">Barry Gibb</a> as an artist.

The songs &#8220;<a title="I'm a Fire" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_a_Fire">I&#8217;m a Fire</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a title="Stamp Your Feet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Your_Feet">Stamp Your Feet</a>&#8220;, and &#8220;<a title="Fame (The Game)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fame_(The_Game)">Fame (The Game)</a>&#8221; reached number one on the US Billboard Dance Chart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ballad &#8220;Sand on My Feet&#8221; was released to adult contemporary stations and reached number thirty on that chart. While commenting on the album, Summer said &#8220;I wanted this album to have a lot of different directions on it. I did not want it to be any ones&#8217; baby. I just wanted it to be a sampler of flavors and influences from all over the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s a touch of this, a little smidgeon of that, a dash of something else&#8230;like when you&#8217;re cooking.&#8221; On the song &#8220;The Queen Is Back&#8221;, Summer reveals her wry and witty self-awareness of her musical legacy and her public persona. &#8220;I&#8217;m making fun of myself,&#8221; she admits. &#8220;There&#8217;s irony, it&#8217;s poking fun at the idea of being called a queen. That&#8217;s a title that has followed me, followed me, and followed me. We were sitting and writing and that title kept popping up in my mind and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8216;Am I supposed to write this? Is this too arrogant to write?&#8217; But people call me &#8216;the queen,&#8217; so I guess it&#8217;s ok to refer to myself as what everybody else refers to me as. We started writing the song and thought it was kind of cute and funny.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer wrote &#8220;The Queen Is Back&#8221; and &#8220;Mr. Music&#8221; with <a title="J. R. Rotem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Rotem">J. R.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer was the first artist to have three double albums reach No. 1 on <em>Billboard&#8217;</em>s album chart: <em>Live and More</em>, <em>Bad Girls</em>, and <em>On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I &amp; II</em>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike some other stars of disco who faded as the music became less popular, Summer was able to grow beyond it and later segued to a pop-rock sound. She had one of her biggest hits in the 1980s with &#8220;She Works Hard For the Money&#8221;, which became another anthem, this time for <a title="Women's rights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights">women&#8217;s rights</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p id="story_continues_1" style="text-align: justify;">The woman who would become known as the Queen of Disco, Donna Summer, was born in Massachusetts in 1948.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She began her life in the spotlight as a backing singer for 1970s trio Three Dog Night, releasing her first solo album in 1974.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her first US chart success came in 1975 with Love To Love You Baby, which raised eyebrows with its erotic lyrics and sultry vocals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She went on to become one of the defining voices of the era with a string of hits including I Feel Love, State of Independence, Bad Girls and She Works Hard For The Money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Skyscraping blend&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Music critic Garry Mulholland described her voice in her 1977 song I Feel Love as a &#8220;skyscraping blend of American gospel and light opera&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;On the radio, I Feel Love&#8217;s insistent ethereality smothered the orchestral funk of US disco and stood out so completely you found yourself riveted by its awe and its glowing ache. On the dance floor, the effect was even more profound,&#8221; he wrote in his book This Is Uncool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She notched up a stack of awards during her long career, and had 19 number one US chart hits between 1975-2008.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She had five Grammys to her name and was also the first artist to have three consecutive double albums to reach number one in the US charts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike many disco stars, Summer was able to move beyond the genre and develop a more pop-rock sound.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her style and her music shaped the dance music that was to follow, influencing David Bowie, as well as bands like Duran Duran.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/60312000/jpg/_60312500_donna_summer_ap_1979.jpg" alt="Donna Summer " width="226" height="282" /><strong>Donna Summer won many awards, including three at the American Music Awards in 1979</strong></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Rolling Stone lists I Feel Love as one of the top 500 singles of all time.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Its impact on dance music is incalculable. When Brian Eno first listened to this, he told David Bowie, &#8216;I&#8217;ve heard the sound of the future&#8217;. Thanks to Giorgio Moroder&#8217;s throbbing Moog synthesisers and Summer&#8217;s epic vocals, I Feel Love claimed tomorrow in the name of disco.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It all began when she stood up in church one Sunday in Boston and began to sing, reducing her father to tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I discovered right then that God had blessed me. I had a talent. I knew I was going to be great,&#8221;<a title="Washington Post: 'Interview with Donna Summer, 1978'" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/arts-post/post/donna-summer-dies--remembering-the-disco-queen-through-the-post-archives/2012/05/17/gIQAYz0GWU_blog.html"> she told the Washington Post in a 1978 interview</a>, when she was at the height of her fame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Frenzy&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But she wasn&#8217;t always comfortable with the success, describing returning from a period in Europe to the US as walking &#8220;into this commotion&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I got off the plane and there was all this frenzy. I didn&#8217;t understand it, I was shocked and I almost had a nervous breakdown.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2003, she said success had initially taken her by surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I was going through a lot of adversity right up until that point and then one day there was a knock at the door and everything changed and I went from being a victim to being celebrated and the mental adjustment and the internal adjustment did not follow that quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;It took me years to bring that other person up to the standard of what was going on in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1980s, Summer became a born-again Christian. At the time, she attracted controversy when she was accused of making anti-gay comments about the Aids epidemic that was raging at the time. She denied making the remarks but was nonetheless subjected to a boycott.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Later in the same decade, Summer teamed up with British producers Stock Aitken Waterman for an album that included the hit This Time I Know It&#8217;s For Real.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wary of the &#8216;Queen of Disco&#8217; title, Summer successfully reinvented her musical style throughout her career.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I am actually the first woman &#8211; not black woman &#8211; but woman, period, to get a rock-and-roll Grammy,&#8221; she told the Windy City Times in 2009. &#8220;I don&#8217;t take it as an insult but I am still working and there are fields that I haven&#8217;t conquered yet. I won&#8217;t stop until someone says, &#8216;It&#8217;s over.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She continued to work until the end of her life. Her last LP album, Crayons, was released in 2008, after a 17-year break.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That year, she also performed on American Idol, and a year later, sang at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Born LaDonna Adrian Gaines, she acquired her stage name from her 1973 marriage to Austrian actor Helmuth Sommer, with whom she had fallen in love two years earlier while both were appearing in the musical Godspell in Austria.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple had a daughter, Mimi Sommer, but the marriage did not last, ending in divorce in 1975.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1980, she married again, this time to musician Bruce Sudano, with whom she had two daughters, Brooklyn and Amanda.</p>

<h2><em>No One Will Ever Forget This Voice</em></h2>

<p><strong>This was the original theme song for BadGalsRadio.com</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just Listen to her voice &#8211; she had magnificent range and strength. It was taken from us, as she was just reaching her peak.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Donna will always be remembered as another casualty of 911.</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her apartment was near the world trade center when it collapsed in september of 2001. She said to many people that the lung cancer she sucumbed to was due to the close proximity of her apartment to the world trade center. It&#8217;s reported that she complained about the smell and the heaviness of the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually she moved out of the apartment &#8211; but not before the damage had been done.  She relocated and lived the rest of her life in florida.  when she was diagnosed with Lung Cancer, she told many people that she believed it originated from the 911 dust;  that drove her from her beloved new york.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We saw her perform in ny at the Roseland Ballroom in the late 1970&#8242;s.  We also caught her sneaking in on a Sylvester set at Paradise Garage in ny.  It was always a party when she showed up on the set. Her fun sweet manner made her an instant icon. She was loved by all who met and knew her.  We can never forget her and we&#8217;ll forever associate her voice with Good Times.</p>
<h2><em>Donna Summer Saldano will forever be our voice of Summer,</em></h2>

<p>This chart puts it in language anyone can understand. Bush Was a Bloody Bully; and Obama is trying to Get Along.</p>
<p><strong>Take a Look at This Chart &#8211; From NPR Today</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/05/14/152671813/50-years-of-government-spending-in-1-graph?sc=fb&amp;cc=fp"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m42ipi0ypj1qd9dz2o1_500.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="700" /></a></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can clearly see that America has spent more playing badly than providing for it&#8217;s own internal needs. Why ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is what should be asked of the folks who were in charge during these peak spending years for defense.  Until america puts Education, and Social Welfare programs into it&#8217;s priority list &#8211; life in america will continue to slip into the red zone.  The chart shows clearly how much this small amount of money matters to the budgeters &#8211; at the end of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How can those who are elected think that social welfare and education are to follow defense spending ?</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Happened to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Sound</em></span> Domestic Policy ?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If social welfare programs and education are ignored, how will the defense picture be impacted;  should be the question at this point.  How can you train soldiers if they don&#8217;t have primary education &#8211; which in america is a right. But not according to the actions of congress; If they continue to cut funding &#8211; as they clearly do each session.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Today this was in <a href="http://theatlantic.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">the Atlantic</a></strong> -</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The other part of the student debt crisis is all of the debt that students aren’t taking on because they’re not going to college. College grads still earn more, work longer, and are employed at higher rates than everybody else. Their investment — that is, their debt — benefits the country at large in the form of a more-skilled workforce, higher productivity, higher GDP, more taxes, and so on. Newspapers can’t report on this part of the student debt crisis, because there is no headline statistic to report on. You can’t put a number on how much money some promising inner-city student is giving up in lifetime earnings by not attending college or how much it’s taking away from federal income taxes through 2030. But just because those statistics are invisible don’t mean they’re not real.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>They can&#8217;t even agree on helping those who are the poorest &#8211; student loan debtors</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Did you know <span style="color: #ff0000;">they can now garnish your social security and disability payments</span> from the government &#8211; <span style="color: #ff0000;">for back student loans.</span>   </strong></em><strong>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yes they are doing it</span> now.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you feed the poor who are destined to join the miltary as their step up in life, if you cut primary food programs such as food stamps and school lunch subsidys ?  where will the soldiers come from who can&#8217;t read to operate the machinery ?  and who will teach them to read when they have to operate the machinery ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>This was in <a href="http://think-progress.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Think Progress</a> today - </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that if generals continue to run the united states budget; pretty soon there will be no more soldiers or citizens. They&#8217;ll all die from hunger and the lack of skills employable skills.  Just ask a now citizen former soldier &#8211; who&#8217;s homeless.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Today we should all remember Sybrina Fulton &#8211; the mother who lost her child Trayvon.</strong></p>
<h2>Please Watch the Video for Sybrina&#8217;s Message</h2>
<p><object width="500" height="284" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/m_4HHcOHBfU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="500" height="284" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/m_4HHcOHBfU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We Join Sybrina in asking for a second look at Stand Your Ground Laws across the US. Call your legislators if you live in a stand your ground state and ask them to re-examine the laws and to put in place safeguards so that sentencing and definition match the actual crime.  More on that shortly</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t106/OnlyObvious/ALEC/Stand_your_ground_States_500.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also want to ask you to remember another victim of the Stand Your Ground laws in Florida &#8211; Sister Marissa Alexander. Her husband had previously been placed under an order of protection.  Yet he came to the home of Marissa to abuse her once again.  He told her He Was Going To Kill Her.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.forgottenmajority.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Marissa-and-child1.jpeg" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a four day old baby, Marissa didn&#8217;t want to take another beating, so she stood her ground. Now she&#8217;s facing twenty years in jail for doing so.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Bear In Mind that She Didn&#8217;t Shoot Him &#8211; and that He Told Her He Was Going To Kill Her</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This should tell you just how unevenly this law is applied. If it applied for George Zimmerman to kill Trayvon Martin; and not for Marissa Alexander to fire <em>a warning shot</em> at her already convicted abuser; we need to understand why.</p>
<p><img src="http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/photo1-e1336834193171.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">There Is Something Very Wrong With This Picture</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There can be no more ignoring and pretending. It&#8217;s time to become a voice in the discussion on these deadly laws. Otherwise we will just continue to be victims <em>for Standing Our Ground</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://downtownjax.firstcoastnews.com/news/news/77605-marissa-alexanders-retrial-motion-denied">Marissa Alexander learned her numerous motions for a retrial were denied Thursday morning by Circuit Court Judge James Daniel.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A packed Duval County courtroom listened as the judge heard arguments as to why Alexander should be granted a new trial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier Thursday morning, a group of supporters gathered to hold signs and hope to encourage the judge to grant Alexander a new trial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Former victims of domestic violence were among the group, which was there to speak out not only on behalf of Alexander, but for other victims of domestic violence as well. Their fear is that by prosecuting Alexander, other victims may become fearful of leaving an abusive relationship or defending themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marissa Alexander was convicted on three counts of aggravated assault after firing a warning shot at her ex-husband inside their home in August 2010.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>At the time, Alexander had already taken out a protective order against her ex-husband earlier that year when he was arrested for physically abusing her.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So when a fight started in their master bedroom, Alexander told police she feared for her life. Motions filed by the State Attorney&#8217;s office state Alexander was the aggressor, not her husband. However, her defense attorney argues Alexander&#8217;s ex-husband said he was going to kill her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alexander&#8217;s attorney, Kevin Cobbin, wanted a new trial based on Florida&#8217;s Stand Your Ground law and said that it should have applied in this case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Judge Daniel disagreed in making his ruling before a packed courtroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the hearing, Cobbin said the Stand Your Ground law is not always applied fairly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&#8220;The law was made for people like Ms. Alexander. They did not make it for people running around on the streets shooting people. They made it for women in their homes trying to defended themselves against abusive mean men,&#8221; said Cobbin.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of leaving, Alexander did return to the kitchen and fired a single shot into the ceiling with her ex-husband and his two small children in the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">State Attorney Angela Corey says she met with Alexander and her attorney before the trial, along with the victims, to personally review the circumstances of the shooting and the self defense claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Corey says the defendant, Alexander, was offered a plea deal of three years. Corey said Alexander did not accept the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prosecutor Nick Lake said following the hearing, &#8220;The jury decided she was not in fear when she fired the gun. She went back to his house, alone, and committed a domestic battery on him (ex-husband).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marissa Alexander&#8217;s sentencing has been scheduled for Friday, May 11. Her attorney, Kevin Cobbin, says he plans to file an appeal following her sentencing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alexander faces a sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>

<h2>When will we stop being the planned victims ?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the wake of the killing of  Trayvon Martin &#8230; The Koch bros. who manufacture paper products are paying for Trayvons killer George Zimmerman&#8217;s legal fees. They say it&#8217;s because they feel he had legal right to bear arms and shoot Trayvon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are asking that people everywhere ban together with us and pass this information on and not purchase any of the following items because your money will be paying for Zimmermans legal fees.</p>
<h2>Please do not purchase any of the following items :</h2>
<ul>
<li>Angel soft toilet paper</li>
<li>Brawny paper towel</li>
<li>Dixie plates,bowls napkins cups</li>
<li>Mardi gras napkins and towels</li>
<li>Quilted northern toilet paper</li>
<li>Soft and gentle toilet paper</li>
<li>Sparkle napkins</li>
<li>Vanity fair napkins</li>
<li>Zero napkins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We must all remember our sisters today.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Please re post and re send this message to everyone so that we can work this out quickly.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today we want you to take a moment and enjoy a new dramatic comedy parody series we discovered. <strong>It&#8217;s called<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LaBelleOfTheBall2/videos" target="_blank"> Got 2 B Real</a>.</strong> Check This Out it&#8217;s better than Basketball Wives with Female Celebrities &#8211; Throwin Shade, Pew Pewww</p>

<p>It almost kills me when at 3:52 Rihanna says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;This is the time where we ask her for Receipt because I&#8217;m not even sure Beyonce has the right to vote</strong>&#8220;</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOO Jesus NOOO.. Damn that was a big ass coconut Rih-Rih.  Then just moments later Dionne says:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>&#8220;Beyonce Damn Girl, your fans is like jehovas&#8217; witnesses&#8217; you can&#8217;t get they ass to go away&#8221;..</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">my my my I need to wipe my face because I&#8217;m cryin. The next receipt is requested by Aretha from Patty &#8211; Yes she does. it&#8217;s more than anyone can watch without running it back several times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another of my most favorite shade moments comes at 6:51 when Rih-Rih mentions Mariahs&#8217; recent Jennie Craig commercials.  Mariah replies with midnight -</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna read you through Transitions lenses. I can do this all day, all night I promise you&#8221;.  </em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Oh Whiplash !</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Whitney Houston Hologram is unbelievable.  It&#8217;s almost like she&#8217;s coming direct from Heaven.  She is a side character which adds spice even as you ask  yourself why she is skyping in. Yes you have Divas and they are hilarious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the 2:45 mark the shade begins to thicken quickly on Mary J&#8217;s Burger King Chicken Commercial. This is sublime.  Mary J goes off. but it hits the fan when Toni says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;she should have just tap danced for watermelon slices in front of the NAACP Headquarters.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><object width="500" height="284" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q6OJBjCJLx4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="500" height="284" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q6OJBjCJLx4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It really shows you how intense the shade is when Mary J&#8217;s hair flips to the other side at the 3:49 mark. wow they really take the time to put in a lot of small details which show you how much fun they&#8217;re having doing this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>It&#8217;s so refreshing when Mary J snaps back at Toni and says</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;Wat&#8217;n nobody even talking to you Toni Broketon. I&#8217;m looking at you right now. you can&#8217;t afford a backdrop. You sitting there in front of a blank ass screen. Like you are a PSA for Flop Insurance.&#8221; </em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">BANG !</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The brilliant young producers should surely get at least a job working for some film company;  after this circulates a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is written and performed mostly by Men from what we can tell. It&#8217;s just enough Diva for me. I wonder what Patty, Aretha, Dion, Mariah, Janet, Beyonce, Rihanna, Chaka, Toni, Diana, Fantasia, Nicki, Christina, Queen B and Lady Gaga have to say about the parodies of themselves.</p>

<p><strong>What The Fuck &#8211; Dead Baby Pills ?  Please Jesus Take The Wheel</strong></p>

<li>More than 17,000 pills smuggled into country have been intercepted since last August</li>

<p><strong>PUBLISHED:</strong> 05:44 EST, 7 May 2012 | <strong>UPDATED:</strong> 06:49 EST, 8 May 2012</p>
<p>Thousands of pills filled with powdered human flesh have been discovered by customs officials in South Korea, it was revealed today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The capsules are in demand because they are viewed as being a medicinal &#8216;cure-all&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The grim trade is being run from China where corrupt medical staff are said to be tipping off medical companies when babies are aborted or delivered still-born.</p>
<div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/07/article-2140702-12F7EF37000005DC-814_468x330.jpg" alt="Dead baby pills: This is ground baby powder which tests discovered is 99.7 per cent human last year.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dead baby pills: This is ground baby powder which tests discovered is 99.7 per cent human last year. South Korean officials have stopped 17,000 dead baby pills being imported since last August</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tiny corpses are then bought, stored in household refrigerators in homes of those involved in the trade before they are removed and taken to clinics where they are placed in medical drying microwaves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the skin is tinder dry, it is pummelled into powder and then processed into capsules along with herbs to disguise the true ingredients from health investigators and customs officers.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> This Bust has shocked even hardened customs agents who have pledged to strengthen inspections.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chinese officials are understood to have been aware of the trade and have tried to stop the capsules being exported but thousands of packets of them have been smuggled through to South Korea.</p>
<div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/07/article-2140702-12F8F0DA000005DC-250_468x311.jpg" alt="Danger: The Chinese Ministry of Health has launched an investigation into the alleged production of pills made from dead babies" width="468" height="311" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Danger: The Chinese Ministry of Health has launched an investigation into the alleged production of pills made from dead babies</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a huge demand for alternative Chinese remedies &#8211; which include ground up rhino horns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chinese have historically consumed human placentas to improve blood supply and circulation.</p>
<div>
<h3>ENDANGERED SPECIES IN CHINESE MEDICINES</h3>
<div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/07/article-2140702-000AAEAB00000258-361_223x193.jpg" alt="Rhino horns" width="223" height="193" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chinese alternative medicines contain traces of endangered species, a study has found.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of the remedies are more than 2,000 years old &#8211; and claim to be alternative methods for curing disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The use of rhino horns in Chinese medicines has been widely criticised.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the claims the &#8216;cures&#8217; can treat everything from broken bones to headaches, there is limited proof they actually work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A team of Australian scientists discovered that some of the medicines contained traces of black bears and antelope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Murdoch University team used DNA sequencing to work out what the plants and animal ingredients are.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Health authorities in Asia are concerned that if the powdered foetus trade is allowed to continue the capsules will find their way onto the internet and be sold to gullible or sick desperate people in other parts of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The South Korean Customs Service said today that it had heightened its searches of suspicious packages being brought into the country by travellers from China in an attempt to stamp out the sickening trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to customs agents, 35 smuggling attempts have been made since August last year involving more than 17,000 capsules disguised as &#8216;stamina boosters&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hospitals and abortion clinics in China reportedly pass the remains onto drugs companies when a baby is stillborn or aborted, the South Korean SBS documentary team reported last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="http://sanfrancisco.ibtimes.com/articles/193371/20110805/china-dead-baby-pill-stamina-booster-cannibal-placenta.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">San Francisco Times</a> reported that tests carried out on the pills confirmed they were made up of 99.7 per cent human remains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tests were successfully able to establish the genders of the babies used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a huge demand for the pills which are thought to enhance stamina. Microwave-dried placenta is also sought after for its alleged &#8216;medicinal&#8217; benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, in reality the human flesh capsules contain super-bacteria and other harmful ingredients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of smugglers who have been detained by the South Korean authorities have claimed they did not know what the ingredients were or the manufacturing process behind them.</p>
<div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/07/article-2140702-12F90417000005DC-272_468x705.jpg" alt="Crackdown: Chinese officials, pictured confiscating thousands of illegal tablets, say they will clampdown on the massive herbal medicine industry which has seen dangerous bacteria an human remains added to seized pills" width="468" height="705" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crackdown: Chinese officials, pictured confiscating thousands of illegal tablets, say they will clampdown on the massive herbal medicine industry which has seen dangerous bacteria an human remains added to seized pills</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Ethnic Koreans from north-east China who now live in South Korea are those who were mostly intending to use the capsules or share them with other Korean-Chinese&#8217; said a customs official.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;They are normally brought into South Korea in luggage or posted by international mail.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The capsules were all confiscated but no one has been punished because the amount was deemed small and they were not intended for sale, a customs official added.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chinese newspapers have identified the north eastern provinces as the source of the human flesh capsules, in particular the Jilin region which is close to North Korea.</p>
<div><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/07/article-2140702-003B1FA100000258-796_468x327.jpg" alt="Smuggling: More than 17,000 capsules disguised as 'stamina boosters' have been intercepted as they were smuggled into South Korea last year (pictured is Seoul airport)" width="468" height="327" /></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There have been disturbing reports that some babies were those who had perished in China&#8217;s notorious &#8216;dying rooms&#8217; where youngsters are deliberately left to die because they were born into families that already had the limit of one child in country areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to keep its population down, China performs 13 million abortions a year &#8211; mainly because mothers sacrifice their newborns to avoid punishment such as severe fines or even a beating by the authorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chinese authorities have confirmed that 38 per cent of women of child-bearing age have been sterilised &#8211; but the babies that are aborted do not go to waste because of the sickening trade in using their corpses for purported medicinal purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite their disgust at discovering packets of the so-called rejuvenation pills being brought in from China, South Korean officials have refused to confirm where the babies came from or who made the capsules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sources said this was because they were not prepared to create diplomatic friction with Beijing, preferring to leave it to Chinese officials to do something about the horrific trade in powdered babies.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Yes We Finally Got Our Billboard</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier today we received the update on the clarification of Michigan&#8217;s Medical Marijuana Laws.  Four new laws were passed by the Michigan House on 5/3/2012 and are now on their way to the Michigan Senate for Ratification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They are not the types of changes most patients wanted to see, or needed.  Most of the changes were put into place to help the law enforcement community enforce their part of the bills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personally I don&#8217;t think a photo is needed on the MMMPID Since it won&#8217;t help dispensaries ID Patients; since the Dispensary Bills are still sitting unsigned.  That&#8217;s the real problem.  They approve more legislation against the patient, yet still have no word on when the Dispensary issue will finally be clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a Patient I&#8217;d like to know When Will Patients Finally Have Clear Rights In Michigan ? that&#8217;s important to point out in the light of this new legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>That&#8217;s What You Need to be Smoking Out Legislators &#8211; Where do PATIENTS/TAXPAYERS/CITIZENS go to get their prescriptions filled legally, without Harrassment ?</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<h1><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mobileweb/2012/05/03/medical-marijuana-bills-pass-michigan-house_n_1476055.html">MMM Patient ID Center Update</a></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A package of four contentious bills defining medical marijuana use passed the Michigan House Thursday and will go to the Senate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bills, which were written to clarify the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act passed by voters in 2008, have drawn the ire of some medical marijuana advocates, but received the necessary three-fourths majority House vote with bipartisan support, according to the Detroit Free Press.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HB 4834 would require Michigan Marijuana patients to have <span style="color: #ff0000;">photo ID on their registry identification card</span>, make the card valid for two years and privatize parts of the registration process. It would also allow law enforcement access to information about patients on the registry.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HB 4851 would offer stricter guidelines for the &#8220;bona fide physician-patient relationship&#8221; as it relates to medical marijuana use, including requiring an in-person physical examination of patients.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HB 4853 would put the penalty for selling marijuana without a proper registry identification card within the sentencing guidelines for a two-year felony.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>And HB 4856 would criminalize the transportation of medical marijuana in a motor vehicle under certain conditions.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s about protecting a sick patient,” Rep. Ken Horn (R-Frankenmuth), a co-sponsor of the package, said of the reforms back in March. &#8220;They have the right [to medical marijuana use] under the law, so we&#8217;re going to make sure they feel safe in their own state.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Attorney Matt Abel specializes in marijuana law and is the campaign director for Committee for a Safer Michigan, a group working to legalize marijuana in Michigan. He is troubled by the access to patient&#8217;s personal information that HB 4834 gives police officers using the Law Enforcement Information Network (LEIN).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;The access to the LEIN system by name and address is going to cause all kinds of problems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There were people who were assured their information was confidential.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although he believes HB 4853 is fair because it applies a consistent standard for two year offenses, he thinks HB 4851 and HB 4856 single out the medical marijuana community for targeted regulation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>&#8220;It would prevent a medical marijuana patient from carrying it on their person, but they can carry their Vicodin on their person,&#8221; he said of HB 4856.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this week, Rep. Mike Callton (R-Nashville) introduced a different bill addressing medical marijuana to the House. HB 5580 would regulate medical marijuana dispensaries and provisioning centers to ensure they are safe and clean.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;Since medical marijuana became legal in Michigan, dispensaries are popping up left and right and we need to make sure these places pass the grandma test,&#8221; Callton said in a release. &#8220;If you wouldn&#8217;t feel safe having your grandma go to one of these places to pick up her medical marijuana, as if she went to a pharmacy, then it needs to be cleaned up or closed down.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bill would also mandate that marijuana could not be consumed at dispensaries or provisioning centers, only sold; provide for local control; and allow caregivers to sell excess products to dispensaries. It would also prohibit centers from setting up shop within 1,000 feet of schools. HB 5580 must now be considered by the House Judiciary Committee to go forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abel said there&#8217;s a lot to like about Callton&#8217;s bill, but added that he had some concerns about its 90-day record-keeping requirements for transactions. He thinks it may open the door for raids by federal agents. <strong>A memo released by the U.S. Department of Justice last year that said that state laws do not protect patients from federal prosecution.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michigan&#8217;s&#8217;  Legislature has yet to understand the critical nature of these bills. If they had just an inkling of the views of Patients/Taxpayers/Citizens as sufferers; we believe they&#8217;d come correct. But until then Michigan Patients will still have to suffer under crisscross standards, which don&#8217;t include any view of their needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Michigan why not clear the air and make it safe for Patients to be Patients</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, Patients are Taxpayers and Citizens. That means we have rights under the ADA and HIPA. Until these issues are resolved, Michigan will continue to prosecute and persecute patients and caregivers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #339966;">Michigan Why Do You want to Be Mean, instead of Healthy and GREEN ?</span></em></h2>

<h2>Detroit Judge Wade McCree got Caught Sexting &#8211; By The News Media.. <em>OOOO,OOOOOOOO&#8230;</em></h2>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/d96pLyMf9UU?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="480" height="320"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The judge in question in fact rules on Pornography and Sexual Assault Cases on a daily basis.  This indicates to us that he knows the law, and chose to ignore it when sending this pic to one of His &#8220;Married&#8221; Female Staffers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Yeah, Sexting Another Employee</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That means it&#8217;s also Sexual  Harrasment within the workplace. This judge has got a whole lotta splainin&#8217; to do,  although he seems to think he&#8217;s done nothing wrong.  There has to be some level of professionalism established within the Legal and Judicial realms to stop all this random sexual harrassment by cellphone.  Anthony Weiner sent pics less racy than this one and he stepped down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Does this mean that Judge Mc Cree will Do The Right Thing, and Step Aside ?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Check This From Tumblr This Evening-</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://onthemedia.tumblr.com/post/22395417777/pulitzer-prize-winning-reporter-charlie-leduff" target="_blank">onthemedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pulitzer prize winning reporter Charlie LeDuff left the New York Times to cover his hometown, Detroit <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/2010/nov/19/reporting-from-detroit/transcript/" target="_blank">(our interview about that is here)</a>. Now, he’s reporting for the local Fox affiliate, where he produced maybe our favorite local newscast story ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sexting, shameless judge + a reporter doing stand-ups in Ray-Bans + a distorted voice modulator interview = our favorite non-MCA related thing on the internet today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charlie’s done some <a href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/04/beastie-boys-mca-will-miss-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-induction/" target="_blank">badass reporting on Detroit</a> for Mother Jones, too. (What Killed Aiyana Stanley-Jones?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All We Can Hope is that He Understands the Law that He Enforces, because after that complaint is in front of him, he better sentence himself to the naughty chair for a spell. This is sure to be another lawsuit for Wayne County; which is almost bankrupt.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Damn Damn, <em>Double Damn</em></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Just days ago we wrote about the need for reciprocity within Africa; from it&#8217;s European Colonialist ties.  Tonight we found a post that directly addressed that point in an up to date way.</p>
<p>The economics of the one sided deal are clarified for all to see.  It brings alot to light about the colonialist demands and how they are still inforce today in many African nations.</p>
<p><strong>Take a Read and Be Amazed at how Colonialism 2012 Works</strong></p>
<p><img title="Some economists say ending the peg between CFA francs and the euro would help African economies" src="http://media.voanews.com/images/480*277/voa_colombant_Africa_Money_480_eng_30apr12.jpg" alt="Some economists say ending the peg between CFA francs and the euro would help African economies" width="480" height="277" border="0" /></p>

</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>By Nico Colombant &#8211; VOA</p>

<div></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Some economists say ending the peg between CFA francs, shown here on a bus in Abidjan, and the euro would help West and Central African economies.</div>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While weak European economies create concerns around the world, economists in Africa are pushing to sever ties binding the continent to former colonial powers. One idea is to decouple the CFA franc, the currency in 14 African countries, from the euro.</p>
<p>One of the speakers at the Revival of Pan-Africanism Forum was economist Salomon Samen, who advises several African countries on economic policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Samen calls<strong> the post-World War II CFA franc, which is used in West and Central Africa, an umbilical cord that needs to be cut. A good start, he says, would be to loosen the fixed relationship between the euro and the CFA franc.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The fixed parity between the CFA and the euro is no longer justified because trade between Africa and Europe has changed drastically over recent years with the greater role being played by Asian countries and China, and with a lot of trade being done with the United States as well. So it is not acceptable to have a simple fixed parity between the CFA franc and the euro. It has got to be overhauled,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Another <strong>African economist, Ivory Coast national Nash Kpokou, wants CFA franc countries to have their own currencies, so that African economies can increase their competitiveness and not be so influenced by the uncertain standing of the euro.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&#8220;If we have our own currency, this will really help our economies to deal with most of the countries and they will be able to sell their goods to the rest of the world,&#8221; he said. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Kpokou calls the current system &#8220;banking tourism&#8221; that has benefited France and French-backed leaders, not African populations, even when their countries post solid economic growth.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&#8220;When we talk about growth it should be inclusive.  They miss that it should take into consideration reducing poverty. So when growth is not taking into consideration the population, then there is no growth,&#8221; he said. </strong></p>
<p>Kpokou also notes that the current system requires participating countries to hold most of their foreign reserves in accounts held at the French Treasury. Other participants at the forum said that instead of relying on this system to reassure investors who are wary of doing business in a highly-indebted region, African states need to improve their business and investment environments, and increase intercontinental trade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(end of clipping from voa)</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>One of the most troubling things about the CFA is that the 14 countries who utilize it, are required to keep the bonus of their currency in French Banks, Still Today.</strong></p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why ?</em></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s because the Parity between the CFA and the EURO demand that the French keep control of the rate of return on the CFA.  This is because initially the CFA was backed by French Francs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Now that each of the individual countries who utilize the CFA has it&#8217;s own treasury and economy; this system clearly penalizes each of those economies.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CFA must be allowed to stand on it&#8217;s own weight, and should actually be slowly decommissioned in favor of currencies linked to each of those 14 countries economies.  That way when Mali is at war and Cote D&#8217;Ivorie is earning more of a return on imports and exports; Cote D&#8217;Ivorie can see it&#8217;s gains seperately from the taxed Malian economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until ECOWAS and the CFA are disbanded Africa will continue to live under the rules and plans of the colonialist who planned these very systems for their express benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hope that with many of the economies of Africa becoming stronger through exports of significant minerals; their economies will begin to reflect that new found wealth.  Only then can Africa begin to demand and count it&#8217;s reparations from the generations of Colonial Economic Policies and Penalties.</p>

<p><strong>No Doubt you understand the video. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><em>FYRE</em></span> in all senses of the word.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jr Gong and B Real cooked up some smokin riddims. The basis for this tune is simple; which is why we think this is going to burn up the airwaves, for a long time to come. It&#8217;s clean enough to make the Reggae and HipHop show charts on Internet and maybe Public Radio.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re undecided about commercial charts at this point. mostly because it&#8217;s an election year and things are different. The subject matter could make it a cult favorite. Just as the riddim could make it a dancehall staple for years to come. it&#8217;s hard to decide. but one thing is certain &#8211; this is a hit. no doubt, a bonified cross over hit.</p>
<p><strong>This <em>Is</em>, More Hotness from the Tuff Gong - </strong><strong style="text-align: justify;"><em>But of course you didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d just play a video and let you go ?  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that just wouldn&#8217;t be fair.  We want you to contemplate how much you enjoyed that video while you read this next short piece &#8211; all about Why President Obama Went to Afghanistan Today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[…] Welcome to Drug Hunters International, which, for all of the $2.1 billion in taxpayer funding the agency gets in a year, has accomplished very little by way of the metrics: the illegal drug industry is considered as lucrative and even more dangerous than ever, <a href="http://projects.latimes.com/mexico-drug-war/#/its-a-war" target="_blank">particularly in neighboring Mexico</a>, while the situation in Afghanistan – counter-terror and counter-narcotic alike – is on a widely accepted downward trajectory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[…] Of course, that the U.S. has set up secret wiretapping programs with the aid of foreign governments all over the world, particularly in South America, where it has been operating heavily for years, is no surprise. The <em>New York Times</em> was perfectly right when it said the cables “do not offer large disclosures.” But they paint an interesting portrait of classic mission creep, of a bureaucracy constantly reinventing and recalibrating itself to maintain its significance in the annual budget; and most importantly, how the war on terror has been used to advance those goals for the DEA. By no means is it the only agency doing it, but it is certainly the most obvious.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">By All Means Click That Link and Read the Full Article so that you see what POTUS Obama was really doing today.  This is why we let you watch the video of Fyre before you got pissed about the continued war on something as universally loved as Ganja.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that his trip to Poppiland was more about the shipments than stopping them.  The price of drugs on the street are only as stable as the troops keep them stable.  The war in Afghanistan is purely about the Poppy.  The Taliban is just another name for any generic drug consortioum world wide that the United States opposes openly; and does deals with secretly by way of the CIA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why we felt mixed signals from the POTUS visit to Kabul today.  the signifigance of the date Osama Bin Laden was removed from the drama, had more to do with open signals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> It&#8217;s like spitting on someone who you&#8217;re holding bound and gagged.  You know that if they could they&#8217;d respond.  Thats why you taunt them once you have them under your control. Sort of like Hamid Karzai and the country of Afghanistan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one believes that this was about saying to the Taliban that POTUS Obama &#8220;Has A Big Stick&#8221;. But more about saying to them that the US will continue to take control of their finished product and pay them less and less every year until they finally decide to only farm for the US and the CIA. Otherwise the US Troops will continue to interrupt the growth cycles of their crops. Burn their fields; and take their poppy paste before they can get paid for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is what the CIA does all over the globe. they control and crash the drug markets by using extreme militarism; backed up with so called diplomacy.  We all know better because it&#8217;s clearly apparent.  just wait 3 months from now and watch the deaths from Heroin overdoses spike in the US Hot Spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Europe has worked out an entirely different approach on how they handle their supply line economic policies with the Poppy Dealers Wholesalers.  You see that&#8217;s the difference.  European countries which have just as bad of a heroin problem as america, have learned to manage to control the influx more closely. therby putting the imports of heroin on a calendar which the military and counter intelligence operatives basically devise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The farmers are simple pashtoons. they grow fields of flowers. their money comes when their poppy paste is delivered to the local warlord who then bundles these small farmers individual deliveries into one larger shippment.  this is how the market demands are supplied; and how the military knows when shipments will be leaving the fields of asiana and heading to the airports of europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Obama did good TV today. we watched the entire suprise landing on the dark runway of a gigantic 747 and the fast walk in a dark armoured trenchcoat over to the Airforce Helicopter.  This POTUS makes his presence known when he feels that he needs to heighten his military posturing.  Humans apparently are not the object of his foreign affairs policy; but poppys.  Sad indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Knowing that He is bargaining with Hamid Karzai only helps to bolster that opinion that he like Karzai wants to win at any cost.  America needs to ask POTUS Obama when that cost will finally be paid ?  One more year of American troops loosing their lives in Afghanistan, to protect the poppy crop is ridiculous. Everyone knows that the US Economy is buckling from the weight of this prolonged military deployment in so many theaters.  There is only so much american troops can do to solve any countries security problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rich countries like Afghanistan should and can pay for their own private armies to fight their battles. thats&#8217; why the average military contractor deployed today earns almost twice as much as POTUS Obama.  yes $750 K a year plus.  and from what we hear it&#8217;s all US Tax Free. Can You Imagine That ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the fix is clearly in for B Real, Jr Gong and Us; because we believe that if Ganja was not a scheduled class 1 narcotic like Heroin; America would benefit from it&#8217;s cultivation and the many faceted businesses which would rebloom the US Economy instantly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition it would clearly help to remove the hand of Illegal drug dealers who   bring Illegal Marijuana into the US. If it were decriminalized that would end.  Just like if American troops left Afghanistan, the Poppy paste would flow to Europe, once more.</p>
<p><em><strong>President Obama, Come out of the Dark and into the Light Please. America is Waiting on You,</strong></em></p>

<p>Today in the Hague justice was delivered.  it came on a slow boat, but it came.  We remember when we first started covering the dictator Charles Taylor.  <strong><a href="http://badgals-radio.com/we-think-its-time-to-neuter-this-poodle-wanna-watch" target="_blank">We made an announcement one day that his days were over</a></strong>.  within two days he was out with the urging of US Troops and believe it or not GW Bush Jr.  this is the one thing that he did for the good of humanity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today when Charles Taylor was found guilty it was a very hollow victory; because it left his co conspirators in the clear.  this can&#8217;t be good.  quite possibly this might  be the reason that it&#8217;s said Sierra Leone is on a slow simmer today.</p>

<p>The United States welcomes the issuance of the judgment by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, convicting Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Today’s judgment was an important step toward delivering justice and accountability for victims, restoring peace and stability in the country and the region, and completing the Special Court for Sierra Leone’s mandate to prosecute those persons who bear the greatest responsibility for the atrocities committed in Sierra Leone<strong>. </strong>The Taylor prosecution at the Special Court delivers a strong message to all perpetrators of atrocities, including those in the highest positions of power, that they will be held accountable.</p>
<p>The trial of Charles Taylor is of enormous historical and legal significance as it is the first of a powerful head of state to be brought to judgment before an international tribunal on charges of mass atrocities and serious violations of international humanitarian law. Over 90 witnesses testified during the trial, bringing to light the range of crimes committed during the war in Sierra Leone, and affirming the importance of justice for the victims. The United States has been a strong supporter and the leading donor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone since its inception. The successful completion of the Special Court’s work remains a top U.S. Government priority.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">No doubt the US urging the completion of the trial, held the witness list to under 100.  Many showed their limbs, which had been hacked off.  They told stories of the terror.  There was no doubt that this man who claimed to eat the hearts of his victims, was a living genocide machine.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Now that it&#8217;s done, we wonder where they plan to house him for the duration of his life ?  we heard that another foreign dignitary who is presently incarcerated; was beaten very badly in prison recently.  Might this very same fate await Chucky Taylor ?  we can only dream..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The blood diamonds still flow over the borders of Sierra Leone, and they still keep man and child trapped in mud pits digging for little pieces of the tears they have shed.  The Diamond Bourse has claimed some success in stopping the flow of so called conflict diamonds. However we don&#8217;t see any difference in the flow of african diamonds splashing onto the market today.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Until the situation which caused this calamity are corrected, the conditions for the same genocide to reoccur, still exist.  that is what needs to be addressed. There can be no further witnesses brought to the courtroom; yet the victims are still clamoring for justice.  Who will repay them for their hacked off limbs ?  who will provide for them the kind of life they could have had, before Chucky Taylor destroyed their futures ?  Who will give a childhood back to the legions of children conscripted into his armys of child soldiers.  This is what we need to know.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Until we see some movement toward rectifying the situation and addressing the conditions &#8211; we will continue to wait on the next war lord.  African natural resources have been the base of european enrichment. so it is now time for european markets to repay the African resources at the proper rate.  Slavery was one thing, but the extraction of Natural Resources is a much larger problem.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Strangely some folks in Liberia seem to think that Charles Taylor is not guilty. We&#8217;re not sure why, but supposedly his power is still wafting over Monrovia.  He is rumored to be supporting an entire army secretly plotting his return.  he had anticipated being set free by the ICC.  This must be why there are folks in Liberia willing to die for him still.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">International criminal court finds former Liberian president guilty of war crimes in Sierra Leone, but decision ignores victims inside Liberia itself</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>What it means for international justice</h3>
<p>The guilty verdict is a historic blow against the traditional impunity of presidents and dictators. But by ignoring Mr. Taylor’s many victims inside Liberia itself, it sent a message that political leaders are more vulnerable to prosecution for foreign crimes than domestic ones.</p>
<p>The verdict was praised by human-rights groups and aid agencies around the world. “Powerful leaders like Charles Taylor have for too long lived comfortably above the law,” said Elise Keppler of Human Rights Watch. “Taylor’s conviction sends a powerful message that even those in the highest level positions can be held to account for grave crimes.”</p>
<p>Gilles Yabi of the International Crisis Group said the verdict was “a watershed moment in the fight to hold high-level perpetrators accountable.”</p>
<p>Yet aside from Mr. Taylor, only eight other defendants were convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which will wind up its work by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The court prosecuted only those who were deemed to have the “greatest responsibility” for the atrocities in Sierra Leone. And nobody has been convicted for thousands of war crimes in Liberia. Many of its warlords are still free, with some still holding positions of power in Liberia today.</p>
<p>“The question of why Taylor was not tried for the crimes he committed here remains unanswered and may come back to haunt us,” said an editorial in a Liberian newspaper, the Daily Observer. “This is a case of moving the body next door and hoping not to smell it.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>What it means for Liberia</h3>
<p>Many Liberians were enraged by the verdict in The Hague, seeing it as a global conspiracy against them. The verdict may have even increased the sympathy for Mr. Taylor in his homeland. Yet significantly, there was no violence in the reaction here, suggesting that Liberians are weary of war and determined to protect the fragile peace that has prevailed since 2003.</p>
<p>Crowds of Liberians gathered in the streets of Monrovia to watch television broadcasts of the verdict on Thursday. Most were convinced it was a plot by the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>“It was a mockery of justice,” said Alfred Kromah, an unemployed printer. With tears rolling down his face, he denounced the international court as an unfair body. “Charles Taylor never did anything in Sierra Leone,” he said.</p>
<p>Simeon Hayes, a 24-year-old student, wore a T-shirt demanding freedom for Mr. Taylor. “The Americans and British are supporting this decision,” he said after the verdict. “No Americans are ever tried in the international courts.”</p>
<p>Bitter arguments erupted as crowds argued over Mr. Taylor’s guilt or innocence. Some were pleased to see him convicted. “My people were massacred,” said Sekou Dukuly, a 38-year-old shopkeeper from a Liberian tribe that was persecuted by Mr. Taylor. “He should be in prison forever.”</p>
<p>Yet most people in the street crowds were Taylor supporters. After the verdict, they looked up to the sky and saw a rainbow halo around the sun – a rare atmospheric phenomenon. “God is angry,” they said. “It means there was no justice.”</p>
</div>

<div></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Peter Tarr, 31, a former child combatant who now begs for money on the streets of Monrovia, Liberia, speaks about his past experience in the wars here. Tarr fought on the side of Taylor&#8217;s forces since he was eleven, but was later captured and fought against Taylor. Later, after Taylor became president, he fought with the Liberian Army. It was during this time that he was injured at two different times. It was because of the second injury to his right arm that he lost it. He says that he is unhappy that former president Charles Taylor brought war to the country which hurt him and many others, but he will accept whatever ruling is made at The Haig when the international court delivers its verdict on Thursday.</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What it means for victims</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Sierra Leone, where many people had their hands or limbs chopped off by Liberian-backed rebels during the war, there were scenes of joy and celebration at the viewing sites that were set up to allow people to watch the court ruling from The Hague.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a decade after the war, amputees are still a common sight in Sierra Leone’s cities, where they are often begging for money from foreigners. The Taylor verdict is a symbolic victory for the victims – especially those who were brutalized as children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anthony Lake, executive director of the United Nations children’s agency, UNICEF, said the children of Sierra Leone were forced to serve as soldiers, human shields, sex slaves and diamond labourers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“For the thousands of children brutalized, scarred and exploited as weapons of war, today’s verdict against Charles Taylor may not wipe out the atrocities they suffered, but we hope it will help to heal their wounds,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">America is closely involved, not because it wants justice for the victims of Charles Taylor;  but because it wants to again re-secure it&#8217;s rubber plantations.  America is still extracting as much as it can from where it can globally. Don&#8217;t ever believe anything further, because it wouldn&#8217;t be correct.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Until the resources which were stolen from Sierra Leone by Samuel Doe and Charles Taylor are re-secured; there is nothing settled about this affair.  And even GW Bush Jr. knows that.  We still haven&#8217;t heard anything about the poodle, but we can bet that it, like it&#8217;s master; would be clipped mercilessly if found.</div>

<p><strong>Yes he&#8217;s doing hiphop news now &#8211; the POTUS with the Mostest slow jams the news</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.collegehumor.com/e/6760562" frameborder="0" width="500" height="338"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">President Obama, dubbed ’Preezy of the United Steezy’ by Jimmy Falon, reached out to students and young voters last night with a slow jam. Accompanied by Falons stage band &#8211; The Roots. Jimmy Falon always comical; called the president ’Barack Ness Monster’ and ’The Potus with the mostest’. Potus meaning; President of the United State of America, during the musical skit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The appearance did elicit quite a bit of comment on the morning talk shows and so we think you should know that our POTUS joins us in asking Congress to stop it&#8217;s planned raise on stafford pell grant interest rates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We Agree Mr President, Students have more than enough to handle. Let Mitty pay for it.</p>

<p><strong>“Million Hoodie &amp; Hijab” contingent on May Day in Bay Area</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ROOTS (formerly Occupy the Hood), People’s Community Medics, and MXGM invite you to join the Million Hoodie &amp; Hijab contingent on May Day as part of the Dignity and Resistance march in Fruitvale &amp; the International May Day mobilizations for workers &amp; im/migrants</p>
<h1>Tuesday, May 1</h1>
<p><strong>Meet at 3:00pm at Fruitvale BART plaza.</strong><br />
After the rally, we’ll join the march to San Antonio Park and on to Downtown Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>Uniting our struggles against racist profiling and oppression </strong><br />
In honor of: Trayvon Martin (Sanford, FL), Sergio Huereca (El Paso), Shaima Alawadi (San Diego), Oscar Grant (Oakland), Ramarley Graham (Bronx), Rekia Boyd (Chicago), Danny Chen (U.S. Army), Kenneth Chamberlain (NY), Agnes Torres (Puebla) and all people attacked, detained, brutalized, and killed by racist violence.</p>
<p><strong>We will wear our hoodies, our hijabs, our rebosos, in solidarity with each other for:</strong></p>
<p>* An end to police brutality and vigilante murders *<br />
* An end to splitting up and deporting our families *<br />
* An end to the oppression of all immigrant communities *<br />
* An end to all forms of racism, xenophobia, and homophobia *<br />
* An end to evictions, foreclosures, and gentrification *<br />
* An end to school closures and funneling our children into private prisons *</p>
<p><strong>We call for Black, Brown, &amp; Arab Unity against institutional racism </strong><br />
<strong>We want: Schools not jails. Homes not banks. People not profits. Immigrant rights. Civil Rights. HUMAN rights for all! </strong></p>
<p>This is NOT about a piece of clothing…this is about America’s criminal disregard for our lives: for Black life, for Muslim life, for the lives of Im/migrants and poor people. We are not disposable. We are mothers, fathers, aunties, tios, sons, daughters, and elders — and we WILL have our human rights.</p>
<p><strong>We call for an end to white supremacy and for the institution of a National Plan of Action for Racial Justice, as proposed by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and others. <a href="http://mxgm.org/trayvon-martin-is-all-of-us/">http://mxgm.org/trayvon-martin-is-all-of-us/</a> </strong></p>
<p>This action is for all our beautiful Oakland diasporas. For East, West, and North Oakland. For youth, for the church folks, for the artists and agitators, for teachers, for first-time marchers, for veteran freedom fighters, for aunties and uncles &amp; everybody who loves justice…</p>
<p><strong>Bring your signs! Your songs! Your chants! And most importantly…your folks! </strong></p>
<p>If your group would like to endorse and/or participate in this contingent, let us know!</p>
<p>- &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; -</p>
<p>—&gt; Note: This contingent will be part of the Dignity and Resistance march, which is being organized by a wide range of immigrant rights and Decolonize/Occupy activists. While we never know how the police are going to respond, both this march and contingent are being organized to be non-violent and family-friendly. There will be many actions going on during May Day in Oakland, and we hope this will be a strong day for the diverse, powerful people of the 99%.</p>
<p><strong>We also stand in solidarity with the Occupy the Justice Department actions in Washington, DC on April 24 and the National Day of Action for Trayvon Martin on April 26. </strong></p>
<p><strong>For more info on the Dignity and Resistance march: <a href="http://mayday2012.blogspot.com/">http://mayday2012.blogspot.com/</a></strong><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.miller-mccune.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mmw-medical-marijuana-100711.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today Was April 20th &#8211; a universal day of Ganja Appreciation. We celebrated along with everyone else by visiting our favorite dispensary, and getting our favorite strains at a slight discount; due to a promotion for the day. We received the text early this morning and when we arrived the wait was well over 30 minutes, with two rooms working at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They were once again able to accept credit cards, which meant most folks including me could spend fairly liberally &#8211; since it was a holiday. the festivities included folks saying <em>Happy Four Twenty</em>, and <em>Get Blazed</em>. Of course we chimed right in and sent out our friendly cyber spliff, which we received back late in the evening; after much passing and puffing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing about today&#8217;s cyber spliff is that you really have to hit it before you pass it on. yeah, you know that means alot of folks were medicating all over the place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can you imagine how much money was spent on Marijuana Today ? hey remember this is the so called <em>Stoners Christmas</em> &#8211; and people celebrate like it&#8217;s a holiday because it only comes once a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We believe that everyone should have the right to medicate in the manner that they choose; based upon your beliefs and legal status. In Michigan the fight is in deep drama mode. But why ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is it the intention of the sitting government that Medical Marijuana should be legislated out of availability to Patients ?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apparently so, because they are shutting down dispensaries; destroying grow ops; and interfering with patient caregiver exchanges state wide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Jackson the community is strong and activism is in full effect, by both patients, and caregivers. The city government has had their issues with clarity on the law and enforcement; but lately they seem ready to accept that Patients and Caregivers are not criminals.</p>
<p><strong>We received a short update from our friend Blueberry tonight.<em> Dig This,</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear badgal,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First,  I wanted to give you folks an update in the market.  The Jackson Market is operating with the full knowledge and approval of the city of Jackson.  We are compliant with all local and state law.   The City understands our mission.  We have educated them that we fill a vital position in the community.   We are unique in that we are compassion based and non profit.  The market is located at 135 West Pearl in Jackson, MI.  The market opens from 12 to 4 every Sat. and Sunday.  The market remain safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ruling from the appeals court is troubling on many levels.  A person can test positive for cannabis use for up to 30 days.  This new ruling means that if you are tested, whether you are impaired or not, you can be convicted.  It might have been two weeks since you medicated, but they can still convict you.  Even more troubling to me, it is a Section 7 violation.  Which nullifies the medical marijuana defense.  Which means you could be prosecuted under the PHC or the CSA for possession.  It was a terrible ruling and places all of us in danger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were successful in stopping the four bills and educating the public as to the danger to patients.   My concern is when I hear CPU talking about fixing the Bills.  Hearing them talking about having so much work in, that they don’t want the Bills to die.  This is insane folks.  The whole idea is to try to  preserve our freedom, not to save  CPU wasted efforts at over turning the act.  They were responsible for the Bills to start with.  They say as much themselves.  They were also responsible for reaching compromises before the committee vote.   Without their approval those Bills would not have made it to the vote on the 29th of March.  Now, that we have delayed the vote again, they are again talking about  fixing the Bills.  These folks have failed miserably and are desperate.  That is a recipe for disaster.  They continue too insist on repeating their  mistakes.  That is the definition of insanity.  Write your Reps today and tell them that CPU does not represent you. !</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The email-omatic is still up and running.  Don’t delay.    <a href="http://mmma.co/email/MMMA_minorml_email_form_letter1.html" target="_blank">http://mmma.co/email/MMMA_<wbr>minorml_email_form_letter1.<wbr>html</wbr></wbr></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We  have a protest scheduled for May 29th to protest the appeals court decision as well as the pending legislation.  We urge you to go to the protest Facebbok page and join.  Please use the facebook tool to invite all of your friends.  We must build an army to stop these civil rights violations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Facebook Page is located at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/312712545467695/314041402001476/?notif_t=like" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/<wbr>events/312712545467695/<wbr>314041402001476/?notif_t=like</wbr></wbr></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blueberry</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michigan and Florida concern me greatly, because both are huge patient populations that are under attack. One legal &#8211; Michigan, about to loose it&#8217;s legality. and the other Florida, fighting tooth and nail to prevent legality for patients and caregivers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s clear that in GOP states the profit factor is ignored, in favor of prohibition to patients. This is both anti humanitarian and anti profit. Big studies of the underground market, produced data that gave clarity to todays&#8217; dispensary operations budgets. no one could have believed that this much money could flow legally into the system, from the dispensation of alternative medications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Big Pharma wants to do as much as it can to keep Medical Marijuana illegal, and they lobby hard in congress to do just that. In each state the situation is much the same, unless the community of patients and caregivers unite to form a clear voice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This has happened in Michigan and it&#8217;s shaken the Snyder government enough, that they&#8217;ve continued to hold meetings on legality of Dispensaries and Caregiver Exchange Programs. This is signifigant because it says clearly that some recognition of the programs exist, and must be clarified in future amendments of Michigans Medical Marijuana Act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ve got our irons in the fire in Florida, and we&#8217;re watching them heat up. We can see that the Scott government, much like the Snyder government has reservations based purely on social and moral objections; not legality. This is how the legalization fight has been left to mire for more than 10 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can personally say that we&#8217;ve seen the state of Florida and their enforcement and wildlife officers going after personal gardens; which they claim violate the state law. But there is no state law saying you can&#8217;t grow your own if you have a legal reason. Many Rastafarians in Florida have been harrassed and had their crops confiscated for just this madness. Even though they have been to the US Supreme Court to clarify that Marijuana is their rightful sacrament. The USSC accepted it, so the state of Florida needs to accept it too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sooner or later the economics of the situation will become the real meat; and only then will we see some meaningful federal action. There needs to be a consistent comparison in the growth of the Medical Marijuana market.  If the federal government could finally see that their prosecution of small amounts amounts to both health and religious persecution.  The USSC has ruled that both are illegal under the present constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As bad as the US Economy is you would think the gop would finally see the green, instead of all that red they created.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">America Take A Good Deep Toke of This Truth, and Demand Decriminalization Now. Stop harassing patients and caregivers.  End the Prohibition on Marijuana TODAY,</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Okay this came across my tumblr dashboard today and It was just too juicy not to pass along on a thursday.  can you imagine the swedes not wanting anyone to know that they actually worked women to death in seven years ?  this means much  more than we can see from this short post; because it clarifies how Sweden actually accumulated such wealth, so quickly.  Slave Labor is clearly the most hidden formula toward wealth &#8211; if you were a slaver.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This also clarifies why the swiss exported so much cocoa and chocolate around the world. the plantations were ripe with slave labor; and then the ships carried the labor and raw cocoa pods back to swedens slave barons.  finally it&#8217;s starting to make sense.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><em>Swiss Miss, Seems like you could actually have a touch of chocolate after all.</em></h2>

<p><strong>Jan 13, 2012 </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The recent uncovering of centuries-old documents has revealed that Swedish ships were used in the Mediterranean slave trade. Up to three quarters of the cargo was women who researchers have suggested were sold as sex slaves. </em></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Swedish history must be rewritten,” researcher Joachim Östlund told The Local.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Östlund, from the Department of History at Lund University, found that Sweden had an active role in the 18th century slave-trades through the discovery of forgotten ship registration documents stored in Stockholm’s consulate archives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While ‘not surprised’ about uncovering Sweden’s participation in the Ottoman Empire, he stresses the importance of shedding light on Sweden’s role in the affair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Sweden actively participated in the Ottoman Empire slave trade with the Sub-Sahara – and this is completely new,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>According to Östlund’s findings, the shipping registries state that the Swedish ships’ cargo was “negroes”.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the slaves sent to America were predominantly men used for plantation work, the Ottoman Empire had a different agenda entirely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“Up to 75 percent of the passengers on board were women,” said Östlund.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“These women were used as servants and concubines, often both at the same time. They lived a relatively short time, research suggests an average of seven years after reaching the Empire, and this kept the slave trade between Africa and Tripoli going strong.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only other alternative for freedom was marriage, and this, too, reduced slave numbers – prompting an increase in demand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweden had consuls in Tripoli in 1741, creating a peace agreement between the countries</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Östlund, Sweden also had peace agreements with other states in the region meaning Swedish ships had extra leeway in international waters and used this to sail the Mediterranean uninterrupted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Östlund’s findings have created a heated discussion, and not everyone is taking the news well. While people have accused him of trying to drag Sweden’s history through the mud, Östlund explains that it was simply curiosity that motivated his research.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We can’t always have this idea that Sweden is just a happy land in the North, isolated from the rest the world,” he told The Local.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Östlund’s book on the findings, <em>Sweden and North Africa: Slavery and Diplomacy in the Mediterranean World, circa 1650-1760</em>, will be released in 2013.</p>
