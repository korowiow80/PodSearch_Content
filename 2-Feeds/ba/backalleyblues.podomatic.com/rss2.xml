Like the other great album to come out of post-Katrina New Orleans, Allen Toussaint &amp; Elvis Costello&#8217;s The River in Reverse, the Radiators&#8217; latest consists mainly of songs written before the deluge. But the long-running Crescent City band catch a definite sense of time and place on this disc, which was recorded in the studio during the first post-hurricane Mardi Gras. Many of the lyrics sound too appropriate to be accidental, especially the opening &#8220;Ace in the Hole&#8221; (&#8220;When the big wind blows chilly and cold, the wise fool flies south&#8221;) and the closing &#8220;Shine Tonight&#8221; (&#8220;We&#8217;re all in the same boat, it sunk without a trace&#8221;). It also makes sense that the band sound even more New Orleans&#8211;ish than usual, adding sax on the &#8217;50s-style jukebox rocker &#8220;Rollercoaster&#8221; and banjo on the Preservation Hall homage &#8220;Desdemona.&#8221; The overall mood is more intense than usual for these guys, notably on the Richard Thompson&#8211;esque &#8220;Don&#8217;t Pray for Me&#8221; and the sexy/swampy &#8220;Rub It In&#8221; &#8212; the first time the standout track on a Radiators disc has been a love song. Their trademark two-guitar workouts are kept tight enough to serve the songs, and the mood is muted but still celebratory. The chanted choruses that close &#8220;Shine Tonight&#8221; attest to a city &#8212; or at least a few individual souls &#8212; slowly coming back to life.

A guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, he is meticulous, whether it is perfecting a guitar riff or working on a lyric.But then again, its always been that way. Ever since he first saw The Beatles on television, Deziel has been involved in music, whether playing, writing or admiring. He grew to love vocal harmonies and layered guitars, and used them in his own compositions as well as those he has written with other artists. In 1991, Deziel met Jeff Carlisi of .38 Special through a meeting arranged by a friend. After that initial meeting, Carlisi became Deziel's mentor, and Deziel began sending him tapes of his own compositions to critique and judge. Carlisi would respond by phone or by mail with his compliments and comments. This is something that to this day Deziel claims to be an invaluable asset to his work. However, Deziel doesn't do everything solo. In 1993, Deziel founded the Connecticut band Sundance. As a guitarist/vocalist, he is one of the principal songwriters in the band. Sundance released its first full-length album, &quot;Pearls of Wisdom&quot; in November 1995. The band was a popular draw throughout the Northeast, and could be heard on many radio stations. With the group Deziel was also the subject of a television special called &quot;Behind the Scenes With Sundance&quot;.

Tony Deziel never stops making music.

A guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, he is meticulous, whether it is perfecting a guitar riff or working on a lyric.But then again, its always been that way. Ever since he first saw The Beatles on television, Deziel has been involved in music, whether playing, writing or admiring. He grew to love vocal harmonies and layered guitars, and used them in his own compositions as well as those he has written with other artists. In 1991, Deziel met Jeff Carlisi of .38 Special through a meeting arranged by a friend. After that initial meeting, Carlisi became Deziel's mentor, and Deziel began sending him tapes of his own compositions to critique and judge. Carlisi would respond by phone or by mail with his compliments and comments. This is something that to this day Deziel claims to be an invaluable asset to his work. However, Deziel doesn't do everything solo. In 1993, Deziel founded the Connecticut band Sundance. As a guitarist/vocalist, he is one of the principal songwriters in the band. Sundance released its first full-length album, &quot;Pearls of Wisdom&quot; in November 1995. The band was a popular draw throughout the Northeast, and could be heard on many radio stations. With the group Deziel was also the subject of a television special called &quot;Behind the Scenes With Sundance&quot;.

Tony also collaborated with longtime friend Jason Elledge on Blackfoot&#8217;s 1994 Rhino Records compliation &#8220;Rattlesnake Rock &#8216;n Roll, the Best of Blackfoot&#8221;, featuring one of Tony&#8217;s all-time favorite guitarists; Rickey Medlocke.

Currently Tony is working on a new studio album scheduled for Fall 2005 release, as well as 2 CD Singles to be released in the Summer of 2005, and has recently had the privilege to play with longtime friend and former .38 Special guitarist Jeff Carlisi, former Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Ed King, drummer Liberty DeVito of Billy Joel&#8217;s band, and vocalist/guitarist Derek St. Holmes, formerly of Ted Nugent.

Tony Deziel never stops making music.

A guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, he is meticulous, whether it is perfecting a guitar riff or working on a lyric.But then again, its always been that way. Ever since he first saw The Beatles on television, Deziel has been involved in music, whether playing, writing or admiring. He grew to love vocal harmonies and layered guitars, and used them in his own compositions as well as those he has written with other artists. In 1991, Deziel met Jeff Carlisi of .38 Special through a meeting arranged by a friend. After that initial meeting, Carlisi became Deziel's mentor, and Deziel began sending him tapes of his own compositions to critique and judge. Carlisi would respond by phone or by mail with his compliments and comments. This is something that to this day Deziel claims to be an invaluable asset to his work. However, Deziel doesn't do everything solo. In 1993, Deziel founded the Connecticut band Sundance. As a guitarist/vocalist, he is one of the principal songwriters in the band. Sundance released its first full-length album, &quot;Pearls of Wisdom&quot; in November 1995. The band was a popular draw throughout the Northeast, and could be heard on many radio stations.

You don't need an old record to recapture the spirit of great music. You can hear the reverberations of the past, and the sound of the future in one group... Matthew D and Random Tuesday. Breaking down the barriers of the blues while churning up a style and sound of their own, Matthew D and Random Tuesday create a solid mixture of rocking, original, pop based blues. Along with innovative cover material, they are blazing the modern road from the delta. Blues is a state of mind. Despite a blues emphasis wrapped in a pop package, their set of music makes it transparently clear just how grounded these tunes are in rock, country, jazz, hip-hop and gospel. This musical eclecticism is the canvas that allows Matt?s musical soul come up for air. Matt?s abilities as a composer, guitarist, singer, producer and band leader span a broad spectrum indeed, but the foothold of Mathew D and Random Tuesday is still fully ensconced with their unique stamp on the blues. Their all original debut album, ?NOTES FROM THE EDGE?, (produced, recorded, and written by Matt) is a passion filled, radio friendly, no holds barred production. From the beginning hook of the first track, ?Ain?t Man Enough?; to the heart felt, country inspired ?Here Come Those Tears?, to the jazz flavored, ?Shadows Of Love?, to the final track, there is something here for every one. This release will likely be followed by more reviews comparing the singer/songwriter to &quot;John Mayer with the soul of Stevie Ray Vaughan.? With songs of love, loss and whatever strikes him at the moment. Always compelling, confounding, creative.



&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.garageband.com/artist/bluessmyth&quot;&gt;Bluessmyth&lt;/a&gt;
bluessmyth is a heavy blues band. The rhythmic foundation of bluessmyth is laid down by Jason Yaholkoski&#8217;s deep, definitive bass playing, combined with Calvin Becker&#8217;s bombastic, hammerhead drumming, and then is finished off with Chris Yaholkoski&#8217;s fire and brimstone guitar lines.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mp34u.com/songCard.php?posting=2078&quot;&gt;Rev Blind Gary Davis Blues&lt;/a&gt;


In his prime of life, which is to say the late '20s, the Reverend Gary Davis was one of the two most renowned practitioners of the East Coast school of ragtime guitar; 35 years later, despite two decades spent playing on the streets of Harlem in New York, he was still one of the giants in his field, playing before thousands of people at a time, and an inspiration to dozens of modern guitarist/singers including Bob Dylan, Taj Mahal, and Donovan; and Jorma Kaukonen, David Bromberg, and Ry Cooder, who studied with Davis.

Davis was partially blind at birth, and lost what little sight he had before he was an adult. He was self-taught on the guitar, beginning at age six, and by the time he was in his 20s he had one of the most advanced guitar techniques of anyone in blues; his only peers among ragtime-based players were Blind Arthur Blake, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Blind Willie Johnson. Davis himself was a major influence on Blind Boy Fuller.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rustywrightblues.com/&quot;&gt;Rusty Wright Blues Band&lt;/a&gt;

There will always be those who feel compelled to argue over what the blues is or isn't.  If the music of Rusty Wright Blues sounds like it was colored from the big box of crayons, it's because Rusty Wright and Laurie LaCross-Wright feel the universe would be a mighty flat and boring place if everyone was given a crayon from the box and told they had to express themselves with just that one color.

The title track, &quot;Ain't No Good Life&quot;, is easily the most traditional sounding on the disk and features Rusty's slide guitar skills but a wide variety of influences make an appearance on this Flint Michigan couple's debut release.

Tommy Stewart (a longtime friend of Rusty's who enjoyed success as original drummer for Godsmack) contributes wickedly deep pocket drum grooves on all of the tracks. Steve Himes, a band mate since 1999, plays keys. Recent additions to the band include drummer Dan Mata and bassist Randy McEntire.

These husband/wife guitarists manage to keep at least one toe lodged in the blues while embracing a southern rock vibe that might best be described as 'Bonnie Raitt and ZZ Top crashing an Allman Brothers house party.'

Taking a cue from husband/wife country music teams like Carter &amp; Cash, Jones &amp; Wynette and McGraw &amp; Hill, the Wrights also bring the time-honored male/female duet tradition into the Blues world. Their affable banter and sense of humor pervades the disc and they sound like they're having a helluva good time as they trade verses back and forth on songs like &quot;Something Missin&quot; and &quot;The Fool Will Do.&quot;

Their quirky sense of humor again shows up in &quot;Nasty Reputation,&quot; &quot;Ain't From Mississippi,&quot; &quot;Toppy&quot; and &quot;Long Time Coming&quot; - all hard grooving tunes with a southern blues rock vibe. Rusty tears up the fret board on &quot;Hell On My Heels.&quot; 

&quot;Do It Again&quot; may slip out of the genre of blues but Rusty and Laurie refuse to feel apologetic.

Their quirky sense of humor again shows up in &quot;Nasty Reputation,&quot; &quot;Ain't From Mississippi,&quot; &quot;Toppy&quot; and &quot;Long Time Coming&quot; - all hard grooving tunes with a southern blues rock vibe. Rusty tears up the fret board on &quot;Hell On My Heels.&quot; 

&quot;Do It Again&quot; may slip out of the genre of blues but Rusty and Laurie refuse to feel apologetic.

Easy Rider Blues by Soileau and Robin is a really sweet cajun blues holler in an equally mesmerizing and haunting style. Hastings Street has Blind Arthur Blake on guitar and Charlie Spand on piano in an impromptu and rollicking guitar/piano duet blues. The Corley Family have a ragged but sweet down home family gospel vocal sound with a lot of charm on Give The World A Smile. The Original Stack O'Lee Blues by Long Cleve Reed and Little Harvey Hull (aka the Down Home Boys) is not only really rare - it in fact is a one of a kind record being the only copy known in existence! - it is also a mellow finger picking blues which would make Dylan melt. </description>

I've been playing guitar since 1983 or so. I heard Eric Clapton's &quot;Just One Night&quot; album and have been addicted to blues guitar ever since. I've dabbled in bands now and then but right now it's just me, a bass guitar, a fender and assorted drum loops. I've tried singing and I've tried writing lyrics and when I do the following Dirty Harry quote comes to mind... &quot;A man's got to know his limitations.&quot;

a road-fatigued Jeep Cherokee into the first bar we could find in Kelowna, B.C.

We were far from our Calgary homes and wanted little more than several beers, some passable grub and - hope beyond hope after noticing the bathroom-sized stage - music that wouldn&#8217;t make us bolt for the door and the comfort of the truck stereo.

We chugged our chilled beer, wolfed platefuls of authentic Cajun and the four of us didn&#8217;t hit the exit until the end of what turned
out to be a magical night in The Blue Gator bar - where we were totally and utterly blown away by Dogskin Suit.

I&#8217;ve been to dozens of Blues bars across the continent and applauded scads of good bands, but never have I heard
anything that compares with what Dogskin did to, and
for, the audience that night.

      <title>Robbie Duecy Band- At Last-And Lay the Hammer Down</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636736.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All artists are a direct product of their influences. Such is the case with guitarist,singer,songwriter Robbie Ducey.Growing up in the same hometown as the Godfather of Soul, it was only natural that Ducey was exposed to some of the heavyweights of the rhythm and blues and soul music scene of the 60's such as Otis Redding,Curtis Mayfield,Albert King, and of course James Brown. The 'British Invasion' of the late 60's and early 70's brought more influences such as Jimi Hendrix,Eric Clapton,Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck, all of which can be heard in Robbie's guitar style.
It is rare when an artist can infuse the elements of Rock, Soul, Funk, and Blues into their song writing and playing style, and create a truly uniqe sound of their own.Robbie has managed to do this while staying true to his roots,but always pushing the envelope. His guitar playing can come at you like a 'buzz-saw' one moment, and then be as smooth and mellow as a glass of fine wine the next.
His vocal style is soulful, gritty,sensual, and direct, all of which draw the listener in to the song and lyric content.
With 'magic' Mark Jones on Bass Guitar and vocals, and Burt 'da sheriff' Rayburn on drums and vocals, the band has never sounded better. Currently touring in support of a new &quot;Live&quot;CD, the band is also working on it's third studio release titled;&quot;Acey-Ducey&quot; which should be completed by late summer.

      <title>we come to have church</title>
      <description>it all started with a simple prayer in 1981 by Rev. Bob McCarton, &quot;Father, how about a Christian Blues Band?&quot; It wasn&#8217;t to take place until February 1994 in Passaic County Jail in Paterson, NJ. Rev. John Witherspoon stood at the microphone ready to sing the first song and announced, &quot;We&#8217;re Breakin&#8217; The Bondage Blues Band and we&#8217;ve come to have church!&quot; And that&#8217;s exactly what they did, had church complete with hand clapping, foot stomping, and soul saving.
This group is dedicated to bringing the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world. It makes no difference if they are in a prison, public park, church, music festivals, anywhere. Their songs are original compositions inspired by The Holy Spirit. The words of each song are clear and cannot be misunderstood. Breakin&#8217; The Bondage Blues Band lifts up the Name of Jesus to be revered, praised, and worshiped.
	Rev. Bob McCarton (aka The Blues Rev)
Leader, founder, blues harp player, producer, and chief songwriter with contributions from the entire band. He&#8217;s convinced that King David was the original Blues Harp player. Rev. Bob is just as comfortable playing those old church hymns on harmonica as he is getting down, gritty, dirty, and bluesy with the Blues of Breakin&#8217; The Bondage. He is a proud Vietnam Vet having served two tours of duty with the 19th Combat Engineer Battalion.
	Rev. James Blank (a.k.a. Doc Ivory)
Chief vocalist and keyboardist for B4. Jim was raised by renowned Gospel singer Rev. Joe Scott Jr. and his family. At the age of thirteen, Rev. Jim was taught to turn on the church&#8217;s Hammond B3 organ. Having no formal lessons, he was taught to play the organ by the Holy Spirit. Growing up in Evangelist Rev. Scott&#8217;s family, Doc Ivory was taught to sing and discern in four part harmony and accompanied his stepfather everywhere. Jim is the pastor of an international outreach ministry.
	Brother Ken Neill
Rhythm guitar. His energy levels are legendary, his musical input is valuable. Ken plays on his church&#8217;s worship team. In addition he also plays in a wedding band, a multi piece Big Band group, and string bass in a bluegrass group. Before coming to Jesus, Brother Ken played bass guitar in the heavy metal rock group Twisted Sister.
	Brother Ken &quot;The Professor&quot; McNeil
Lead guitar. For over 40 years, Ken has played in numerous rock and blues groups. His major influences are Freddie King, Luther Tucker, Buddy Guy just to name a few. Ken shares in the orchestration duties with B4&#8217;s song writing. He is a proud Vietnam Vet having served with the First Cavalry Division in Long Range Recon Patrol (LRRP).
	Rev. Keith &quot;The Kid&quot; DeGroat
The bass man. Keith comes from a musical family with deep roots in Gospel music. His mother, aunts, and uncles are The Gospelites. Keith had played percussion and bass with The Gospelites prior to joining Breakin&#8217; The Bondage.
	Brother Donnie Van Vooren
Drums. Don has been keepin&#8217; the foot over the years with various club bands. He has a wide range of percussion background and brings a laid back attitude to the rhythm section. He&#8217;s powerful, in the pocket, and just outright happy to be playing for Jesus.
	Brother Rhett Tyler
Guest lead guitarist. Guitarist, songwriter, vocalist, and producer, Rhett is best known for his explosive style of scorching modern blues guitar and high-octane, house-rocking live performances. And when The Blues Rev goes head-to-head on blues harp with Rhett, watch out! You ain&#8217;t never heard nutin&#8217; like this before. Call out the fire department!!!
	And...
Rev. John Witherspoon, Ray &quot;Lightnin'&quot; Griggs, Frank Robbins, Joe Brennan and Tommy &quot;DC Tommy&quot; Powell all performed on B4's debut CD, &quot;We've Come To Have Church.&quot;</description>

      <title>Tony Deziel - Jilly Bean - This guy Rocks</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636737.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony Deziel never stops making music.

A guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, he is meticulous, whether it is perfecting a guitar riff or working on a lyric.But then again, its always been that way. Ever since he first saw The Beatles on television, Deziel has been involved in music, whether playing, writing or admiring. He grew to love vocal harmonies and layered guitars, and used them in his own compositions as well as those he has written with other artists. In 1991, Deziel met Jeff Carlisi of .38 Special through a meeting arranged by a friend. After that initial meeting, Carlisi became Deziel's mentor, and Deziel began sending him tapes of his own compositions to critique and judge. Carlisi would respond by phone or by mail with his compliments and comments. This is something that to this day Deziel claims to be an invaluable asset to his work. However, Deziel doesn't do everything solo. In 1993, Deziel founded the Connecticut band Sundance. As a guitarist/vocalist, he is one of the principal songwriters in the band. Sundance released its first full-length album, &quot;Pearls of Wisdom&quot; in November 1995. The band was a popular draw throughout the Northeast, and could be heard on many radio stations. With the group Deziel was also the subject of a television special called &quot;Behind the Scenes With Sundance&quot;.

Tony also collaborated with longtime friend Jason Elledge on Blackfoot&#8217;s 1994 Rhino Records compliation &#8220;Rattlesnake Rock &#8216;n Roll, the Best of Blackfoot&#8221;, featuring one of Tony&#8217;s all-time favorite guitarists; Rickey Medlocke.

Currently Tony is working on a new studio album scheduled for Fall 2005 release, as well as 2 CD Singles to be released in the Summer of 2005, and has recently had the privilege to play with longtime friend and former .38 Special guitarist Jeff Carlisi, former Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Ed King, drummer Liberty DeVito of Billy Joel&#8217;s band, and vocalist/guitarist Derek St. Holmes, formerly of Ted Nugent.

      <itunes:summary>Tony Deziel never stops making music.

A guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, he is meticulous, whether it is perfecting a guitar riff or working on a lyric.But then again, its always been that way. Ever since he first saw The Beatles on television, Deziel has been involved in music, whether playing, writing or admiring. He grew to love vocal harmonies and layered guitars, and used them in his own compositions as well as those he has written with other artists. In 1991, Deziel met Jeff Carlisi of .38 Special through a meeting arranged by a friend. After that initial meeting, Carlisi became Deziel's mentor, and Deziel began sending him tapes of his own compositions to critique and judge. Carlisi would respond by phone or by mail with his compliments and comments. This is something that to this day Deziel claims to be an invaluable asset to his work. However, Deziel doesn't do everything solo. In 1993, Deziel founded the Connecticut band Sundance. As a guitarist/vocalist, he is one of the principal songwriters in the band. Sundance released its first full-length album, &quot;Pearls of Wisdom&quot; in November 1995. The band was a popular draw throughout the Northeast, and could be heard on many radio stations. With the group Deziel was also the subject of a television special called &quot;Behind the Scenes With Sundance&quot;.

Tony also collaborated with longtime friend Jason Elledge on Blackfoot&#8217;s 1994 Rhino Records compliation &#8220;Rattlesnake Rock &#8216;n Roll, the Best of Blackfoot&#8221;, featuring one of Tony&#8217;s all-time favorite guitarists; Rickey Medlocke.

Currently Tony is working on a new studio album scheduled for Fall 2005 release, as well as 2 CD Singles to be released in the Summer of 2005, and has recently had the privilege to play with longtime friend and former .38 Special guitarist Jeff Carlisi, former Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Ed King, drummer Liberty DeVito of Billy Joel&#8217;s band, and vocalist/guitarist Derek St. Holmes, formerly of Ted Nugent.

Collette

Well I go out for a ride in my Pinto Hatchback
The one that I got from my kind Uncle Jack
Cruisin' down the highway or any city street
It doesn't really matter to the girls I'm dead meat
I just want a love to step into my life
that doesn't give a damn about this car that I drive
Oh please Collette if you loan me the money I'll buy a Corvette

Its got a definite miss and the muffler's fallin' off
Exhaust fumes in the cab's makin' all my friends cough
No long drives for this piece of crap
I think its high time that we parked it out back
I just want a love to step into my life
that doesn't give a damn about this car that I drive
Oh please Collette if you loan me the money I'll buy a Corvette

Oh please Collette if you loan me the money I'll buy a Corvette
If you loan me the money I'll buy a Corvette
If you loan me the money I'll buy a Corvette

glenn syndal

I started writing songs in about 1998, I took up bass a year or two after that, but kinda got bored of it. Started playing acoustic guitar in early 2001, and re-recorded a few bass tracks that I'd written, making an EP and giving it out just to friends. Made two more albums in the last few years, and then in July 2006 recorded a demo in a studio, which I've sent out to radio stations. I've been played on a number of community radio stations in my local area, and looking to get as much exposure as possible. I'm generally trying to bring the vibe of the 60's, through hippie and beatnik culture, into the 21st century. Check out my website for more.

Glenn Syndal is an artist who does have something to say.

&quot;A song isn't just a bunch of rhyming words&quot; he says.
&quot;Anyone can put together a bunch of rhymes, but every line in every one of my songs has been thought carefully about. I see songwriting as an artform. It takes practice and skill to produce great songs, and I'm dedicated to bringing out the most emotion, the most relevance that I can in my music.&quot;

Glenn's love of music began at a young age.

      <title>Lost and found- Red Hot Blues Sisters</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636739.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biography
In the short time since the Red Hot Blues Sisters performed their first live show in 2004 at Highway 99 in Seattle, they have taken the local blues community by surprise with the power and depth of their musicianship.

Their innovative songwriting brings a fresh feel to the blues. Selective covers of traditional standards shine like polished stones through the lens of the bands style &amp; strong musicianship.

Recently featured live performances on the main stages of Portland Waterfront Blues Festival, Seattle&#65533;s Northwest Folklife, Blues by the Sea, Doc Maynard&#65533;s, The New Orleans, Rockrgrl Music Conference 2005 and Beal St Northwest have continued to introduce the talents of RHBS to the Northwest music scene, resulting in extremely positive responses from ardent blues, rock and R&amp;B fans.

Fronted by the hot and soulful vocals of Suze Sims and the searing rock/blues styles of Teri Anne Wilson on guitar; this group also features some of the finest North West musicians on the circuit backing up this dynamic front.

The Red Hot Blues Sisters have a guaranteed crowd pleasing show that is quickly gaining momentum, well-crafted songs with brilliant performances that are rapidly being picked up for airplay and a growing fan base!

Proucers Bonnie Hayes and Tom Pfaeffle recently joined forces with Peace Code Records to produce their latest 2 song EP, &#65533;Hot Off the Press&#65533; which includes &#65533;Ocean Beach and See You&#65533;  composed by Suze &amp; Teri.  Bonnie Hayes is best known for her hit songs &quot;Have A Heart&quot; and &quot;Love Letter,&quot; which restored Bonnie Raitt to superstardom with the multi-platinum, multi-Grammy-winning CD Nick of Time.  Tom Pfaeffle is best known for his work with  Heart and Queensrych. Together, they influenced an impressive sound on this EP!

      <title>Eric Bath  - This is the Day</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636740.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eric Bath Band was formed in the summer of '95 after the independent release of my first solo album. I had been writing songs and playing the guitar since the age of 13 but my high school band &quot;The Pact&quot; broke up soon after graduation. Although I continued to write songs and play the guitar the pieces never seemed to fall in place to start a new band.

About six months after my wife Brenda &amp; I were married,
she encouraged me to go for my dream. So I recorded a solo album at Firebird Recording Studio here in Milwaukee. After the album was recorded opportunities to play became more frequent and it was easier to get a band together with the material in place and a game plan in hand.


The band has seen more than its share of personnel changes over the past 10 years, but we are very excited about
the most current lineup which includes the addition of
Rick Wegner as a second guitarist as well as veterans Steve Campbell on bass guitar and my brother Chris Bath on drums.
I round if off playing guitar and carrying the lead vocals and song writing duties.

Over the years we have had the opportunity to serve up our own unique brand of original faith based rock-n-roll with flavors of blues, funk, and jazz mixed in for good measure. Overall one of our greatest strengths is in our lyrics which use a lot of humor, wit, and even a little bit of sarcasm to bring forth truths about life, love, &amp; family from a believers perspective.

We have been featured on local radio and television as
well as at several county fairs &quot;The Mexican Fiesta&quot; (on Milwaukee's famed Summerfest grounds),GODSTOCK(where we cobilled with SKILLET) and other various coffee houses, bookstores, clubs and festivals across the state and in Illinois.

Some may call us a Christian Rock Band but I prefer to just be known as a Rock-n-Roll band and let the music speak for itself. Every song is not about Jesus, but every song is written from the perspective of someone who can't live a millisecond without Him. When the Lord is that important to you it can't help but come out in everything you do, especially your music

      <title>BLUE FRANCES '62 MUSIC SHOW,The Samson Band</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636741.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samson
The Mission: To give &quot;The Answer&quot; rather than ask more questions. The band's mission is to spread His Word through music, share His grace in our lives and promote service to God.

The Man: Samson was a biblical character who, with the help of God's Spirit, did great things. He was in many ways an ordinary person, like you and me. A person who makes mistakes. But God used him, nevertheless, to do great things for his people.

The Band: In the spring of 1998 Pastor James Walck and Michael Senft discovered a common love of music and a past in previous bands. Both were searching for an outlet for their talents. Pastor Jim shared his vision of a contemporary coffee house experience led by a rock and roll band. Intrigued, Michael and Jim began performing together and recruiting other talents. What followed was a true calling by the Spirit. Lydia Griffin joined Samson in February of 1999; Bob Lawler heard the call to Samson in April of 2000;Dan Brooks completed the group in August of 2000 when he answered an ad in a local musician's paper. 


Background from, ohmyspace.com BLUE FRANCES' heart and soul is in rock n roll - country blues and rockabilly. The '62 MUSIC SHOW sound is down-to-earth gritty and real, steeped in sin and faith, raised in volumes of power. This gig has hit the stages of biker rallies, county fairs and even the rockin' religious, right and left. This sound has made its way to radio, regardless of its slightly irreverent bent. Some have deemed it holy, some have judged it not holy enough. Frances says, &quot;Its just rock n roll, man&quot;. And that it is and so much more.

      <title>Breakin the bondage blues band- we come to have church</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636742.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it all started with a simple prayer in 1981 by Rev. Bob McCarton, &quot;Father, how about a Christian Blues Band?&quot; It wasn&#8217;t to take place until February 1994 in Passaic County Jail in Paterson, NJ. Rev. John Witherspoon stood at the microphone ready to sing the first song and announced, &quot;We&#8217;re Breakin&#8217; The Bondage Blues Band and we&#8217;ve come to have church!&quot; And that&#8217;s exactly what they did, had church complete with hand clapping, foot stomping, and soul saving.
This group is dedicated to bringing the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world. It makes no difference if they are in a prison, public park, church, music festivals, anywhere. Their songs are original compositions inspired by The Holy Spirit. The words of each song are clear and cannot be misunderstood. Breakin&#8217; The Bondage Blues Band lifts up the Name of Jesus to be revered, praised, and worshiped.
	Rev. Bob McCarton (aka The Blues Rev)
Leader, founder, blues harp player, producer, and chief songwriter with contributions from the entire band. He&#8217;s convinced that King David was the original Blues Harp player. Rev. Bob is just as comfortable playing those old church hymns on harmonica as he is getting down, gritty, dirty, and bluesy with the Blues of Breakin&#8217; The Bondage. He is a proud Vietnam Vet having served two tours of duty with the 19th Combat Engineer Battalion.
	Rev. James Blank (a.k.a. Doc Ivory)
Chief vocalist and keyboardist for B4. Jim was raised by renowned Gospel singer Rev. Joe Scott Jr. and his family. At the age of thirteen, Rev. Jim was taught to turn on the church&#8217;s Hammond B3 organ. Having no formal lessons, he was taught to play the organ by the Holy Spirit. Growing up in Evangelist Rev. Scott&#8217;s family, Doc Ivory was taught to sing and discern in four part harmony and accompanied his stepfather everywhere. Jim is the pastor of an international outreach ministry.
	Brother Ken Neill
Rhythm guitar. His energy levels are legendary, his musical input is valuable. Ken plays on his church&#8217;s worship team. In addition he also plays in a wedding band, a multi piece Big Band group, and string bass in a bluegrass group. Before coming to Jesus, Brother Ken played bass guitar in the heavy metal rock group Twisted Sister.
	Brother Ken &quot;The Professor&quot; McNeil
Lead guitar. For over 40 years, Ken has played in numerous rock and blues groups. His major influences are Freddie King, Luther Tucker, Buddy Guy just to name a few. Ken shares in the orchestration duties with B4&#8217;s song writing. He is a proud Vietnam Vet having served with the First Cavalry Division in Long Range Recon Patrol (LRRP).
	Rev. Keith &quot;The Kid&quot; DeGroat
The bass man. Keith comes from a musical family with deep roots in Gospel music. His mother, aunts, and uncles are The Gospelites. Keith had played percussion and bass with The Gospelites prior to joining Breakin&#8217; The Bondage.
	Brother Donnie Van Vooren
Drums. Don has been keepin&#8217; the foot over the years with various club bands. He has a wide range of percussion background and brings a laid back attitude to the rhythm section. He&#8217;s powerful, in the pocket, and just outright happy to be playing for Jesus.
	Brother Rhett Tyler
Guest lead guitarist. Guitarist, songwriter, vocalist, and producer, Rhett is best known for his explosive style of scorching modern blues guitar and high-octane, house-rocking live performances. And when The Blues Rev goes head-to-head on blues harp with Rhett, watch out! You ain&#8217;t never heard nutin&#8217; like this before. Call out the fire department!!!
	And...
Rev. John Witherspoon, Ray &quot;Lightnin'&quot; Griggs, Frank Robbins, Joe Brennan and Tommy &quot;DC Tommy&quot; Powell all performed on B4's debut CD, &quot;We've Come To Have Church.&quot;

      <itunes:summary>it all started with a simple prayer in 1981 by Rev. Bob McCarton, &quot;Father, how about a Christian Blues Band?&quot; It wasn&#8217;t to take place until February 1994 in Passaic County Jail in Paterson, NJ. Rev. John Witherspoon stood at the microphone ready to sing the first song and announced, &quot;We&#8217;re Breakin&#8217; The Bondage Blues Band and we&#8217;ve come to have church!&quot; And that&#8217;s exactly what they did, had church complete with hand clapping, foot stomping, and soul saving.
This group is dedicated to bringing the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the entire world. It makes no difference if they are in a prison, public park, church, music festivals, anywhere. Their songs are original compositions inspired by The Holy Spirit. The words of each song are clear and cannot be misunderstood. Breakin&#8217; The Bondage Blues Band lifts up the Name of Jesus to be revered, praised, and worshiped.

      <title>Back alley hoodoo- Million Mile Away</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636743.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Back Alley Hoodoo   is a fusion of kindred spirits, united by their love of the Blues.
 
2005 saw a series of collaborations by some good souls with great talent, but none seemed to really click. In the Spring of 2006, today's lineup came together to cut loose and jam in an anonymous garage, and the magic began to happen. At that moment, the band that was to become Back Alley Hoodoo was born.
 
Three months later, Hoodoo made their Richmond debut at the RCBS Blues Challenge, where we didn't win, but we didn't suck either, so here we are, still playing, and still in love with the Blues.
 
Hoodoo is focused on bringing a natural sound and old school style to Richmond's Blues scene. Delta, Texas, Chicago, and even West Coast Jump all played roles in the formative years of Hoodoo's members, and today they bring it all home with a vengeance.
 
We're not the next Stevie Ray or Junior Wells, we're Back Alley Hoodoo and we're ready to serve you up a taste of Blues played our way. So grab your friends and come on out for a show. Together we'll have a fine time and leave you with your attitude &quot;adjusted.&quot;
 
 
Gordon Graham has been polishing his harp chops for over 25 years. He stole his first licks from Pigpen, and has since gone on to develop his own inimitable style.
 
Influenced through the years by the likes of Little Walter, Rice Miller, Junior Wells, and George &quot;Harmonica&quot; Smith, his blues arsenal now has a life of its own. When not laying down some sweet harp, his vocals add a unique flavor to the Hoodoo stew, and his jazz tinged Guitar licks complement Jack's gritty sound.
 
His most recent band ventures were Richmond's own Johnnie and the Lowdowns and the Rockabilly inspired duo, the infamous Blue Billies (who will one day ride again!). When not performing with Hoodoo, you can find him lending his vocal talent to the Virginians, a Richmond based Men's Chorus.
 
Recently returned from the Augusta Heritage Center's Blues Camp where he studied with Joe Filisko, Gordon's continuing goal in life is both simple and inspiring - &quot;I just want to play Blues with friends.&quot;

      <title>Rusty Wright Blues-  Do it again - personal interview</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636744.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rusty and Laurie gleefully dubbed 2005 their &quot;Dude! Where did you come from?&quot; Tour after receiving gracious compliments from Lynyrd Skynyrd members when the band opened for them in 2004.

Longtime fans aren't surprised. Rusty Wright's got the kind of guitar chops that make people stop and stare, spellbound. Wide eyed, people jostle for a better view of his hands and riotous facial expressions. 

Wright's introduction to professional musicianship came at age 13 when he climbed aboard a tour bus and became the guitarist for a successful Southern Gospel recording act led by his mother. His diverse career as an in-demand touring guitarist, front man and composer has taken him to most points in the US and across Europe. 

A skilled movie and television composer, songwriter, audio engineer and in-demand session guitarist, Wright's compositions have also been picked up by ESPN and TNT.

Fronting the band with Wright is his wife, rhythm guitarist/vocalist Laurie LaCross-Wright, a compelling singer with a vivid and expressive vocal style that stretches with ease from a breathy, crooned endearment into a two-octave slide that becomes a throaty affirmation of her ability to wail.  Touching  people's emotions through a song is a rare ability, but this woman has the knack - often making the most stoic man in the room wipe at his eyes with her Bluesy rendition of Summertime.

The chemistry between Wright and his wife is both obvious and refreshing as they exchange playful banter onstage and share anecdotes about the songs and their lives with the audience. 

Musically, they soar. Their passion for music and performing is evident as they take turns playing off each other.  Laurie laughs with delight when Rusty plays a particularly inventive riff. His guitar work echoes the dynamics and emotion of her voice as she sings. He closes his eyes and loses himself in the music as he plays.  She, in turn, looks directly out at the audience, smiling widely from the stage, as if to say &quot;You'd better believe this is every bit as fun as it looks!&quot;

COMMENTS AND REVIEWS
Oxford Hot Blues &amp; BBQ Festival, June 2006
&quot;The Rusty Wright Blues Band hit the stage running and had the people on their feet with songs from their close-to-being-released CD (Ain't No Good Life) to crowd favorites. Guitar wizard Rusty led the band through a series of songs and just to show the kids before them that they had chops too, finished with a red hot version of the Allman Brothers Whipping Post, which brought the entire crowd to it's feet for a standing ovation.&quot; &#8211; Tim Richards, Blues Photographer, writer

&#8220;The Rusty Wright Band is one of the finest Blues acts that you will ever see. From their first tune to their last, Rusty and Laurie will keep you captivated with in-your-face, hard-driving blues selections as well as their heart-wrenching mellow numbers. These guys are a definite &quot;must see.&quot; &#8211; Steven J. Allen, Oxford Hot Blues &amp; BBQ Festival Executive Producer &amp; Detroit Blues Society Board Member

Enjoy the vibe yall and don't forget to send an e-mail. PEACE, Robbie


Hi...I'm Robbie King, blues guitarist and song writer.My music is both retro and modern..sort of Ottis Redding meets Robert Cray meets Stevie Ray Vaughan! This isn't by copying someones style either...I was born in Witchita FallsTexas and grew up listening to some of the greatist R&amp;B and Blues artist there were at the time..artist such as Ray Charles to BB King and everyone in between. As I grew into the Blues, my sights were set high. I wanted to play on stage with the likes of Eric Clapton ,BB King,Jeff Beck and others...I felt that one day I would have the maturity as a Blues guitar player, to be able to stand on the same stage with my hero's and be noticed and appreciated by these great artist's. My wish to play with these wonderful people seem to be coming true.. To date I have played on stage with Bonnie Riatt ,Johnny Neel once a song writer and keyboard player for the Allman Brothers Band, just to name a few... My music is no doubt Blues, but with a very original twist I'm sure will please blues fans everywhere!! So be on the look out for Robbie King... My first solo album (Classic Case Of The Blues), is my calling card...I hope that those of you who have a chance to listen it,will enjoy it. These songs are both yours and mine! All from the heart and all real! All the best to yah! ....... Robbie King

      <title>The Radiators</title>
      <description>The Radiators are in their 26th year of providing some of the most intense live performances (over 3600 thus far!) of any band on the road today. Their intuitive grasp of each other's moves, coupled with a repertoire of nearly 1300 songs provides a basis for a fresh and spontaneous approach to their music.

The Radiators rely on a myriad of musical influences to create their own sound - &quot;Fish Head Music&quot;. At a Radiators show it is not uncommon to hear blues, R&amp;B, jazz, country, Zydeco, soul, swing, and even gospel filtering through their original New Orleans Rock N' Roll.

During their early years, the band members were able to watch and even play live with many of their local New Orleans heroes. They combined these influences with the rising spirit of sixties rock and R&amp;B to form a new, rhythm-intensive blend of rock and roll.

The Radiators have developed into a strong national act, a result of their marathon length live shows and a relentless touring schedule. The Radiators quickly became one of New Orleans' hottest musical acts, then rose to national prominence as their fans spread the word across the country. 
There are no half measure when it comes to the Radiators. The majority of the tracks are at least six minutes long, and six of them rack up over 10 minutes. None of them ever sound like they are too long, however, which is largely down to the way that the band make their own particular brand of New Orleans music sound interesting. Stylistically the Radiators fuse together elements of funk (New Orleans style, naturally), rhythm and blues, jazz (Steely Dan style) and rock and roll. The end result is something for everybody, and music that will have you tapping your feet, nodding your head, and shaking your booty, or some combination of the three.

      <itunes:summary>The Radiators are in their 26th year of providing some of the most intense live performances (over 3600 thus far!) of any band on the road today. Their intuitive grasp of each other's moves, coupled with a repertoire of nearly 1300 songs provides a basis for a fresh and spontaneous approach to their music.

The Radiators rely on a myriad of musical influences to create their own sound - &quot;Fish Head Music&quot;. At a Radiators show it is not uncommon to hear blues, R&amp;B, jazz, country, Zydeco, soul, swing, and even gospel filtering through their original New Orleans Rock N' Roll.

      <title>Blind Blake- You gonna quit me Blues</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636746.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the finest guitarists of the century, Blind Blake's finger-picked playing evokes the jazzy, melodious rags and stomps of the period. With breathtaking skill, Blake sings and plays from blues to breakdowns to shuffles to novelty tunes.

Blind&quot; Blake (born Arthur Blake, circa 1893, Jacksonville, Florida; died: circa 1933) was an influential blues singer and guitarist. He is often called &quot;The King Of Ragtime Guitar&quot;. There is only one photograph of him in existence.

Blind Blake recorded about 80 tracks for Paramount Records in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He was one of the most accomplished guitarists of his genre with a surprisingly diverse range of material. His complex and intricate fingerpicking has inspired Reverend Gary Davis, Jorma Kaukonen, Ry Cooder, Ralph Mctell and many others. He is most known for his distinct guitar sound that was comparable in sound and style to a ragtime piano.

Very little is known about his life. His birthplace was listed as Jacksonville, Florida by Paramount Records but even that is in dispute. Nothing is known of his death. Even his name is not certain. During recordings he was asked about his real name and he answered that his name was Blind Arthur Blake which is also listed on some of the song credits, strengthening his case on his real name, although there is a suggestion that his real name was Arthur Phelps.

His first recordings were made in 1926 and his records sold well. His first solo record was &quot;Early Morning Blues&quot; with &quot;West Coast Blues&quot; on the B-side. Both are considered excellent examples of his style. Blake made his last recordings in 1932, the end of his career aided by Paramount's bankruptcy. It is often said that the later recordings have much less sparkle and, allegedly, Blind Blake was drinking heavily in his later years. It is likely that this led to his early death.

 Best Song On G.B.
I appreciate this &quot;Big Time&quot; ! You are liable to get pounded on your production, but I LOVE this!
It seems in todays world nobody knows what music really is... you my friend have captured it and put it right on out here...Thanx!
One single guitar, laying down some blues jangle chords... not perfect, but played with real feeling... This takes me back 30 years to jamm'in in the park, hav'in a great time with people that loved music, not big time, fake productions... The lyrics are simple and easy to pick up on... Someth'in everyone can holler in unison... hey pass it over here... Your vocal style sounds as if it could of come straight out of a sixties recording session... You have made my night and I thank you for this superb trip back in time...
Good luck and best wishes and don't stop do'in what your do'in!</description>

Chop Top Mercury 49


near Texas, four guys dream of warmer climes. From way up in the chilly north of Sweden, blues are in a rockin' mode, inspired by the likes of ZZ Top. Rest assured, there's some hard riffing raising temperatures in their Scandinavian studio.

 musical project from far up north in Sweden. Started as a test recording and is now a still on-going project. Texas Boogie is based on the interchange between the songwriter Roger Enquist and the sound engineer/producer Lars kastberg.

At the moment we are working with our second album which is scheduled to be relased later this year. We are still a unsigned band, but&#65533;record companies has shown interest.

The members in the project comes from different backgrounds: Roger Enquist is the songwriter and mind behind the project. He started playing the bass as a 12-year old kid in a local progressive pop band, called &quot;Alfa-Laval&quot;, way back in the 70:ies. He left the band together with his older brother after just a few years. In the middle of the 80:ies he and his brother S&#246;ren, formed a ZZ Top cover band called &quot;Tres Hombres&quot;, and they played on motorcycle clubs and dicoteques. Tres Hombres made their last gig in the summer of 1990 and then Roger took a long break from the music. The former members used to get together one time every each year playing some of that good ol' songs from the past, until the year of 2000, when Roger started to write his own songs. The songs was inspired of the years in Tres Hombres, so the blues and Texan rock was to be the cornerstones in his songwriting.

      <title>Rusty Wright Blues-   I Ain't From Mississippi</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636750.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rusty and Laurie gleefully dubbed 2005 their &quot;Dude! Where did you come from?&quot; Tour after receiving gracious compliments from Lynyrd Skynyrd members when the band opened for them in 2004.

Longtime fans aren't surprised. Rusty Wright's got the kind of guitar chops that make people stop and stare, spellbound. Wide eyed, people jostle for a better view of his hands and riotous facial expressions. 

Wright's introduction to professional musicianship came at age 13 when he climbed aboard a tour bus and became the guitarist for a successful Southern Gospel recording act led by his mother. His diverse career as an in-demand touring guitarist, front man and composer has taken him to most points in the US and across Europe. 

A skilled movie and television composer, songwriter, audio engineer and in-demand session guitarist, Wright's compositions have also been picked up by ESPN and TNT.

Fronting the band with Wright is his wife, rhythm guitarist/vocalist Laurie LaCross-Wright, a compelling singer with a vivid and expressive vocal style that stretches with ease from a breathy, crooned endearment into a two-octave slide that becomes a throaty affirmation of her ability to wail.  Touching  people's emotions through a song is a rare ability, but this woman has the knack - often making the most stoic man in the room wipe at his eyes with her Bluesy rendition of Summertime.

The chemistry between Wright and his wife is both obvious and refreshing as they exchange playful banter onstage and share anecdotes about the songs and their lives with the audience. 

Musically, they soar. Their passion for music and performing is evident as they take turns playing off each other.  Laurie laughs with delight when Rusty plays a particularly inventive riff. His guitar work echoes the dynamics and emotion of her voice as she sings. He closes his eyes and loses himself in the music as he plays.  She, in turn, looks directly out at the audience, smiling widely from the stage, as if to say &quot;You'd better believe this is every bit as fun as it looks!&quot;

Fronting the band with Wright is his wife, rhythm guitarist/vocalist Laurie LaCross-Wright, a compelling singer with a vivid and expressive vocal style that stretches with ease from a breathy, crooned endearment into a two-octave slide that becomes a throaty affirmation of her ability to wail.  Touching  people's emotions through a song is a rare ability, but this woman has the knack - often making the most stoic man in the room wipe at his eyes with her Bluesy rendition of Summertime.

The chemistry between Wright and his wife is both obvious and refreshing as they exchange playful banter onstage and share anecdotes about the songs and their lives with the audience. 

Musically, they soar. Their passion for music and performing is evident as they take turns playing off each other.  Laurie laughs with delight when Rusty plays a particularly inventive riff. His guitar work echoes the dynamics and emotion of her voice as she sings. He closes his eyes and loses himself in the music as he plays.  She, in turn, looks directly out at the audience, smiling widely from the stage, as if to say &quot;You'd better believe this is every bit as fun as it looks!&quot;

      <title>Smokehoues Blues- Mighty Long Time</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636752.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're moved by the classic sounds of Chicago, West coast swing and jump blues, the authentic tone of '50's guitar, cool rhythm's and Fat tone amplified harmonica in the style of the greats such as T.Bone Walker, Robert Lockwood Jnr, Fred Below, George Harmonica Smith, Little Walter and William Clarke, then Smokehouse Blues are the real deal. Smokehouse have a deep passion for this music,  and their live performance's around the country are evidence of their energy and style.  Influenced by the blues greats of the 1950's &amp; 60's, Smokehouse Blues work hard to carry on this great music adding there own special touches along the way.

 Smokehouse blues are a four piece band from the Northwest of England. They play no nonsence pure blues


Since 1998 Smokehouse Blues have been earning themselves the reputation as one of the purest blues bands in the country. Influenced by the likes of Little Walter, George Smith, Sonny Boy Williamson II and more recently by Kim Wilson, William Clarke and Rod Piazza. Front man Johny Hewitt on harmonica and vocals is surely one of the best at his trade.

Formed in 1998 all members of the band have grown up and jammed together since boyhood. Consisting of:-
Johny Hewitt on Harmonica &amp; Vocals
Barny Barnett on Guitar
Gary Clarke on Bass
Baz 'Dog' Evans on Drums

They have strived to achieve the raw authentic sound of Chicago and West coast blues, the kind of blues that can only be played with a passion guaranteed to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up and boogie with a constantly changing set including many of their own original songs, as well as some classic blues standards.

They have won over audiences at most of the major blues festivals in England and paid their dues around the bars and clubs, supporting the likes of Paul Lamb &amp; the King Snakes, Nicky Moores and Steve Philips.

This Palma Mallorca (Spain) based band is originally from New York City and Oklahoma USA!! Tim Mitchell Richardson (the founder of The Mitchell Blues Band) has taken his music from America and all over the world. The unique style that Tim has brought with him from Oklahoma is a down home Blues with just a touch of funk and rock! Tim started playing the guitar from the tender age of 4 years old. He was actually thought by his mother ( his mom was also an incredible guitar/keyboard/ player herself) Matter of fact, Tim was blessed to be able to play any musical instrument that he decided to pick up. With the knowledge of music he played with different bands in bars and venues all over Oklahoma for many years. After being seasoned by the best he branched off to bigger and better opportunities. He started playing for well known artists : The Stylistics and James Brown. Also performing with Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes just to name a few. With these classic groups he started to travel to Europe. He started to play his music in pubs and shows while playing with these groups. Seeing many opportunities available to him he decided to stay on in Europe. A year later he hooked up with a famous Blues Guitarrist (Javier Vargas) in Spain. The group &quot;The Vargas Blues Band&quot; traveled throughout Europe concerts at Blues/Jazz Festivals. They have even recently played with Carlos Santana, Buddy Guy and BB King just to name a few. . At the same time Tim and Sharon Mckie (the singer/entertainer mentioned earlier in the Bio) works on projects for The Mitchells Blues Band as well. While together performing venus with his own band in Europe. He is recently planning on bringing his Blues rocking style back to the states while continuing to make his music well known throughout Europe. So if you're ever passing by a stadium or Blues Festival and you see on the billboard &quot;The Mitchells Blues Band in Concert&quot; make sure to check them out because you'll kick yourself if you miss this blues band in action. So we look forward to seeing you there!!</description>

      <title>Robert Johnson- Love in Vain</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636756.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Leroy Johnson was born on May 8, 1911 to Julia Major Dodds and Noah Johnson in Hazelhurst, Mississippi. Until his late adolescence, his name was Robert Spencer after his stepfather, who had to change his name from Dodds to Spencer when he ran from Mississippi after a personal vandetta with the Marchetti Brothers (Lavere 7). Johnson took the name of his natural father as a teenager, even though he had not met him. Music was a long-time interest for Johnson, and his first instruments were the Jew's harp and the harmonica. Before he became seriously involved with the guitar, he married Virginia Travis in February 1929, and the young couple soon became expectant parents. But tragedy struck when Virginia, only sixteen years old, died in childbirth in 1930.

Around June of 1930, blues musician Son House came to Mississippi. His music deeply affected Johnson, for it was the &quot;rawest, most direct pure emotion Robert had ever heard, and he followed House and [Willie] Brown wherever they went&quot; (Lavere 11). But Johnson did not appear to be gifted with a musician's talent for guitar, as Son House asserts, &quot;Such another racket you never heard! It'd make people mad, you know. They'd come out and say, &quot;Why don't y'all go in there and get that guitar from that boy!&quot; (Cobb 289). </description>

ARTIST: Source: Dennis 'Little Hat' Jones 'Kentucky Blues' recorded in San Antonio, Texas, on 14 June 1930 and issued as Okeh 8815. Note: the first four stanzas are from the transcription in Paul Oliver 'Songsters &amp; Saints' Cambridge Uni Press 1999 p 70.

Here are the lyrics to &#8220;Kentucky Blues/Lost John&#8221; from &quot;Little Hat&quot; Jones: 

Well whiles we here tryin' to have our fun
'Spose the law jumped up and said, 'Nobody run!'
Well, you know I'm long gone, from Kentucky
Long gone, an' got away lucky
'Cause I'm gonna leave so keen
I'll be just like a submarine

Well, my woman poked her head out the window of the bed
Said, 'Please don't let them kill Mister Little Hat dead'
I said, 'No use worryin', sweet mama, I ain't gonna be here long'
Tell her not to sing this worryin' song
'Cause I'm gonna leave so keen
I'm gonna be just like a submarine

Well an officer, you know the man, they call him Austin Jack
Stopped and put the bloodhounds right on my track
'Cause the hounds they couldn't catch my scent
You know, they couldn't tell where Little Hat went
'Cause I left so keen
People, I was just like a submarine

Well here comes the Santa Fe just puffin' and flyin'
Oughta seen me when I reached up and caught them blinds
They said, 'There's another long gone - from Kentucky
Long gone - an' he got away lucky
'Cause he's ever so keen
He's just like a submarine'

I want to sing this song, ain't gonna sing no more
'Cause I'm leavin' San Antonio, I don't plan on coming here no more
Well, I don't play the dozen and neither the ten
'Cause you keep on talkin', I leads you in
Well you keep on talkin' till it makes me mad
Well I'll tell you 'bout the money that your father had
'Cause I don't play the dozen, I declare man, and neither the ten

I said, 'No use worryin', sweet mama, I ain't gonna be here long'
Tell her not to sing this worryin' song
'Cause I'm gonna leave so keen
I'm gonna be just like a submarine

Well an officer, you know the man, they call him Austin Jack
Stopped and put the bloodhounds right on my track
'Cause the hounds they couldn't catch my scent
You know, they couldn't tell where Little Hat went
'Cause I left so keen
People, I was just like a submarine

Well here comes the Santa Fe just puffin' and flyin'
Oughta seen me when I reached up and caught them blinds
They said, 'There's another long gone - from Kentucky
Long gone - an' he got away lucky
'Cause he's ever so keen
He's just like a submarine'

I want to sing this song, ain't gonna sing no more
'Cause I'm leavin' San Antonio, I don't plan on coming here no more
Well, I don't play the dozen and neither the ten
'Cause you keep on talkin', I leads you in
Well you keep on talkin' till it makes me mad
Well I'll tell you 'bout the money that your father had
'Cause I don't play the dozen, I declare man, and neither the ten

Poppa Dawg - turns in a solid set of traditional Blues penned by the excellent guitarist and singer.

'Nobody Here Feels Sorry For You' bounces between Hokum and Jump; 'Croc Talkin', a greasy, minor-key funk instrumental features some of the snarkiest wah tone ever waxed; and 'This Man' is a towering deep soul number. 'I Ain't Leavin' shuffles with Stevie Ray Vaughan power, '1, 2, Gone' swings like Ronnie Earl's best work and 'Cool Little Number' is reminiscent of Little Charlie and Rick Estrin's hipper stuff.

Hailing originally from Edmonton, Alberta, Rick 'Poppa Dawg' Halisheff has played for 20 yrs in a variety of bands and has backed up such artists as Kenny 'Blues Boss' Wayne, Michael Pickett, Harpdog Brown, Sherman 'Tank' Doucette, and Juno Award winner Dave Nicol.

For 10 years, he has been the bandleader and frontman for the very successful Western Canadian Blues band Dogskin Suit. In that time, they recorded 2 CDs, received airplay in Canada, and around the World including CBC's Saturday Night Blues and won numerous awards including Best Local Band 2001 &amp; 2002 and an Honour In The Arts award.

They have shared the stage as opening acts and fellow musicians with Sonny Rhodes, Michale Pickett, Tony Coleman(BB King), Fathead, Frankie Lee, Johnny V, Jeff Healey, Jim Byrnes, Donnie McDougall(The Guess Who), Danny McBride(Chris DeBurg), Shirley King, The Powder Blues, Terry Edmunds and many others.

      <title>George Higgs -  Rainy Day Blues, Rueben</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636759.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Higgs was born in 1930 in a farming community in Edgecombe County near Speed, North Carolina (&quot;a slow town with a fast name&quot; as he is fond of saying.) He learned to play the harmonica as a child from his father, Jesse Higgs, who enjoyed playing favorite spirituals and folk tunes at home during his spare time. George got to catch the medicine showman and harmonica player Peg Leg Sam playing locally in Rocky Mount during the tobacco market season and he made a lasting impression on the young harp player. He was later attracted to the guitar as a teenager and reluctantly sold a favorite squirrel dog to a neighbor to raise funds to purchase his first. As a result of their close proximity the dog spent more time at George's home than at his new owner's, so he got to have the guitar and keep the company of his dog.

Acoustic Piedmont blues by George Higgs, a North Carolinian, who was inspired to take up the harmonica as a child after hearing Deford Bailey on the radio and seeing Peg Leg Sam at medicine shows and then learned to play guitar as a teenager.

f you could wrap Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee into one package, it would probably look like George Higgs. Not only does Higgs play blues on the guitar, but he also is an artist on the harmonica. While his songs are in the Piedmont Blues tradition, they have the melancholy flavor of Mississippi Delta blues. Born in 1930 on a farm near Tarboro, he learned the skills of farming from his father and later learned carpentry. As a child, he would listen to his father play spirituals, and &quot;Cryin' Holy Unto the Lord&quot; on his father's harp led him to begin thinking of following his father's model.

A guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, he is meticulous, whether it is perfecting a guitar riff or working on a lyric.But then again, its always been that way. Ever since he first saw The Beatles on television, Deziel has been involved in music, whether playing, writing or admiring. He grew to love vocal harmonies and layered guitars, and used them in his own compositions as well as those he has written with other artists. In 1991, Deziel met Jeff Carlisi of .38 Special through a meeting arranged by a friend. After that initial meeting, Carlisi became Deziel's mentor, and Deziel began sending him tapes of his own compositions to critique and judge. Carlisi would respond by phone or by mail with his compliments and comments. This is something that to this day Deziel claims to be an invaluable asset to his work. However, Deziel doesn't do everything solo. In 1993, Deziel founded the Connecticut band Sundance. As a guitarist/vocalist, he is one of the principal songwriters in the band. Sundance released its first full-length album, &quot;Pearls of Wisdom&quot; in November 1995. The band was a popular draw throughout the Northeast, and could be heard on many radio stations. With the group Deziel was also the subject of a television special called &quot;Behind the Scenes With Sundance&quot;.

Tony also collaborated with longtime friend Jason Elledge on Blackfoot&#8217;s 1994 Rhino Records compliation &#8220;Rattlesnake Rock &#8216;n Roll, the Best of Blackfoot&#8221;, featuring one of Tony&#8217;s all-time favorite guitarists; Rickey Medlocke.

Currently Tony is working on a new studio album scheduled for Fall 2005 release, as well as 2 CD Singles to be released in the Summer of 2005, and has recently had the privilege to play with longtime friend and former .38 Special guitarist Jeff Carlisi, former Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Ed King, drummer Liberty DeVito of Billy Joel&#8217;s band, and vocalist/guitarist Derek St. Holmes, formerly of Ted Nugent.

      <title>Blind Lemon Jefferson - Hangman Blues</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636765.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blind&quot; Lemon Jefferson (September 1893&#8211;December 1929) was an influential blues singer and guitarist from Texas. He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s.

Jefferson is believed to have been born in Couchman, Texas, near Wortham, Texas. It was long believed by most that he was born in 1897 (although some accounts varied the date by up to ten years) but research a century later revealed a census record that listed his birth record as September 1893. He was blind or nearly blind from a young age, possibly from birth; the cause is unknown, as is the reason for the name or nickname &quot;Lemon&quot;.

Where, how, and from whom he learned to play guitar and learned his songs is unknown. Around 1912, he began performing at picnics and parties. He also became a street musician, playing in East Texas towns. According to his cousin, Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for Blind Lemon Jefferson, Classic Sides:

    They was rough. Men was hustling women and selling bootleg and Lemon was singing for them all night... he'd start singing about eight and go on until four in the morning... mostly it would be just him sitting there and playing and singing all night.

By 1917, Lemon had moved to Dallas, where he is reputed to have met and played with Leadbelly, as well as gotten married.
[edit]

The beginning of the recording career

Unlike many artists who were &quot;discovered&quot; and recorded in their normal venues, in December 1925 or January 1926, he was taken to Chicago, Illinois, to record his first tracks. Uncharacteristically, Jefferson's first two recordings from this session were gospel songs (&quot;I Want to be like Jesus in my Heart&quot;, and &quot;All I Want is that Pure Religion&quot;), released under the name Deacon L. J. Bates. This led to a second recording session in March 1926. His first release under his own name, &quot;Booster Blues&quot; and &quot;Dry Southern Blues&quot;, was a hit; this led to the release of the other two songs from that session, &quot;Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Long Lonesome Blues&quot;, which became a runaway success, with sales in the six figures. He recorded about 100 tracks between 1926 and 1929; 43 records were issued, all but one for Paramount Records. Unfortunately, Paramount Records' studio techniques and quality were infamously bad, and the resulting recordings sound no better than if they had been recorded in a hotel room. In fact, in May 1926, Paramount had Jefferson re-record his hit &quot;Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Long Lonesome Blues&quot; in the superior facilities at Marsh Laboratories and subsequent releases used that version. Both versions appear on compilation albums and may be compared.</description>

      <title>Al Bernard &amp;quot;St. Louis Blues&amp;quot;</title>
      <description>&quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; is a piece of American music composed by William Christopher Handy in the blues style. It remains a fundamental part of jazz musicians' repertoire. It was also one of the first blues songs to succeed as a pop song; it has been performed by numerous musicians of all styles from Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith to Glenn Miller and the Boston Pops Orchestra. It has been called &quot;the jazzman's Hamlet&quot;. Published in September of 1914 by Handy's own company, it later gained such popularity that it inspired the dance step the &quot;Foxtrot&quot;.

Though the name of the song may imply that it is about events in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, it instead refers to a sophisticated woman from that city who has stolen the affection of the singer's lover. The form is unusual in that the verses are the familiar standard twelve bar blues in common time with three lines of lyrics, the first two lines repeated, but it also has a 16-bar bridge written in the habanera rhythm.

The opening line, &quot;I hate to see that evenin' sun go down&quot; may be one of the more recognizable lyrics in pop music, and set the tone for many subsequent blues songs.

Handy said in writing &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; his objective was &quot;to combine ragtime syncopation with a real melody in the spiritual tradition.&quot; He had been inspired by a chance meeting with a black woman on the streets of New Orleans distraught over her husband's absence, who lamented: &quot;Ma man's got a heart like a rock cast in de sea,&quot; a key line of the song.[1] Details of the story vary but agree on the meeting and the phrase.

Fascinated by music as a boy, he would often beat on pans with a stick and imitate the whistle of the railroad trains that ran nearby. He also sang in the choir at the White Station Baptist church, where Will Young, his stern, unforgiving great-uncle preached. When his parents separated, his father moved to the Delta, and his mother left Chester with his uncle Will, who treated him harshly. One childhood friend said Will Young was &#8220;the meanest man between here and hell. Wolf&#8217;s relationship with his mother was also troubled. Gertrude spent much of her adult life as a street singer, eking out a living by selling hand-written gospel songs for pennies to passersby. She disowned her son Chester, claiming he played &#8220;the Devil&#8217;s music.&#8221; Wolf&#8217;s wariness can be traced to his bleak childhood.

EVERYONE likes his music.&quot; Pamela Polston of Seven Days Newspaper said. &quot;Blue Fox's vocals are deep-lazy-growly-sexy, and his guitar playing is ultra-strength.&quot;
Art Edelstein of the Times Argus Newspaper says&#8221; One of the few authentic blues musicians in Vermont - well worth the listen.&#8221;

Blue is currently booking his spring/summer tour. Due to a big interest in his solo steel guitar/harmonic shows, it will be focusing on that style, as well as doing local shows with his band, Blue Fox &amp; the Rockin&#8217; Daddys.

In the 1980's, Blue played almost everyplace that had street musicians (Boston, New York, New Orleans, Austin, San Francisco, etc.) and quite a few that did not. &quot;Blue Fox has been a fixture on the blues scene since he arrived in Vermont in 1990... Charlie Frazier, Good Citizen Magazine.

Blue's first CD, The Way Things Go, was with a trio. His second CD, Shades of Blue, is a mix of solo and his band. Both got good reviews and sold well. Songs from these CDs are featured on all four of the Best of the Green Mountain Blues CDs. His third CD, Solo Blue, features Blue as a solo artist in a mix of studio and live performances.

Two different persons were so inspired by a Blue Fox performance, they put on their own music festivals. (Bill Eustis - Brookfield Blues &amp; Funk Festival &amp; Sandy Bazzano - Pondstock)

He is well-known locally as a player of relentless energy, passion and showmanship.&quot; Charlie Frazier, Good Citizen Magazine.

A left-handed slide-guitarist, his intense slide style of playing and rapid-fire vocal style set him apart from his contemporaries.

Having learned the basics of the guitar from his cousin John Wiggs, Arnold began playing in the early 1920s as a sideline while he worked as a farmhand in Buffalo, New York, and as a steelworker in Pittsburgh. In 1929 he moved to Chicago and set up a bootlegging business, an activity he continued throughout Prohibition. In 1930 Arnold moved south briefly, and made his first recordings, Rainy Night Blues and Paddlin' Blues, under the name Gitfiddle Jim for the Victor label in Memphis, Tennessee.

This Palma Mallorca (Spain) based band is originally from New York City and Oklahoma USA!! Tim Mitchell Richardson (the founder of The Mitchell Blues Band) has taken his music from America and all over the world. The unique style that Tim has brought with him from Oklahoma is a down home Blues with just a touch of funk and rock! Tim started playing the guitar from the tender age of 4 years old. He was actually thought by his mother ( his mom was also an incredible guitar/keyboard/ player herself) Matter of fact, Tim was blessed to be able to play any musical instrument that he decided to pick up. With the knowledge of music he played with different bands in bars and venues all over Oklahoma for many years. After being seasoned by the best he branched off to bigger and better opportunities. He started playing for well known artists : The Stylistics and James Brown. Also performing with Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes just to name a few. With these classic groups he started to travel to Europe

      <title>Willie King- King of the Blues - Tribute</title>
      <description>Podcast Tribute to the classic Blues and the modern day heros of music. Lets step into time and relive the the era that set the nation and time to what it is today. Join me as we bring the past to the present.

Willie King has loved and played the blues ever since he was 7 years old, as Willie says it, &quot;I am the Blues.&quot; Living in one of the poorest regions, of one of the poorest states in America, could give anyone a case of blues but Willie is constantly struggling against the odds to gain control. He's one of the true Alabama bluesmen who's lived the blues everyday of his life. It's no fad with him. When you hear Willie playing the blues you're hearing the truth and you can feel it. He's presently working with the Alabama Blues Project helping with blues education programs throughout the state and has recently completed his first solo CD called, &quot;I am the Blues.&quot; It was self-produced by Willie. His newest CDs, &quot;Freedom Creek&quot; and &quot;Living In A New World&quot; on Rooster Blues are available in most record stores.

      <title>radiators</title>
      <description>The Radiators were born during a transitional decade in the history of New Orleans music. The Meters, the premier funk band, had disbanded, the Neville Brothers formed, and in 1980 Professor Longhair, the father of New Orleans R&amp;B and spiritual embodiment of Crescent City Soul had passed on. This decade would prove to be the fertile period of development when a unique blend of rhythms and sounds came together and &quot;Fish Head&quot; music was born. The Radiators, an extremely eclectic group of musicians, rely on a myriad of musical influences to create their own sound - &quot;Fish Head Music&quot;. At a Radiators show it is not uncommon to hear blues, R&amp;B, jazz, country, Zydeco, soul, swing, and even gospel filtering through their original New Orleans Rock N' Roll.

This group could only come from New Orleans. Since its earliest settlement, the city developed a rich musical heritage that gave birth to 20th century American music. Musicians from this region were the first to incorporate African rhythms with Western melody. Beginning with culture-blending jam sessions at Congo Square, this musical tableau unfurled in the hands of artists such as JellyRoll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, Earl King, The Meters, Dr. John and others too numerous to mention. These acts provided great inspiration for the Radiators.


The Radiators are in their 26th year of providing some of the most intense live performances (over 3600 thus far!) of any band on the road today. Their intuitive grasp of each other's moves, coupled with a repertoire of nearly 1300 songs provides a basis for a fresh and spontaneous approach to their music.

The band formed in January 1978 in Keyboardist Ed Volker's garage. Ed, Frank Bua, and Camille Baudoin were performing in one band together, with Dave Malone and Reggie Scanlan in another. &quot;Ed invited us to come over to his house and jam; Dave and I figured we'd have a few beers together and play a couple of blues tunes,&quot; remembers Scanlan, &quot;instead, we jammed for five hours straight, then all quit our old bands the next day.&quot;

      <title>Dixon Brother- The School House Fire</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636772.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tough as the life of a professional musician must have been in the '30s, the plight of a typical Carolina millworker was a whole lot worse. This was the background that Dorsey and Howard Dixon were born into, as they and their family all worked in the mills of Darlington, Lancaster, and Greenville, SC, as well as East Rockingham, NC. Dorsey was born October 5, 1897, and his brother on June 9, 1903. Music was an outlet from the long hours, lousy pay, and miserable factory conditions, with the workers often picked on by their bosses for being so-called hillbillies, and persecuted by local police for being so-called communists. Perhaps a career in country music was inevitable for hillbilly communists and it surely must have seemed like it would be more rewarding. At any rate, Dorsey picked up guitar at 14 and switched to fiddle later. When his little brother also figured out chords on the guitar, the two put together a fiddle-guitar duo, although the older brother continued practicing guitar. The most important musical influence on the Dixons was a local guitarist named Jimmy Tarleton, who had been a member of a successful duo, Darby and Carleton. The Depression had sandbagged this duo's career, so Tarleton had returned to the Little Hanna Pickett Mill in East Rockingham and his old job as a textile worker. He made friends with the brothers and the talk frequently turned to music, with lots of song trading going on. The brothers flipped over Tarleton's slide-guitar sound, which was much more heavily influenced by black blues styles. A strength of the Dixon Brothers' sound inevitably was the blues influence they filtered down through their friend, the result being a bit less of an overt blues influence, but plenty of stylistic shading. Howard also switched instruments because of his new friend, so enamored was he with the sound of the National steel</description>

      <itunes:summary>As tough as the life of a professional musician must have been in the '30s, the plight of a typical Carolina millworker was a whole lot worse. This was the background that Dorsey and Howard Dixon were born into, as they and their family all worked in the mills of Darlington, Lancaster, and Greenville, SC, as well as East Rockingham, NC. Dorsey was born October 5, 1897, and his brother on June 9, 1903. Music was an outlet from the long hours, lousy pay, and miserable factory conditions, with the workers often picked on by their bosses for being so-called hillbillies, and persecuted by local police for being so-called communists. Perhaps a career in country music was inevitable for hillbilly communists and it surely must have seemed like it would be more rewarding. At any rate, Dorsey picked up guitar at 14 and switched to fiddle later. When his little brother also figured out chords on the guitar, the two put together a fiddle-guitar duo, although the older brother continued practicing guitar. The most important musical influence on the Dixons was a local guitarist named Jimmy Tarleton, who had been a member of a successful duo, Darby and Carleton. The Depression had sandbagged this duo's career, so Tarleton had returned to the Little Hanna Pickett Mill in East Rockingham and his old job as a textile worker. He made friends with the brothers and the talk frequently turned to music, with lots of song trading going on. The brothers flipped over Tarleton's slide-guitar sound, which was much more heavily influenced by black blues styles. A strength of the Dixon Brothers' sound inevitably was the blues influence they filtered down through their friend, the result being a bit less of an overt blues influence, but plenty of stylistic shading. Howard also switched instruments because of his new friend, so enamored was he with the sound of the National steel</itunes:summary>

Since this area has been built up to include industry and shopping malls, Scott moved farther away to northeast PA &quot;My dad gave me sort of a guitar for Christmas one year... it was a little plastic guitar with plastic strings - plucking along with my parents playing country music on the stereo. I was around 8 years old and my dad said, &quot;Play something like Johnny Cash and I will buy you a real one.&quot; I learned, I walk the line sort of and I finally got a guitar made of wood... buy my teacher was Mr. Joseph - a man about 82 years old. He wanted me to play Mary Had A Little Lamb' single notes... I soon got bored. Later, I got a real silver-tone Sears Electric and an amp from a friend. The guitar obsession was born playing Hendrix and early Elvis by ear.&quot; Later, Scott was taught some scales, on guitar by hippie guitar master, Dave Williams. At sixteen, he was playing with local bands. The showman was born, playing endlessly, then hooking up with the House Of Music Recording Studio in West Orange, NJ. Scott started to bump into all kinds of legends and making waves - taking work anywhere he could. Through many incarnations of all sorts, Scott has worked with, opened for, or played with living legends over the course of 25 years, including, Stevie Washington, George Clinton, Jr. Wells, John Lee Hooker, BB King, Buddy Guy, Jerry Garcia, U2, Dave Matthews, Bon Jovi, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Richie Havens to name a few. Scott was seriously busy trying any way he could, to learn from these legends. After nearly eight years of steady work and brushes with his own tragedies, Scott needed a break. In his own words, &quot;I was afraid I would look like Keith Richards by the time I was 40.&quot; Scott drastically slowed down and went on a journey of the spirit from doing sweat lodges to studying meditation in Tibetan monasteries and taking long hikes by himself. After spending a few months alone in his VW bus in Colorado and Montana, Scott had an awakening and moved back from isolation, realizing that music was his true calling. This was about eight years ago. Scott has been writing songs like a waterfall ever since.

I have had blues and rock&#180;n roll as hobby since the 70&#180;s and my influences come from a wide range of artists within rock and blues.

Why this name?
Got a nice ring to it. Originally LW Hawkins was a sheriff in Twin Falls County who managed to spot UFO:s back in the 40&#180;s.

Do you play live?
Have played bass in several cover bands. For the time being mostly recording playing most instruments by myself.

How, do you think, does the internet (or mp3) change the music industry?
Hot question right now...think the music industry will find a way to satisfy all parties in some kind of compromise for music distribution

Would you still sign a record contract with a major label?
Yes

Band History:
Earlier bands: Onyx, Ella Blues Band and Orientexpressen

Your influences?
Eagles, ZZ Top, BB King, Jimi Hendrix, Clapton, Led Zeppelin, John Lee Hooker, Swedish artists Louise Hoffsten and Mats Ronander to mention a couple of names.

Favorite spot?
The Swedish Archipelago

Equipment used:
Fender Telecaster, Epiphone guitar, Yamaha BB1600, Peavy amps. Still keep my original Colorsound Wah Wah from the 70&#180;s</description>

      <title>Little Freddie King- Cat Squall Blues</title>

Martin and he was born in McComb, Mississippi, July 19, 1940 down the road from Bo Diddley place. His father, Jessie James Martin, was a blues guitarist that worked the weekend southern circuit in the Delta. His father would bring him out on the town when he was out there playin. &quot;I would go out there and sit around on the outside around the juke joints and listenin.&quot; He'd be playin and drinkin and everyone was havin' fun. Freddie eventually taught himself how to play guitar and develop his country-style blues or as he calls it &quot;Gut Bucket Blues&quot;.

At the age of 17, Freddie moved from the farm to New Orleans to stay with his sister. There he met such upcoming stars as Buddy Guy and Slim Harpo. However, adapting to life in the big city wasn't easy as Freddie explains. &quot;I got lost all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;All the houses looked the same. I had to get the police to take me home or else they'd arrest me. Finally one of the policemen told me to look at the street sign and the number on the houses. It got easy to get around after that.&quot;

In 2001, I started using the Internet (blogs, MP3s, P2P) to spread my music and not worrying so much about copyright violation. I've even been giving the source of my songs away for remixers to play with. I figured that spreading my music should be the number one goal and so far it's worked out pretty well.

Despite giving my music away for free online, my songs have been licensed for television, played on commercial and campus radio, and I made enough money from licensing and sales to do a real pressing of my first CD

They have been playing their potent blues based mix of original songs and covers for the last 18 years in the south west of the UK. The twin guitar based band with lashings of harp from Jeff Horsey and backing vocals from the lovely Tucker sisters are a main draw on the blues scene in this neck of the woods. Check 'em out!


The band have always served as a magnet for up and coming talent and have often incorporated other musicians and even a four piece rocking brass section on occasions. For the last ten years Backdoormen have usually featured Gyan Bansall on rhythm and second lead guitar. (He plays beautiful Peter Green style licks) and Kate and Vanessa Tucker on lead and backing vocals. Their input into the band has been immense. Kate sings like Aretha Franklin while Vanessa is more Bonnie Raitt. What a combination! They look great too. . What sort of music should you expect at a Backdoormen gig? Well, the basic line up always features lashings of harmonica and guitar, but the band manage to produce a whole range of musical textures from straight ahead, Chicago style blues, to funky workouts like &#8220;Buddy Buddy Friends&#8221; and the original &#8220;Nightshift&#8221; soon to be released on the new CD.

      <title>Cora Mae Bryant: empty room blues</title>

He played with Blind Willie McTell, Buddy Moss, Barbecue Bob, Eddie Mapp and all of em. I remember I used to sit on Buddy Moss' and Eddie Mapp's lap and reach in their front pocket and pull out some chewing gum. They used to play around with my father.

We plays the original Georgia blues music. We plays and sings songs that my father, Blind Willie and Barbecue Bob and Buddy Moss made and Joshua plays them all so close. He really took the time to learn how to play em. And I makes up my own songs and Joshua plays them like my father and them, you know in that same style.



Cora Mae Bryant is the daughter of Georgia guitar legend Curley Weaver. She remembers, &quot;When the weekend came, Daddy would come and get me. We did not know the difference between night and day.&quot;
Cora is a blues scholar; her house is a blues museum. She can tell you everything one needs to know of the old blues. If you need a good lesson I strongly urge you to make a trip to her door in Oxford, Georgia.

      <title>Lee Gates-  My Wife Left Me</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636782.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blues guitarist Lee Gates was born in Mississippi sometime in the 1940s. As a first cousin to blues legend Albert Collins it seemed ordained that he would love the blues and become a blues artist. It&#8217;s easy to hear the family influence when Lee picks up his guitar and the music begins to flow.

Lee moved to Milwaukee in 1959 and started playing at Wilson&#8217;s Club at 10th and Center Street with the house band. He stayed with the club for 15 years straight and has been treating fans in Milwaukee to his brand of down home blues for almost fifty years.

Even though Lee and Albert both played the blues they never met until Lee was in his early 30s. Lee says it was due to his uncle living in Texas, &#8220;My daddy&#8217;s brother had a lot of kids out there in Texas. I never met them as a child, but we all knew of each other.&#8221;

After he finally met his legendary cousin in 1974, he would show him around Milwaukee whenever Albert came to town and they would do some gigs together. He remembers those times as something special and said, &#8220;He was a good friend to me.&#8221;

Even though Lee has performed his fluid style of music for 50 some years it has only been recently that he decided to record any of his music. In October 2003 he traveled to Alabama, spent three hours recording, pronounced the CD done, and gave the world the glorious tones of his magical guitar. Hopefully this will just be the start of a long and fruitful recording career.

At the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival this year Lee will give his thirsty public a long and cool drink of his down home traditional blues.</description>

      <title>Mississippi John Hurt - Frankie</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636784.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mississippi John Hurt
1892 - 1966


Mississippi John Hurt's father was Isom and his mother Mary Jan McCain.  He was born in Teoc, MS on July 3, 1892 in the hill country not far from the tiny town of Avalon whose population was not even one hundred. He was one of three children who at the age of nine, began to teach himself how to play the guitar when his Mother had bought him his first, &quot;Black Annie.&quot;  She paid $1.50 for it. Hurt had soon developed a style like no other artist of his time or from the area

Hurt was originally discovered in 1928 by Okeh recording director Tommy Rockwell when he had heard about John Hurt from two white country musicians he had recorded in the area, guitar player Shell Smith and fiddler Willie Narmour.  After recording Narmour, Rockwell quickly auditioned Hurt.  Hurt, who again had rarely left the Avalon area soon traveled to Memphis, TN where he recorded eight titles.  It was at this time that &quot;Frankie&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Dirty Business&quot; were released.  Hurt remembered being very nervous and completely out of his element as the producer made him sit up straight and still in front of the microphone, practically frozen as he sang.  His poor neck ached for days on end afterwards.  He also recalled being seated outside the recording studio with whom would become legends themselves, Lonnie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Bessie Smith.  Each of them would occasionally get up to sneak a peek at what was happening on the other side of the glass before they were unceremoniously brandished away and back to their seats.  These first recordings made Hurt a staggering $240.00 and all of his expenses were paid for.  Both &quot;Frankie&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Dirty Business&quot; sold very well and Hurt found himself traveling to New York City to once again record for Okeh.  Just before Christmas of 1928, Hurt recorded legendary tracks like &quot;Spike Driver Blues,&quot; &quot;Stack O' Lee,&quot; &quot;Avalon Blues&quot; and &quot;Louis Collins.&quot;  &quot;Louis Collins&quot; was a ballad written about the murder of the man named in the title.  Hurt had opined that Collins was a good and decent man who had been killed by two thugs named Bob and Louis.  He had heard of the story and known just enough about the events to turn them into a complexity of peaceful weariness and prophetic magic.   </description>

Like fine jambalaya, you just never know exactly what the Radiators will cook up. Their non stop yearly tours include the top clubs and festivals, from BB Kings in NYC to High Sierra fest in Quincy, CA. Their fans have honored the true New Orleans connection the Radiators represent by forming private krewes all over America. But instead of beads these people throw Radiators shows. Their DADs ball every Halloween in Minnesota has become legendary.

In only its fourth year, The Monkey Krewe of south Florida has followed valiantly in its predecessors footsteps. Like the Minnesota DADs krewe, many members of the Monkey Krewe are frequent visitors to New Orleans and have an eye for keeping things as authentic as possible. There is a Monkey Krewe Court with coronations and the weekend builds up to a masquerade ball known as the Monkey Ball, of course. And these fans do not miss a detail. They have a website and an email list. This is serious fun. When Monkey Ball rolls into South Florida the first weekend of January it will seem as if New Orleans was visiting, and that's the whole idea.</description>

There is a Monkey Krewe Court with coronations and the weekend builds up to a masquerade ball known as the Monkey Ball, of course. And these fans do not miss a detail. They have a website and an email list. This is serious fun. When Monkey Ball rolls into South Florida the first weekend of January it will seem as if New Orleans was visiting, and that's the whole idea.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Willie King</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636786.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willie&#8217;s first recording was a local production with Alabama bluesman &#8220;Birmingham&#8221; George Conner, titled Walkin&#8217; the Walk, Talkin&#8217; the Talk. This CD created an unexpected amount of interest, and promoted reviewer Gordon Baxter to state, &#8220;No label, no catalog number, and definitely no doubt about it, Walkin&#8217; The Walk Talkin&#8217; The Talk will feature in my top 10 albums of 2000.&#8221;

I Am the Blues, Willie&#8217;s next CD, was a solo project, produced by Willie King in collaboration with the Alabama Blues Project. Again, despite being independently produced and initially only locally distribute, this album gained a lot of critical acclaim. This CD was a &#8220;Top 10 Album of 2000&#8221; for Niles Frantz, host to Chicago Public Radio&#8217;s Comin&#8217; Home program. He described it as &#8220;Howlin&#8217; Wolf meets B.B. King in the Alabama backwoods. The real deal . . . brilliant.&#8221;

Jim O&#8217;Neal eventually caught up with Willie King to record Freedom Creek, Willie King&#8217;s debut album on Rooster Blues Records. With international distribution, this was King&#8217;s powerful introduction into the wider music and blues world. Not only was the album acclaimed by critics worldwide, it also received awards from Living Blues Magazine for Best Male Blues Artist (2001), Best Blues Album (2000) and Best Contemporary Blues Album (2000).

Dave also played in Quadimondi a progressive rock band. Keith was in Swan, Factor S, and Painter all cover and original bands. Painter toured the East Coast and was on several album projects. His latest project was West End, an all original contemporary rock band. Their CD was well received and they had a very loyal following.

      <title>Jack Falk Project- Tribute to Santana</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636788.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Being an independent artist. This move started out by having a few labels tell you they love you and your the best etc........ but they are not taking risk on this kind of music. Its not the 1970's anymore. Holding on to what I loved I continued on without any financial support from labels etc. Everything I did was on my own. This was now the late 90's and in investing my own money I started buying and selling analog multitrack recorders. There was a huge second hand market for these recorders as the turn of the independent musician and a home studio revolution was just starting to take place. I had Tascams, Otaris, MCI's, Ampex you name it they all came through my door. With all this going on I successfully got enough recording gear to do my own thing and not pay for studio time for recording. I was now ready for the next generation of music MP3's. MP3 sites were popping up all over the web. Only one was the real deal. The original MP3.com site. It no longer exists just a shell make shift version created by download.com. I do not have my music anywhere on that site.

        I decided back in 1999 to place some of my recordings on the MP3.com site. Just a few Flying Without Wings, Homesick Blues and Cruising The Rainforest. These songs were from my massive collection of reel to reel tapes I recorded in my home studio. I checked back in a few days and noticed my songs were topping the charts. I was like is this real or what. The formula at mp3 was to have CD's for sale and make money off each CD. MP3 would burn CD's one sale at a time if need be and the artist collected a few dollars from each one sold. In my accounting over the years 1999-2001 I had sold over 250,000 CD's and had over 1 1/2 million downloads. This equaled out to big money. I mean enough to buy a new house, new cars, and all new furniture. Kinda like the rappers of today you know MTV cribs  LOL!!  This was my payoff for all the hard years trying to make it happen. I earned this and I waited a long time for this moment in time. Man I paid big bucks in taxes those years! Did I learn my lesson from the past NO............ I spent all the money but I have the rewards to show for it. Sure enough the easy street ride came to a sudden halt in 2001. MP3 got sued and Universal took over and piece by piece shut down the site. The financial good times once again were over except this time I got to ride it out and reap the rewards. Funny thing MP3 would never release the names of who bought the CD's from me so I never really knew who did, just where they were located. Even with these crazy off the charts sales figures I once again have a grammy award winning producer who believed in me represent me once again to the labels with all my sales results and guess what... Once again they passed on me. They said I was an amazing artist but they did not handle what I was doing musically. As if I didn't expect this. The producer thought for sure it would be a sure deal but no go. I was not surprised. OK so where to now you say......

      <title>Joshkirkland Band  - Dark side of town</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636792.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the swamps of southeast Georgia, born in Waycross, and raised on Southern Rock and Blues. Josh Kirkland still calls his Mother &quot;Mama&quot; and speaks with a cool softness, not only is he a southern gentleman, he is one intense guitarist.

Josh became fascinated with the guitar at an early age, after receiving his first guitar for his 13th birthday, he began cutting his teeth on the popular rock music of the 80's but soon found himself being drawn toward the blues.

Josh's father who played Hammond B-3 organ in several local bands during the 70's not only wanted his son Josh to learn the music of his own generation, but to also learn the southern rock and blues based music that he himself came up playing. Josh was soon hooked on Duane Allman's slide guitar playing, he then discovered the music of Stevie Ray Vaughan which led him to all of the blues masters and the innovative Jimi Hendrix, the rest is history.

Josh Kirkland's debut cd release is a six string odyssey, full of searing guitar riffs &amp; soulful deep southern rooted vocals. You hear all of the influences, but there is more. Josh has evolved his own distinctive style. The Josh Kirkland Band's music is a mix of Blues, Southern Rock, Jazz, Funk, R&amp;B/Soul, Country etc. A typical Josh Kirkland Band show features songs for everyone, including original songs and covers ranging from a twangy Johnny Cash song to a jammin' Allman Brothers tune to a hard driving Jimi Hendrix cover complete with Kirkland playing screaming guitar solos with his teeth and behind his back. Truly, Kirkland is the type of player that has to be seen.

Over the years Josh has supported such acts as Rick Derringer, Pat Travers, Jerry Reed, and the Marshall Tucker Band. In 2005 Josh Kirkland was selected as one of the top ten blues artists worldwide in the &quot;Blues Idol&quot; competition. Most recently, the Josh Kirkland Band performed at the 2006 Wanee Festival in Live Oak FL, supporting the Derek Trucks Band, Robert Randolf, the North Mississippi Allstars, Gov't Mule, the Allman Brothers Band etc.

Joe McCoy played music under a variety of stage names but is best known as &quot;Kansas Joe McCoy.&quot; Born in Raymond, Mississippi, he was the older brother of blues accompanist Papa Charlie McCoy. As a young man, he was drawn to the music scene in Memphis, Tennessee where he played guitar and sang vocals during the 1920s. He teamed up with future wife Lizzie Douglas, a brilliant guitarist known as Memphis Minnie, and their 1929 recording of a song called &quot;Bumble Bee&quot; on the Columbia Records label was a hit. In 1930, the couple moved to Chicago where they were an important part of the burgeoning blues scene. Following their divorce, McCoy teamed up with his brother to form a band known as the &quot;Harlem Hamfats&quot; that performed and recorded during the second half of the 1930s.

At the outbreak of World War II Charlie McCoy entered the military but a heart condition kept Joe McCoy from service. Out on his own, he created a band known as &quot;Big Joe and His Rhythm&quot; that performed together throughout most of the 1940s. In 1950, at the age of 44, Joe McCoy died of heart disease only a few months before his brother Charlie. They are buried in Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.</description>

      <title>MICHAEL HEYMAN - If you see my baby</title>

From 1983-88, Michael fronted a series of blues outfits in the U.S.A. and Europe. As a result of concerts with artists such as Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, John Mayall&#8217;s Bluesbreakers, Albert Collins, James Cotton, Eric Burdon, Pat Travers, Alvin Lee, Leslie West, Nick Lowe, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Omar &amp; the Howlers and Marcia Ball, he earned a reputation in both blues and rock circles as an exciting and dynamic blues-rock artist in the long Texas tradition of guitarists fronting blues trios. Other highlights of this period were his associations with blues great Joe &quot;Guitar&quot; Hughes and with noted British musicians Ronnie Lane and Ian McLagan for the highly successful &#8220;RONNIE LANE APPEAL FOR A.R.M.S.&#8221; concert in 1985. Michael also had the honor of participating in an all-star jazz/blues concert with legendary saxophonist Arnett Cobb and being selected to represent Texas rhythm &amp; blues at the Willie Nelson/Wrangler Jeans Invitational in Austin, Texas. Upon returning to the United States in 1988, Michael retired from performing to spend time with his family. In 2003, Michael returned to the stage fronting a series of blues outfits and eventually purchased a block of studio time. What began as a demo session quickly developed into the sessions for his debut CD. &quot;Heart Full of Blues&quot; features eight original tracks as well as covers of &quot;Three Hours Past Midnight&quot; by Johnny &#8220;Guitar&#8221; Watson, &quot;My Sweet Little Honey Dripper&quot; by Jimmy &#8220;T-99&#8221; Nelson and the instrumental guitar showcase &quot;Steppin&#8217; Out&quot; by James Bracken. In addition to guitar artistry reminiscent of the early work of T-Bone Walker, B.B. King, Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor, &#8220;Heart Full of Blues&#8221; features guest performances by internationally acclaimed harmonica virtuoso Sonny Boy Terry, Houston's First Lady of Soul Trudy Lynn and the incomparable Tommie Lee Bradley. Michael will also be a featured artist along with the legendary Johnny Winter at the upcoming Guitarslingers Ball in Houston.

For this gig, we had no bass player nor a drummer. Therefore, for some
songs, a pre-recorded/arranged track was used on the Yamaha DGX-305 of
the drum and bass parts (and sometimes a quiet keyboard part such as
e-piano or grand piano). For other songs, a drum pattern from the
Yamaha DGX-305 was used and K. Selby played bass and keys live (using
the DGX-305 in Split mode). In a few cases, a drum pattern from the
Yamaha DGX-305 was used and K. Selby played bass on the DGX-305 and
keys using a Roland A-30 triggering various sound libraries hosted in
Sonar 3.11 on the Notebook PC (see next paragraph). These permutations
are noted for each song listed below. We are providing this information
because we believe in fully informing our listeners of the specifics of
our shows as well as possibly inspiring others to use relatively basic,
inexpensive and available equipment to play live. Try it! It's fun!

      <title>Grateful Dead Live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on 1985-09-07 (September 7, 1985)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636797.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grateful Dead was an American psychedelia-influenced rock band formed in 1965 in San Francisco. The band was known for its unique and eclectic songwriting style&#8212;which fused elements of rock, folk music, bluegrass, blues, country, jazz, and gospel&#8212;and for live performances of long modal jams.

The Grateful Dead's fans, some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for years, were known as Deadheads and were renowned for their dedication to the band's music. Many followers referred to the band simply as The Dead.

The Grateful Dead became the de facto resident band of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, with the early sound heavily influenced by Kesey's LSD-soaked Acid Tests, as well as R&amp;B. Their musical influences varied widely with input from the psychedelic music of the era, combined with blues, jazz, rock and roll, and bluegrass. These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead &quot;the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world.&quot; [1].</description>

Raised on the plantation Skip was interested in music early and had learned guitar by age 8. After learning piano in high school he dropped out to hobo around and began earning a living from music around 1918. He worked parties, roadhouses, jukes, and barrelhouses in the South and Midwest, notably Memphis into the 1920's. He attended divinity school and became active in ministry work from the mid-twenties. He was ordained a Baptist minister in 1932 supporting himself preaching and playing churches and concerts in the forties. James was ordained a Methodist minister in 1946 and worked outside music preaching until 1964 when he started working the folk festival and college circuit riding the blues revival wave.

An influence to Robert Johnson, Skip James recorded 17 selections for Paramount in 1931. His surviving works of this time demonstrate a masterful and unique style on both guitar and piano. Skip's haunting delivery was created by his falsetto singing over a rythymic and erratic instrumental accompaniment. The Depression suppressed his record sales and left him in obscurity until rediscovered in 1964. Illness curtailed Skip James' performing career in 1968 and he died of cancer on October 3, 1969. </description>

      <title>Josh Kirkland band-  Hard Time Blues</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636800.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the swamps of southeast Georgia, born in Waycross, and raised on Southern Rock and Blues. Josh Kirkland still calls his Mother &quot;Mama&quot; and speaks with a cool softness, not only is he a southern gentleman, he is one intense guitarist.

Josh became fascinated with the guitar at an early age, after receiving his first guitar for his 13th birthday, he began cutting his teeth on the popular rock music of the 80's but soon found himself being drawn toward the blues.

Josh's father who played Hammond B-3 organ in several local bands during the 70's not only wanted his son Josh to learn the music of his own generation, but to also learn the southern rock and blues based music that he himself came up playing. Josh was soon hooked on Duane Allman's slide guitar playing, he then discovered the music of Stevie Ray Vaughan which led him to all of the blues masters and the innovative Jimi Hendrix, the rest is history.

Josh Kirkland's debut cd release is a six string odyssey, full of searing guitar riffs &amp; soulful deep southern rooted vocals. You hear all of the influences, but there is more. Josh has evolved his own distinctive style. The Josh Kirkland Band's music is a mix of Blues, Southern Rock, Jazz, Funk, R&amp;B/Soul, Country etc. A typical Josh Kirkland Band show features songs for everyone, including original songs and covers ranging from a twangy Johnny Cash song to a jammin' Allman Brothers tune to a hard driving Jimi Hendrix cover complete with Kirkland playing screaming guitar solos with his teeth and behind his back. Truly, Kirkland is the type of player that has to be seen.

Over the years Josh has supported such acts as Rick Derringer, Pat Travers, Jerry Reed, and the Marshall Tucker Band. In 2005 Josh Kirkland was selected as one of the top ten blues artists worldwide in the &quot;Blues Idol&quot; competition. Most recently, the Josh Kirkland Band performed at the 2006 Wanee Festival in Live Oak FL, supporting the Derek Trucks Band, Robert Randolf, the North Mississippi Allstars, Gov't Mule, the Allman Brothers Band etc.

serious bands on the scene. Their debut album, in final mixdown
at VuDu Studios, is the next natural evolution, a CD that will get them certain airplay on commercial stations playing local talent and college stations hungry for material that reflects a love for the style of music that a group plays. With recent rave reviews around the New York City scene as well,it's clear that 2001 is the year of the Shark.&quot;

&quot;This is a band dedicated to creating new material that sizzles with desire while tipping their cap to a line of great blues men that have inspired them over the decades.&quot;

&quot;Had a taste yet? Now is a good time to start, before Chumslick Nick and the Sharks take off on that inevitable bigger tour.&quot;

Since I have been a performing artist for 35 years, and a Christian for 25 years, this seemed like a perfect match for me. We assembled this band and produced a CD of high quality blues, and classic rock with a funky, jazzy texture, and lyrics that have eternal significance. Since then we have covered a lot of territory, gotten some rave reviews and made some headway in becoming known. We have, for example had over 70,000 downloads on MP3.com and we have sold almost 1000 of our CDs with no distribution. We have also had 9 of the top ten Christian Blues songs on MP3.com for almost a week. In 2003 we have toured 7 states, and played everything from prisons, juvenile homes and rehab centers to outdoor festivals, coffee houses and churches. We are willing to go wherever we are called, and play music that is not only joyful and uplifting but spiritually significant. We are all about JOY!!

      <title>Red Hot Blues by andy Kimbal</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636804.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Kimbel is a very talented folk and country-blues performer whose star is rising quickly on the national blues and folk scene. Listen to him play and you will hear the influences of traditional blues, folk, R&amp;B and a touch of New Orleans style roots music. Hard to pigeonhole, Kimbel has been likened to Lightning Hopkins, John Hammond, Chris Smither and Leo Kotkke. He performs a unique selection of material that ranges from gentle ballads and pointed originals, to hard driving country blues and slide guitar using various tunings and harmonics. Interspersed between his own songs, Andy also includes songs ranging from traditional folk tunes to more contemporary ballads and delights in having the audience participate in many of the numbers. His own distinct interpretations set him apart and give even old traditional blues a new face. Andy is a great improviser, often re-inventing words and music using the themes of traditional blues stemming from the early 20&#8217;s to the mid 30&#8217;s. &quot;His always expressive guitar playing ranges from frolicking and exuberant to driving and soulful. Whether picking, plucking, or using a skillful slide, Kimbel brings to the stage vision of the roots of American Music that conjures up everything from rambling railroad trains to dark and lonely nights of solitary traveling&quot;... Pam Miller, Big Shout Magazine

Andy is a great improviser, often re-inventing words and music using the themes of traditional blues stemming from the early 20&#8217;s to the mid 30&#8217;s. &quot;His always expressive guitar playing ranges from frolicking and exuberant to driving and soulful. Whether picking, plucking, or using a skillful slide, Kimbel brings to the stage vision of the roots of American Music that conjures up everything from rambling railroad trains to dark and lonely nights of solitary traveling&quot;...

So many of life's tragedies have messed up reality, that songwriting and performing live music, is the desired realm of existence. Non-Conformity! Quoting from Hornor: &quot;Rock and Roll let's the Blues groove, and the Soul can shine through too&quot;. Chance want's to &quot;do his part&quot;, and then some. Plays with anyone and excells in multiple genres. Roots in Gospel, broke away young into Rock, R&amp;B, and Soul. Records at home, jamming and recording these originals with Phatt Hornor, while playing guitar for several NE Louisiana bands. Notorious for being the only &quot;white boy&quot; in black R&amp;B bands. Great vocalist with incredible range and sustain. Slide guitar is emphasized as an exceptional style signature. However, Chance is an excellent drummer, and a very creative bassist too. He has recorded in Nashville, for other various songwriters, produced and engineered several originals in the past few years. Chance Lain is preparing to be heard. Phatt Hornor has an ear and a composure that cause others to ask for opinion and advice. Honest and constructive, he writes guitar rhythms along with lyrics that say something about how he feels and what he experiences in day to day life. He is one of a kind. Chance Lain and Phatt Hornor both live in Bastrop, Louisiana. These two collaberate on occassion, when time permits. Only if there were bigger clubs in the area, and more people would get up off of their things.</description>

      <title>BB Chung King &amp;amp; The Buddaheads  - Still the rain</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636806.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB Chung King &amp; The Buddaheads are back on the LA scene after returning from a tour of Asia and the U.S. Taking a year and a half off, Alan Mirikitani (aka BB Chung King) established his own 24 track recording studio &quot;Dawghouse Studios&quot; in Burbank California.

BB's music is a mix of roots rock with a blues base. BB has always claimed blues to be his first love, but comes from a generation that loves to rock. Their first CD &quot;Blues Had A Baby&quot;, was released in 1994 on RCA/BMB and received generous support from radio fans. If you have to categorize the music, it is somewhere between newer artists Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Blues Travelers. But make no mistake, BB Chung King &amp; The Buddaheads are the original LA version!

He began playing rather late in life, while attending college at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

His music career took him through several phases ranging from touring the southwest in a rock and roll band in the early 80's to country music in the early 90's, before taking a 10 year hiatus from music all together. He regained his interest in music after rekindling friendships with some old musician friends a few years ago.

 His current direction combines jazz, blues and rock and he hopes to showcase this with the release of a CD in the near future.

      <title>Billy Marquis   Hhighway 82 blues</title>

Not bad for a guy who doesnt look a day over thirty, huh. He started out with RocknRoll but you cant grow up in the middle of the Mississippi Delta without hearing the Blues and the Blues won out.

His music heritage? On the insert of his new CD, The Blues and Beyond He thanks a few poeple who have meant a lot to him over the years. Those people include his father, Billy G Marquis Sr., of whom he refers to as the first musician I ever knew and admired.

He shares the Blues stage with an impressive array of musicians. Steve Hauth on bass, Jim Michie on Keys and Robert Marquis on drums. These guys really lay down some rhythm for Billys guitar to wail over.

Lately Billy Marquis can be found hangin out at the The Bait Shop on Walnut Street, in Greenville, Mississippi and on Beale Steet in Memphis, to name a few places. His music is different, his guitar work innovative, and his lyrics heartfelt. Give him a listen when pulls into your town.</description>

He quickly picked up the twelve-string guitar, and his father would often leave him on street corners to sing for money, where his newfound powerful voice left an indelible impression on passersby (legend has it that he was arrested for nearly starting a riot at a New Orleans courthouse with a powerful rendition of &quot;If I Had My Way I'd Tear the Building Down&quot;, a song about Samson and Delilah). This song was performed hundreds of times by the Grateful Dead, and the live recordings of their version of the song have helped preserve it for decades.

At age 25, Willie married a young singer named Angelina, who was the sister of blues guitarist L.C. Robinson. His wife sung with him in some of his 30 recordings with Columbia Records from 1927-1930. Some examples of which Angelina Johnson sung with him were songs such as &quot;Church I'm Fully Saved Today&quot;, &quot;When the War Was On&quot;, &quot;John the Revelator&quot;, and &quot;Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning&quot;. John the Revelator would eventually be recorded by delta blues musician Son House, and his other song, Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning, was recorded by another delta blues musician, Fred McDowell.

Johnson remained poor until the end, preaching and singing in the streets of Beaumont, Texas to anyone who would listen. In 1945, his home inexplicably burned to the ground. With nowhere else to go, Johnson lived in the burned ruins of his home, sleeping on a wet bed his wife had prepared for him. He lived like this until, two weeks later, he contracted pneumonia and died. Although there is some dispute as to where his actual gravesite is, concerned members of the Beaumont community have committed to finding the site, and preserving it.</description>

Of African American and Cherokee descent, he was born January 16, 1896, in Hernando, Mississippi, 21 miles from Memphis, Tennessee. He died May 26, 1987.

Wilkins worked in Memphis during the 1920s at the same time as Furry Lewis, Memphis Minnie (whom he claimed to have tutored), and Son House. He also organized a jug band to capitalize on the &quot;jug band craze&quot; then in vogue. Though never attaining success comparable to the Memphis Jug Band, Wilkins reinforced his local popularity with a 1927 appearance on a Memphis radio station. Like Sleepy John Estes (and unlike Gus Cannon of Cannon's Jug Stompers) he recorded alone or with a single accompanist. He sometimes performed as Tim Wilkins or as Tim Oliver (his step-father's name).

His best known songs are &quot;That's No Way To Get Along&quot; (covered as &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; by The Rolling Stones), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (covered by Muddy Waters and which inspired The Rolling Stones very name), and &quot;Old Jim Canan's&quot;.

He became an elder of the Church of God in Christ in the 1930s and began playing gospel music with a blues feel.

The &quot;Reverend&quot; Robert Wilkins was rediscovered by blues enthusiasts during the 1960s blues revival, making appearances at folk festivals and recording his gospel blues for a new audience. His distinction was his versatility; he could play ragtime, blues, minstrel songs, and gospel with equal facility</description>

Lesh started out as a trumpet player with a keen interest in avant-garde classical music and free jazz; he also studied under the Italian modernist Luciano Berio (a classmate was the minimalist composer Steve Reich). While still a college student he met then-bluegrass banjo player Jerry Garcia. They formed a friendship and eventually Lesh was talked into becoming the bass guitarist for Garcia's new rock group, then known as the Warlocks. He joined them for their third or fourth gig (memories vary) and stayed until the end.

Lesh had never played bass before joining the band, which meant he learned &quot;on the job&quot;, but it also meant he had no preconceived attitudes about the instrument's traditional &quot;rhythm section&quot; role. Indeed, he has said that his playing style was influenced more by Bach counterpoint than by rock or soul bass players (although one can also hear the fluidity and power of a jazz bassist such as Charles Mingus or Jimmy Garrison in Lesh's work).</description>

He is considered by many to be the &quot;Father of Delta Blues&quot; and therefore one of the oldest known figures of American popular music.

Charley Patton is one of the first mainstream stars of the Delta blues genre. Patton, who was born in Hinds County, Mississippi near Edwards or Bolton, lived most of his life in Sunflower County, in the Mississippi Delta. He was extremely popular across the U.S. South, and (in contrast to the itinerant wandering of most blues musicians of his time) was invited to perform at plantations and taverns.

He is credited with creating an enduring body of American music and personally inspiring just about every Delta blues man (Robert Palmer, 1995). Palmer considers him among the most important musicians that America produced in the twentieth century. Long before Jimi Hendrix he was the entertainer's entertainer with dazzling showmanship, often playing guitar on his knees and behind his head, as well as behind his back.</description>

      <title>King Robbie  Classic case of the Blues</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636821.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi...I'm Robbie King, blues guitarist and song writer.My music is both retro and modern..sort of Ottis Redding meets Robert Cray meets Stevie Ray Vaughan! This isn't by copying someones style either...I was born in Witchita FallsTexas and grew up listening to some of the greatist R&amp;B and Blues artist there were at the time..artist such as Ray Charles to BB King and everyone in between. As I grew into the Blues, my sights were set high. I wanted to play on stage with the likes of Eric Clapton ,BB King,Jeff Beck and others...I felt that one day I would have the maturity as a Blues guitar player, to be able to stand on the same stage with my hero's and be noticed and appreciated by these great artist's. My wish to play with these wonderful people seem to be coming true.. To date I have played on stage with Bonnie Riatt ,Johnny Neel once a song writer and keyboard player for the Allman Brothers Band, just to name a few... My music is no doubt Blues, but with a very original twist I'm sure will please blues fans everywhere!! So be on the look out for Robbie King... My first solo album (Classic Case Of The Blues), is my calling card...I hope that those of you who have a chance to listen it,will enjoy it. These songs are both yours and mine! All from the heart and all real! All the best to yah! ....... Robbie King </description>

      <title>Henry Thomas  Texas Easy Street</title>

When  Thomas first recorded for the  Vocalion label in the late 1920s, he was already over 50 years old and most assuredly was the eldest African-American performer ever to lay down tracks considered Blues music at the time.

    Thought to have been born in 1874 in Big Sandy, Texas, Henry was one of nine children by parents who were former slaves and sharecroppers raising cotton. Having a strong dislike for farming, Henry Thomas ran away from home as a teenager and struck upon the life of a hobo and street musician. He traveled by foot with his guitar slung over his shoulder or by the rails throughout most of Eastern Texas, occasionally making his way as far as Chicago. He was also believed to have performed at two World's Fairs crossing over the centuries, the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair.</description>

Blind Willie became an accomplished musical theorist, able to both read and write music in Braille, through an encouraging family and strong faith.

While few of his recordings ever earned mainstream popularity, his influence on the modern music and art scene is widely known. His songs (Statesboro Blues, Broke Down Engine Blues, etc...) have been recorded by famous artists such as the Allman Brothers, Taj Mahal and others.

He left the music scene for the pulpit in later life and the details of Blind Willie's death remain nebulous; nonetheless, his legacy grows exponentially each year.

You have to maintain a certain tolerance for ambiguity to understand how a disabled African American from central Georgia in the early part of the 20th century could inspire the likes of the most successful and influential Blues, Jazz and Rock musicians of our time.</description>

      <title> Bob Walkenhorst -venue Molloys irish Pub 2004</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17241/600x600_636829.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEGINNER &#8212; Bob Walkenhorst

When a great rock n&#8217;roll band comes to an end, where does the music go?

Bob Walkenhorst, lead singer and songwriter of The Rainmakers, answers that question on his first solo CD, The Beginner.

&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to make a record where I set out to prove that I could single-handedly make up for the absence of the Rainmakers. Instead, I wanted this to be a discovery of what I truly sounded like without them.&#8221;

In thirteen new (and very short) songs, Walkenhorst has pared his already elemental approach to song arrangements down to a skeletal acoustic guitar, bass, and drums, most often played by his one-man-band. Harmonica is the lead instrument of choice, with the notable exception of a honking sax solo by Johnny Reno on &#8220;Jan Vermeer,&#8221; a Chuck Berry-style rocker about the great Dutch painter. The only lead guitar solo on the CD is played by Kansas City guitarist Jack W. Hayhow, Jr., on another retro-rocker, &#8220;J-Walkers,&#8221; about the first band Walkenhorst ever heard. Vocal harmonies appear on only one song, &#8220;Just Leaving.&#8221; From the sparse instrumentation to the early-&#8217;60s-style extreme-stereo production, the overall sound of The Beginner is as much about what has not been recorded as it is about what you do hear.</description>

      <itunes:summary>THE BEGINNER &#8212; Bob Walkenhorst

When a great rock n&#8217;roll band comes to an end, where does the music go?

Bob Walkenhorst, lead singer and songwriter of The Rainmakers, answers that question on his first solo CD, The Beginner.

&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to make a record where I set out to prove that I could single-handedly make up for the absence of the Rainmakers. Instead, I wanted this to be a discovery of what I truly sounded like without them.&#8221;

In thirteen new (and very short) songs, Walkenhorst has pared his already elemental approach to song arrangements down to a skeletal acoustic guitar, bass, and drums, most often played by his one-man-band. Harmonica is the lead instrument of choice, with the notable exception of a honking sax solo by Johnny Reno on &#8220;Jan Vermeer,&#8221; a Chuck Berry-style rocker about the great Dutch painter. The only lead guitar solo on the CD is played by Kansas City guitarist Jack W. Hayhow, Jr., on another retro-rocker, &#8220;J-Walkers,&#8221; about the first band Walkenhorst ever heard. Vocal harmonies appear on only one song, &#8220;Just Leaving.&#8221; From the sparse instrumentation to the early-&#8217;60s-style extreme-stereo production, the overall sound of The Beginner is as much about what has not been recorded as it is about what you do hear.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Band/Artist: Radiators</title>

as posted on Radsfans.net

The Radiators were born during a transitional decade in the history of New Orleans music. The Meters, the premier funk band, had disbanded, the Neville Brothers formed, and in 1980 Professor Longhair, the father of New Orleans R&amp;B and spiritual embodiment of Crescent City Soul had passed on. This decade would prove to be the fertile period of development when a unique blend of rhythms and sounds came together and &quot;Fish Head&quot; music was born. The Radiators, an extremely eclectic group of musicians, rely on a myriad of musical influences to create their own sound - &quot;Fish Head Music&quot;. At a Radiators show it is not uncommon to hear blues, R&amp;B, jazz, country, Zydeco, soul, swing, and even gospel filtering through their original New Orleans Rock N' Roll.

This group could only come from New Orleans. Since its earliest settlement, the city developed a rich musical heritage that gave birth to 20th century American music. Musicians from this region were the first to incorporate African rhythms with Western melody. Beginning with culture-blending jam sessions at Congo Square, this musical tableau unfurled in the hands of artists such as JellyRoll Morton, Fats Domino, Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, Earl King, The Meters, Dr. John and others too numerous to mention. These acts provided great inspiration for the Radiators.</description>
