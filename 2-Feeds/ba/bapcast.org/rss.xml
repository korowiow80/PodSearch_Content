      <itunes:summary>There is no possibility of doing Krishna bhakti without Guru bhakti. You cannot engage in Krishna bhakti without honoring the Guru, without honoring the Vaishnavas. In Sri Bhakti Rasamrita sindhu by Srila Rupa Goswami Prabhupada there is a discussion about the angas of bhakti. Anga means limb, like my arms or my legs and angi means the body. So the angi has angas. Rupa Goswami gives the angas of Krishna bhakti, 64 limbs of bhakti to Krishna. In listing those angas of Krishna bhakti what is the first thing that he says? What is the first anga of Krishna bhakti? He says guru padasraya... we have to take shelter of the feet of the Guru, to come and sit and hear. So this is the first anga of the angi of Krishna bhakti.    </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:subtitle>How to serve all Vaishnavas</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>There is a story in the Mahabharata about the Kauravas who sent the Pandavas into the forest to be in exile. And these Kauravas they thought: &quot;Let us make the Pandavas envious by having a big party right next to were they are exiled, we are going to have a big feast and we are going to sing and dance and these guys (the Pandavas) cannot come out because they are in exile, let&#039;s really torture them in this way.&quot; So they (the Kauravas) were in the middle of their partying when suddenly the Gandharvas, who are some very powerful people, they found out about their party. Having a grudge against the Kauravas, the Gandharvas came and invaded their party and they took everybody prisoner. One messenger went to Yudhishtira and said: &quot;Somebody took the Kauravas as prisoners, their whole party was destroyed by the Gandharvas.&quot; And then Yudhishtira said: &quot;Oh, then we have to go and free them, we have to protect them, Bhima go and get your weapons, we are going to go and help the Kauravas.&quot; Bhima said: &quot;Never, never I will do this, move one finger for these Kauravas. No Yudhishtira, you cannot ask me that, anything else you can ask me.&quot; Then Yudhishtira said: &quot;Listen Bhima, you are right, they are rascals and they should be chastised, they are real nonsense and they have done real stupid things, but when we are under attack we are 105 (The Kauravas are 100 brothers and the Pandavas 5 brothers), because we have a family relationship. If a foreign interest, a foreign danger approaches, even though I have a misgiving with my brother or with my nephew, when we are under attack we are 105.&quot; In India the junior submits to the senior unlike in the west where we even fight with our father. We have no understanding of tradition, of keeping something unified and strong. So Bhima finally said that if this is your order Yudhishtira I obey. They went and they freed the Kauravas and defeated the Gandharvas. This shows you how powerful these 5 brothers were, what the whole Kauravas could not do. So in the same way when we are under attack, we are one Vaishnavas, doesn&#039;t matter wether we are Ramanujas, Madhvacharyas or Vallabhacharyas.    </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:subtitle>Thinking that we are the center of the universe</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>There is a law in physics which says that every action has a corresponding reaction. People learn about it in school but they do not learn how to apply this law in real life. They think that this is a law for the mechanical department, or maybe it is a law for the chemical department, but they do not think that this is a law for the life department. You are functioning under this law. Every one of your actions will bring about a corresponding reaction, no exception to the rule. Everybody teaches it in every school in the world, but they do not apply it to their own life. If I use a little bit too much salt then what happens to the food? It becomes spoiled. If I cook it too long, or too little, too much salt, too little salt, every detail has a reaction. So then why do you think that life has no reactions? Why you think that you can kill, intoxicate, you can abort children, you can do anything without getting a reaction? You know why you think in that way? Because you idiot think that you are the center of the universe.    </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:subtitle>Trying to conquer the relative or submit to the absolute</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Do we belong to the relative or to the absolute? If we would belong to the relative and it is natural to die then why we do not want this? It is natural that we need food so nobody is upset by the fact that he needs to take food. It is natural that we have to go to the bathroom, it is not such a pleasant thing but still we all submit to the process. But when it comes to death we are really upset about it and we do so many things in this world to try to avoid it. Death is a relative thing and we belong to the absolute, so we are in absolute opposition towards the relative impact of death. And even the announcements of death called old age and disease are very much against what we aspire to meet. But because we are in this relative existence with a body subjected to the rules and regulations of this relative world there is nothing we can do about it, we simply have to accept. So we are in confrontation between the absolute and the relative. Nobody can say that: &quot;this is not my struggle, this is not my topic.&quot; Hiranyakasipu wanted to conquer the relative, he said: &quot;I will do something about it. I will become a yogi and I will get so much power that death will not be able to touch me.&quot; So he became a great yogi and he was very determined in what he was doing. He went into yoga meditation and started to make extreme tapasya (austerities) in order to conquer death.    </itunes:summary>

We hear from the Ramayana that any complain any citizen had, specifically a brahmin, he could go right away to the king and complain to him: &quot;My dear King, you are supposed to be the ideal ruler, why this is going on, why that is going on?&quot; and the king had to respond to this complain.

      <itunes:summary>One of my godbrothers went to the beach in Jagannath Puri, he was a hippie. As he walked he saw something shining on the beach. He went down and looked and there was a little Krishna deity. So he picked Him up and immediately he was attracted to the Deity and without having any other introduction or knowledge about it he carried the Deity to his home and started to offer food to Him. Very shortly after that he went to Hyderabad and met the devotees on the street and they invited him to meet Srila Prabhupada. He went there and fell in love with Srila Prabhupada at once, became his disciple and Prabhupada made him the pujari of Radha Madhava in Mayapur. That was 28 years ago or more and he is still pujari there.    </itunes:summary>

      <description>One of my godbrothers went to the beach in Jagannath Puri, he was a hippie. As he walked he saw something shining on the beach. He went down and looked and there was a little Krishna deity. So he picked Him up and immediately he was attracted to the Deity and without having any other introduction or knowledge about it he carried the Deity to his home and started to offer food to Him. Very shortly after that he went to Hyderabad and met the devotees on the street and they invited him to meet Srila Prabhupada. He went there and fell in love with Srila Prabhupada at once, became his disciple and Prabhupada made him the pujari of Radha Madhava in Mayapur. That was 28 years ago or more and he is still pujari there.    </description>

      <itunes:subtitle>Understanding the cause and importance of our existence</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>How important are we? That is actually only answerable in connection with the cause of our existence. The cause supposedly is an indicator to the purpose, and when the purpose is fulfilled and the cause is thus satisfied we can thus define what was the value. How important are we, if we could not talk about this subject we would not know if we are important at all. If we want to be important without knowing the reason why we exist or why we are important then that would bring about a state of consciousness of self-righteousness which is artificial and not accepted by others and which would finally prove to be erroneous by the very development of the history of matter and your participation in it.         </itunes:summary>
