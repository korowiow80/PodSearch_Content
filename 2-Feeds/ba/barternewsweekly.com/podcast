			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my second video review this week, I went through the SwapRight.com website. They have a bit better user interface than Barterian did, the option of logging in with Facebook Connect, and an easier sign up process, but have the same problems that most of these barter startups have: no tools for hooking people up, no great way to search for what you want, and nothing to help you get a transaction underway. Overall they get a C+ only because I like the look and feel better. Still just as difficult to use as Barterian.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VeggieTrader.com is a new online startup dedicated to the free spread of home grown produce. The idea is to trade what excess produce you may have for the produce that you want. According to the site, &#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe a bonanza of fruits, vegetables, fresh herbs and more are found right in your own backyard—and your neighbors’ yard too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s local, affordable and sustainable, but we&#8217;ve noticed a lot of it goes to waste. You plant too many tomatoes, or your plum tree has a bumper crop, most of which is enjoyed by the sidewalk and the grass&#8230;</p>
<p>So we’ve launched Veggie Trader – a free resource for bringing good food and good people together.</p>
<p>Wish you could turn your excess plums into lemons, or maybe even a little cash? Use this site to find neighbors to swap with or sell your excess produce to. Or if you specialize in growing tomatoes, find neighbors who specialize in other produce and form networks to share in the variety. Even if you don&#8217;t have a garden, Veggie Trader is your place for finding local food near you.</p></blockquote>

Plan on seeing more of these in the future. Asset Fair is an exchange system for property, services, and debt. From their site:</p>
<blockquote><p>In today’s world of financial challenges, it makes sense to use the barter (cash-free) exchange system – the earliest form of trading – when looking to dispose of or acquire a new asset. While it may be difficult to find a cash buyer for your property, plane, yacht or other high-end assets, there may be owners of other assets who would wish to trade their asset for yours. This scenario offers numerous advantages. You spread your leverage in different forms of assets, you acquire that toy or property you have longed for and you minimize your tax impact. You may even end up with some cash or debt relief – after all, cash is just another form of asset.</p>
<p>ASSETFAIR is the universal asset platform and your ultimate tool through which you can evaluate and manage your portfolio of possessions.</p></blockquote>
