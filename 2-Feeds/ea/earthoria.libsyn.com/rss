I then head to the coast at Miraflores, and to the super cool Larco Mar bar complex.<br/><br/>The following day is museum day, with trips to Museo Larco Rafael Herrera - home to 50,000 pre-Colombian pots, and a fabulous and famous collection of erotic ceramics, and later on to the ‘main’ museum in Lima - Museo de la Nacion.<br/><br/>Following Lima, I get a bus 9 hours south to Nazca and take a rollercoaster flight over the Nazca lines, then head on another 10 hours South to the beautiful Colonial town (and UNESCO World Heritage Site) of Arequipa 2300m up in the Andes where I visit some frozen 500 year old Incan ice mummies in Museo Santuarios Andinos, and finish the podcast in the incredible 16th century ‘citadel’ Monasterio de Santa Catalina.<br/><br/>This podcast will be followed by another podcast from Southern Peru in the next couple of weeks covering the Colca Canyon, Puno, Lake Titicaca, and Cusco, followed by a long stay helping to develop an Eco-yoga community in the Sacred Valley outside Cusco, where I hope to finally get a chance to learn and practice yoga, and also learn about eco-building and organic cultivation. <br/>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://earthoria.libsyn.com/earthoria-p35-north-peru]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This podcast covers Northern Peru, starting at Chiclayo I head out on a tour to the 1500 year old Moche ruins at Sipán. Following this, I head three hours down the coast to the town of Trujillo, where I visit the Chimu city of Chan Chan, the largest Adobe (mud) city in the World and around 1300AD home to 60,000 people. </p>
<p>Just outside Trujillo, and near to Chan Chan are the Huacas (sacred places) of the sun and moon - Huaca de la Luna and Huaca del Sol. These structures are also Moche adobe pyramids from about 800AD, and Huaca del Sol is the largest single pre-Colombian structure in Peru - built from an estimated 140 million adobe bricks.</p>
<p>I finish the podcast in Huanchaco, 12km north of Trujillo. Huanchaco is a fishing town of about 12,000 inhabitants, that has now become well known thanks to three things - its reed fishing boats, its lovely beach and its fabulous surfing.</p>

this year by <a href="http://www.earthoria.com/songkran-2008-chiang-mai-the-water-festival.html">Songkran, the water festival</a>.
It has been so hot that I have started to find it quite difficult
living here. A good night’s sleep has become a thing of the past, and
you find yourself sweating around the clock - you wake up damp, and go
to bed damp. Not very pleasant at all!</p>

<p>Last night the weather finally broke, and the sounds you hear in
this audio file are the sounds of the first storm following this build
up. I’m happy to say it’s now gray with temperatures probably back
around 30 degrees again! Bring on the rainy season!</p>

Depending on what visa you enter Thailand with, you may be required to leave Thailand after 30, 60 or 90 days. There are a few points that you can do this, but two of the most common are the crossings at Mae Sot and Mae Sai. Both these crossings require that you walk over a bridge, enter Burma and get your passport stamped.<br/><br/>This month I decided to do my crossing at Mae Sai as it can be done in one (albeit long) day from Chiang Mai. 13 hours later I returned home. <br/>]]></description>
