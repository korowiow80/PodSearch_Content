    <description>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
LEGENDARY NEW YORK RAPPER CAPONE
RETURNS WITH SECOND ALBUM ON Pain,Time,Glory Entertprises
&quot;Menace II Society&quot; HITS THE STREETS 2006

Album features Scarface and Norega

New York, NY--After 5 years away from the game, Capone is back with a vengeance. Five years after the Capone-n-Noriega Reunion album (2000), Capone is set to release his second solo record on Pain, Time, and Glory Enterprises. &quot;Menace II Society&quot; will be released in 2006, and features Scarface and , Norega,The album also features some hot producers, including the Heatmakerz, Twinz, Screwface, Nexxus Entertainment, Reefa, Dub Z and DJ Absolut.

I am definitely excited about this album; it's time for the game to see what I've been doing. I want to dedicate this album to the hood because the hood kept me afloat all these years. Every song on this album is real whether party or pain, it's time for the PTG experience,&quot; says Capone.

Capone was one-half of the Queens based powerhouse Capone-N-Noreaga, a duo which sold over 1 million albums in their short-lived career. The pair met at the Collins Correctional Facility in New York, quickly hitting it off. Capone was from the Queensbridge Projects and Noreaga was from Lefrak City. Shortly before finishing the recording of their debut album, War Report (1997), Capone was sent to prison for breaking parole on a weapons charge, but War Report became an underground hit and went gold. Noreaga released two solo albums while Capone was incarcerated, and upon his release, the duo released The Reunion, which also went gold.

Fans who loved the duo CNN will not be disappointed with &quot;Menace II Society&quot;. Older and much wiser, Capone has taken his past experiences and created an impressive album with club bangers and street anthems.

The track listing is:
01-Intro
02-Words From A Menace
03-Aura
04-Interogation (skit)
05-Fire
06-Troublesome ft. NORE
07-Nowhere To Run-ft Scarface
08-Beat Down (skit)

10-Mac On Chill.
11-Drive By (skit)
