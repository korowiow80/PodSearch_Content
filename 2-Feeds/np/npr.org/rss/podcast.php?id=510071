      <title>Amanda Bennett:  "The Cost of Hope"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Terence Bryan Foley was an American expert on agriculture and Asia who earned his Ph.D. when he was in his 60s. He played more than 15 musical instruments and spoke six languages. He was funny, eccentric and beloved by his wife, award-winning journalist and editor Amanda Bennett. In a memoir, Bennett writes of their marriage, their travels and their battle for more life together after Foley was diagnosed with cancer. She takes us on a journey through the complex and often maddening American medical system. And she questions whether the emotional, physical and monetary price was worth it.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Wisconsin Recall Results</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Governor Scott Walker survived an attempt to oust him from office. Wisconsin voters also gave him a place in history: It was the first time a U.S. governor has won a recall election. The recall campaign came about after the Republican governor stripped away collective bargaining rights for public workers. Walker's win was a blow for Democrats and unions. Republicans say their victory shows voters want leaders who will make tough fiscal decisions. Whether the Wisconsin results are a bellwether for the 2012 presidential race remains to be seen.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Environmental Outlook: "The Ocean of Life" by Callum Roberts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The world's oceans cover 140 million square miles and have remained stable for most of human history. But in the last 30 years, man's impact on the seas has taken a heavy toll:  global fish supplies are declining thanks to new technologies and overfishing. Climate change has led to a rise in ocean temperatures and the loss of 75 percent of large sea animals.  Plastics and agricultural fertilizers are polluting our oceans and killing marine life. On this month's Environmental Outlook: How humans are harming the world's oceans and what can be done about it.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Psychiatry often focuses on the abnormal. Patients are diagnosed based on a cluster of symptoms, many of which could be defined as mental illness in millions of healthy people. A Harvard University psychiatrist says this approach is misguided. He argues there are no bright lines between normal and abnormal, and that psychiatric disorders are variations of normal brain functions that help us cope with everyday challenges. It could also build a new foundation for defining disorders from autism to depression. Diane and her guest talk about the "biology of normal."</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Recent revelations about the Stuxnet and Flame computer attacks show the urgency of threats in the digital universe.  Two years ago, the Stuxnet worm, which was designed to attack uranium processing centrifuges, was discovered at an Iranian nuclear plant. Last week, The New York Times reported President Barack Obama approved the operation as part of a secret U.S. and Israeli campaign against Iran begun under the Bush administration. And days ago, we learned of Flame, a cyberespionage mission secretly collecting data in Iran for years.

      <title>Sally Bedell Smith:  "Elizabeth the Queen:  The Life a Modern Monarch" (Rebroadcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Britain's Queen Elizabeth will observe her diamond jubilee next month.  It's been sixty years since her father, George the Sixth, died.  Elizabeth Alexandra Mary became head of the Commonwealth at age twenty five.  During her reign - the longest since Queen Victoria's - she's ushered the British monarchy into the modern age.   The young princess who never expected to become queen has evolved from working mother to wise grandmother during her reign.  Despite heading a sometimes flawed family, Elizabeth's popularity has survived — even thrived — in recent years.  Diane and her guest discuss the life of Britain's Elizabeth II and the modern monarchy.</p>]]></description>
