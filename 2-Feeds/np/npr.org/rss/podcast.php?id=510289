      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">As the world considers the possible death of the euro, it's worth considering a famous historical example. Ok, it's not that famous. But it's still worth looking at: The break-up of the Austro-Hungarian currency union in 1918.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Just as the countries of Europe today share the euro, the Austrian empire and the Kingdom of Hungary had created a shared currency: the Austro-Hungarian crown.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">After World War I, the region broke up. All of a sudden there were lots of countries wanting to switch to their own currencies.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">At the beginning, they used a simple system: Countries simply stamped existing Austro-Hungarian currency with particular markings to turn it into new, domestic currency. Some countries used ornate samps; Romania's stamp was just a cross.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">This quickly led to chaos. Everyone wanted to get their money stamped in the country they thought would have the strongest currency. Countries sealed their borders, but it was no use.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">"You had boxcar loads of currency" moving across borders, says Michael Spencer, an economist who has written about this period.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">It turns out, killing a currency is hard to do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><em>*&#160;Note: Today's podcast is a rerun.

They were savvy political operators, who knew how to push their competitors out of the market. They set up a system of fines, wage ceilings, and public rebukes that would be the envy of a modern cartel.</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-size: small;"> It's a tale of economic monopoly and discrimination.

      <description><![CDATA[<p></p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Willow Tufano is a 14-year-old girl who recently bought a house in Florida for $12,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Willow and her mom split the cost of the house, which they're now renting out. Willow saved up money by selling stuff from foreclosed homes on Craigslist; she plans to buy out her mom's share in the next few years.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">We did a&#160;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/09/148218539/this-14-year-old-girl-just-bought-a-house-in-florida" _mce_href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/09/148218539/this-14-year-old-girl-just-bought-a-house-in-florida" target="_blank">radio story</a>&#160;about Willow earlier this month.

And we hear more from the neighborhood where Willow lives. It's a place where people who bought at the top of the bubble &#8212; including Willow's family &#8212; live next to people who bought identical homes at a fraction of the price.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">And we discuss whether a 14-year-old girl buying a house is a sign that that housing market has finally bottomed.</p><p></p>]]></description>

      <title>#338: Do Sanctions Work?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It seems like there's always some country or another that the United States is imposing sanctions on. The reasons change, but the idea is always the same: economic coercion.</p><p>This month, it's Iran. In response to Iran's alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons, President Obama signed a law that punishes banks for doing business with Iran's central bank. This makes it difficult, in theory, for Iran to sell its oil around the world.</p><p>You can see why sanctions are so appealing for the U.S. government: Rather than go to war to stop Iran's nuclear program &#8212; to risk American lives &#8212; the U.S. can block money from going in and out of the country. That makes life miserable for the Iranians and, in theory, persuades them to give up their nuclear ambitions.</p><p>But do sanctions work? Have sanctions ever really worked? Today, we talk to Gary Hufbauer, author of the book Economic Sanctions Reconsidered. And we hear a first-hand account of what life in Iraq was like under the sanctions of the 1990s.</p>]]></description>

Before American came Pan Am, Delta, United, Northwest, US Airways, and Continental.<br /><br />Sure, fuel costs are high and planes are expensive &#8212; but why is it that the industry continues to lose money year after year?

Bob Crandall, the former CEO of American, famous for calling it a "nasty, rotten business," says he used to tell his employees not to buy the company's stock. Why?

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We went downtown this week to talk to the protesters at Occupy Wall Street.<br /><br />We asked people why they were there. We heard lots of different answers.<br /><br />We went to the big nightly meeting, which lasts for hours. Everybody has something to say. Along the lines of:<br /><br />Should we buy some sleeping bags? Why does that guy get to run the meeting? What if we just buy fabric and make our own sleeping bags?<br /><br />This kind of back and forth, people told us, is the whole point of Occupy Wall Street. It's not a movement; it's a venue. Standing around, talking about what everybody wants &#8212; this is a model of how the protesters want society to be.<br /><br />This being Planet Money, we immediately wondered: Can an entire economy run on group participation? How could that work? It turns out, there's an economist named Robin Hahnel who's been working on this problem for 40 years. And he has a proposal that he thinks would be perfect.<br /><br />He calls it participatory economics.</p>]]></description>

And he has a proposal that he thinks would be perfect.<br /><br />He calls it participatory economics.</p>]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>#233: To Solve Debt Problem, Europe Borrows More Money</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Europe is borrowing money to bail out countries that got in trouble by borrowing too much money.<br /><br />On today's Planet Money, Satyajit Das explains that European countries aren't actually putting their own money into that big euro-zone bailout fund. Instead, the fund will borrow from investors around the world &#8212; the same investors who are growing wary of lending to a bunch of countries in Europe.<br /><br />What's more, the fund will be guaranteed by the countries that use the euro. So the more the fund is used, the more countries that are already struggling &#8212; countries like Spain and Italy &#8212; will be on the hook for potential losses.</p><p>Note: This podcast originally aired December of '10.</p>]]></description>

Instead, the fund will borrow from investors around the world &#8212; the same investors who are growing wary of lending to a bunch of countries in Europe.<br /><br />What's more, the fund will be guaranteed by the countries that use the euro. So the more the fund is used, the more countries that are already struggling &#8212; countries like Spain and Italy &#8212; will be on the hook for potential losses.</p><p>Note: This podcast originally aired December of '10.</p>]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>#298: Why The World Still Needs Dollars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Every day, all around the world, people do business in U.S. dollars &#8212; even when their business has nothing to do with the U.S.</p>
<p>The dollar is the international language of money. It's essential for global trade.</p>
<p>This provides huge benefits for the United States. U.S. businesses can trade in their own currency. Our government can borrow money more cheaply. Mortgages and student loans are cheaper, too.</p>
<p>For the moment, the dollar's dominance seems secure. Safe-haven currencies like the Swiss franc are too small to replace the dollar. And bigger currencies like the euro and the Chinese renminbi have problems of their own.</p>
<p>On today's show, we hear about how people use the U.S. dollar Brazil and South Africa. And we talk to an economist who says the dollar's days as the world's lone reserve currency may be numbered.</p>]]></description>

      <title>#293: Would A Downgrade Matter?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Let's assume that the U.S. government raises the debt ceiling, and the country keeps paying its bills next month.</p>
<p>It's still very possible that one or more rating agencies will downgrade the country's credit rating.</p>
<p>On today's show we ask: Would a downgrade matter?</p>
<p>We revisit a question we asked last year: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/05/_after_the_downgrade_ap.html" _mce_href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/05/_after_the_downgrade_ap.html" target="_blank">How do you rate a country?</a></p>
<p>And we talk to one expert who says a downgrade of America's credit rating would make for splashy headlines, but would likely have a relatively small impact. Most of America's debt is held by big institutional investors &#8212; and those investors do their own research, and don't tend to be swayed much by what rating agencies say.</p>]]></description>

      <title>#291: How Much Debt Is Too Much?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Say you're a country with a decent-size national debt. Everything's going fine: Investors are willing to lend you money at a low interest rate, andyou can pay your bills without too much trouble.</p>
<p>But then investors get nervous and start demanding higher interest rates. All of a sudden, you have to devote more and more of your money just to pay off your debt.<br /><br />Your economy starts to falter, and investors demand still higher interest rates. Now you're really in trouble.<br /><br />What causes this to happen? Is there some magic threshold that countries cross before they get into trouble?<br /><br />On today's Planet Money, we put that question to Ken Rogoff &#8212; a Harvard economist and an expert on the history of sovereign debt crises. We talk to Rogoff about three countries in particular: Greece, Italy and the U.S.<br /><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>North Korea relies on charity to feed its starving people. But the country's elites like their luxuries &#8212; imported wine, fine china, dancing shoes.</p>
<p>To buy those things, they need foreign currency. (North Korean currency is worthless outside of North Korea.) To get foreign currency, they need to sell things to the outside world. But North Korea's industrial base is a disaster, and the country doesn't grow enough food to feed itself.</p>
<p>On today's Planet Money, we look at the ways North Korea's leaders have managed to keep foreign currency flowing into the country. Their strategies include manufacturing drugs, counterfeiting U.S. dollars, and selling gigantic statues to foreign leaders.</p>]]></description>

      <title>#288: Manufacturing The Song Of The Summer *</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On today's show, we tell the story of a secret battle that's been going on for more than a year: Creating the song of the summer, the music industry's holy grail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our case study is Rihanna's "Man Down." The story starts in the spring of 2010, when Rihanna's label flies in songwriters and producers from around the company for a "writing camp" &#8212; a pop-up version of the old hit factories that churned out pop tunes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Writing camp is expensive. But the real money doesn't start flowing until after the song is done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*Correction: An earlier version of this podcast used the incorrect version of Jennifer Lopez's, "I'm Real."</p>]]></description>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">On today's Planet Money, economist Mark <a href="http://www.economy.com/dismal/bios.asp?author=25">Zandi</a> says households have been steadily reducing their debt over the past few years. Companies slashed 8.5 million jobs in the recession and their productivity has soared. </span></p>

      <title>#283: Why Do We Tip?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the 16th century, coffee shops prominently displayed coin boxes with the phrase "to ensure prompt service" written on the side. If you wanted your coffee in a hurry, you dropped a little something extra in the box, and made sure the waitress saw you do it.</p>
<p>This, according to at least one version of history, is where tipping began.</p>
<p>But today, we tip after we get served, not before. And, according to one expert we talk to on today's podcast, the quality of service we perceive makes a tiny difference in how much we tip. (The weather has a comparable influence on tip size.)</p>
<p>According to one theory, when you get down to it, we don't even tip for good service. We tip because we feel guilty.</p>]]></description>
