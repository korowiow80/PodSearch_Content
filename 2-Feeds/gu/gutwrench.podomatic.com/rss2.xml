Art Director, Illustrator, Designer, Historian, Theologian, Writer

Having spent the bulk of the last twenty-five years in advertising as a creative director, designer and illustrator, Scotty's background is laced with varied and diverse skills and experience in the publishing, audio and visual fields. He possesses an astute flare for the visually dramatic, and carries that over from print to film.

After two years in a Christian bible college, he entered seminary pursuing his Masters in Divinity (Mdiv) and worked as a youth director. During his college and seminary studies, he focused on his academic and personal passion for history, theater and art. His religious studies intensified his interest in spirituality, and his research of the Paranormal expanded throughout the following years.

Shortly after his seminary years, Scotty began a small comic book publishing effort, writing and illustrationg stories, which were also pitched as animated television series. He developed and published the highly successful Ancient Heroes trading card series, and began development on a series of young readers chapter books. He authored and illustrated his first historical teen readers novel, The Rollicking Adventures of Tam O'Hare, which garnered success in the teen and college markets.

Scotty's current projects include, Tam O'Hare and the Banshee of BallyGlenMorrow - the second in his series of Tam O'Hare historical novels; and a more scholarly effort,The Rise and Fall of the Nephilim, published by New Page Books and set for release January 2012. The book explores biblical, apochryphal and ancient Mesopotamian accounts of extraterrestrial and spirit visitation, and comparative Flood mythologies.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Scotty Roberts
Art Director, Illustrator, Designer, Historian, Theologian, Writer

Having spent the bulk of the last twenty-five years in advertising as a creative director, designer and illustrator, Scotty's background is laced with varied and diverse skills and experience in the publishing, audio and visual fields. He possesses an astute flare for the visually dramatic, and carries that over from print to film.

After two years in a Christian bible college, he entered seminary pursuing his Masters in Divinity (Mdiv) and worked as a youth director. During his college and seminary studies, he focused on his academic and personal passion for history, theater and art. His religious studies intensified his interest in spirituality, and his research of the Paranormal expanded throughout the following years.

Shortly after his seminary years, Scotty began a small comic book publishing effort, writing and illustrationg stories, which were also pitched as animated television series. He developed and published the highly successful Ancient Heroes trading card series, and began development on a series of young readers chapter books. He authored and illustrated his first historical teen readers novel, The Rollicking Adventures of Tam O'Hare, which garnered success in the teen and college markets.

Scotty's current projects include, Tam O'Hare and the Banshee of BallyGlenMorrow - the second in his series of Tam O'Hare historical novels; and a more scholarly effort,The Rise and Fall of the Nephilim, published by New Page Books and set for release January 2012. The book explores biblical, apochryphal and ancient Mesopotamian accounts of extraterrestrial and spirit visitation, and comparative Flood mythologies.</itunes:summary>

      <title>David Kowalsky - Founder/Director of Cannabis Information Network</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1340436/600x600_5958306.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join me this week as I talk with with David Kowalsky who is instrumental in a campain to help break down some of the myths and reasons why Marijauna gets such a bad wrap.  Over 83 million Americans over the age of 12 have tried marijuana at least once. Over 12 million had used the drug in the month before the survey.  

The Cannabis Information Network (CIN) was founded in May 2011. The conceptual idea for this organization was simply to campaign the repeal of federal marijuana prohibition on a social media platform, I have come to learn that this method has been mostly ineffective in communicating the message that, it is &#8220;The People&#8221; that want marijuana legalization.

The Cannabis Information Network is becoming the most dynamic, volunteer-powered and supported pro marijuana legalization organization that is powered by &#8220;The People&#8221;.

So, we will share with you some of the details of her personal story so you may begin to understand the depths of this, &quot; Indiana Jones!&quot;. Her books are available in our store and are filled with all the incredible details!  Susan Isabelle was born in Massachusetts, USA in 1949. Her mother was from Canada and of the French and Iroquois Indian lineage. She inherited her fair complexion from her English father.  She was raised by both parents in the 1960's during times of civil unrest while living in the deep south. She moved there with them when she was four years old. She grew up on the pristine beaches of the Gulf Coast spending time with a pet dolphin.  The life-changing moment of impact occurred at age 12 when she made a trip to the north east, traveling up through the southern states. She saw the tragic situation of the black people from the back seat of the car; the visions of extremely poor, naked children playing outside their shacks on large plantation-style lands of the rich growing tobacco, still haunts her memories.   Later, the visits with her father to bring food and help the black families that lived in the swampy back bay areas of Florida taught her the need for human compassion and the need to make changes in the world.  At that time she vowed to help the people one day.She became an advocate of human rights at a very young age and fought hard for civil rights, even while in high school....

      <title>Thomas P Fusco-Author/Behind The Cosmic Veil</title>

 Throughout modern history, humanity has made remarkable strides toward unraveling the secrets of the universe. Yet in spite of these impressive scientific achievements, certain fundamental mysteries continue to evade both our powers of reason and our modern physics. Among these are:  

- Is there a Divine Order within the cosmos?
- What are the causes behind the bizarre events known as the 
  paranormal?
- Are anti-gravity, time travel and teleportation possible, or are 
  they just food for fantasy?
- How was matter created &#8220;from the void?&#8221; 
- Is there a gateway to a higher dimension, and what does it 
  look like?
- Is dark matter real, and why can&#8217;t we see it?
- How did life originate on earth?
- Could UFOs really be advanced spacecraft?
- And how does religion and spirituality fit into all this?  

Questions like these have long confounded scientists, philosophers, and ecclesiastics alike. Efforts to solve these riddles have often suffered from too narrow a focus, such as those that attempt to describe telepathy or consciousness in terms of quantum theory while overlooking the vast body of other unexplained phenomena. None have led us to a single cosmological framework that can accommodate the wealth of scientific anomalies, spiritual experiences and paranormal events that are observed and recorded.     </description>

      <title>Jonathan Schang and Robert Clearfield of &quot;District 97&quot;</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1340436/600x600_5568808.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOIN ME AS I TALK WITH TWO MEMBERS OF &#8220;DISTRICT 97&#8243; THE DRUMMER JONATHAN SCHANG AND THE KEYBOARD PLAYER ROB CLEARFIELD. I HOPE TO FIND OUT WHAT DRIVES THIS YOUNG AMBITIOUS PROGRESSIVE BAND AND HOW THEY HAVE GROWN TOGETHER AS MUSICIANS. 


Jonathan Schang is proud to be the drummer and primary composer for District 97.  In addition to his activities within the band, Jonathan is one of Chicago&#8217;s busiest and most in-demand Modern Dance Accompanists.  He has been commissioned to write works for Deeply Rooted Dance Theater and Thodos Dance Chicago, with future collaborations in the works involving the most gifted members of Chicago&#8217;s thriving dance community.  Having won numerous awards for both his compositional and drumset prowess, Jonathan has performed with Chicago&#8217;s most legendary musicians, including a national TV appearance with former Miles Davis Musical Director (1979-1988), Robert &#8220;Baabe&#8221; Irving III. In October 2010, Jonathan was signed as a Paiste Cymbals Artist. Fellow Paiste Artist Bill Bruford (Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, Earthworks etc.) calls District 97 &#8220;sensational&#8221; and says &#8220;Jonathan writes and plays like a demon.&#8221; The pair had a chance to meet and jam together in Memphis, TN in December 2010.

From an early age, keyboardist Rob Clearfield has always shown a fascination in all types of music.  From his humble beginnings playing grunge rock in his friends&#8217; basements and accompanying choirs at his mother&#8217;s church, Clearfield has become a fixture on the Chicago music scene.  Although perhaps a rocker at heart, Clearfield has made a name for himself as one of Chicago&#8217;s best  improvisers, performing with such renowned artists as Fareed Haque, Rakalam Bob Moses, Grazyna Auguscik, Juma Santos, Steve Gorn, Zach Brock, John Wojciechowski and Greg Ward, among others.  In addition to District 97, Rob Clearfield is also a member of Matt Ulery&#8217;s Loom and Greg Ward&#8217;s Fitted Shards, as well as his own band Information Superhighway.  As a composer, Clearfield&#8217;s work with the Superhighway is only the beginning.  In 2008, he was commissioned to score a production of MacBeth by Purdue University, and he is also currently the music director and composer-in-residence at the emergent church Wicker Park Grace in Chicago.</description>

I have talked about religions on a one on one basis in the past. This show I will be talking on a one on 12 basis! Sounds exciting I know! You must join in in the conversation!

For Andrew Bowen, theology is a playground. A champion for inter-religious peace and reconciliation, Andrew created Project Conversion in 2011, a year-long personal immersion into the culture, practices, beliefs, and rituals of 12 belief systems from around the world.


Coverage of his efforts has appeared in The Huffington Post, The American Baha&#8217;i, the Charlotte Observer, and more. His fiction and essays splash in the often murky waters of religion and spirituality, and have appeared in over a dozen venues like decomP, Prick of the Spindle, Pulp Metal Magazine, and Charlotte Viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Philip Coppens- Ancient Aliens </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1340436/600x600_5439131.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philip Coppens&#8217; publishing career began at the age of 23, when he edited the legacy of the late Belgian historian Marcel Mestdagh&#8217;s research into European megaliths into a much-anticipated sequel. That same year, he also helped edit a controversial non-fiction thriller on the theft of Jan Van Eyck&#8217;s The Adoration of the Lamb, which was made into a documentary both for Flemish television and the BBC.

If there is one thing that sets Coppens apart from other writers, it is that he is often ahead of the trends. He wrote the first guide in more than four decades about Rosslyn Chapel &#8211; the only one to do so before The Da Vinci Code made that Scottish chapel world famous in 2003. He also researched the origins of the Mitchell-Hedges Crystal Skull, before the 2008 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie, resulting in a series of controversial articles, which even came to the attention of The Washington Post.

      <title>Helen Michaels and Lorraine Roe-&quot;Audacious Action Angels&quot; Oracle deck November 28th-7 PM EST</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1340436/600x600_5400257.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join me next week as I talk with the creators of a deck of cards I thought were Tarot cards! I have talked with Tarot users and creators in the past but this time it is an ORACLE DECK! Very different.And very exciting to learn something new. Let us take this jouney together and see just what this is all about.

Helen Michaels is a co-creator with Lorraine Roe of the Audacious Action Angels (AAA) Oracle Deck. Helen is an artist, Reiki practitioner, and a very experienced art therapist. She and Lorraine have been on a high octane spiritual journey for a few decades now and learning to live with their emerging psychic abilities. Much to their surprise, messages and information from the angelic and fairy realms are filled with wit and humor that end up piercing the ego's perspective - which isn't exactly the 'feel good' part! After Lorraine asked Helen to do up a few ideas for an oracle deck, Helen was downloaded with images, titles and basic structure for the deck in about 3 hours. Then she created a painting a day for more than a month to birth the deck into visual form. Although Helen is a life-long artist, she had not received creative inspiration &quot;straight from God&quot; in this way before, but laying a spiritual foundation was the first step. Helen is excited to collaborate with Lorraine and share their real life, on-going experience of embodying spirit.</description>

      <title>Raeanne Bartlett and Alix Chavasse- &quot;Pamela Courson Morrison&quot;-Nov. 21-7 PM EST</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1340436/600x600_5362692.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join me on Monday as I talk with Raeanne Bartlett and Alix Chavasse who are currently researching and writing a book that explores the tumultuous lives and relationship of The Doors' singer Jim Morrison and his common law muse Pamela Courson. They run a tribute website to honor the late Ms. Courson, who was a huge inspiration for a major influence on not only the Jim Morrison of The Doors, but also for many in the fashion world then and now.
 A tribute to the beautiful Pamela Courson Morrison, may she rest in peace. &#9829;

I think that Pamela has been greatly misunderstood, misjudged, and undercredited for her contributions in inspiring some of the world's best known rock songs, styling Jim, and being a fashion icon of the 60's. Pamela remains a beautiful mystery, someone who continues to fascinate people and spark interest in a culturally pivotal time in American history.
