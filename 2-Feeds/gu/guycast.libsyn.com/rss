It's got many of the characters you know and have come to love, and a new one who fucking hate's his new nickname. Fair warning, it was recorded via voice memo into open air through the iPhone, so quality isn't as good as usual, but I was fairly impressed. Hope you enjoy.</p>]]></description>

<p>So a guy who used to get high and write music with Lauren Hill thinks that because he mentions Haiti on the radio a few times that he's qualified to run a small country in the midst of Disaster recovery. I heard next year Jude Law wants to be queen of england, and the lead singer for Ramstein is running for Fuhrer of Germany. That's what they have right? A Furher? Or is each leader just called Hitler something. Y'know, like Ceaser?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm gonna be honest here. Normally after we finish a show, I take the notes from my master sheet and move the topics we talked about to another document specifically to the episode. Long story shot. I got drunk and kinda didn't do that. What I'm left with is a shee that says two names. Mel Gibson and Lindsay Lohan. odds are good we talked about these people, but I don't really remember. Here's to hoping it's not 30 minutes of silence.</p>

<p>We're such assholes. Somehow we allowed talk about the new Twilight movie to hijack, like, 15 minutes of our show about Guy stuff. We should just put guns in our mouths and end it. We are SO BAD at this sometimes. Anyway. The iPhone 4 came out. and we saw splice. But in the face of the first part of the show, who really cares? &nbsp;Thanks for listening, we understand if you don't come back.</p>

We're such assholes. Somehow we allowed talk about the new Twilight movie to hijack, like, 15 minutes of our show about Guy stuff. We should just put guns in our mouths and end it. We are SO BAD at this sometimes. Anyway. The iPhone 4 came out. and we saw splice. But in the face of the first part of the show, who really cares? &nbsp;Thanks for listening, we understand if you don't come back.

<p>A new game is discovered. The "Guy Code" is examined. And we finally saw Iron Man 2. AKA The greatest sequel ever made. well, that's cleary not true. I guess that's probably Terminator 2, followed by Empire Strikes Back, and then Spiderman 2. And Rocky 4. Then maybe Iron Man 2. But Probably not. Hmm...maybe we should discuss this on the show instead of me writting about it stream-of-consciousness style in the description. Oh well, next time maybe. Enjoy!</p>

<p>If there was a no penalty, and the guy was a prisoner or a hobo or something, would you hunt a human? Like, in the wild. He's armed with a handgun with one clip and is on foot. You get a jeep, an AR-15 and 50 rounds. Would you do it? I don't think we actually discuss this scenario in the episode. I just thought of it and thought it was interesting.

            <description><![CDATA[Marc extends his stay with us as we dip into the GC Male bag. We've recieved a slew of first time e-mails from listeners around the world complaining about how we don't do enough shows. I suppose they also provide a few stories, but all we hear is criticism. We're fragile like that, though. Also, by this point we'd been drinking for almost a full half day, and this is one of the most horrifyingly graphic shows we've done in a while. But here we just call it Old School.

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome back from the holidays. We start of the new year with actual new content, unlike most other media outlets who spent the last two weeks running Best Of's, we skipped the middle man and provided no content at all. But now we're back and ready to provide details of Tristan's work history. Fascinating. How often do you finish an Episode of Guycast and ask yourself 'Was that really the best thing I could've done with my time?'. Me? I ask myself that all the time. Enjoy.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[These stories come across the news desk here at GC every once a while, but rarely do they end up with the intruder quite so...dead.  Also we discuss a highschool teams 83-0 manhandling of a rival school, and Kanye West's kind hearted and thoughtfull treatment of Taylor Swift.

            <description><![CDATA[Here it is, the longest episode in GuyCast history. What started as an innocent attempt at answering a few e-mails, ends up as almost a two hour trip down the road of more topics than I can write about here. We hope to one of these again soon, but until then. Enjoy this.

There is lively debate on the merits of Quinten "Cut Trailers to look like the movie is about something that it's not really about" Tarentino's new movie "Spelled Incorrectly because that makes me seem edgy", also known by it's french title "Not really about killing Nazi's at all, mostly about tense conversations over tables."  And by lively debate, I mean Tristan thinking the movie was shitty, and Adam being suprised by how upset Tristan is by the whole thing.  Also Ted Kennedy is dead.  Big day.

            <description><![CDATA[Well it was bound to happen sooner or later. The Laptop that we run all of the show content off of finally took a dump.  As a result, I'm not sure what we actually talked about on this one.  But you can probably figure it out right.  Blah blah blah (insert athlete here) is a douchbag. Instert dumb citizen doing incredibly dumb thing, what an asshole!  Insert horrifying sexually themed joke, half-appology, followed up by another joke. This time probably with less appology and more laughter.

            <description><![CDATA[Every year Maxim trots out their hot 100 list, and every year it's littered with a few repeat offenders, lots of women who have happened to be on their covers and do interviews, and then there's always a few that you look at and say "Wha?". It's my opinion that #1 is one of those. How can you look at your readers with a straight face and say "This moderately ok looking woman is clearly the hottest woman on The Fucking Planet. Period."  Fuck you. You didn't even choose a good picture of her. Dipshits.

            <description><![CDATA[This episode is a little dated (a few weeks) because it disapeared into the deapths of Adam's Laptop for a couple of weeks. But it's a good one.  We have everything a guy needs here: Cage Fighting (in a a real cage), Booby Traps (with real boobies) and Amputee Fucking (with real...Stumps?). Enjoy!

There's a five on the kitchen counter for your cabride. Don't call us... Yeah, that's it. Just don't call.

            <description><![CDATA[This is pretty self explanitory. If you don't know what this one's about, then you probably can't read. And are hence, probably not reading this. So why would I even write this for a guy who can't read?  I don't have time to be sitting around writting long winded descriptions for episodes that will never be appreciated, either because of a crippling learning disorder or by your complete lack of respect for the educational system.  Fuck you, you unappreciative jerkoff.

We start with a little bit of chat about Christmas, Global Warming, and a man who gets his butthole sewn shut.  I suppose that list should seem a little odd, but giving the context of this show, I guess it's not really.  We finish up with a man who commited suicide with a chainsaw.  Fuck. Yes.

Now, the bad news is, that same study says that while you don't need to spend more tim eating box, you do need to actually have sex for, on average, a full 15-20 minutes.

We touch on the shotgun rules, thanks to Shotgunguide.com and our boy Forrest. And last but not least we get a rundown on the Nerf Sniper Riffle. Oh and how can i forget, listen near the end for Susan's birth conrtol and the sexomnia studies. Enjoy!]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Ok, so this is the first of a two part episode that happened over the party this weekend. The first part of this episode is a little of the usual and some introduction to the party, then we start the interviews. We tried to interview everyone that we have talked about over the last 60 shows, and we got to most of them and even a few we didnt plan on. This part you'll get Tony Buttons, Ryan Floyd, Drunken Jon, and Susan. What a good time! So enjoy and stay tuned for Thursday's show where we hit a few more that are downright funny as hell!]]></itunes:subtitle>

Well basically Adam and I over-use the “fag? reference towards our fearless leader Tristan, and…well, he… pretty much just plain snaps! He goes off on this rant about being a “kid-toucher?. I laughed my ass off and so did Tristan. Enjoy!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Put together one man and one woman what do you get? A recipe for destruction in my opinion. And in this week's episode that’s what we go over. All the shit-nasty break-ups we got in from you tool-boxes! We got some sick stories and we even grabbed a couple from the web. Why you ask? Well here’s the deal...other people’s misery is down-right funny as hell. There are some stories in here I don't think I ever wanted to know about but what the hell! In other news Adam is joining us on a regular basis, and we think he will work just in GuyCast fashion. Adam brings a totally different dynamic to the show....actually he just comes and hangs out. But he's pretty damn funny and plus he's sick with sports knowledge! So listen up hookers!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[So this time one of us got older. Itâ??s sad to say but itâ??s true. And worst of all, it was me. Thatâ??s right it was my 24th birthday last week and weâ??ve got some stories for you! So basically we talk about the drinking that ensued on Friday night, everyone had a good time and got plastered. There was the funny thing that happened at the end of the night. So after we all got hammered and both Tristan and I broke our faces on the trampoline, it turns out that Tony Buttons and Tristan got a little close that night! Well, not exactly but it does make for a funny-ass story! So listen up, and please donâ??t drive while hearing this you may cry from laughter as Tristan does during the show! Enjoy!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[What up bitches?!?! So today we go over March Madness. So Adam is here and there is no better at college basketball, at least that we know. So first we talk about how to set up you own bracket, whether it be at work or school or whatever. We also talk about our first impressions now that the brackets are out. All the large conferences vs. all the mid-majors, teams like Duke, Memphis, U-Conn and Villanova. We also talk about how the teams are matched up, and also how OUR picks look. Weâ??ve got a couple of upsets and we even took Robinâ??s picks, and Tristanâ??s little sisterâ??s picks. So we will see how it pans out over the next few weeks. Anyways, if your into College Hoops, this is the show for you! Listen up and enjoy! Next week will be back with the shenanigans from my birthday celebration!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Se habla Espanola? I don't read a lot of Spanish nor do I speak it but I think this was the opener for our show. So we got a couple of shout outs, some from Dave, some from Mike, and some from our boy Zansurf. We actually got around to doing a guy of the week this week. So quit yer bitchin! No, really we are lazy assholes and totally forgot. Snowboarding, what a catastrophe. Iâ??ve never seen anyone fall so much in my life. Tristan is officially the worst snowboarder ever. But it was his first day so Iâ??ll give him a little credit. The big topic for the day was god-awful Academy Awards or Oscars. Too many nominations for Fagback Mountain and more money to George Clooney. Not to mention the 3-6 Mafia song. Anyway enjoy and next week is the Final Four, Baby!]]></description>

"Anything worth doing,is worth doing late" as we always say. Tristan finally 
got back from California in time to post this quick show. It's 
un-freakin'-believable how much stuff builds up to talk about when we're 
half a week late. We've got new voice-mails, e-mails, and a brand new 
Guycast Store!  Guycast t-shirts, hoodies, and thongs! Get 'em while they're 
hot! Finally, Tristan Fills us in on some of the nitty-gritty details on his 
trip out west, and boy was it a trip.

Here's a little break-down:
-Super Bowl prediction apology
-D.U.I Story apology
-Guycast store
-Tales from Cali
-Air Travel
-Family Gatherings]]></description>

We also go over a bunch of things that you should and should not do to your car. We give you the tips and tricks that we learned only after 10 years of screwing up, paying to much and doing it twice! Finally, at the very end we handle the bidness! News about t-shirts, the forum, UC Radio and how we botched his promo stuff, and finally a quick Ultimate Guy of the Week! Enjoy!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Alright! Well this is episode 11 and what can we say other than get your jerseys out and crack a beer. Basically in this episode we have Adam on the show and give us insight on the greatest sports moments ever (or at least that we can remember). The basic topic is the top 5 greatest sports moments that youâ??ve been to/watched. We hit a variety of topics but for the most part this show is all about sports. And never not once does Adam disappoint with his sick sports knowledge. We go over last weekâ??s poll winner, and as always the guy of the week. Except this week its for the guy of the year, so vote up bitches!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Well, What Can I Say? Apperently not much when we are all drunk as hell. This show is off the f*ing wall. Im not really sure what the hell happend. We started out good and you can here us get worse and worse. Nontheless, WE DELIVERED! Actually this show is pretty damn funny becuse we had such a hard time staying on topic. Now to let you guys know upfront, the damn recording program was in some sort of frames per milisec or some crap. So when we are calling out "We've been on here for 600 second?" and stuff like that...its not actully seconds. So in Adam and mine and Tristan's defense we thought it WAS in seconds. The best part is we listened to the show the next morning and really figured out how long it was. It rakes in at something around 50 mins. So sorry if its too long, but oh well its WELL worth it! Enjoy and as always hit us up on here or on the email and let us know how it went!
P.S. - Tristan apoligizes for the screaming.]]></description>

In all honesty we really sort of pussy-footed around on the topic for this week so we just sort of went with "lets talk about whatever the hell we want". Hopefully you guys will like this show. Other topics include Christmas, bad driving, "beautiful lips", and what the hell IS Elmo anyways? So listen up, and as always tell us what you think via the comments or email.]]></description>

Chew, why i(jeff) don't comment when it comes time for sports, and of course the topic of the week. Movies! Thats right guys movies, and not just any movies - GUY MOVIES! We touch on a few classics, a few newbies, and just some damn good guy movies. This weeks show was done on short notice (again) so we had to record in "the shed" which is built for doing audio recording however is not built like a real studio, so after getting the laptop to work and the mics to sit decently we got underway. You'll notice Tristan yelling at me becuase i was affraid the latop was going to hibernate in the middle of recording. Either way, Enjoy The Show....and keep those emails and comments comming. And of course another big thanks to all you listners out there that keep our lazy asses motivated!]]></description>

Ok, well on with the show...so this episode is all about fat-ass Americans, and VIDEO GAMES! Thatâ??s right the wait is over boys...and...Uh girls (if there are any that listen us). We actually recorded this show on Monday night because Tristan is away with family for the holidays stuffing his face. Last week we got a comment from Ben all the way out in Cali (which is amazing that this show has gone cross-country) stating that he would like to see a poll to vote for the guy of the week. Well Ben, you got it. I busted my ass and found a poll that would work. Now, we recorded this episode before I put the poll, so in the episode you wonâ??t here us ask who you voted for. But I promise on next weekâ??s show we will let you know who the winner is. Well I think thatâ??s about it, enjoy and keep the comments/emails coming, we are always trying to improve the show.]]></description>
