<p><a href='http://rachelheldevans.com/huck-finn-hell'>Rachel Held Evans | &#8220;All right, then, I&#8217;ll go to hell”</a>.</p>
<p>Well, once again leave it to Rachel Held Evans to offer some moving insights into the ongoing cultural and theological within the church regarding homosexuality.  Denominnations, mainline and otherwise are continue to take the reality of homosexuality and turn it into a generational turf war, with the elder side engaging either in beatings with the Bible or rendering it irrelevant under social justice, and the younger side walking away, not seeing a loving community or a connection with Jesus.  Leave it to Mark Twain to offer better theological insights than what passes for it today.</p>
<p>Twain and George Takai, theologians for the 21st Century  Sad part continues to be, as Rachel also observed, the older side might celebrate victory for being &#8220;right&#8221; in the coming years, but the North American Church as we know it will die with them because most everyone born since 1964, and especially since 1990, will have left.</p>

<p>Letter From John Piper to a 12-Year-Old Girl About the Eternal Destiny of Those Who Have Not Heard the Gospel  Sorry, kid, they&#8217;re gonna burn.</p>
<p>Nothing like kindly, TV evangelist, John Piper, telling a 12 year old that everyone who has never heard of Jesus and made a decision of faith for Jesus is going to burn in hell.  Everyone before, everyone now, everyone to come, because God always punishes people who deserve it.  I guess only Moses and Elijah get saved out of the Old Testament.  Sucks to be everyone else.  Poor Adam and Eve.  </p>
<p>BTW, I hope you are a good little girl and love Jesus. Keep praying, and reading your Bible.  I hope its enough to keep you out of hell.  Yep, that&#8217;s pastoral care for kids. </p>
<p>Which reminds me, John Piper never uses the word &#8220;love&#8221; once in this entire letter.  God punishes, condemns, and occasionally saves if someone sends a missionary to tell the people God has left hanging.  Nor does he mention the cross.  I guess love and the cross aren&#8217;t the most important parts of the Gospel(s) after all.</p>
<p>And people got angry at Rob Bell over Love Wins.</p>

<p><a href='http://pastorjonathanmartin.com/uncategorized/thoughts-on-mitt-romney-liberty-university-and-the-civil-religion/'>Jonathan Martin: Pastor of Renovatus Church in Charlotte NC – On Mitt Romney, Liberty University and civil religion.</a>.</p>
<p>This rather insightful reflection on civil religion popped up on my Twitter feed.  I have to admit, I really don&#8217;t use twitter like it was intended &#8211; for communication and bumper sticker wisdom.  For me, its a better rss feed to articles, blogs, and podcasts with a 144 character descriptions of content.  Works for me.</p>
<p>Jonathan Martin hits the nail on the head with thoughts on how the Protestant mainline has ceased to be prophetic and has become polite, comfortable, or innocuously politically correct and how Evangelicalism has likewise lost its way, turning theology into a political categories of conservative or liberal.  </p>
<p>This quote gives you a flavor of the whole blog and I highly recommend it.  It points us in the direction that many of us have been saying &#8211; we need to rethink what it means to be church in light of what it has become.</p>
<p> We don’t care what anybody believes about the trinity, because we don’t believe what a person believes about the trinity makes a difference in real life.  More potently, we don’t believe the trinity can change the world.  Who cares whether or not a person partakes of the eucharist, because the body and blood of Jesus is of course trite in comparison to our political platforms–that is where the power is.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We don’t care about theology anymore because we are no longer concerned about being Christians in any particular sort of way.  Jesus is unable to save the world, thus the best hope we have now is to embrace across theological lines in service of the true god of conservative civil religion.  The stakes are too high to be concerned about doctrine when there are far more pressing matters at hand.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><a href='http://rachelheldevans.com/win-culture-war-lose-generation-amendment-one-north-carolina'>Rachel Held Evans | How to win a culture war and lose a generation</a>.</p>
<p>Once again my friend, Rachel Held Evans, nails it.  I remember reading about &#8220;The Lost Generation&#8221; of the 1920s and we have created our own lost generation in the church in the name of pure doctrine and social justice.  I think there are really two conflicted poles that have created the same result &#8211; a generation alienated from their Boomer parents and grandparents.  Yeah, I know I harp on the Boomers a lot.  Its an old song but when you look who is abandoning congregations, its those under 40, usually in response to the polarities &#8211; intolerance in the guise of doctrine or self-righteous correctness masquerading as justice/social Gospel. </p>
<p>As Rachel puts it so well:<br />
My generation is tired of the culture wars. </p>
<p>We are tired of fighting, tired of vain efforts to advance the Kingdom through politics and power, tired of drawing lines in the sand, tired of being known for what we are against, not what we are for. </p>
<p>So my question for those evangelicals leading the charge in the culture wars is this: Is it worth it? </p>
<p>Is a political “victory” really worth losing millions more young people to cynicism regarding the Church?</p>
<p>Is a political “victory” worth further alienating people who identify as LGBT?</p>
<p>Is a political “victory” worth perpetuating the idea that evangelical Christians are at war with gays and lesbians?</p>
<p>And is a political “victory” worth drowning out that quiet but persistent internal voice that asks—what if we get this wrong? </p>
<p>Too many Christian leaders seem to think the answer to that question is “yes,” and it&#8217;s costing them.  </p>
<p>Because young Christians are ready for peace.</p>
<p>We are ready to lay down our arms. </p>
<p>We are ready to start washing feet instead of waging war.  </p>
<p>And if we cannot find that sort of peace within the Church, I fear we will look for it elsewhere. </p>
<p>WJP Addendum: If we don&#8217;t recognize it, it will be the epitaph of the North American Church &#8211; cause of death &#8211; war wounds.</p>

<p><a href='http://shetterly.blogspot.com/2012/04/expanded-stephen-fry-on-being-offended.html'>it&#8217;s all one thing: Stephen Fry on being offended, plus Penn &#038; Teller</a>.</p>
<p>Great blog post with a couple of video clips on one of the great banes and logical fallacies of American culture &#8211; the statement &#8220;I am offended by that.&#8221;  This Stephen Fry quote and poster has gone viral and I think that is a good thing.</p>
<p>As he observes, we have come to believe that if you are offended by something, you are inherently granted the power to trounce on any offenders rights.  I&#8217;m offended, you must stop doing that.  I&#8217;m offended, therefore what you said is wrong.</p>
<p>The sad part is that we have conditioned ourselves, particularly in the church, into believing that every offended person, every complaint, is worthy of being responded to and we obligated to conform to it in practice &#8211; be it worship, education, or preaching.  And we somehow convince ourselves that is is what Jesus would do, as if Jesus answered and changed his ministry to meet the complaints and new expectations of the offended Romans, Sadduccess, Pharisees, moneychangers, crowds, Judas, Sanhedrin, Pontius Pilate, teachers of the law, his family, the high priest, and a few others that are mentioned in the Gospels.  As I recall, it didn&#8217;t quite work out that way and the offended parties nailed him to a cross.  Most were equally offended when he had the gall to rise from the dead, which just magnified the fact that their perspectives and actions were wrong but that he still loved them, calling them to follow.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem in it is all is the old Dr. Phil line, &#8220;Its not about you!&#8221;  You and I are not the center of the universe nor are we God.  But as soon as we say &#8220;I&#8217;m offended&#8221; and demand someone else, either the &#8220;offender&#8221; or some governing body &#8220;do something&#8221; about it, we place ourselves and our sensibilities over everyone else, including God.  If you didn&#8217;t quite pick up on it, Jesus offended nearly everyone around him but never changed his ministry because someone found what he said as being &#8220;offensive.&#8221;  I guarantee, if you read through a Gospel from beginning to end, you will be offended by what Jesus says and does &#8211; and that is part of the message.  Love and grace is offensive if you believe you don&#8217;t need either, that you can make it in life on your own and that you can do no wrong.</p>
<p>I never saw the movie <strong>Love Story</strong> but I do remember a line made famous in it that says &#8220;Love is never having to say you are sorry.&#8221;  Doesn&#8217;t really work in marriage but it just may work in community life if you add, &#8220;Love is never having to say you are sorry if someone else is offended.&#8221;  Maybe they should think about why.  That is not being offended.  That is being honest.  And that is better for the church and a step toward being disciples of Jesus.</p>

<p>Scientists have revealed one of the reasons why some folks are less religious than others: They think more analytically, rather than going with their gut. And thinking analytically can cause religious belief to wane — for skeptics and true believers alike.</p>
<p>No surprise here.  People are wired differently and you can&#8217;t put God under a microscope.  Therein lies the flaw of fundamentalism &#8211; you can&#8217;t analytically prove God and and if you spend your life trying to find Noah&#8217;s ark, prove the shroud of Turin, or defend a 5,000 year history of a short earth, not only will you end up frustrated, you will miss out on God&#8217;s activity around you right now.</p>

<p>Living near a church in Toledo that dropped 30,000 eggs this weekend, I really like this article as a response.  Eugene&#8217;s ending is the best part for me.</p>
<p><em>If you’re going to a church that’s giving away prizes, gadgets, iPads, and such…more power to you. I hope many visitors and guests come and many return and are drawn to relationships and community. I sincerely mean this.</p>
<p>But if you’re not going to a church and you’re asking me for advice about what kind of church you should go to, it’s possible that churches giving away prizes are incredibly deep, missional, and substantive. This isn’t a criticism against them but if you’re looking for a church:</p>
<p>Go to a church that believes in Christ Crucified and Christ risen – every single day. Every single week. This is what they believe, teach, and live out. This is the good news they share to welcome people, encourage people, disciple people and release people.</p>
<p>That’s the gospel worth living for.</em></p>

<p>Amazing.  Got my act together to have all my Holy Week and Easter sermons done so I had time to do a podcast this morning.  Its a reflection on the meaning of Easter that comes out of an email I received from a WJP listener about what Easter means.  Considering Jesus is on the front cover of Newsweek, zombie Jesus pics are floating all over, and the usual lamentation over why so many people come on Easter then disappear until Christmas, it seemed a good time to consider what it all really means and why Easter should make a difference.</p>
<p>So, enjoy the podcast, have a blessed Easter, and may you discover something new about Jesus and resurrection, something better than Zombie Jesus Day.<br />

<p><a href='http://centralchristianchurchga.org/news-and-events/happy-zombie-jesus-day/'>Happy Zombie Jesus Day!</a>.</p>
<p>Cudos to <a href="http://centralchristianchurchga.org/news-and-events/happy-zombie-jesus-day/" title="Zombie Jesus Day">Central Christian Church in Columbus, GA</a> for the attention getting leap to get non-Christians to think about Easter.  Being a zombie movie fan and all the zombie hype right now, proper church people will be offended.  People not in church will wonder if resurrection is different from being a zombie.</p>
<p>As I said, if it sounds offensive to you, you don&#8217;t have enough friends who aren&#8217;t Christians. If it made you laugh and interested in what they mean, well, if you live near Columbus, GA, go to Central Christian.</p>
<p>My prayer is the church will be packed with people wanting to meet Jesus rather than disgruntled Bible Belters who want to run out their pastor.</p>
