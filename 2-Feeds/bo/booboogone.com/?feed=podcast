<strong>How to Protect your Child from Sexual Predators</strong></p>
<p>In our 6th podcast episode Preston Jones continues with the 5 Top Safety Secrets.&nbsp; Today we talk about Tip #4 &ndash; <strong>Listening</strong>. Preston explains the importance of listening and how to listen to your child. Children have a totally different view of the world, and when our child wants to tell us something, we need to stop, pay attention and listen to what is being said. Listening without judgement is very important as it establishes a bond of trust with your child, so in the future if something is wrong they won&#039;t be afraid to tell you about it. Children often feel that they are at fault when they have been touched by a predator, so it is extremely important to establish a strong bond by of trust listening without judgement. If you have concerns about a particular situation, its best to discuss those issues at later time.</p>

<strong><br />
</strong>In our 5th podcast episode Preston Jones continues with the 5 Top Safety Secrets and today we talk about Tip #3 which is <strong>Catch Them Being Good</strong>. Preston explains what &quot;Catch Them Being Good&quot; really means. When you ask your child to complete a task, such as cleaning their room, when your child tells you that it&#039;s all done &ndash; what&#039;s the first thing you do? Do&nbsp; you focus on the things that are not completed or do you praise the child for what has been done? If you focus on a job well done, and then just notice that&#8230;.&quot;this item should really go here and oh lets take care of the garbage too and take that out to the trash can. The child will remember those unfinished things and likely do them next time to please you. When you praise a child for what they have accomplished it boosts their confidence and they will try harder next time.</p>
