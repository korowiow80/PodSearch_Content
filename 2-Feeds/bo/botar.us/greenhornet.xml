<itunes:subtitle>green hornet</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>The premise of the Green Hornet was that of a modern day Lone Ranger. The main character was Britt Reid, a newspaper publisher of the Daily Sentinel by day and the Green Hornet by night. Britt Reid was the great-nephew of the Lone Ranger. Britt Reids war against crime was an extension of his family history. The Green Hornet fought crime with his high-powered car, the Black Beauty. He also utilized a gun that fired knockout gas instead of bullets. His fists also came in handy on a regular basis. He was assisted by his Filipino valet, Kato. Kato would drive the Black Beauty, keep watch out for the police or the bad guys and sometimes lend a helping fist to the fighting. The Green Hornet pretended to be a villain while really battling the forces of crime in the big city.</itunes:summary>

            <description>The city was dimmed out. Along the riverfront were grey ships and vessels tied up at dark piers, there were no streetlights. Everywhere on telegraph poles and the walls of buildings were terse signs. A man just lately off a supply convoy cupped his hands around a match as he lit his cigarette. He read one of the signs by the flicker of the light. It read, Serve in silence, as slip of the lip may sink a ship.</description>

            <description>Mr. Bennett has called to confide in his friend Britt Reid publisher of the Daily Sentinel newspaper. For the past month Mr. Bennett has been acting as treasurer of the welfare special charity fund. Mr. Bennett does not get involved in the dispersement of the funds but just the signing of checks. Each check requires two signatures, his and Tinker who is head of the welfare board. In order to facilitate matters Bennett has been putting his signature on blank checks and now has become suspicious of Tinker and a friend of Tinkers named Murdoch who Bennett does not trust, especially as the charity has just applied for a further million dollars.</description>

            <description>To the Editor of the Daily Sentinel. Dear Sir, in answer to an ad in your paper I bought an engagement ring that was advertised by a private party. I paid 75 dollars for it and have since found out that it is not a diamond ring as I thought. The police say there is nothing that can be done about it since the person who sold it to me did not say it was a diamond so I have been gypped in a racket that the police can not touch. I am surprised that a newspaper like yours would carry ads like that. Signed and Ex GI. This was one of three letters to turn up in the Classified Ads of late and Britt Reid intended to investigate.</description>
