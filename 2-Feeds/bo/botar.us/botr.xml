		    <itunes:summary>The CBS Radio Workshop was an experimental dramatic radio anthology series that aired on CBS from January 27, 1956, until September 22, 1957. It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The CBS Radio Workshop was an experimental dramatic radio anthology series that aired on CBS from January 27, 1956, until September 22, 1957. It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Last week the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram addressed to Kansas Citys favorite singer and intended for Dinah Shore but by mistake it was delivered to George Burns. The telegram was an invitation to sing at the opening of the 5th war loan drive so we now find Mr and Mrs George Burns in a compartment on a train approaching Kansas City.</description>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

It was resurrected due to public demand, with Vincent Price returning to save the day.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

                 Was first brought to life on the radio in 1940 on Radio Athlone. It was then a five year wait before NBC picked up the option, and featured Edgar Barrier as Simon Templar, alias The Saint. Later in 1945, Brian Aherne took over the role when the show switched over to CBS. Then in 1947, probably the most famous Radio Saint of all time, Vincent Price, added his golden voice to the role. Vincent Price was once quoted as saying the most difficult thing about the show was coming up with new and unique ways to get conked on the head. After a large number of episodes, Price finally left and his replacement Barry Sullivan only lasted a few episodes before the show was cancelled. It was resurrected due to public demand, with Vincent Price returning to save the day.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

                 Was first brought to life on the radio in 1940 on Radio Athlone. It was then a five year wait before NBC picked up the option, and featured Edgar Barrier as Simon Templar, alias The Saint. Later in 1945, Brian Aherne took over the role when the show switched over to CBS. Then in 1947, probably the most famous Radio Saint of all time, Vincent Price, added his golden voice to the role. Vincent Price was once quoted as saying the most difficult thing about the show was coming up with new and unique ways to get conked on the head. After a large number of episodes, Price finally left and his replacement Barry Sullivan only lasted a few episodes before the show was cancelled. It was resurrected due to public demand, with Vincent Price returning to save the day.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Famous stage actress Betty Aimes has an appointment with the publisher Jim Barrie but when she arrives to meet him he is shot dead on the street before her. In a panic she runs away and jumps in to a taxi in which Simon Templar is already occupying.</description>

                 Was first brought to life on the radio in 1940 on Radio Athlone. It was then a five year wait before NBC picked up the option, and featured Edgar Barrier as Simon Templar, alias The Saint. Later in 1945, Brian Aherne took over the role when the show switched over to CBS. Then in 1947, probably the most famous Radio Saint of all time, Vincent Price, added his golden voice to the role. Vincent Price was once quoted as saying the most difficult thing about the show was coming up with new and unique ways to get conked on the head. After a large number of episodes, Price finally left and his replacement Barry Sullivan only lasted a few episodes before the show was cancelled. It was resurrected due to public demand, with Vincent Price returning to save the day.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her.

The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

After a large number of episodes, Price finally left and his replacement Barry Sullivan only lasted a few episodes before the show was cancelled.

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The CBS Radio Workshop was an experimental dramatic radio anthology series that aired on CBS from January 27, 1956, until September 22, 1957. It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The CBS Radio Workshop was an experimental dramatic radio anthology series that aired on CBS from January 27, 1956, until September 22, 1957. It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The CBS Radio Workshop was an experimental dramatic radio anthology series that aired on CBS from January 27, 1956, until September 22, 1957. It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

That man was Matt Dillon, U.S. Marshal of Dodge City, Kansas. In Dodge, Dillon was surrounded by hardened, but heartfelt, townsfolk, including his deputy, Chester Wesley Proudfoot; the town physician and mortician, Dr. Charles Adams and, the owner of the Long Branch Saloon, Miss Kitty Russell.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The CBS Radio Workshop was an experimental dramatic radio anthology series that aired on CBS from January 27, 1956, until September 22, 1957. It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

That man was Matt Dillon, U.S. Marshal of Dodge City, Kansas. In Dodge, Dillon was surrounded by hardened, but heartfelt, townsfolk, including his deputy, Chester Wesley Proudfoot; the town physician and mortician, Dr. Charles Adams and, the owner of the Long Branch Saloon, Miss Kitty Russell.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The CBS Radio Workshop was an experimental dramatic radio anthology series that aired on CBS from January 27, 1956, until September 22, 1957. It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

It was a revival of the earlier Columbia Workshop, broadcast by CBS from 1936 to 1943, and it used some of the same writers and directors employed on the earlier series. The CBS Radio Workshop was one of American network radios last attempts to hold onto, and perhaps recapture, some of the demographics they had lost to television in the post World War Two era.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Jim and Marian Jordan ,real-life husband and wife Vaudevillians, played Fibber and his wife Molly in this hilarious domestic comedy. The show made good use of running gags. Probably the best remembered is McGees junk-filled closet, which always crashed down on anyone that happened to open the door.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

George Burns and Gracie Allen were performers who successfully moved their stand-up comedy act to radio. There were, in total, over 120 episodes of the situation comedies featuring George and Gracie as a married couple, which they were in real life. The audiences loved Gracie, she was too dainty and ladylike for anyone to even conceive disliking her. As George soon learnt He was quoted as saying -I learned that if I blew a puff of cigar smoke in Gracies direction the audience would hate me- Burns and Allen went on to TV, as did many of the greatest radio stars that had worked in vaudeville.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary> Fibber McGee and Molly was first broadcast in 1935 and ran in a variety of formats until the final broadcast in 1956. Jim and Marian Jordan ,real-life husband and wife Vaudevillians, played Fibber and his wife Molly in this hilarious domestic comedy. The show made good use of running gags. Probably the best remembered is McGees junk-filled closet, which always crashed down on anyone that happened to open the door.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

The National Broadcasting Company in cooperation with Street and Smith, publishers of Astounding Science Fiction, presents X Minus One. X Minus One was a thirty-minute science fiction series totalling 113 episodes and throughout its three years of broadcasting, it always used the same opening, a rocket-launch countdown. The stories were strict science fiction striking out into deep space, exploring thousands of other worlds and galaxies and, the much more exciting, power struggles with aliens. Although the stories were not always human triumphs, sometimes the aliens won. It was broadcast in America from April 1955 to January 1958 on NBC. A revival of Dimension X, X Minus One is widely considered among the finest radio dramas ever produced. The first fifteen episodes were new versions of Dimension X episodes, but the remainder were adaptations of newly published science fiction stories by respected writers such as Frederik Pohl, Theodore Sturgeon, Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, with a few original scripts.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>X minus one  1955-1958, From the far horizons of the unknown, come transcribed tales of new dimensions in time and space. These are stories of the future, adventures in which you'll live in a million could be years on a thousand maybe worlds. The National Broadcasting Company in cooperation with Street and Smith, publishers of Astounding Science Fiction, presents X Minus One. X Minus One was a thirty-minute science fiction series totalling 113 episodes and throughout its three years of broadcasting, it always used the same opening, a rocket-launch countdown. The stories were strict science fiction striking out into deep space, exploring thousands of other worlds and galaxies and, the much more exciting, power struggles with aliens. Although the stories were not always human triumphs, sometimes the aliens won. It was broadcast in America from April 1955 to January 1958 on NBC.

		    <itunes:summary>X minus one  1955-1958, From the far horizons of the unknown, come transcribed tales of new dimensions in time and space. These are stories of the future, adventures in which you'll live in a million could be years on a thousand maybe worlds. The National Broadcasting Company in cooperation with Street and Smith, publishers of Astounding Science Fiction, presents X Minus One. X Minus One was a thirty-minute science fiction series totalling 113 episodes and throughout its three years of broadcasting, it always used the same opening, a rocket-launch countdown. The stories were strict science fiction striking out into deep space, exploring thousands of other worlds and galaxies and, the much more exciting, power struggles with aliens. Although the stories were not always human triumphs, sometimes the aliens won. It was broadcast in America from April 1955 to January 1958 on NBC. A revival of Dimension X, X Minus One is widely considered among the finest radio dramas ever produced. The first fifteen episodes were new versions of Dimension X episodes, but the remainder were adaptations of newly published science fiction stories by respected writers such as Frederik Pohl, Theodore Sturgeon, Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, with a few original scripts.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Sherlock Holmes - 1930-1967

The famous Sherlock Holmes detective stories appeared on radio for more than 25 years,  with a long list of performers playing the parts of Holmes and Dr Watson. The stories were written by Edith Meiser, a self-confessed Holmes addict. At first she used Arthur Conan Doyles original stories, but, after the series outlived the original material, she created her own new stories. These were so well written that she was warmly praised by Arthur Conan Doyles widow and son.

Throughout the early 1940s on American Radio, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce performed as Holmes and Watson, respectively, in several series of canonical and original Sherlock Holmes stories. When Rathbone finally departed the role before the 1947 season, Tom Conway played Sherlock Holmes opposite Nigel Bruce for one season. After a change of networks, there were two more pairings: John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson in 1947-1948 and John Stanley and Ian Martin in 1948-1949.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Sherlock Holmes - 1930-1967

The famous Sherlock Holmes detective stories appeared on radio for more than 25 years,  with a long list of performers playing the parts of Holmes and Dr Watson. The stories were written by Edith Meiser, a self-confessed Holmes addict. At first she used Arthur Conan Doyles original stories, but, after the series outlived the original material, she created her own new stories. These were so well written that she was warmly praised by Arthur Conan Doyles widow and son.

Throughout the early 1940s on American Radio, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce performed as Holmes and Watson, respectively, in several series of canonical and original Sherlock Holmes stories. When Rathbone finally departed the role before the 1947 season, Tom Conway played Sherlock Holmes opposite Nigel Bruce for one season. After a change of networks, there were two more pairings: John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson in 1947-1948 and John Stanley and Ian Martin in 1948-1949.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

He went and booked passage on the same ship Leora and Charles Moffit were sailing on that night. He agrees to be sensible to remember that she is married to respectable wealthy Charles Moffit. But it has always been hard for him to be reasonable where Leoras concerned and that night at nine oclock just three hours before sailing time he goes to Leoras hotel to see her but Charles is there and a struggle ensues which ends in a fatality.</description>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

            <description>The trip from Hayes City to Dodge was long enough on horseback, but by stage coach it seemed endless. There were only two passengers, besides me, and after the first hour on the road we stopped talking. Just sat there in silence waiting for the ride to be over. Id been up late the past couple of nights, so I braced myself into the corner of the coach and fell asleep. I vaguely remember the stage pulling to a stop and somebody shouting. But I came fully awake when the door was jerked open and a man behind a bandanna stuck a shotgun in my face.</description>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Boston Blackie - 1944-1948

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

Blackie was a tough, wisecracking private detective working in New York, billed as -enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.- His speciality was making fools of the police, a simple task with Inspector Farraday heading the official investigations.

Boston Blackie was a character introduced by Jack Boyle who was featured in a series of mystery films during the silent movie era and in the 1940s. The character appeared in stories in the Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines. He first appeared in book form in Boston Blackie, published in 1919. The silent film version of Boston Blackie lasted from 1919 until 1927. Over a decade later the screen rights were purchased by Columbia, and a new series ran from 1941 until 1949.  In 1944 a Boston Blackie radio show was played by NBC as a replacement. Over 200 episodes were made between 1944 and 1950.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Sherlock Holmes - 1930-1967

The famous Sherlock Holmes detective stories appeared on radio for more than 25 years,  with a long list of performers playing the parts of Holmes and Dr Watson. The stories were written by Edith Meiser, a self-confessed Holmes addict. At first she used Arthur Conan Doyles original stories, but, after the series outlived the original material, she created her own new stories. These were so well written that she was warmly praised by Arthur Conan Doyles widow and son.

Throughout the early 1940s on American Radio, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce performed as Holmes and Watson, respectively, in several series of canonical and original Sherlock Holmes stories. When Rathbone finally departed the role before the 1947 season, Tom Conway played Sherlock Holmes opposite Nigel Bruce for one season. After a change of networks, there were two more pairings: John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson in 1947-1948 and John Stanley and Ian Martin in 1948-1949.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

Yes the saucy little servant girl Alfred had married in London so many years before had become a lazy little housewife whose untidy home had miraculously survived the blitz.</description>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

            <description>There was only one love in the life of Captain Martin Quist. it wasnt money, he long since made more than enough to retire comfortably. And it wasnt women nor liquor or self indulgence. Captain Quist was part of the sea. It had been his home and his life since the day in 1907 when he signed on as an apprentice seaman. But a love as strong of that of Captain Quists of the sea can be dangerous. It can blind a man to more important things like human decency and justice.</description>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

            <description>The Way of All Flesh 1903 is a semi autobiographical novel by Samuel Butler which attacks Victorian era hypocrisy. Written between 1873 and 1884, it traces four generations of the Pontifex family. It represents a relaxation from the religious outlook from a Calvinistic approach, which is presented as harsh. Butler dared not publish it during his lifetime, but when it was published it was accepted as part of the general revolution against Victorianism.</description>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Murder is a peculiar affair. All it needs in many cases is the right pressure the right set of circumstances, the right opportunity and an otherwise respectable member of the community becomes a killer. If youd tried to explain that to Arthur Winslow he wouldnt have understood. If youd told him that he was in a fair way to become a murderer in a few months he would have looked at you strangely for Arthur was respectable, solid exactly like a hundred thousand other respectable solid Jersey commuters. His life was a pretty drab affair, part of it the office J. Simmons and Company, Investment Brokers.</description>

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

            <description>It has been mighty peaceful around Kansas lately and Chester likes it that way. Even though he is a Texan himself he does not like Texans and generalizes to Matt Dillon that they all cause nothing but trouble.</description>

		    <itunes:summary>Airing on the CBS network on April 26, 1952, Gunsmoke was the first and greatest adult Western, it told the story of the violence that moved west with young America, and the story of a man who moved with it. That man was Matt Dillon, U.S. Marshal of Dodge City, Kansas. In Dodge, Dillon was surrounded by hardened, but heartfelt, townsfolk, including his deputy, Chester Wesley Proudfoot; the town physician and mortician, Dr. Charles Adams and, the owner of the Long Branch Saloon, Miss Kitty Russell.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Most people are blind. Yes they are blind to the shortcomings of someone close to them someone sometimes to their own. That was the way with the three women who lived in the old Hopkins house on the hill, three very different women but all of them blind to the characters of the others. There was Lola Hopkins mistress of the house, warm sincere Lola happy in her coming marriage to Gregory. There was Patsy Hopkins Lolas cousin whose only happiness is in herself her youth, her loveliness and old Fraulein the German housekeeper who has been Patsys governess and who had found happiness with serving her with years of devotion. None of them really knew the others; all of them were a little blind that is until it happened.</description>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>The Adventures of Superman, adapted from the DC Comics character created in 1938, came to radio as a syndicated show on New York Citys WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942 to June 17, 1949, as a weekly serial. It was aired on a three-times-a-week schedule from January 31, 1949 to June 17, 1949. The series shifted to ABC Saturday mornings on November 5 1949, and then to twice-a-week in June, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951.

The character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster arrived on radio not long after the comic book and took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kelloggs Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for -truth, justice and the American way- in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip.</itunes:summary>

            <description>FDR declares war on japan</description>
		    <itunes:subtitle>original air date 12/08/1941</itunes:subtitle>
		    <itunes:summary>Yesterday, Dec. 7, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.  The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with the government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleagues delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack. It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace. The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu. Yesterday, the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya. Last night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong. Last night, Japanese forces attacked Guam. Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands. Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island. This morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island. Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation. As commander in chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense. Always will we remember the character of the onslaught against us. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. I believe I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again.Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our interests are in grave danger.With confidence in our armed forces - with the unbounding determination of our people - we will gain the inevitable triumph - so help us God. I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, Dec. 7, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>World War II was a global military conflict that took place between 1939 and 1945. It was the largest and deadliest war in history.

The war began in 1939 between Germany and the Allies. The Allies were initially made up of Poland, the British Commonwealth, France, and others. Germany, Italy, and Japan in 1940 signed a mutual defense agreement, the Tripartite Pact, and were known as the Axis Powers. In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, forcing the Soviets into the Allied camp. In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States bringing it too into the war on the Allied side. China, which had been at war with Japan since the mid-1930s, also joined the Allies, as eventually did most of the rest of the world.</itunes:summary>

		    <itunes:summary>Jack Benny Program, 1932 - 1955

Benny Kubelsky was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 14, 1894. He grew up in Waukegan, Illinois, and would later become Jack Benny.

As a young boy, he was encouraged by his Jewish immigrant parents from Poland to achieve respectability as a violinist. He showed enough talent to hit the vaudeville stage, where he played popular songs, adopted a suave-but-fragile personality, and told self-deprecating jokes.

When columnist/broadcaster Ed Sullivan invited Benny on his program on March 19, 1932, the persona was effective. Benny got his own twice-weekly show later that year on CBS.  Benny became an enormously successful national figure with The Jack Benny Program, a weekly radio show which ran from 1932 to 1948 on NBC and he returned to CBS from 1948 to May 22, 1955. </itunes:summary>
