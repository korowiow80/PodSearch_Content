<description>A sure sign of summer being over is the ability for AJ and I to get together. It almost didn't happen, neither of us are in a place where returning calls when agreed upon is easy. BUT - we rose above it, because there was cold beer to be consumed, and audio to create. Even though the elections in Canada and the US are about a month away, we remain faithful to ourselves and avoid politics in favour of Hockey and The Muppets.....      * Frank Sinatra's Watertown (BoingBoing Wikipedia)     * The Habs = this is our year (as long as Detroit doesn't spoil it)     * AJ   family are off to DisneyWorld     * Bob's San Francisco trip (Pics of Bob at Pixar Thanks Pat!)     * The Hunt for Big Mike     * The anti-government French "Seal" video "Culture en Peril"     * This year's xmas show will be our 5th Xmas show!     * Barenaked Ladies "troubles"     * Barenaked Ladies awesome "Bathroom sessions" videos     * Oh Danny Boy     * Jeff Dunham     * Great Quebec french movie : Bluff     * Tetes-a-claques is now in English  Our musical selections this time:      * nelo - You Don't Know     * Brown Shoe - Uh Oh</description>

<description>Oh was this fun. Christa Couture came to town to play and promote her new album, and there was no way in hell we were going to miss that. We had a great time listening and watching Christa, and an even better time chatting with her. It was like talking to an old friend for the first time.  You'll hear some other voices around the table, they'd be:      * Cat from the Catfishshow     * Neil Gorman from Comicology     * Nico from SnowyDay Design  Proving why Bob and AJ aren't doing radio, we discuss lots of fun stuff with Christa, almost none of which has to do with music :      * Neil is Obama's running mate     * after 3 years we meet     * Mic stand parts in Lethbridge     * Married before getting too old     * We ask an FM question, and can't follow through     * Self booked tours     * Christa hates Montreal ?     * Withnail and I     * Tatoo-Tawk, with AJ and Christa     * The Bronski-Beat test     * Being a Bad Amputee  All Christa Tunes this time!</description>
