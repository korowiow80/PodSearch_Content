      <title>Fascinating Author: Laura Harris</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Regain Sanity by Strategically Relinquishing Control
Starting a business is never easy, neither is it easy being a seasoned entrepreneur.

Wouldn’t it be nice if someone laid out the basics so that others could save a lot of time, money, and grief? Laura Harris has done just that. Focusing on concepts that will help entrepreneurs avoid costly, time-consuming trial-and-terror learning, Harris will guide you through the challenges of running a business.

Based on the author’s own hard-earned lessons and her years of experience consulting with hundreds of business owners, Surrender to Win will teach you how to generate more income, maximize profits, create client loyalty, develop autonomous employees, and decrease the stress that results from “making it up as you go along.” You can achieve all of this and not be shackled to the business by developing a solid busi-ness plan, clear-cut operations, strong leaders, and competent employees.

Harris offers insightful and authoritative advice that both fledgling entrepreneurs and seasoned business owners will find helpful and practical. She can teach you how to build a profitable business where employees think and act like owners.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Nora Franke is a New York food writer stuck in a rut. Hoping to get rid of a broken heart (and the extra pounds that came with it), she accepts a job as a menu consultant at an elite fitness ranch in Baja. With any luck she'll shed the weight, make some friends, and maybe even find a way to get over her ex-lover.

But Nora soon finds that there's more than just yoga classes, morning hikes, and liquid fasts among the flowers and herbs—someone's put murder on the menu, and unless she can solve the mystery of who's behind the death of two of the guests, Nora may just be the next victim.

night his band performs at a blowout party for EyeBitz.com, a fast-rising
Internet startup that has the city of San Diego talking. When Rolly returns after hours to retrieve his guitar from the host’s mansion, he finds a dead body floating in the swimming pool.

industrial parks of Torrey Pines Mesa to downtown blues clubs, from street
taco shops to the penthouse of the La Jolla Hyatt, from the hallowed halls
of academia to the sands of Black’s Beach, San Diego’s official

      <description><![CDATA[Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in America. It occurs
in some form every 79 seconds. And nefarious minds are dedicated to the
discovery of new methods for its commission. The same technological
advances that make communication easy and instant have torn our identities
from us and turned them into “objects” that can be stolen and misused.

What if a male law firm partner hijacked the identity of a female
associate? What if he used email impersonation and electronic forgery to
set her up as the mastermind of an illegal scheme? And what if she was
ultimately framed for murder as a result of his actions?

Wearing the Spider, a debut legal thriller by Susan Schaab, explores these
possibilities.

thoroughly-enjoyable tale.”

      <description><![CDATA[Haunted by her involvement in her parents death at the age of ten, Cassandra has never been confident in the love that others felt for her—not her adoptive parents, her friends and certainly not the man she loved with all her heart. So, after giving herself to her high school sweetheart on prom night, she flees from the overpowering fears and all those who supported her.

And then after four years of sleeping with one strange man after another—whose names she couldn’t remember or never knew—she decided enough was enough. It was time to return to face those she’d left behind, particularly Brenden Carter.

Brenden should hate Cass for running away from their love and with his daughter, but somehow even after years of telling himself he hated her–and doing a lot of womanizing himself–Cass’ smile still managed to get next to him.

Will he be able to forgive her for leaving him when he needed her most?]]></description>
