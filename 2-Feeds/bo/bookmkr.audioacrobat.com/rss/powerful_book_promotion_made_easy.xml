      <description><![CDATA[Publicity in today's Internet world is a whole new game: it is NOT about

1. How to respond to HARO (Help a Reporter Out) with a 90% success rate of
getting contacted.

2. The magic formula of writing emails to the media so that your message
gets read.

3. The essential rules of what works and what doesn't when working with
bloggers, reporters, and producers.

4. How to tie your expertise into today's news that will land you in the
press.

5. The importance of speaking and writing in juicy soundbites that get you
invited by the media over and over again.

6. The secrets to writing "screaming good" headlines for your articles,
blogs, or social media savvy press releases.

About our guest: Speaker and author Liz Goodgold is a fiery redhead with
over 20 years of experience in marketing and branding. She is the author of
RED FIRE BRANDING: Create a Hot Personal Brand and Have Customers for Life
