      <description>Nothing is sacred to shameless heavyweight comedian &lt;b&gt;Ralphie May&lt;/b&gt;, who -- in a very special encore presentation of one of our most scandalous shows ever -- entertains Bob &amp; Co. with his hilarious take on Michael Jackson's legacy, how he prefers his Oprah &amp; why Paula Dean turns him on! And in &lt;b&gt;The Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, a moronic burglar checks his FacebookÂ® account on victim's computer, but forgets to log out. And this was also the episode in which one story made us crack up so hard we almost couldn't finish the show. Hint: It had to do with cyber toys for the virtual bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_11_25.mp3</link>
      <description>Those bleeding-heart liberals insist on turning everyone -- even hardcore terrorists -- into victims, our guest, conservative icon and agitator extraordinaire &lt;b&gt;Ann Coulter&lt;/b&gt;, claims in a rapid-fire broadside against the Left. And, she fumes, this spineless surrender mentality is exactly why the Army and everyone else failed to act on the chilling rhetoric from Fort Hood massacre suspect Maj. Hasan! And on &lt;b&gt;The Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, the panelists discuss Google's plans to double Internet speeds with a new application-layer protocol. Also on the menu: Conspiracy theorists and other nuts believe the world will come to a cataclysmic end on Dec. 21, 2012. So can we kiss our earthly lives goodbye?</description>

      <title>Sen. Fred Thompson Warns of the Dangers of Trying the Sept. 11th Mastermind in NYC!</title>
      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_11_18.mp3</link>
      <description>Trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York is a huge mistake, and the inevitable media circus will hand the Sept. 11th mastermind a very public pulpit from which to preach his vile propaganda. That's the disturbing warning from our guest, &lt;b&gt;the esteemed Sen. Fred Thompson&lt;/b&gt;, who also claims that some of the documents handed over to Mohammed's defense went straight to Osama Bin Laden's tent! And on &lt;b&gt;The Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, the panelists try to make sense of a new study, which claims that Internet usage makes you more social. And a warped new computer game permanently deletes a random file from your Mac every time you pulverize an alien!

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_11_11.mp3</link>
      <description>He is cranky, volatile and absolutely hilarious. He's even got an asteroid named after him! In a very special encore presentation of Radio Go Daddy, we're replaying one of our funniest shows ever as combustible comedian &lt;b&gt;Adam Carolla&lt;/b&gt; entirely loses his cool and goes on an epic tirade that ridicules navel-gazing tweets and absolutely eviscerates the ACLU, which, he claims, is destroying our country! And on the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, we reveal how one brainy house cat landed a high school diploma. Also on tap: New study proves what's painfully obvious: Half of all tweets are nothing but mindless babble!

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_11_04.mp3</link>
      <description>John Lennon and Michael Jackson are performing divine concerts in Heaven, and Farrah Fawcett has gone into research! So speaks our guest, world-famous psychic &lt;b&gt;Sylvia Browne&lt;/b&gt;. The seeress also predicts a massive recovery of the US economy and assures us that no meteorite impact or other cataclysmic natural disaster will wipe out Mankind anytime soon!
 
And in &lt;b&gt;The Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, the panelists examine the &quot;tweeting-after-sex&quot; phenomenon. We also have the strange tale of the NYU researcher who's translating Moby Dick in its entirety into Japanese emoticons.
 
&lt;b&gt;Plus: Balloon Boy video games, nude burglars &amp; Susan Fitter's latest lecture on netiquette!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>TV's Sexy &quot;Money Honey&quot; and Web Celeb Hotty iJustine</title>
      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_10_28.mp3</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Maria Bartiromo&lt;/b&gt; made it to the top of a heavily male-dominated world. But does CNBC's original &quot;Money Honey&quot; cringe when she hears that nickname? Or does she kinda like it? You will never guess why she trademarked the term! Maria also delivers her sobering take on the troubled economy: Is there light at the end of the tunnel, or are we only halfway through a devastating &quot;double-dip recession&quot;? Also joining Bob &amp; Co: &lt;b&gt;Web hottie Justine Ezarik -- aka &quot;iJustine&quot;&lt;/b&gt; -- reveals why creepy stalkers forced her to stop &quot;lifecasting&quot; her every waking moment on the Internet and how the phenomenal power of YouTube inspires millions to watch her order pizza or flip through a phone bill. And on which hit TV show will she be making a brief, but bloody appearance?

On the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, the panelists learn which country made high-speed Internet a legal right and hear the chilling story of how an iPhone saved a Vermont woman from the jaws of a ferocious bear.

&lt;b&gt;Plus: Owen Thomas lets loose on the alleged inside trader and fired Twitter boss's new start-up.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <title>La Toya Says Michael Knew He Was Going To Die... And Why.  Plus: Kiss &amp; Tell on Google Maps and Tweets From The Afterlife!</title>
      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_10_21.mp3</link>
      <description>&quot;Michael was a gift from God&quot; -- an absolutely wonderful human being. But justice needs to be served following his tragic and unnecessary death! That's the message from an emotional &lt;b&gt;La Toya Jackson&lt;/b&gt;. In an absolutely extraordinary show, a painfully honest La Toya opens up to Bob about Michael's legacy,  her theory about his untimely death -- and her best-selling Playboy spreads. Also on the menu: &lt;b&gt;Gayle Bass -- aka the &quot;Click Chick&quot; from KTAR Radio&lt;/b&gt; -- joins the cast and tells the crew where to see stories of leprechauns in Alabama and chimpanzees riding Segways!
 
On the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files&lt;/b&gt; a tasteful new website lets you pinpoint on a Google Map where, how and when you just did the nasty and our panelists reach a stunning new low as they discuss &quot;twÃ©ances,&quot; &quot;twairvoyances,&quot;&quot;twasturbation&quot; and other ridiculous Twitter twenomena!

      <description>Is it OK to get naked in the gym locker room? As long as you follow the &quot;5-minute rule&quot; says our guest and &lt;b&gt;Last Comic Standing winner Jon Reep&lt;/b&gt;. Jon also tells us what you should NEVER do with a hair dryer. Plus, &lt;b&gt;Republican advisor and political commentator Mary Matalin&lt;/b&gt; blasts Pres. Obama's track record and slams liberal men who don't fight fair.

In the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;: computer makers plan to release an &quot;instant-on&quot; PC and why you shouldn't shoot your iPhone in the Apple store.

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_10_07.mp3</link>
      <description>Zapp!!! Kapoww!!! Bamm!!! Holy Sound Effects, Batfans: In a truly legendary show, the great &lt;b&gt;Adam West&lt;/b&gt; joins Bob &amp; Co. from the Batcave to entertain you with anecdotes from the Bat set, his co-starring role with The Three Stooges and how his new Family Guy gig almost earned him a Fatwa. Adam also gives the scoop on that Batcave garage sale and the new &quot;Adam West Naked&quot; DVD, which features the Caped Crusader telling all about every 120 &quot;Batman&quot; episodes. Plus, will the Dark Knight kiss and tell on who he lured into the Bat bedroom? Tune in to find out!  And in the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, the panelists wonder what made a British school girl auction her granny on eBay. A no reserve auction at that!  We also have the lowdown on why Britain wants Arnold Schwarzenegger to &quot;terminate&quot; the Calif-based &quot;TripAdvisor for Pimps&quot; Web site that posts reviews on London's prostitutes!

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_09_30.mp3</link>
      <description>He's outrageous, politically incorrect, and funny as hell! Nothing is sacred to our guest, the &quot;Austin-tatious,&quot; larger-than-life &lt;b&gt;comedian Ralphie May,&lt;/b&gt; who, in a show for the ages, entertains Bob &amp; Co. with his hilariously irreverent take on Oprah, the hot women of the Food Network, Michael Jackson's legacy &amp; smoking weed with JC! Also on the menu: Pro Bull Rider Cody Ford dishes on rodeo groupies and mounting a 2100 lb. bull!  And in the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files,&lt;/b&gt; an epically idiotic burglar checks Facebook account on victim's computer, but forgets to log out. And -- it finally happened -- one story made the panelists laugh so hard they almost couldn't finish the show. You gotta hear it!

      <title>The Disturbing Truth About the Columbine Massacre</title>
      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_09_23.mp3</link>
      <description>When Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold slaughtered 13 people and then themselves at Columbine High School, the media helped create an image of the killers as reclusive outcasts who snapped after years of bullying. Not true, says &lt;b&gt;Dave Cullen, author of NYT Bestseller &quot;Columbine,&quot;&lt;/b&gt; who's on a mission to set the record straight about the tragedy. There was, he tells Bob in a jaw-dropping interview, no &quot;Trench Coat Mafia,&quot; and the perpetrators were coldblooded, calculating killers determined to murder hundreds of random students and school personnel.  And on the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files,&lt;/b&gt; the esteemed panelists discuss how Microsoft's new Visual Search service will work for X-rated material, while Bob finds the positive in Denmark's embarrassingly ill-advised tourism ad.

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_09_16.mp3</link>
      <description>Their raunchy lyrics and suggestive videos put Miami rappers &lt;b&gt;2 Live Crew&lt;/b&gt; squarely on the frontline of the late 80s/early 90s rap censorship war. In a show that's bound to up Radio Go Daddy's street cred, the infamous rappers reminisce about &quot;Me So Horny,&quot; give a sneak peak of their latest single and unleash their unfiltered take on strip clubs, censorship and, even, Danica Patrick! And in the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, the pundits try to understand why 2 trapped girls updated their Facebook for help instead of calling for help. Also on tap: Carrier pigeons make a triumphant return in South Africa, and should email messages in &lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;BOLD, RED and ALL CAPS&lt;/font&gt; really be grounds for termination?

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_09_09.mp3</link>
      <description>Bernie Madoff pulled off one of the biggest swindles in history by shamelessly ripping off friends, celebs, charities, even unsuspecting relatives. &quot;&lt;b&gt;Madoff with the Money&quot; author Jerry Oppenheimer&lt;/b&gt; reveals how Madoff's life of deceit can be traced all the way back to his childhood in Queens and exposes his rampant obsessive compulsiveness, secret sex affairs and personal quirks including wearing two $30K Rolexes on the same wrist.  Also on the menu, &lt;b&gt;AdventureGirl -- aka Stephanie Michaels&lt;/b&gt; -- reveals Buzz Aldrin's unbelievable last thought before stepping on the moon and explains how she racked up a whopping 1 million Twitter followers! And in the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, the pundits weigh in on the new Twitter parody, Woofer.com, and the iPhone exclusive is running out for AT&amp;T. And although marginally intrigued, Bob &amp; Co. are mostly split on the authenticity of the &quot;Nessie&quot; sighting on Google Earth.

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2009_09_02.mp3</link>
      <description>Obama's message of Hope and Change is a hoax, and voters are facing a serious case of buyer's remorse! At least that's what our guest, conservative blogger and &lt;b&gt;#1 NY Times Bestselling author Michelle Malkin&lt;/b&gt; claims in her devastating expose on the Obama Administration, which, she alleges, is infested with corruption and cronyism.

      <link>http://mediafiles.godaddy.com/GDRadio/radio_2008_12_10.mp3</link>
      <description>In a highly party-centric edition of the show, Bob &amp; Nima discuss the somewhat critical media coverage of Go Daddy's Holiday Bash &amp; ponder the question: Is it OK to throw a party for the ages while the economy is tanking? Meanwhile, &lt;b&gt;Blip.Tv founder &amp; CEO Mike Hudack&lt;/b&gt; - who has also received his fare share of party-related press lately -- joins us to talk about that much-maligned &quot;Camp Cyprus&quot; video, which placed him at the center of a blogosphere firestorm. And in the &lt;b&gt;Internet Files&lt;/b&gt;, we discuss one teenager's incredibly ill-advised text message to her dad &amp; wonder if the drowning city of Venice will be entirely submerged before it can implement free Internet for all of its citizens. 

&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;Plus:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Bob hands us the scoop on the two new Go Daddy Super Bowl commercials!
