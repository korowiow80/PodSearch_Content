The songs in this episode are "General Error" by 047, "Baby Still Too Fat" by Starship Amazing, "Cheeky Girls Fast Food" by cerror, "Retrotune" by Souleye, and "Hexadecimal Genome" by Bit Shifter.</description>

	<title>Episode 26: Modern Classical and Beyond!</title>
	<description>In this episode, I have five modern classical songs for you.  Some of the songs are more "modern" and some are more "classical" but they are all really good. The first song in this episode is "Waltz of the Pigalle Side Streets" by Alexander Piterskiy, who wrote the podcast's theme music and cohosted episode 21.  It is a swirling waltz that manages to be both complex and very easy to listen to.  It is followed with the dark and chaotically fun "Drehorgel" by Sallo, a duo from Portland, Oregon.  "Hiatus" by RQTN is a beautiful little piece from Paris. "Shores" by Empiric Project and "Nanoreactor" by Xcentric Noizz are both much more modern and push the definition of "classical".  "Shores" is ambient electonica, while "Nanoreactor" is much darker and heavier.  Both are off a compilation dedicated to the Chernobyl tragedy put out by the Tunguska Electronic Music Society.  Classical is still alive and definitely still evolving.</description>

	<title>Episode 27: Robot Love</title>
	<description>This is the Valentine's Day themed podcast, but since I can't really top last year's podcast for songs about love, I thought I'd go for something a little bit different.  So, do you remember in the movie "The Terminator" when Sarah Connor's answering machine says "Machines need love too"?  Well, I decided to use that as the theme.  With that in mind, here are five songs about robots... and their relationships with the humans who love or need them.  The podcast begins with "Everybody Needs a Robot" by Matthew Ebel, followed by "Robots" by Canadian musician Dan Mangan, which has a fantastic video. "Disco Droid" by Astro Kid and "I Need Your (Robot) Love" by Eat Me Drink Me are two robot-themed dance songs, and "Wadsworth's Song" by Lewis Fitzjohn wraps up the show with a tribute to the video game Fallout 3 in the style of The Ink Spots.  Also, in this episode, I announce the winners of the 2011 Listeners' Choice Contest.</description>

	<title>Episode 28: Ska Ska Ska!</title>
	<description>This episode features five very upbeat, very fun ska tunes.  Ska has changed a lot over the years from its beginnings in Jamaica in the late 1950s, but the changes haven't diminished the music.  If anything, time has given ska bands all over the world a lot of room to find their own sound and get out their message.  From four high school guys in Colorado to Cleveland Street Ska coming out of Russia, ska has a lot to offer.  The songs in this episode are "A Song For The Broken" by Stacked Like Pancakes, "Model Rocket" by Hatrick Penry, "Despierta" by Termofrigidus, "The City of Khakassia" by Hary Davi, and "Never Stop" by The Ruckus.</description>

	<title>Episode 31: Post-Whatever</title>
	<description>If the "post-" genres are all about pushing the limits and breaking rules within their parent genres, then this episode is a little bit of chaos  for your ears: five songs from the "post-" genres.  That's a post-rock song by a band from Budapest, a post-hardcore and post-jazz song from Austria, post-hardcore from Southern California, another post-rock song that feels quite different from the first from England, and some post-electronica that was made in Costa Rica.  The songs are "Volt Jobb?" by [tagless], "IV" by IXOYE, "Mission: Control" by Harris Grade, "Constants (Part 2)" by Arbor Lights, and "Freddy Liked to Dance" by Adino.</description>
