      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1133574/600x600_905381.bmp&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us had one of those moments at the beach when time stopped. The DJ spun in our head, and we dropped the shit to some babe-liscious babe we hadn't noticed. Someone you wouldn't introduce to your momma, but would fly to the moon with right there and then. Oh, the guilt... Jeremy had one of these beach guilty pleasures just last year down at the beach in Australia. This year he hopes to find the pleasure of love as he gives that naughty Australian beach a second browsing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
