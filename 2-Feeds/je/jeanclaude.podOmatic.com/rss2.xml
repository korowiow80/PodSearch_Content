At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles.  I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame. At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,&#8221;
says the LORD.  Zephaniah 3: 19-20

Zephaniah had warned the people of the days of suffering that were coming but as the book closes he reminds them of something else.  Everything will be restored, and it will happen before your very eyes.</description>

At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, 
who are like wine left on its dregs, who think, &#8216;The LORD will do nothing, either good or bad.&#8217; Their wealth will be plundered, their houses demolished. Though they build houses, 
they will not live in them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink the wine.&#8221;              Zephaniah 1:12-13.

Zephaniah was likely written in the years immediately before and during the revival that took place under King Josiah&#8217;s rule.  God most likely used this prophecy to speak to the hearts of the people about repentance.</description>

Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, 
though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen 
and no cattle in the stalls,  yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior.
Habakkuk 3:17-18

What to do when the world comes crashing down?  Don&#8217;t rejoice for the situation but rejoice in the middle of the situation.  Know that the love of God is there to uphold you.  </description>

      <title>The Unexplainable</title>

&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. St John 3:16

The unexplainable, the unbelievable was now reality. The word was made flesh and dwelled among us. Christ came to pay a debt he didn&#8217;t own for generations who were not yet born. Our minds are too limited to fully comprehend His love. It is in our hearts that we open the door. It is there we accept a reality we cannot explain. It is there the Son of God dwells.

&#8220;See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright&#8212; but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness.&#8221; Habakkuk 2: 4

Habakkuk is aware that judgment must come to the people but is concerned that the judgment will come at the hands of those who are wicked than they.  The Lord assures him that he sees and knows the Babylonians.

I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me,and what answer I am to give to this complaint. Habakkuk 2:1

It is likely that Habakkuk lived through the revival experienced during the time of the godly Josiah and then saw the people return to their sins.  A prophet of God he felt compelled to discuss the matter with God. </description>

The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet. Nahum 1:3

Nahum's message was a harsh one for a city that had escaped danger once.
Now without repentance they would be destroyed.</description>

He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. Micah 6:8

God will judge not by the expectation of the people but by the standard of righteousness and holiness that He requires.</description>

Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. Micah 7:7


 Let us wait for the God of our salvation.  It is never too late or too early to call him.  It is never a bad time to cry out to Him.  In fact, with a world filled with needs he waits to hear our voice seeking him for while he loves all of us, He also loves each one of us.</description>

We Will Rise

Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will rise. Though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.  Micah 7:8.

  When we have failed, just as the people Micah was sent to, there is still hope. </description>

Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they lean upon the LORD and say, &#8220;Is not the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us.&#8221; Micah 3:11

Micah both in name and in his message to the people had one critical question, who is like God, or who is like Jehovah? It is a question we should all ask.</description>

And God saw their works that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not. Jonah 3:10

The sentence has been given but a wise leader decided to ask for mercy.  Nineveh was a wicked city but they acknowledged their wrongdoing and went down in fasting and prayer.  Even the animals fasted and God extended mercy.</description>

Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.&#8221;  When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened. Jonah 3:9-10

Jonah wanted a well earned punishment for Nineveh  but God does not delight in the destruction of his creation.  He delights when man repents, sees the error of his ways, turns from doing evil, seeks God's forgiveness and serves Him.</description>

 Seek good, not evil, that you may live. Then the LORD God Almighty will be with you, just as you say he is. Amos 5:14


The cry goes forth today just as it did then, justice must prevail, fairness must be a part of our government and our courts. Evil cannot be the order of the day nor the exploitation of the innocent.</description>

 Seek good, not evil, that you may live. Then the LORD God Almighty will be with you, just as you say he is. Amos 5:14


The cry goes forth today just as it did then, justice must prevail, fairness must be a part of our government and our courts. Evil cannot be the order of the day nor the exploitation of the innocent.</itunes:summary>

Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.  The lion has roared&#8212; who will not fear? The Sovereign LORD has spoken&#8212; who can but prophesy?  Amos 3:7-8 

Who can but speak the words of truth when the Lord has spoken?  Amos was compelled to go to the people and speak the words of the Lord.  He was not a member of some elite group but he was the messenger of God for that hour.   </description>

 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision. Joel3:14

Could there be a day of decision for each of us? Could it be the day we decide if we are a friend or an enemy of God?  Multitudes, great multitudes, stand now faced with the greatest single question that they must ever consider. Will we accept Jesus Christ as our personal Savior, will we serve him?

 &#8220;Even now,&#8221; declares the LORD, &#8220;return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.&#8221;  Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity. Joel 2:12-13

God is less interested In our public displays of sincerely and righteousness than the reality of a truly repentant heart.  He is not moved by the appearance of repentance but by a heart that is broken and contrite.</description>

&#8220;O Ephraim, what have I to do with false gods? It is I Who answer and take care of you. I am like a green cypress tree. Your fruit comes from Me.&#8221; Hosea 14:8 (New Life Version)

The true and living God has nothing to do with false gods, produced by the hands of men, powerless and useless.  These are not to be compared to the God of Jacob.  </description>

But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and wait for your God always.
Hosea 12:6


You have tried it your way.  You have searched  out other gods and they have failed you.  Now remember Jacob, remember God&#8217;s convent with his people.  Remember who you are and God&#8217;s great love for you.  On your own you have failed, turn back to the Lord.  </description>

&#8220;What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears.&quot; Hosea 6: 4

The love of God's people is described like dew in the morning, beautiful, pleasant for the moment but also not substantial, it is fleeting and temporary. When the heat of any stress is applied to the situation the love simply evaporates. </description>

The LORD said to me, &#8220;Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by another man and is an adulterous. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes.&#8221; Hosea 3:1

Hosea was directed by God to show love to Gomer despite the fact she was loved by another.  Would anyone condemn him if he just walked away from the marriage? probably not.
But God wanted this relationship to show to the people His love for them in a way they could understand.   The Lord would purchased them back and love them.  He would in due time fully restore every aspect of the relationship with His people.  Hosea chose to not only purchase his wife back he chose to love her.

My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. &#8220;Because you have rejected knowledge...&quot; Hosea 4;6a

The people perish for lack of knowledge.  Was it knowledge of the culture, days and seasons? Was it the knowledge of the natural world?  No, this knowledge was all about knowing God, the discernment that comes from being close to God and hearing or heeding his words and his teaching.</description>

When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, &#8220;Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the LORD.&#8221;  Hosea 1:2


Are you seeking God for an opportunity for greater service to him?  Remember Hosea. Understand that great service walks hand in hand with great sacrifice.  Great blessing and spiritual intimacy with God come at a great cost. </description>

Then he continued, &#8220;Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.  But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia.  Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.&#8221; Daniel 10: 12-14



God lifted the curtain of time and revealed to Daniel events of the future in a vision.  It was unbelievable and yet undeniable.  God is indeed the God of history and all time.</description>

Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote. ..Then Daniel answered the king, &#8220;You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means.Daniel 5: 5;17

(Rembrandt&#8217;s version of handwriting on the wall courtesy of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshezzar)
The King offered Daniel prestige and recognition if he would interpret the writing.  
Surely this would be a fitting reward for such a task.  Daniel was not interested in 
the the offer of prestige but simply wanted to do God&#8217;s will and speak truth.

Then Nebuchadnezzar said, &#8220;Praise is to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king&#8217;s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.&#8221; Daniel 3:28-29


Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s failure to submit himself to a God he acknowledged and respected  might have saved him from some of the experiences to come but now he comes face to face with the reality of God and will not ask the critical question, what must I do?  How can I become a servant to this great God?

One of the criminals hanging beside him scoffed, &#8220;So you&#8217;re the Messiah, are you? Prove it by saving yourself&#8212;and us, too, while you&#8217;re at it!&#8221;  But the other criminal protested, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die? We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn&#8217;t done anything wrong.&#8221;  Then he said, &#8220;Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.&#8221; And Jesus replied, &#8220;I assure you, today you will be with me in paradise.&#8221;Luke 23:39-43 (New Living Translation)

The voice of the second  criminal was softer and kinder. He did not deny his guilt.  This repentant criminal knew in his heart that this Jesus was different.  And Jesus stopped and saw what no man could see, a repentant soul ready for the kingdom.

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, &#8220;O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you.   If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty.  But even if he doesn&#8217;t, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.&#8221; Daniel 3:16-18(New Living Translation)


Three young men respectfully and without hesitation refused to bow down to an idol god and were sent to  what should have been certain destruction.  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego teach us much about faith and courage.

Daniel went and asked the king to give him some time so that he could explain the dream&#8217;s meaning. Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about this matter. He told them to ask the God of heaven to be merciful and to explain this secret to them so that they would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise advisers in Babylon. 
Daniel 2:16-18.


Drinking buddies are  a type of friendship. Some use a euphemism, 
friends with benefits to describe a relationship that exist only for mutual 
convenience and gratification.  We have shopping friends, workplace friends, 
and sports buddies but in times like these we all need praying friends.

The king said to Daniel, &#8220;Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.&#8221;  Daniel 2:47

God revealed the dream and the interpretation to Daniel.  When he shares this with the king the king willingly acknowledges the greatness of Daniel&#8217;s God.  Daniel was promoted and at Daniel&#8217;s request the king also elevated Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.</description>

At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. So the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead. Daniel 1:15-16


Nebuchadnezzar understood the importance of surrounding himself with the best and brightest. He also understood that if he could win the allegiance of the youth they would be a powerful addition in his government.  The captive Hebrew youth would be taught everything they needed to know to be successful but would they remember their God or take on the gods of the Babylonians?

Then he said to me, &#8220;Prophesy to these bones and say to them, &#8216;Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! This is what the Sovereign LORD says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life.
 Ezekiel 37:4-5


When everyone has given up on us and we have given up on ourselves, when the situation is clearly insurmountable and the goal laughable,when the dream God has given us is as dead and as dry as those bones,this is when God  speaks to us. 
&#8220;You will achieve your goal.&quot;

I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice. Exekiel 34:16 

To be a shepherd  is to be a leader.  It is an opportunity to help others.  It is a calling  not to personal  gain and well being but  to protect the flock.  It is the joy of knowing that through your actions the flock has been preserved. </description>

 But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will surely live; they will not die.  None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them.  Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live.  Ezekiel 18:21-22

God, who knows all things, can and does choose to forget. God does not remember our sins when we turn to him.  Does he fail to recall the wrongs we have done?  Is there a lapse in one who knows what has been, what is, and what will be?  That is not the case at all.  God chooses not to reference or to entertain these pass events.

Is there a lapse in one who knows what has been, what is, and what will be?  That is not the case at all.  God chooses not to reference or to entertain these pass events.

Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, &#8220;Live!&#8221;Ezekiel 16:6

The world  celebrates the second chance given to Ted Williams, a native of New York who was living in Columbus, Ohio.  A chance meeting of the formerly homeless man with a reporter from the local paper gave him the second chance he had prayed for.  In today&#8217;s lesson Ezekiel retells the story of  our rescue. How will we use our new opportunity?

I will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them; I will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh. Then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. They will be my people, and I will be their God. Ezekiel   11:19-20

The prophet reminds the people in our passage for today that God can and will restore.  The rebellion, the sins against him can be forgiven.  If His people would obey His commandments and keep his law they will indeed be restored.</description>

And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.&#8221; Matthew 1:21 New King James

The season is about love, love of family, love of friends and most of all the love of a Heavenly Father who offered his only Son for a world hopelessly lost in sin.
