      <title>Out Of Bounds - March 27th 2007</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On the March 27th edition of Warpaint Illustrated’s Out Of Bounds we discuss Kansas City’s latest trade options and rumors. We also answer the following questions from the Warpaint Illustrated message board community. 
 
A) So what do you guys thank the odds are of the chiefs drafting center Samson Satele? Is he likely to be there at pick #23? - guitarman570

B) If Bernard Pollard starts like many think he will do you think he will still play special teams since he brings so much to that part of the game or is the injury risk to high? - Splat420
 
C) Is a blockbuster trade still a possibility, or are we sticking to our guns and hoping for a good draft to fill the holes. - Lamar

D) Any chance the Chiefs trade up to grab Amobi Okoye? or is it more likely they trade down and get more picks? - jarradpage44
 
E) Now that Atlanta has extra picks in the draft have the Falcons contacted the Chiefs about a trade for Jared Allen?  And if he is traded, what can the Chiefs expect to get and should they trade him? - GoDeepBalls  

F) If Alan Branch's stock is falling off as bad as they say it is, is he still a DT the Chiefs should consider, should he fall to them in the first round?
Some say he has the Sims syndrome. - DJO56

This week’s show was sponsored by Affordable Framing and Warpaint Illustrated the magazine.
 
The March 20th edition of Out Of Bounds was hosted by Warpaint Illustrated’s Mike Campbell and Nick Athan. The music featured on this week’s show was perfor med by Isaac Hayes, Skillet, Bob Marley, and P.O.D..  

The Out Of Bounds intro was performed by Dennis “The Voice” Jackson and each show is produced by Warpaint Illustrated’s Mike Campbell.

      <title>Out Of Bounds - March 20th 2007</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On the March 20th edition of Warpaint Illustrated’s Out Of Bounds we spend an hour with Chiefs head coach Herm Edwards during his annual meet the media press conference. We also answer the following questions from the Warpaint Illustrated message board community. 
 
A) There was mention in the previous podcast about acquiring defensive tackles through trades, what defensive tackles could the Chiefs be looking at trading for? – GoDeepBalls

B) Despite the signings of Napoleon Harris and Donnie Edwards could the Chiefs still take a LB day 1 of the draft? - Jarradpage44

C) With Trent Green leaving and Huard and Croyle staying do you feel that Brodie will be able to carry the team next year? - Missouripride

D) Are the Chiefs convinced Chris Terry will be the starting RT next year, or is a guy like Justin Blalock from Texas or Julius Wilson from UAB on their radar? He's not hyped, but Julius Wilson is a powerhouse who can open wide lanes for LJ on the right side and has a great kick step in pass protection. Let's get LJ running right again! - Mobdeuce

      <title>Out Of Bounds - March 13 2007</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On the March 13th edition of Warpaint Illustrated’s Out Of Bounds we discuss Donnie Edwards and his return to the Kansas City Chiefs. We also finish up our three part series of “Coaches As Mentors” with Coach Larry Sanders of Kansas City’s Pop Warner league. Warpaint Illustrated’s draft guru Mike Campbell ranks the top 10 defensive backs in this year’s draft. We also answer the following questions from the Warpaint Illustrated message board community.
 
A) Do you feel with the additions we made in free agency we could possibly win the AFC west this year? - Missouripride

B) Knowing that CB is not one of the top 3 needs this offseason (DT,WR,OL):
What do you think of Surtain and Law? How have they played? For how long are they going to stay around? What is the long term plan at CB? - Aztekchief

C) I think letting Kendall Gammon go is a bad move on the field and in the locker room agree or disagree? - Splat420

Is it possible that letting Trent Green go could cause problems in the lockerroom with some players? - Jarradpage44
 
D) If we traded Jared Allen and switched to a 3-4 how would that effect the young players that were just now starting to adjust to the cover 2? and IMO the key to a 3-4 is that the offense never knows where the blitz is going to come from. So how does Tamba Hali fit in a 3-4? We all know that he can blitz but what is the use of a 3-4 if the same guy is blitzing all the time and on that same note does he even have the athletic ability to drop into coverage? - Guitarman570

There has been rumors the Chiefs could switch to a 3-4. I feel they don't have the right players to pull it off. We are too small on the defensive line, what is your take? - SurtainwegotD

This week’s show was sponsored by Sports Nutz and Affordable Framing.

The March 13th edition of Out Of Bounds was hosted by Warpaint Illustrated’s Mike Campbell and Sly James. Special guests on this week’s show were “Big Jax” Steve Jackson of 610 Sports and Coach Larry Sanders. The music featured on this week’s show was performed by Isaac Hayes, Canton Jones, Dkun Frost, Ruffstyle, Dkun Frost (x2), and Big Ran.

      <title>Out Of Bounds - March 6th 2007</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On the March 6th edition of Warpaint Illustrated’s Out Of Bounds we discuss the Chiefs recent moves in free agency and we look at the top offensive linemen in this years draft class. We also answer the following questions from the Warpaint Illustrated message board community.
 
A) With the free agent pool thin at DT should the Chiefs bring back Ron Edwards or James Reed or both they are not great but there is not much to pick from at that spot in FA or the draft. - SurtainwegotD

B) What do you guys think of us signing OT Damien McIntosh? and do we still need to try and get a OT in the first day? - guitarman570 

C) Will the Chiefs sign both Donnie Edwards and Napoleon Harris? - Are the Chiefs going to just let Mitchell walk? – We combined questions from GoChiefs81 and jarradpage44

D) What do you think of Keyaron Fox? I think he shows tremendous upside and is really sudden in getting to the ballcarrier. Why does he not have more confidence from the fans and coaching staff? Is he not the obvious choice to play the Will spot next season? - mobdeuce

      <description><![CDATA[On the February 28th edition of Warpaint Illustrated’s Out Of Bounds we explore the Jared Allen trade rumors and progress being made in his contract negotiations. This week’s special guest Bryan Davis from All Pro Dad. With the NFL combine in full swing we’ll take a look at the top ten prospects at wide receiver. We also answer the following questions from the Warpaint Illustrated message board community.
 
A) What are the deepest and weakest positions in the draft this year? – Splat420
 
B) If you were the Raiders who would you take at  number 1?  - SurtainwegotD
 
C) Any chance the Chiefs might be more creative this offseason?  Maybe a trade or two to acquire a player or extra draft picks...   - GoBaDeep
 
D) Who are some one-gap DT's that are flying under the radar? I'm interested in Jay Alford of Penn St. and Brandon Mebane of California. Any players that could be picked up in round 3 or later and still make an impact next season? - Mobdeuce
