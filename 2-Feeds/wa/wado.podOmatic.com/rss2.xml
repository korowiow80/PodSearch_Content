You don't need parades                        VERSO
you don't need shallow movements
all you  need is you (2x) 

you don't need it lighter
you might need fire
you will need water 
but you won't need, what??

you don't need liars
you might need lions
you might seek fountains of love

you don't bleed magma
you might sweat clouds
you are part of the parts you don't know at all</description>

You scratch  my body
you mark my soul
you want  me to behave
but you don't me to go&#8230;.

That s what you call society
where noone  is brighting
blind eyes and fallen minds 
Why you do that for?

You may count until billions
But no one of them are mirrors
You get easily lost
Are you a weak bro???

2012 is arising 
and there's always time
to make good things     
synchronizing Love</description>

Where our achievements chill out
storms of unexpected waves
Our inner skin of feelings
which all the flaming eyes
are evolved to their level 

Blooming stories of colorful beings
Are being set underneath the inner layer of perception
winding up ethereal left/right wings
Pluralizing into light inert thoughts of disruption 
Forget it , there's always solutions

Where pretty much all levels reach out
subtle spells are being felt by the limbs
Trading up with the unseen, the secret's fault
Cores of original poems are thrown to the sins

There's always solution for the wind, it crosses itself, whirling up doubts for those
who asks what is happening there????
Just flow your blood into glowing substance thought through our mankind-cosmic-perception</description>

The harmonic tone is sweatin the white dog of ourselves..the being which reign the power of love.completedness, uniqueness..It's time to endure the soothness of our flexible and cosmic atomic heart, Sing the note within, sing the last wall away from you..

Power of love, POwer of distance..Do melt the bulky sphere in-between us..let us play in the field where the invisible are feasible to feel, to touch, to maintain prophetical coming touchs..how sweet is to be at your side, sweet distance...said the wind..

The calling is arising....feel your last sweat, your last dropp of water within....try to rearrange your deepest touchs...your dee pest incandescent bright...your countless breathes, your flawless divine glance.... the trice of our last inspire is our..

In the very spiral medulla, live our multi-faceted beams of creations, maybe coldness and lightness all together, a mommentary stretching, a last deep aim and breathe, ...there goes the last poet and its last ink...running to cover the last part of earth..

The land of breathing is just taking its own position, the posture of 45&#186; directly in the interior sunshine....before the last abysm, everybody think he will disappear...Where? In the fog of visions which he trabscribes to us? Or will he hang on that....

Let The Blue Hand accomplishes thy sphere of healing the outer world of brightness....let the blue hand catalyzes the inner force which has been waiting to come out and soothe thy solid faces....let the hand make the sculptur of the future, the new form.

you with ith kindness on touching the solar flare inside...you with your incandescent scent of love...you can spread out with your magnetic beauty the power of all the lovers when these get together over the calm brook of nowhere....your with your grace.

We are moving towards our inner spin, where all energetic beams are dissolved 
By the dense frequency we expire from the fog of the flint
We are more like clouds than their wound evolved

Rolling over sharp fences, our disarrayed mind clings 
the nearest become the farthest, the rain become stoned 
Then all feelings are set apart, they start to limp
The arrows of loneliness form our love, loved.</description>

Here where humming birds sing the truth receiving the sweat
 of the smelling leaves we have at our inner space-travelling...
here where the wings should be used to fly, even for those
 who can't feel the within air that impulses ourselves farther on

Here, where the sun appears to touch its highest level Shouted 
the last cloud.I've been touched by these suspended airs for a long
 long time...said the last astronaut..And in the middle of nowhere 
someone screeched...&quot;Lost to get even more lost&quot;..

Here in the membrane of nowhere...here where all the glimpses 
become eternal...here where all the holes become the gates..
.here where all the molecules become the ancient part...
here where all the comets teach how to orbit..
.here where all the spheres become the original touch...
.here where all the solar sun become the internal rain
&#8230;here where all the poems become the floating words of the nearest
 future of comprehension&#8230;here where all the breaths become
 the expiring act of freedom&#8230;.here where all the cloud become
 the doors of aiming the unexpected&#8230;..here where all the sweats 
become the non-saying words of new oblivion-language&#8230;
..here where all the dots&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.change the lines&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;
Here in the place of no one, where only the subtle ears,
 can feel the air-interference-being-cosmical-messenger..
.here where all the light waves splash their message from 
the divine ocean of purification.......here where all the lines 
become the unseen....here where all the bridges become the
 sound-harmonical-sweat....here we breath the untouchable

If you are happy, happiness goes out, happiness comes in. If you are celebrating, your breathing becomes a celebration. You touch somebody's hand and you have transformed that man's being -- at least for a moment; you have given him a glimpse, a taste. And of course you are related to many people, in many ways.... They all will start feeling.
Many many people who are selfish are needed in the world -- they will become a small broadcasting station of happiness. And then whatsoever you feel like doing, you do. If you want to serve a beggar, serve. But first things first. Otherwise you cannot serve anybody because you have not served even yourself.
And god is not going to ask you, 'Why was somebody else a beggar, and somebody poor, and somebody dying?' -- no. He will ask you, 'What have you done with yourself? I had given you an opportunity -- has your seed sprouted? Have you flowered? Has your life been a fulfillment? Have you lived?'
If you don't live rightly, your whole energy becomes evil, des-tructive. Have you noticed the interesting fact that if you read the word 'live' backwards, it becomes 'evil' ?
Just spell your life a little wrongly, and everything goes rotten -- it becomes evil.
So live truly, authentically, sincerely -- that is the most funda-mental thing.
I show you life! I don't show you service. Service comes as a shadow. A really alive person is continuously sharing his energy -- whatsoever he has -- because he knows that the more you share, the more you have.
So, that you have to decide, otherwise meditation will not be possible, because meditators are bound to be selfish people.
A meditator is simply forgetting the whole world. There are so many problems in the world -- and he is sitting with closed eyes under his bodhi tree, meditating, watching his navel! He is really not a good person at all! There are people dying -- you should go and help them to live. There are hungry people. There are orphans, there are wars going on -- you should do something! And you are sitting under the tree and gazing at your navel.... Have you gone mad?
But a buddha, a christ, a krishna -- they all flowered in deep silence. Of course once you have flowered, your fragrance can go to the winds, but never before! You don't have anything!
So my suggestion is: first be selfish, then altruism will come on its own accord. Then it has a beauty... a totally different quality. Then you are not a do-gooder. You don't impose anything on anybody. You are a sharer, and to whomsoever accepts some-thing from you, you feel grateful, because he has accepted something from you. Then there is no ego trip.
Just be here, meditate a little, do a few groups.

Touching is very very meaningful. In fact, if the mother has not touched the child very deeply, the child will always remain divided between feeling and thought. Much hugging is needed -- and that has disappeared. Breast-feeding is needed, otherwise the child never starts feeling. Now in the west, mothers don't like to breast-feed because their breasts will lose shape. They don't want to hug too much... touch is almost a taboo.
I was just reading about one japanese sculptor whose works were being shown in New York. The curators of the american museum were very much confounded, because he insisted on one thing which was never heard of before.
He insisted that below each of his statues he wanted a small sign -- there was no trouble; they said that he could have a sign -- but the sign read: 'Please touch' -- statues! He said, 'I won't allow my work if these signs are not allowed in the museum. Then there is no need for my exhibition. Unless somebody touches my statues, how is he going to feel?'
The curators could not believe what this foolish artist was wanting, because in american museums you have the sign, 'Don't touch! Keep aloof!'
And that is not only in the museum -- in life also, touching has disappeared. So this is the problem that arises -- the person has not been touched in his childhood, so he does not know how to feel, because touch brings the feel.
You can devise methods. If somebody says he cannot feel, then let him lie down -- touch him, hug him, let him feel the warmth of the body. Mothering techniques will be needed. If a woman can help, it will be good. If the woman can play the role of the mother, it will be good. Let him move backwards again to his childhood -- when he was small and he was hankering for warmth. Warmth is food for the feeling part -- that's what is needed.
Then he will start moving into emotions. He may start crying... then help him. He may get angry, may move into a tantrum... then help him. But touch seems to be the gateway, so try with touch methods.
