He left Bayreuth in protest and went to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Salzburg Festival</span>. His complete recording of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Die Meistersinger</span> from 1937 is readily available, but the fragment that exists from a 1936 performance, taken from a shortwave radio recording, is very rare.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Most critics will agree that the richest period of Wagnerian singing in The United States took place during the 1940's, and '50's at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. This podcast pays homage to the incredible talent of those historic decades, and features performances by Lauritz Melchior, Helen Traubel, Herbert Janssen, Ramón Vinay, Margaret Harshaw, Otto Edelmann and others. Their voices are heard in live excerpts from Tristan und Isolde, Tannhäuser, and Die Walküre.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[The Bayreuth Festival will open this year on July 25 with a performance of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Der fliegende Holländer</span>, Wagner's first &quot;mature&quot; opera. This production is a controversial modern, Freudian staging of the work that has been greeted with boos year after year since the first time that it premiered in 2003. In this podcast we will listen to excerpts from last year's production (whose cast is almost identical to this summer's scheduled artists) as well as classic and rare examples of past performances of this romantic opera. <br/>]]></description>

Technical difficulties during this period of recorded history prevented British Columbia Records from capturing the audio during an actual performance. Instead, the three acts were recorded between performances in an empty hall. It is a landmark recording, even though there are extensive cuts throughout the work. The cast includes two of the great Wagnerians of the 1920's: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nanny Larsen-Todsen</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gunnar Graarud</span> as the immortal lovers. <br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[For many years, Italian was a second language to Wagner's operas, as scores of Italian singers performed the composer's music in their native tongue instead of in the original German. Based on his Italian performances, tenor <span style="font-weight: bold;">Giuseppe Borgatti</span> became the first Italian heldentenor to be invited to perform at Bayreuth. Although, after the war, most Italian opera houses presented Wagner in German, great post-war artists such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mario Del Monaco</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Renata Tebaldi</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maria Callas</span> became the last generation to sing Wagner's music in Italian.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In our premiere Podcast, we will explore the various ways in which Wagner's last opera, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parsifal</span>, has been performed since it first saw the light of day at the Bayreuth Festival of 1882. In this program we will focus on the way that conductors have approached this musical score. It is our hope that you will enjoy the musical numbers that we have selected for you.&nbsp; My sincere thanks goes out to my friend <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keith Barnes</span> who provided me with the rare musical excerpts that you will hear in this program.&nbsp; This program could not have been done without his help.
