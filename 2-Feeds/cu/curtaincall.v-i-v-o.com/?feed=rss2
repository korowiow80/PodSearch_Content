<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Screen Actors Guild is the nation&#8217;s largest labor union representing working actors. Established in 1933, SAG has a rich history in the American labor movement, from standing up to studios to break long-term engagement contracts in the 1940s to fighting for artists&#8217; rights amid the digital revolution sweeping the entertainment industry in the 21st century.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that there is an ever growing, ever changing landscape of mediums for the screen actor and, hopefully, that always will remain true for our actors working in Texas.  With such dynamic change comes many challenges to protect the actor&#8217;s livelihood, craft, integrity, and product.  SAG stands strong and optimistic about facing these challenges and being an integral part of championing the aspirations and achievements of actors for many more generations.  Meet Linda Dowell, the Executive Director of Screen Actors Guild - Texas Branch. </p>

<blockquote><p><em>If you plan for a year, plant rice. If you plan for ten years, plant trees. If you plan for 100 years, educate your children.</em></p></blockquote>
