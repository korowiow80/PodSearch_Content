Knowing the Public will Suspend Disbelief,
Disregard the Self-Evident, Accept the News Brief,
It's Contract Law -- Legal -- This Shameful Sin,
You Participate in the Scam, Voting Front-Men In" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Gangs would Plunder, Spear and Blade,
Then They'd get Bored, Purpose Forgotten,
Easy Booty Squandered, Bloody and Rotten,

Owning Plants to Make the Spears and Blades,
Encouraged Leaders to War with Neighbours,
Fund Them Too for Interest and Favours,
Paying Youth to Train then Plunder
Easy Targets, Ripping them Asunder,
Banking Families Rose to the Top,
With Power and Riches They did Not Stop,
Hiring Learned Men with Flowing Robe,
They Formed a Think-Tank to Own the Globe,
Private Central Banking to Own Each Nation
Would Keep the Peoples in Subjugation,
It's All been Successful, Anyone can See,
Make Money from Nuthin', The Kicks are Free" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Watch it with Canned Laughter:

"Reading News and Reacting Makes You Feel Bad,
You Must Remember, It's All a Facade,
Authorized News with Anchorman Yapping
Should Leave Us Rolling About Laughing,
Upon Study and Analysis You'll Find,
News is There Strictly to Control the Mind,
It Makes Officialdom Seem More Real
And Bankers Respectable Although They Steal,
Makes Idea Which is Government Seem Like God,
Yet it Exists by Sufferance of the People, How Odd
That the Trick was Carried Out in Broad Daylight,
Fabian-Style it Dominates without a Fight,
By the Time People Wisen from Happenings Local
They're in Meshwork of Treaties in Folder Marked Global" &#169; Alan Watt }--

<description>--{ The Big Idea:
Society's "Evolving" -- But Morality's Dissolving:

Moral Relativity, Eat Each Other for Food,
Nothing's Right and Nothing's Bad,
Old-Fashioned Values Leave You Sad,
So Go On, Share Your Body, Come, Be Vocal,
Monogamous Marriage is Plain Anti-Social,
These Social Changes are Planned in Waves
Which Manifest in Society in Gradual Ways,
About 25 Years of Propaganda, Authorized,
Will See the "New Normal" Materialized,
Big Ideas, Planned Chaos and Resolving
Will Tell You that We're Just Evolving" &#169; Alan Watt }-- 
"Waves" Released to Upgrade Society - Decimation of the Middle Class - Takedown of National Health Systems, Patients Abused and Starved to Death -

"How Far have We Fallen, See and Believe
Or Tune in to TV and Self-Deceive,
Can't Blame Timorous for Choosing the Latter,
Living in Fiction Blocks Things that Matter,

Slaves to Bankers and Those Who Despoil,
At Home and Abroad Uniforms Rule Streets,
Greying Area where Soldiering and Policing Meets,
While Years of Movies have Prepared Us All
For the Crashing as Sovereign Nations Fall,
Hard for Most to Believe the Takedown's Managed
By Globalist Institutions which Manage the Damage" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Moody's Downgrading Countries, Canada - Culture Creators Push the Envelope - Troops and Missiles for London Olympics -

Entertained to Death, No Thoughts Succinct,
Guided to the Point of Becoming Extinct,
But for World Masters the Beat Goes On,
Won't Be Happy till 90 Percent is Gone" &#169; Alan Watt }--

"Quigley, Historian, Council on Foreign Relations,
Gave a Future View of Their Machinations
And how Banks would Fail Because of Vices,
Leading World into Multiple Crises
Which would Be Solved by Unification
Of Regional Blocs Dissolving the Nation,
All Central Banks would then Merge
Under B.I.S. thus Avoiding the Verge
Of Financial Collapse, The World thus Saved,
Would Find through Agreements Laid,
A New Economy would Save the Day,
Depending on Carbon Credits Stashed Away
And Energy Units Bought and Traded,
Until Memories of Cash All but Faded,
The I.M.F. for Defaulters, to Use Severity,
Cutting Welfare, Health Care, Bringing Austerity,
The World Bank to Reign the United Planet,
We've Been Screwed Again, Doggone Dammit" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Who have Power and Influence, Wealthy Too,
They Live in Towers Up Where Birds Sing,
Train and Pass on Power to Own Offspring,
They Needn't be Native to Countries They Own,
But have Centuries of Mastering Art of the Loan,
Excelling in Politics, Rich Relatives Place Them,
Amassing Control Till No-One can Chase Them,
Governments Meet, To Raise More Cash,
Raked from the People, A Mountainous Stash,
Central Bankers Rule, Fat Politicos Follow,
People Keep Voting for a System, Hollow" &#169; Alan Watt }--

You can Bring Out Man's Inhumanity to Man:

"The Military Grabs Youth Who're Trained to Kill,
Too Young for Wisdom to Equate Kill with Chill,
Every Year There's a Few Million Souls,
Turn 18 for Recruitment or Face the Dole,
Unemployment is Good for the Military Machine,
With its Honed Bonding Tactics to Make Men Keen
On Killing the Enemy, Bang-Bang You're Dead,
Unlike Playtime, You don't Head Home to Be Fed,
And the People You Kill, Each One You Slaughter,
Could Be Your Father, Mother or Daughter,
Once You're Out and Support is Gone,
Pharma Quietens Nightmares of Lives Gone Wrong,
Hi-jacked Before Manhood for Political Game,
Geopolitics and Slaughter Leaves Them Insane" &#169; Alan Watt }--

"The Rich Got Richer Pulled by Allure,
The Rest Downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor,
It's All Run by Same Boys, The Money Cartel,
Who Loan to Nations, Finance Wars of Hell,
Progress is What They Call Total Control
Over Necessities for Life, Always the Goal,
Interdependence Means You Completely Depend
On a Global Market to Borrow &amp; Lend,
Out of the Dollar Downgrade Comes Arrival
Of Laws Legitimizing Corporations for Survival,
That's Your Continuity if You Please,
Basic Necessities? Get Down On Your Knees" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Showering Goodies, P.C, Cell Phone, iPod,
Why it Brings the Whole Big World Together,
You're Never Alone in the Sun or Bad Weather,
Without the Net, My, You'd have to Rehearse
On How to Interact with Real People, Converse,
Your Mind Would Need Exercise, Never Been Used,
The Shock of Reality Might Leave You Confused,
Lack of Trivial Data Could Drive You Mad,
Thinking Feels Strange, Frightening and Sad,
On the Other Hand, Think of the Learning to Do,
Finding Your Gadgets were Spying On You,
You're Typed, Categorized, Completely Predictable,
You Could Be Charged with Something Indictable,
It Seems Santa's Technology is Weaponized,
And the Truth is Orwellian-Speak for Lies" &#169; Alan Watt }--

In Order to Lead You into World of Fiction:

"Celebrities are Used by All Different Groups,
Because Public is Trained to Go for Looks
Of the Rich and Successful, They Must Know More
Than the Grovelling Followers Down on the Floor,
Oh Foolish Man, You Wish to Be Told
By All Your "Superiors" Who'll have You Sold,
Rather than Study, and Make Up Own Mind,
Then Set Out to Encourage Others to Find
That the Future's Been Told by Many an Author,
From the C.F.R., IMF with Big Cash in the Coffer,
They Calmly Lay Out Plans without Drama,
How They Pick Presidents, Like Front Man Obama,
And Have Them Sign All Sovereignty Away
As They Dream Totalitarian Dreams of the Day,
When Intellectuals and Science Rule from U.N.,
Over a Depopulated World of Modified Men" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Heavy Aerial Spraying (Media Keeps Quiet), Allergies and Chronic Bronchitis Now Normal - 
Depopulation - Fluoride and Chemicals Added to Water - Hormonal Alteration - Premature Menopause Increasing. 
The Computer give to Monitor You - Microsoft and Bill Gates (Made a Star) - 
Patriot Radio set up Initially by CIA - Public Conditioned to Follow Celebrities - Counterintelligence, The Circus, Fiction and Fantasy.

Not So Straight as I of Course,

Have Worked this System in for Years,

But Even the Blind Can Feel the Rush
Of Well-Laid Plans' Stealthy Hush
And a Thousand Laws and Rules a-Speeding
Past the Heads of Those a-Leading,
Implemented Before the Ink is Dry,
No Opposition From Those Paid to Try,
The Bulk of Society is Left Bewildered,
Not Knowing the News is all Con &amp; Filtered" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Complete Domination Their Ultimate Goal" &#169; Alan Watt }--

"The U.N. is Here With Annual Rant,
Saying World's Poor Women Want Abortions But Can't,
At Least an Agency Stood Up to Refute,
Saying Third World Wants General Care From the Loot,
Problem is Big Agra has All the Food,
They're Upping Prices for Their Own Good,
So Food Itself is Used as a Weapon
To Reduce Populations and Teach Them a Lesson,
The First World, A Term Now Obsolete,
Is Plummeting, Swaying on Bankrupt Feet,
Yet Government Through Treaties Gives More Dough
To International Agencies, Money Trails Go
Mostly in Pockets of These Charity Leaders,
A Few Cents Get Through to Bottom Feeders,
The Shield of the Scammers is "No Moral Shame",
Psychopaths are Rewarded in U.N.'s Hall of Fame" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Mushrooms are Bending, Beginning to Stoop,
Along with New Cons Such as Carbon Tax
Which Will Flatten Many and Break a Few Backs,

Look Out! Here's Another Shitload of Muck" &#169; Alan Watt }--

To Turn Colour to Green I Think I'd Try

Yet, I Love to Travel, It's in My Soul,
I'd Be Marooned Without Any Coal,
Then in Winter, I Think I'd Feel
Frost and Ice Encase My Steel,
Then in No Time, I'd Start to Rust,
My Lovely Body Would Turn to Dust,
Oh! To Hell with That, Stoke the Boiler,
Get the Grease and Fetch the Oiler,
I'll Follow the Rails to Where I'm Led,
A Warm Belly of Coal, Feeling Well-Fed,
The Con-Game of Greening's a Terrible Plan,
So I'll Follow My Senses, I Think I Can" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Where Governmental Decrees Cause Him Strife,
Always Fearful Down to His Very Soul,
Unconscious that Fear Keeps Him Under Control,
Fear of Unemployment, He Strives at Work
To Always Be Good, No Task He'll Shirk,
Fear of Living and Fear of Dying,
Fear of Unknown Keeps Him Trying,
Insured Against Fire, Sickness and Pain,
Yet Helpless When Economy Goes Down Drain,
Raising to Boiling Point All Those Fears,

Caused Brisbane's Suburbs to Turn to Wetland:

"South East Queensland Australia Under Deluge,
Thousands of People Seeking Refuge,
Hit by the 40-Year Cycle of Flood,
Whole Urban Areas Now Water and Mud,
After the Flooding Back in '74,
Saner Minds Planned, Said No, No More,
They Got Busy with Slide Rule Making Plans
To Build Levees and Run-Off Dams,
T'was Stopped by "Warmists" Garrett and Flannery,
Who Wanted Desalination for Water in Cannery,
"The World's Warming, It Will Rain No More",
These Two Fools Made Lots of Folks Sore,
Yet They'll Justify Themselves with Ego and Swank,
As Thousands of Homeless Swim to the Bank" &#169; Alan Watt }--

And as for Marriage, That Quaint Old Thing,

Panic of Aging, Mouth Like a Sturgeon?
Don't Worry, It's the Age of the Plastic Surgeon,
As for Men, They're Put in Their Place,
They're Second-Class in the New Human Race,
Unless Rich and Famous, On the Big Screen,
Or at Least a Look-Alike, Fit to Be Seen,
Each Light Fading in a Retirement Home,

<description>--{ For as Long as We Can Spread the Word,
The Pen is Mightier than the Sword:

"So Much Wrong with World, Some of it Rattles
On Your Nerves or Spirit, So Pick Your Battles,
Government Panics are On Cue, On Time,
Don't Follow the Rabble, the Nasty Sign,
They Go the Way Their Masters Expect
And Riot on Command by Those Who Direct,
Stay Calm, Avoiding Those Who Lead,
For Many are Paid to Start the Stampede,
So in Times to Come Don't Be Easily Led,
Be Guided by Instinct and Use Your Head" &#169; Alan Watt }-- 
Cold Harsh Winters for Britain, Chronically Wrong Met Office "Warm" Weather Forecasts - Social Agenda of Climate Change/Global Warming Con - 
European Commission (later EU) Set up under "Free Trade" (Economic Law) - Denmark, Carbon Trading/Value Added Tax Fraud. 
Vaccination Exemptions and Forms, Canada and U.S., Exemptions on Medical/Religious/Conscience etc. Grounds. 
Inaugurations and Ceremonies of Royalty, Lords' Ermine Cloak (going back to Nimrod) - Prince Charles and Prince Philip. 
Process of Bringing People up into Understanding a Higher Level of Reality - Coming Food Shortages - Selective Breeding and Genetic Enhancement - 
China Owning U.S. Debt, Offers to Bail Out European Nations.

Have as Good as Admitted a New Global Bureaucracy
To Administer All Trade, Transfer of Wealth,
Bringing Down "Richer Nations" to Third World Health,
Civil Servants will Be in Charge of All World Food,
Asking for Seconds -- You'll be Fined, Being Rude,
Sustainable Development is All About You,
How You Exist, Think and Work, All You Do,
Most won't Mind Since Mind's Never Used,
Those Whose Reality is TV Viewed,
So Don't Waste Time on Fools, Teach the Wise
With Sparkling Consciousness Still in Their Eyes" &#169; Alan Watt }--

But in Time You'll Agree Just Where it's At,

Without Conscious Knowing of Where it Leads,

Your Mind is the Battlefield, Your Defences Fell,
Ongoing Propaganda is Shaping You Well" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Never in the Field of Banking Speculation,
Has So Much Been Owed by So Many

Now They're Under the Boot of the IMF,
You'd Swear in Control's the Very Devil,

Never Chased History Down Nook or Hollow,
And So for Him, Events Come as Surprise,
He's Managed by TV that Never Tells Lies,
Mind's Guided by Experts, All Saying the Same,

Their "Sacred Green" Banner will Be Here to Stay" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Finding a Meat Bone Will Bring on Carnage,
In this Orwellian World One Never Relaxes,

Don't Light a Candle After Energy Curfew
Or Carbon Police with Tasers Will Light Up You" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Using Fronts to Foist on the Mass,
Tyranny of World Socialist Elite Upper Class" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Indoctrinating Children Under "Education",

Would First Rise Against Others, Wars of Hate,
Revolutions, Most Social, would Win the Day,
Then the Nation-States would "Wither Away",

Creating Human Compliance, Interdependence,
The Dominant Minority would Rule Humanity,

Controlled Society Dominated by Elite Group - "Continuous Education", Updates - Geopolitical Chessboard.

"What a Wicked Web Our Masters Weave,
Building Empires Which, When They Leave,
Come Crashing Down When Cash Withdrawn,
Top Money-Men of the Devil's Spawn,
They Set Up Shop in Continent New,
Prepare Their System Ruled by Few,
Ensuring Schools Teach Young to Parrot
"I Will Succeed if I Chase the Carrot",
Then War is Called and Off They Go,
Because Their Masters Tell Them So,
They Prepare the Conquered to Be Dominated
By These Moneybags Who are Truly Hated,
Teaching Generations to Be Meek as Lambs,
So Triple-Chinned can Pull Off the Money Scams
With Their "Science" of Economy, Confusion of Lies,
They See Owning the World Become Their Prize" &#169; Alan Watt }--

"Whodathunk You'd Ever See SWAT Teams Raiding Farms,
Guns Drawn, Attacking at Dawn Before the Cock Alarms,
They're Combat-Ready Hit-Men, Members of That Ilk,
They Cause Harm to Any Farm with Organic Milk,
Animals Know They're Coming, Nervously They Mutter,
Nursing Sows and Milking Cows Cross Legs to Save the Udder,
They are America's Finest, Protecting Citizens from Food
That Makers Sell to Keep Them Well, Nutritiously so Good,
Pour Blessings on the FDA, Praise Them on Your Knees,
Crawling Through Mire into the Byre, Peppering the Cheese
With Automatic Weapons, They Earn the Reputation
Tough and Fearless, Leaving you Tearless, Waving Legislation,
God Save America from Each Black-Cladded Goon,
Pull Their Socket, Pop 'em on a Rocket Heading for the Moon" &#169; Alan Watt }--

<description>"Cyber Telephone Wars?"
Sorry for the repeat of last night's show (on RBN).
RBN was unable to reach me again, so I called them as I have been doing for the last week with same problem.
Got the bumper music each time, then it would go back to the ringing sound.
Eventually board-op e-mailed another number and I was able to get through to them successfully for last few minutes.

<description>--{ Slim's the Fashion when You're on Ration:
Listen and Take Heed for Your Own Good,
Eventually Austerity Boils Down to Food:
 
"Hundreds of Trucks, Fleets, Daily Do Arrive,
Bringing Food to Cities So Millions will Survive,
All Kinds of Goodies, Veg Carefully Planted,
Cared until Grown, Things We Take for Granted,
After Years of Plenty, Most'll be Off-Guard,
Rationing'll be Introduced, Times will be Hard,
Austerity Means Plummeting, Near to Poorer Nations,
Where Corrupt Governments Put Down Confrontations,
Under Guise "Equality" the Rulers have a Ball,
Champagne Parties, Good Food, They Do have it All,
Public is Conditioned for All these Things to Be,
Yet in Hedonism, Each Says "They Don't Mean Me",
The Domesticated Herd Ignores Each Warning Sign,
"Politicos will Fix it, it's Their Job, Not Mine,"
Thin Veneer of Civilization will Rip Away so Quickly,
Riots, Theft and Murder, Gruesome and Sickly,
Presently They Scoff, Preferring Actor Celebs Yappin'
To Bringers of Bad Tidings, Warning what will Happen" &#169; Alan Watt }--

<description>--{ The Big Society:
Corp-Philanthro CEOs, Smart, Dripping Piety,
Oversee Rulership of New "Big Society":
  
"Some People Think Very Slowly, Some More Quickly,
A Minority Divulge the Future, Such as Carroll Quigley
On Behalf of CFR, He said the Future Would Go
To a Feudal World System Run by Corporate CEO,
Philanthropist Club is a Cartel in Control of Billions
Thrown Around Stock Market, Influencing Minions,
Formed to Participate in New Governance Variety,
With NGOs and "Them That Knows" in The Big Society,
Democracy's too Cumbersome, Humouring the People,
Governance is Swifter, Since People are Now Sheeple,
Oh Sure, Some will Bleat, Demanding This or That,
The Ministry of Love'll Handle any Uncouth Spoiled Brat,
We'll be Taught Austerity by Steroidal Social Workers,
Faces Sour, Flushed with Power, Chasing After Shirkers,
Serving World Masters, Respecting Those who Rule 'em,
Thought Police with Electric-ease Hunting Those who Fool 'em,
It's All Done so Smoothly, None Dare Think Rebel !
Sheeple, Plugged-in Optimists, Shepherded to Hell" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Nothing They're Trying Not Already Done,
Thinking of Wonders throughout Lifespan?
Each "Discovery" on Cue as per the Plan,

We're Fumbling Along, So as to Deceive,

With its Wars, Degeneracy, Not Indecisive,
And Our Masters, Creatures of High Breeding,
They Know Exactly Where it's All Leading,
Done Countless Experiments, Data Availability,
As We're Trained Expertly in Sustainability,
Lose Control? The Elite's Never in Doubt,
Most will Comply with Ne'er Ever a Shout,
Behavioural Studies have Proven Such Gain,
Most'll Volunteer to be Sucked Down the Drain" &#169; Alan Watt }--

<description>--{ New Saviour Cometh:
Voting for Politicians Fronting for Tacticians:
  
"Angry at the System -- Showing Upset Behaviour?
No Doubt You'll Vote for the Next Groomed Saviour,
The One Who'll Fix Everything, (Ahh --You do Sigh,)
Leave Cash in Pocket for More Goodies to Buy,
Forget the Petitions You could've Wrote,
It'll All Come About by Signing Your Vote,
But Wait, Who are These Lines of Grand Appointees
Who Quickly Make Clear You'll be Down on Knees,
With Inflation, More Taxes, Government Intrusion,
New Agenda for Living, Adding to Confusion,
Your Saviour's on Holiday, He's Not Available,
Appointees in Charge Say You're Not Sustainable,
You Were Just Laying Back Thinking Problem Solved,
New Party's Like Old One, They Kinda Revolve,
Better Dig In, Stock Up, Maybe Go Dig a Moat,
Wait 'Till Next Con-Man Cometh, So You Can Vote" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Look at Body Shapes, Their Stare, Their Blink,
Self-Preservation Destroyed (For Their Own Good),
Victims of Injections and GMO Food,
Sure to Keep Voting for More of the Same,
Same System, Same Parties which Play the Game,
Always Looking for the Hero Making Right Passes,
While the Armchair Warriors Sit on their Asses,
Calmed by Promises and Things Unobtainable,
The U.N. has Ruled Their Lives Unsustainable,
All these Treaties and Payments to Foreign Powers
Need to Go Up in a Bonfire, Hurrah to Spark Showers,
Throw in the Debt, It's All a Deception,
Issue Debt-Free Money, Make the Correction,
A True Hero Would be Killed, That's No Lie,
For Severing Life-Blood of Bankers' Supply,
Such a Nation Would be Attacked, by Globalist Hate,
They'd Turn U.N. Guns on Such a "Rogue State" " &#169; Alan Watt }--

<description>--{ From Under Cover Authority's Creeping,
Assuming the Role it's Been Seeking:

"Authoritarianism is Creeping, Straining
At the Bit, Sleeping Public's in Training
For the New Society Coming in to View,
Where Agencies Rule Herd, That's Me and You,
Democracy's Too Slow They Say, People Fighting,
And These Rules and Rights the Public's Reciting,
To Go Forward the Rulers Must Be a Tower
Whose Orders are Issued, Obeyance to Power,
Rights and Freedoms Just Get in the Way,
Public Must Be Taught to Fear and Obey,
This Totalitarian System Over World is Spread,
And Already has Made Protesters Dead,
In North America the Worst Yet to Come,
Much Will Be Suffered Before its Done,
Heartaches, Poverty, Violence, Fights,
Then a Generation Ignorant of Having Rights" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Apathetic Public, Beaten, Hardly a Hiccup,
Displays of Opulence in Austere-Preaching Times,
Not in the Make-Up of Our 'Guardians of Dimes',
We've to Tighten Our Belts While Theirs Expands,
Paying Debt with Resources Makes Barren Lands,
Strange -- Public Servants Reigning Over Their Masters,
Like Thousands of Royals Leaving Wake of Disasters,

The World Better for Us 'Cos 'We Can Eat Cake' " &#169; Alan Watt }--

As We're Trained for Austerity -- Clever and Neat:
 
"Projections of Calamity from Masters to Ground,
Everybody Look What's Goin' Down,
Post-Industrial Sustainability -- Not Pleasant,
Supposed to Co-Operate and Become the Peasant,
The New Middle Class is Academia and Science,
Chosen by Masters to Go On in Alliance,
While Cities Decay, Monuments to the Past,
Competing Gangs and Drugs Finish the Task,
Terrorism's the Cover to Manage the Fall-Out
Of Planned Money Crash and Turn About
From Industrial to Service to Sustainable Austerity,
Overseen by Terrorism-Police and Military Severity,
Will We Go Down Fast or Compliant and Slow,
Till Greenies Grow Up Eating Beans they Grow,
They'll be Taught No Past, Just Able to Count
Rows of GMO Beans, Watch them Sprout,
'Course they won't Need Many to Feed the Master,
Their Numbers will Drop with Disease and Disaster,
Plus they'll be Sterile from Jabs so they're 'Healthy',
Breeding Only Allowed for Educated and Wealthy,
In the Meantime They Say Mobs will Riot and Steal,
'Change is Good' Now Explained, Here's the New Deal" &#169; Alan Watt }-- 
Elites' Survival of Catastrophes, Wars and Falls of Empires - Industrial Cities/Nations Built up and Taken Down, Moved Elsewhere - Detroit, U.S. -

Permanent Military Bases built in Middle East / Worldwide - New Supercities built for Elite - Continuity of Government - "Austerity" for Post-Consumer Society - 
"Experts" Fear Global Social Unrest - Greece - Rigged Structure of Control through Money and Debt - Economic Bubbles / Stock Market - EU, "Austerity Measures", Rationing - 
Marxist Left-Wing Protests, Use of the Mob, Seizure of Power - Service Economies (Produce Nothing) Cannot Last - GATT Treaty, China Funded into Existence by the West - 
Internal Armies in Western Countries, to deal with "Civilians" - UK and US Defence Department projections for Next 30 Years - Transition Period into Completely New Society. 
Most People Look for a "Leader" - Deviant Creation of the Psychopath - Serial Killers and Politicians Share Same Traits.

Praise 'Money Heaven' and The Banker King,
With Golden Cherubs that Silver-Tongued Sing:
 
"Birth Pangs of Crisis Cross Every Border,
Economic Disorder of the New World Order,
Bringing the Next Phase of Consolidation,
Global Governance and the End of the Nation,
Culmination of Wise Men's Machinations,
Famine, Wars, the Cause of Vexations,
For Mr. Moneybags, There is No Appeasement,
His Front-Men Sign Each Global Agreement,
Of All the Flags that Could be Unfurled,
It's That of the Banker Rules the World,
All Peoples to Suffer His Age of Austerity,
'cept the Banker who Sidesteps, Nimble Dexterity,
We'll All Be in Want of Things We Need,
Now the Banker is King, Salivating His Greed" &#169; Alan Watt }--

The World Can be Conquered by Lending them Money,

Peter-Pan Adults Accept with Hardly a Mutter,
Children Brainwashed into 'Each One's a Brother,'
Who'll Punish 'The Oldies,' Decadent Generation
Which Ravaged the Earth Leaving Desertification,
We in Rags, Big Brother Will Give Gestures Symbolic,
Cheap Package Deals, Pastime Electronic" &#169; Alan Watt }--

<description>--{ Ruling Technique is Clear,
Keep Public in Fear:
"An Arm of Government, Mainstream Media,
It Can Take Statistics and Drum Up Hysteria,
Few Gang Shootings in Toronto Become 'Year of the Gun,'
Few Stabbings in U.K. is 'More Slicing to Come,'
Fear and Terror Pushed Year After Year,
To Keep Public Timorous, Grovelling in Fear,
More Cops are Hired for Crime's Sticky Wickets,
Who're Sent on Highways to Hand Out Tickets,
Now Latest Decree Is Beyond the Pale,
Non-Violent Burglars to Be NOT Sent to Jail,
Why is Law on Thievery Negated this Time?
Politicians Have Affinity with Partners in Crime" &#169; Alan Watt }-- 
Media is under No Obligation to Tell the Truth - Public Dished Out Daily Trivia and Nonsense - Plato's Cave - Programming through Fiction.

Govt. Cutbacks and Higher Taxes, Riots in Greece - King James' "Fresh Air" Tax, Now Carbon Tax (Bags of Nothing). 
Official Secrets Acts, Information Classified 50+ Years - French Town used in Covert CIA LSD Experiment, blamed on Ergot of Rye Hallucinations etc. - Soldiers (and Public) used as Guinea Pigs. 
"It Takes Two to Tango", Authorities and Public - Standing Up on Mass and Saying NO, Enough - Club of Rome, Democracy Bypassed, CFR.

Keep People Stupid:
"Small-fry Told to Work to Accumulate Wealth,
United Governments and Banks Steal it Back by Stealth,
So Forget the Old Dictum 'He Who Scrimps, Saves,'
The New World Order Rules a World of Slaves,
And as We're Depopulated, We Slave as We Must,
Whilst Taxed to the Grave, Ground into Dust,
Sheep are Oblivious, with Play, Dance, They're Fooled,
Never a Thought of Direction, They're Guided, Ruled,
Thinking a Few Windmills and Panels are Salvation,
To Supply All Energy Used by Each Nation,
Running Slaves is Easy, Masters Know Their Tools,
Treat Ignorant as Children, Blind Trusting Fools" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Western Countries Paid for Industrialization of China. British System of Socialized Healthcare - Deaths in Hospitals, Patients Refused Treatment - Cutbacks in Medical Care.

'Me' Squeal Like Pig When They Come for Me,

We'd Avert Our Gaze if They Crucified a Saviour,
Don't Be Involved, Look to Own Salvation,
They Might Leave You Alone in Your Degradation" &#169; Alan Watt }--

A Goldmine for Shysters with 'What If?' Conclusions,

Claiming Things that Cannot Be Proven,
For Every Wonderful Thing We Like to Believe,
There's a Clever Shyster Ready to Deceive

Historians Like the Past All Neat and Tidy,
Giving Too Much Credence to Rich and Mighty,
Optimists Say, 'No Aliens, World's Perfect and Bright,'
The Pessimists Fear the Latter are Right,
Take the Best from Belief and to All Good Luck,
Enjoy Glib-Tongue Shysters, But Don't Be a Schmuck" &#169; Alan Watt }--

"If You Could Design Reality to Suit Your Special Taste,
You'd Never Dream Up This One, Scary, Scary Place,

On a Roll Since 2001, For Dominance and World Control,
Pat-Downs, X-Rays, Anal Probes, Scary, Makes You Fidgety,
Now it's Bomb-Breast Implants, Do Bombshells have No Dignity?
The U.K. Aviation Minister said, 'We Shall Discourage Travel,'
Like the Old Soviet Union, the Purpose Starts to Unravel,
All this Talk of Terror, Force is Means to Deal With it,
No Attempt at Finding Cause, Where Sides at Tables Sit,
Or is Big Biz. and Plunder the Reason for this War,
To Be De-Classified in 100 Years, We'll Find then What it's For" &#169; Alan Watt }--

<description>--{ Seekers, if True, will Find the Few:
"Few Folk Wish to be One within Kind,
Preferring Absorption in Worldly Mind,
Yet Each Begins with Boundless Vitality,
Unique and Seeking Own Individuality,
Then School, like Chickens in a Coop,
Standardizes by Consensus of the Group,
Insecure Teen Pressure, Need to Belong,
Causes Adaptation, Ignores Each Wrong,
Submerged Individuality then Tries to Appear,
Often Re-submerging with Peer-Pressure Fear,
Morning Hills are Moistened with Crystal-Clear Dew,
Climbers of Such Hills are Always the Few" &#169; Alan Watt }-- 
Advertising and Media, Coordination to Standardize Minds of Public - Military-Industrial / Consumer Goods Corporations - Politically-Correct News -

Marketing Strategy, Your "Personal" Computer - ID Card Promotion in Britain - Mandatory Identification Cards, Canada - Highways fitted for Roadblocks - Checkpoints for "Criminals". 
Evidence Disproving Man-Made Global Warming Erased from Wikipedia - Bogus "Hockey Stick" Graph - Medieval Warming Period Eliminated. 
Information Overload and Trivia leading to Short Attention Spans - Children's Cartoons - Creation of Perfect Soviet Man, Destruction of Individuality - 
Brain-Computer Interface Implants - Chips for Programmed Zombies. 
Job of Censorship Committees to "Push the Envelope" - Programming through Entertainment, Comedy, Cartoons - "The Simpsons" movie - Idea Implantation through Fiction.

<description>--{ U.N. -- Achieving Their Goal by Conquering Soul:
"Geopolitics Culminates in World Socialist Society,
Run by Bureaucratic Levels of Every Variety,
Rule by Terror and Fear, to go on Forever,
Propaganda and Statistics used as Lever,
War's Not to be Won, as Orwell said,
But for Elite to Retain Power, Long After We're Dead,
They'll Alter Your Genes, Capture Your Soul,
Complete Dictatorial Power is their True Goal,
The Dead will Adapt, as they have Down through History,
Consumed with Pleasure and Trivia, Life's a Big Mystery,
Never Knowing Huge Dramas are Part of the Plan
To Conquer Free Spirit, the Right of Each Man" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Of a New World Order, Oh So Happy and Bright, 
At Least for Followers, That's One of Their Goals, 
But the True Secret's Held in Inner All Souls, 
Through Intrigue and Conflict, Destroy All Nations, 
With Academic Technique Give Indoctrinations, 
Till the Masses Believe Imperative Sustainability 
And Serve Their Masters with Perfect Docility" &#169; Alan Watt }--

Once Realized, Taking Only the Cream

While Sterile Masses, Left to Fate 
Gradually Die, Leaving 500 Million a Paradise,

<description>Thanks to listeners' response, the Medi-Natzis released Martha to her home. 
Mental competency evaluation head-games attempt to bully Martha into acceptance of hospice. 
Attempt to bully Butch into visiting hospital-possible evaluation. 
Medi-business taking orders from United Nations definition of good citizen=producer-consumer. 
Martha's doing well. Home care visits. 
Hospital's reaction to inundation of phone calls and postcards, the elderly's right to pass the rest of their years as they see fit. 
Big business versus human rights. Separation of the generations through indoctrination-elderly portrayed as all senile children. 
Elderly indignation viewed as mental agitation. Ever-broadening definition of terrorism to include political incorrectness and "inflexibility of opinions." 
Warning to all young men from all ethnic groups to beware of: leaders advocating violence = probably CIA or MI6. 
Gold and silver to be "thrown in the streets" - Selective Christianity. Fake "firemen" SWAT team - Water pistols? 
Thanks to listeners who acted to release Martha.

<description>Listen to a special blurb: Alan speaks with Butch Chancellor, of Missouri (USA). 
Butch's bedridden wife Martha was taken to a hospital this week, after a neighbor was asked, by Butch, to call an ambulance.
He wished Martha to be checked for a behavior change in the last few days. The neighbor phoned 911.
This call brought an unexpected SWAT Team into their home, where Butch was detained and questioned (by armed black-clad men), before the "real" ambulance came. 
Calls to the hospital give continuously changing information about Martha's condition, and false allegations have been inferred upon Butch.
Social Services and hospital "policies" may prevent Martha from ever returning home again. 
Hear how an emergency visit to the hospital, eleven years prior, left Martha paralyzed and unable to speak.
Butch speaks of the events leading to and after the ordeal; it's a story that must be heard.

<description>Red Ice Radio Write-Up: We continue our talk with Alan Watt about the colonization of the Americas. We talk about the Knights Templars 
and their connection to a pre history high civilization and that different cultures visited America long before Christopher Columbus officially discoverer the continent. 
We talk about the conquistadors Pizzaro and Cortez and their encounters with the Maya, Aztec and Inca Civilizations. We address the consequent collapse of the 
South American empires, the gold that was stolen and the anticipation of a white man (Quetzalcoatl) returning. We talk about the possibility that history is "scripture", 
a "game plan" that is being played out. So in regards to South America, is it possible that someone planted the myths that later became their religions? What is the 
connection between the Vatican and the Templars? Did the conquistadors really burn all the Mayan scriptures or did they keep it? So did the Templars or a pre-Templar 
organization really construct the Pyramids in South America? What about the Pyramids in Egypt? Tune into this fascinating interview.</description>

<description>Red Ice Radio Write-Up: We continue talking with Alan Watt and go into an entirely different avenue. We kick things off talking about 
the Priory of Sion, Plantard, the Knights Templar and the Grail Hunters and this leads us into some fascinating areas about DNA research, the Human Genome 
or is it the "Gnome" project. What is the goal of this scientific process? We talk about the elimination or exclusion of the feminine. We talk about the strife for 
eternal life and the aspiration for creating life. We also talk about the Merovingians, the Carolingians and the Cathars. Towards the end we talk about the 
recent news concerning the unearthing of the 1918 Spanish Flu by Canadian scientists.</description>

<description>Red Ice Radio Write-Up: Alan Watt is back for his monthly visit and we begin to talk about the origins of socialism and communism. We get into the occult 
aspects of this apparently atheistic political ideology. What is behind the hammer, the sickle and the star? We talk about the Revolutionary movement 
and tie this together with Promethean ideology and Lucifer the "rebel"? We talk about Guy Fawkes and also about the burning of London in 1666 and 
the consequent the reconstruction of the city. We get into the destruction of "the new Atlantis", which is America, and how this ties into the creation of 
cultural chaos and much more.</description>
