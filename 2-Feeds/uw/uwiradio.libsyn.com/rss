			<title>What You Can Learn and Use from the Oscars to Build Your Business</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://uwiradio.libsyn.com/what-you-can-learn-and-use-from-the-oscars-to-build-your-business]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Hollywood has always fascinated me. In fact, when I first moved to San Diego in </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">the year 2000, I would drive up to Hollywood at least once a month, just to be </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">in the energy of that city. I'm not very good with picking out famous people, </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">but apparently I'd run into a number of them without even realizing it. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">That wasn't why I was going there, it was because my first love in life is </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">photography, video, and film, so naturally, being in the film capital of the </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">world has its appeal. But that's not what I want to share with you today. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">One of the best lessons I learned is simply that "success leaves clues." Tony </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Robbins shared that message again and again and over the years, I've used it to </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">pay very close attention to the most successful people I meet. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">In my mind, I "reverse engineer" their success and pick out the turning points, </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">the "a-ha!" moments, and look for the very visible clues that tell me how they </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">got where they are today. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Last night while watching the Oscars, I was thinking about those people who were </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">being rewarded for their work. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Are they really any different from the rest of the population?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">What did they do to get where they are today?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Who helped them along the way?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">What strategies did they use to become the best?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Are there lessons we can learn from them?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Are their things we can take away from what we saw last night in order to be </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">more successful in our chosen fields?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">The answer to all of these things is YES! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">And, I'd like to share of few of these ideas and strategies with you right now!</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>What would your life look like if you were debt-free?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText">Imagine having <strong>zero balances</strong> on all of your credit cards, and being able to watch your fortunes grow month after month.</p>

			<title>Motivate and Inspire Your Prospects, Never Sell Them!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://uwiradio.libsyn.com/motivate-and-inspire-your-prospects-never-sell-them-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Think about this for a moment. What if, instead of engaging <br/>in hard-selling, you could instead motivate your prospects <br/>to buy from you without any arm-twisting, exaggerating, or <br/>manipulation? </p>
<p>Would you be interested in knowing how it's done?</p>
<p>For many business owners, selling is the hardest part of <br/>being in business. Most people do everything they can to <br/>avoid it, yet it's the most effective way to make more <br/>sales. </p>
<p>What if selling wasn't so hard? </p>
<p>What if you could actually build your business without the <br/>need for any hard-selling at all?</p>
<p>In my own business, I did start out hard-selling my <br/>customers until I discovered a better way. For more than the <br/>last 15 years, I no longer hard sell anybody for any reason. </p>
<p>And clients that buy from me get value, they buy for their <br/>own reasons, not mine, and I get almost zero refund <br/>requests. </p>
<p>This is the right way to build a successful business!</p>
<p>Enjoy the show!<br/>Robert Imbriale<br/>'The Motivational Marketer'</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Discover the Best Business to be in Now! </p>
<p>There's always great benefit to any trend, be it good or bad. </p>
<p>While you might be wondering what in the world is going on right now with the economy, gas at $4 or more per gallon, and companies laying folks off by the dozen, you might do better thinking about <br/>how to prosper from it all instead. </p>
<p>This downturn in our economy is a TREND, and in any trend you can either get swept away OR you can get on the leading edge of it and reap the benefits from it all. </p>
<p>Think about a surfer - in California they are always in the water waiting for that next wave. If they hit the wave just right, they get to ride it all the way to the shore. If they wait too long, they completely miss out on the ride and have to sit and wait for the next wave to appear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Right now is the best time for you to position yourself to BENEFIT from the changes that lie ahead for us all. </p>
<p>There are a few choice professions that will actually GROW substantially over the next few years, and that is where you want to be right now. Instead of sitting back hoping that all will be well for you, why not get ahead of the trend and ride it like a champion instead?</p>
<p>This week's show is very different from past shows in that I've got a very SPECIAL GUEST that is here to share some of her thoughts on what I think is the most exiciting of all professions - coaching!</p>
<p>Who better to talk about coaching with than the &quot;Guru of Coaching,&quot; Terri Levine!</p>
<p>Sit back and be ready to hear much more about coaching as we &quot;peel back the curtain&quot; and get a look at what coching is really like from the inside!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Marketing and The Law of Attraction</p>
<p>I know you've been hearing about the Law of Attraction for a while, and <br/>probably have formed your own opinions about it. </p>
<p>What I want you to know is that you can indeed use the law of attraction in your marketing<br/>efforts to boost response, increase sales, and grow your business quickly!</p>
<p>In this edition of The Motivational Marketing Show, I share a simple<br/>4-step process for using the Law of Attraction in your business. </p>
<p>And you'll also hear how I've used it successfully in my own business to <br/>find new consulting clients, more speaking engagements, and even a new<br/>personal assistant!</p>
<p>You'll also hear how you can have me on your team to help you implement<br/>what I talk about in this show into your business in the most effective<br/>way possible. </p>
<p>Grab a pen, sit back, and listen!</p>
<p>Remember, if you love what you hear, tell your friends!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://uwiradio.libsyn.com/the-law-of-attraction]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>After reading yet another e-mail on how the Law of Attraction<br/>is not real and does not work, I decided it was time to set<br/>the record straight. </p>
<p>Now, the fellow who sent the e-mail was indeed well-meaning, and I'm <br/>sure he has his reasons for writing about Law of Attraction as he<br/>did. And I do indeed disagree with him and in this edition<br/>of The Motivational Marketing Show, I tell you my thoughts<br/>on the topic. </p>
<p>What you'll find is that the Law of Attraction is at work for you <br/>whether you believe in it, know what it is, or even care about it <br/>in any way at all!</p>
<p>This show gives you some solid examples of the Law of Attraction <br/>at work in your life, as it has been since the dawning of time. </p>
<p>It may have been the topic of the hot movie &quot;The Secret&quot; and the <br/>topic of much conversation, but it's anything but a new concept. </p>
<p>Those who know how to harness the power of the Law of Attraction <br/>will get what they want in every area of their lives, no <br/>questions asked. </p>
<p>Those who fail to embrace the fact that this law of attraction is <br/>indeed at work in their lives will continue to get more and more <br/>of what they don't want - more bills, more debt, more pain, more <br/>suffering, etc. </p>
<p>Tune in to this edition of the show and listen to some common <br/>sense on the subject of The Law of Attraction!</p>
<p>Remember, if you love what you hear, tell your friends!</p>
<p>Enjoy the show!</p>

			<title>What Would YOU Grab First if a WildFire was Licking at Your Door?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://uwiradio.libsyn.com/what-would-you-grab-first-if-a-wild-fire-was-licking-at-your-door-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is something to be said for being cool and calm in the face of a fierce <br/>wildfire. While many people were just that way about what to grab out of their homes <br/>before evacuating, what would you grab?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it took more than an entire day for a team of 5 to move into our <br/>home, and with just two of us with 5 minutes to spare ahead of the flames, what do <br/>you grab?</p>
<p>You'll love my answer to this question if you're a business owner of any kind, and it <br/>should make you think about what you'd do if you were faced with losing it all. </p>
<p>While we always hope never to face those kinds of decisions, it may be a good idea to <br/>put your own plan in place right now in case you ever have to. </p>
<p><br/>Listen Now!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>No matter how good your marketing message might be, it will <br/>ultimately fail if nobody sticks around long enough to get your <br/>message. While this is indeed common sense, the challenge we face <br/>on the Internet today is that people make up their minds in <br/>seconds to as whether or not they will stay on your site or not. </p>
<p>Not convinced. Sit down, remain calm, then open up your web <br/>statistics and have a look at how long the average visitor <br/>actually spends on your web site. </p>
<p>And you're paying how much to get them there in the first place?</p>
<p>You may want to listen to this week's show to get a few good <br/>ideas on what you can do to get people to reconsider leaving your <br/>web site too soon. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you've read my book, Motivational Marketing, you know that the <br/>book is filled with great examples of how to really use <br/>Motivational Marketing and the Emotional Motivators to double, <br/>triple, and even quadruple your business. </p>
<p>This week, you'll join me as we take a tour of a web site that <br/>uses one of the five emotional motivators, and does a really <br/>great job of it too!</p>
<p>The site in question offers a lot of great examples of how to <br/>build a web business that gets plenty and new and repeat traffic <br/>and routinely ranks in the top 7,000 on Alex.com.</p>
<p>If you know anything at all about Alexa.com, you know that <br/>ranking in the top 7,000 of ALL the web sites on the Internet is <br/>no small thing to do. </p>
<p>What's really neat is that this web site is NOT doing anything <br/>that's out of your reach, which makes it an even better example <br/>for you. And something else you might want to know too - a good <br/>portion of the content on this web site is NOT created by the <br/>site owner!</p>
