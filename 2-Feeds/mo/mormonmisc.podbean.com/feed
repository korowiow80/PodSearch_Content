<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">James White, a long time opponent of the LDS Church, was a guest this week on a local SLC radio program. Some years ago, White and I discussed a number of topics on about a dozen programs. On this Mormon Miscellaneous program I commented on some of his views this week. He claims that there are wide divergents between the Christians and Mormons. Of course he asserts that Mormons are not Christians. Here, I point out that there are many wide differences between many Christians; Mormons and non-Mormon Christians.</span></p>
<p>Following a are some of the comments:</p>
<p>LDS often say Jesus is subordinate of the Father</p>
<p>Bible - Is Jesus God?; Is God the Father of our God</p>
<p>Old Testament - does not suggest that any man on the earth will be God</p>
<p>There are wide divergents among the non-LDS Christians</p>
<p>Changes in the KJV made by JS</p>

		<itunes:summary>Christians vs Mormons; Christians vs Christians; Mormons vs Mormons

James White, a long time opponent of the LDS Church, was a guest this week on a local SLC radio program. Some years ago, White and I discussed a number of topics on about a dozen programs. On this Mormon Miscellaneous program I commented on some of his views this week. He claims that there are wide divergents between the Christians and Mormons. Of course he asserts that Mormons are not Christians. Here, I point out that there are many wide differences between many Christians; Mormons and non-Mormon Christians.

Following a are some of the comments:

LDS often say Jesus is subordinate of the Father

Bible - Is Jesus God?; Is God the Father of our God

Old Testament - does not suggest that any man on the earth will be God

There are wide divergents among the non-LDS Christians

Changes in the KJV made by JS

<p>We discussed the 1611 King James Bible which Haxton claims was superintended by God and is God&#8217;s word in English. We pursued the question of which KJV is God&#8217;s word since it was 6000 verses longer in 1611 than the editions published today. Haxton denied this. We discussed the modern translations, I argued for their value, he contended that they contain the word of God, but they are not the word of God as is the KJV.</p>
<p>We also discussed his stated view that salvation comes by grace through faith, nothing more and nothing less. In this discussion Haxton did, however, express his view that repentance and obedience to God&#8217;s commands are required for salvation.</p>
<p>The controversial topic of the Trinity was considered briefly.</p>

		<itunes:summary>D&#x38;C Facts and History #1
I raise a number of questions I will address regarding the history and content of the Doctrine and Covenants including additions and deletions in various editions.

 


Joseph Smith's selection for the D&#x38;C in 1835 and 1844 differed from that of Orson Pratt and Brigham Young in 1876. Does this fact raise any questions?
Book of Commandments.
1835 Doctrine and Covenants
General Assembly called to vote for or against the D&#x38;C
Early publication of some revelations.
Comments on D&#x38;C 76, 121, 109, 129-131, 89
Procedure regarding acceptance or rejection of revelation.

<p>A letter of Joseph Smith on polygamy is well-known to many LDS as an article on Happiness. It was written such that its meaning would be hidden to those who do not know its historical context.</p>
<p>Its history includes a stir among LDS in Nauvoo in 1842, significant confrontations, exchanges in the newspapers, denials, defections and information on the early, private promulgation of polygamy.</p>
<p>Its content gives important insight into Joseph Smith&#8217;s views and even includes a revelation. Further, it is an excellent example of a literary form which clearly teaches an impressive message on the surface, but then buried beneath the surface is a deeper message comparable to occasions when Jesus taught something seemingly simple but then invited his disciples to think deeper with the phrase &#8220;he that hath ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those interested in a copy of the Joseph Smith letter discussed which I have placed in a parallel column with D&amp;C 132 send your request to <a href="mailto:van.hale@k-talk.com">van.hale@k-talk.com</a> and I will send it to you by email.</p>

I addressed several points touched upon in recent talk shows and in follow-up emails regarding testimony, faith, belief, knowledge, sure knowledge.I have been a little surprised at the divergence of opinion on what I think should be simple definitions and in the fervor of those who subscribe to these different positions.What does it mean to have a testimony? Does that mean a sure knowledge?

The LDS sources on this are extensive. We have good reason to be more precise in our use of words. When someone declares "I know..." I think there is value in that phrase having a precise meaning.

I read a number of sources which support my conclusion that belief and knowledge in our religious terminology are different. I am comfortable with being a believer and declaring my convictions as belief rather than knowledge.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Massacre at Mountain Meadows</strong> </p>
<p>One hundred twenty emigrants passing through southern Utah on their way to California in 1857, at a time when the U.S. Army was on its way to Salt Lake City, unannounced and unexplained by President Buchanan, were massacred by Mormons and Indians, the Mormons taking the lead. Much written on the topic has been marred by bias, agendas and selective use of inadequate sources. Three LDS professional historians, with the input and review of many, LDS and non-LDS, representing a wide range of perspectives, have written what promises to be a masterpiece of historical research and writing.</p>
<p>Ron Walker and Glen Leonard, co-authors of this long awaited book <em>Massacre at Mountain Meadows</em>, were my guests. We discussed their rendition of this event, including new sources and perspectives, resulting from their extensive research on this controversial topic. The third co-author, Rick Turley, Assistant LDS Church Historian, was in Mexico.</p>
<p>Further, the authors spoke of their determination to examine the known sources which pertain to the topic and to seek out previously unknown sources. They explained the position of Church leadership to give them free access to all historical holdings of the Church and that their writing and conclusions would not be supervised nor reviewed by Church authorities. The book is published by Oxford University Press which has a reputation for publishing works which meet a high professional standard. The first printing of 10,000 was sold out before the official release, the second printing will not supply the current demand and a third printing is already planned.

They include: How what we know exists came to exist?; The universe: how? why? for what purpose? Is it the result of some intelligent design? Is it managed by a higher intelligence? Is all an accident or is it for some divine purpose?</font></p>
<p>Joseph Smith presented some of his views against slavery in the platform on which he was running for President. I discussed other sources in which we find Joseph Smith&#8217;s views.</p>
<p>I engaged in some debate with a caller over Joseph Smith&#8217;s views. I insisted that there has been no evidence, from sources produced before Joseph Smith&#8217;s death, that he believed an ancient curse was to be continued in the Restoration. And further, I presented some from a substantial body of sources that he believed that all should, regardless of ancestry, be considered equal, a view he was vigorously advocating at the time of his death. The caller, in his argument, ignored the statements of Joseph Smith written and published before his death, and rather relied upon a late reminiscence which alleged that Joseph Smith realized that he had been in error declared that the blacks were, in fact, yet under an ancient curse.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0000ff" size="5"><strong>An Alleged Prophet</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Art Bulla has been claiming for almost 3 decades to be the successor of Joseph Smith holding the highest priesthood keys, being the Lord&#8217;s annointed and even superior to Joseph Smith and his successors, claiming to be One Mighty and Strong, to set an apostate LDS Church in order.After many years of discussion on the air and in person with Art Bulla I have decided to address his claims directly by talking about some basic principles of Mormonism introduced by Joseph Smith and endorsed by his successors, but ignored or denied by Bulla. I have tried hard to understand his claims.</font></p>
<p>Basically, he claims that his having been ordained a 70 gives him the highest priesthood keys, eventhough he was excommunicated from the Church. He argues that a person need not be a member of the Church to hold the highest priesthood keys. In fact, he claims that the highest keys are held by a council known as the Council of 50, organized by Joseph Smith in 1844. However, to be a member of this Council, according to Bulla, holding the highest priesthood keys, a person did not need to believe in Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, the Bible, Jesus or God.</p>
<p>Bulla claims he received the highest priesthood keys from the Church, which he asserts has been in apostasy for some time. I have asked him a number of times to trace the highest keys, those to be held only by one man at a time on the earth, from Joseph Smith to himself. He has never gone beyond Joseph Smith, Brigham Young or John Taylor. He weaves a claim of revelation; a pre-existent foreordination; ordination to a 70 before his excommunication; extension of the priesthood to the blacks in 1978, resulting, as he alleges, to a latter-day apostasy of the Church; a total disregard for the vision of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, of great success and expansion of the Church worldwide, diminishing this vision to that of one prophet holding the keys, with one disciple, no Church or priesthood quorums.</p>
<p><strong>I discuss such Mormon Basics as:</strong></p>

		<itunes:summary>An Alleged Prophet

Art Bulla has been claiming for almost 3 decades to be the successor of Joseph Smith holding the highest priesthood keys, being the Lord's annointed and even superior to Joseph Smith and his successors, claiming to be One Mighty and Strong, to set an apostate LDS Church in order.After many years of discussion on the air and in person with Art Bulla I have decided to address his claims directly by talking about some basic principles of Mormonism introduced by Joseph Smith and endorsed by his successors, but ignored or denied by Bulla. I have tried hard to understand his claims.

Basically, he claims that his having been ordained a 70 gives him the highest priesthood keys, eventhough he was excommunicated from the Church. He argues that a person need not be a member of the Church to hold the highest priesthood keys. In fact, he claims that the highest keys are held by a council known as the Council of 50, organized by Joseph Smith in 1844. However, to be a member of this Council, according to Bulla, holding the highest priesthood keys, a person did not need to believe in Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, the Bible, Jesus or God.

Bulla claims he received the highest priesthood keys from the Church, which he asserts has been in apostasy for some time. I have asked him a number of times to trace the highest keys, those to be held only by one man at a time on the earth, from Joseph Smith to himself. He has never gone beyond Joseph Smith, Brigham Young or John Taylor. He weaves a claim of revelation; a pre-existent foreordination; ordination to a 70 before his excommunication; extension of the priesthood to the blacks in 1978, resulting, as he alleges, to a latter-day apostasy of the Church; a total disregard for the vision of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, of great success and expansion of the Church worldwide, diminishing this vision to that of one prophet holding the keys, with one disciple, no Church or priesthood quorums.

I discuss such Mormon Basics as:
The highest priesthood keys were to be invested in the Church.

The President of the Church is the President of the High Priesthood.

All who leave the Church or are excommunicated hold no priesthood keys or authority.

There is to be no modern-day apostasy of the Church.

The meaning of D&#038;C 85 on the "one mighty and strong."

		<itunes:summary>Polygamy &#038; the Utah Attorney General 

What follows is a very interesting discussion I had a couple of years ago on the topic of modern polygamy in Utah with my guest was Mark Shurtleff, the Utah State Attorney General. 

Unfortunately, the digital recording failed and this comes from a rather poor tape recording made by one of my listeners. 

But, because of the topic's timeliness, I am posting this episode of the Mormon Miscellaneous Worldwide Talk Show to my podcast site. A.G. Shurtleff gives considerable information and insight into events which currently are widely discussed daily in the national news media regarding the recent raid by Texas law inforcement agents of the polygamous community known as the FLDS, or the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

More than 400 children were taken from their homes and families and placed in State custody. What will be their future and how Texas, Utah and other states will deal with polygamy and other forms of non-traditional illegal sexual relationships has captured the interest of Americans. 

Attorney General Mark Shurtleff and I were joined by callers in the discussion of: 
Modern polygamy in Utah;
Utah laws regarding sexuality;

Various definitions of statutory rape;

Legal age for sexual activity;

Legal age and conditions for marriage;
The impossibility of aggressive prosecution of infractions by polygamists for religious reasons and those who break the laws, but without religious motivation;

The issue of First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom verses the anti-polygamy laws;

Which laws the State will enforce and which it will not;

Differences among polygamists - independents and those in polygamous religious groups;

The hypocritical public attitude toward polygamy in contrast to that of children who are the result of irresponsible promiscuity;

The prospects of anti-polygamy laws being argued before the Supreme Court;

The 90 page Polygamy Primer prepared by the Attorney General's office to clarify issues pertaining to modern polygamy in Utah;

Warren Jeffs' abuses

Warren Jeffs' distortions of polygamy as practiced by LDS Church members in the 19th century;

Welfare fraud;

Incest;

Women desiring to leave polygamy.

<p>The question, Which Bible should we read? is a question many have never considered - many who insist that the Bible is God&#8217;s complete, final and infallible word. The fact is that a consensus has never been reached even among mainstream Christianity as to which of the many, many Bibles of Christianity today and throughout Christian history is <strong><em>THE</em></strong> Bible. The history of the Bible is very complex.</p>
<p>The following is but a very small list of aspects related to its history: Scrolls, manuscripts, texts, codex, collections, councils, creeds, disputed books, apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, canonization, translations, Septuagint, Law/Prophets/Writings, Samitaritan Penteuch, Latin Vulgate, Masoretic text, Textus Receptus, Marcion, Jerome, Wycliffe, Tyndale, Luther, theological motivations, Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi, lost scripture, ancient translations, modern translations, textual criticism.</p>
<p>I briefly discuss a number of topics from this list and give some of my personal reflections and conclusions drawn from many years of personal interest in the question, Which Bible?</p>

<p>I believe Old Testament is an important collection of religious writings in the Judeo/Christian/LDS tradition. The fact that there has been substantial development within the Judeo/Christian/LDS tradition has resulted in substantial neglect of the Old Testament by most LDS and other Christians.

<p>1. There is not now, nor has there ever been a consensus as to what belongs in the canon of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>2. Every list or collection of Old Testament books is a selection from a much larger body of ancient Israelite and Jewish writings.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0000ff" size="5"><strong>Strange Elements of the Old Testament</strong></font></p>
<p>I comment on the Ensign article on Joseph Smith&#8217;s journals, the Joseph Smith Papers project and the new Priesthood / Relief Society manual for 2008.I received an email asking a question about God sending lying spirits to the prophets to deceive the king. In addressing this issue, I briefly comment on several approaches to the Old Testament.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Rejection of the Old Testament by many early Christians.</p>
<p>2. Modern approach of a majority of Christians who ignore all but a few selected passages and stories from the Old Testament.</p>
<p>3. Another approach is that the Old Testament is a collection of ancient religious writings but not the inspired word of God.</p></blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging the strangeness of the Old Testament is essential to understanding it.</p>
<p>1 Kings 21</p>
<p>There are a number of passages which present seemingly strange Divine characteristics. I list a few:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 Kings 22:9-23 (causes prophets to lie);</p>
<p>Ezekiel 14:9 (deceives prophets);</p>
<p>Amos 3:6 (the cause of evil in a city);</p>
<p>Ezekiel 20:25-26, 31 (gave laws and judgments which were not good, including child sacrifice);</p>
<p>Hosea 9:15-16 (hates and curses);</p>
<p>Deu 20:10-11, Lev 25:44 (commands and condones slavery);</p>
<p>1 Sa 16:14, 18:10 (sends evil spirits to influence men);</p>
<p>Ex 32:14; Deu 28:68; Am 7:3, 6; Jonah 3:9, 10; Jer 26:13; 2 Sam 24:16 (changes his mind).</p>
<p>I read and commented on Numbers 5:11-30 - Procedure for determining a wife&#8217;s faithfulness. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="5">Callers and Email</font> </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>1. A frequent caller who paints Mormonism in the blackest fashion. He insists that the only interest of the General Authorities is in collecting money from its members. </p>
<p>2. This caller has written a novel which incorporates much of this author&#8217;s personal doctrinal views.</p>
<p>3. A frequent caller strongly criticized my view of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>4. A frequent caller discusses the question of whether God would deceive the prophets and questioning my doubting of the literalness of parts of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>5. A frequent caller condemns me for not believing the flood account literally, but insists that it is appropriate for him to discard to refuse a literal interpretation of the Genesis account of creation.</p>
<p>6. This caller was applying some wording from the book of Revelation to current events in America&#8217;s southern states.  </p></blockquote>

		<itunes:summary>Strange Elements of the Old Testament

I comment on the Ensign article on Joseph Smith's journals, the Joseph Smith Papers project and the new Priesthood / Relief Society manual for 2008.I received an email asking a question about God sending lying spirits to the prophets to deceive the king. In addressing this issue, I briefly comment on several approaches to the Old Testament.
1. Rejection of the Old Testament by many early Christians.

2. Modern approach of a majority of Christians who ignore all but a few selected passages and stories from the Old Testament.

3. Another approach is that the Old Testament is a collection of ancient religious writings but not the inspired word of God.
Acknowledging the strangeness of the Old Testament is essential to understanding it.

1 Kings 21

There are a number of passages which present seemingly strange Divine characteristics. I list a few:
1 Kings 22:9-23 (causes prophets to lie);

Ezekiel 14:9 (deceives prophets);

Amos 3:6 (the cause of evil in a city);

Callers and Email 
1. A frequent caller who paints Mormonism in the blackest fashion. He insists that the only interest of the General Authorities is in collecting money from its members. 

2. This caller has written a novel which incorporates much of this author's personal doctrinal views.

3. A frequent caller strongly criticized my view of the Old Testament.

4. A frequent caller discusses the question of whether God would deceive the prophets and questioning my doubting of the literalness of parts of the Old Testament.

5. A frequent caller condemns me for not believing the flood account literally, but insists that it is appropriate for him to discard to refuse a literal interpretation of the Genesis account of creation.

6. This caller was applying some wording from the book of Revelation to current events in America's southern states.

<p><font color="#0000ff" size="5"><strong>Diversity of Mormon Views</strong></font></p>
<p>In this episode I discuss several differing views of LDS leaders, including Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, B. H. Roberts, Joseph Fielding Smith and Bruce R. McConkie on the topic of God&#8217;s omniscience.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith and Brigham Young emphatically declared that the most spiritually advanced in this life will know but little of even the basics of the plan of salvation at the time of their death. From this perspective, they established an LDS position which persists - that we have no carefully worded creed which a person must accept to be LDS. Both of them advocated searching, pondering and speculating upon concepts, even mysteries. This, of course, resulted in a religious climate among the Saints where there would naturally be a diversity of views on even some basic topics, even regarding God and the Godhead.</p>
<p>I discuss the differences between Orson Pratt and Brigham Young on the whether God, or the Gods, progress in knowledge. Their differences resulted in published statements of the First presidency, and the First Presidency and the Twelve, to the Saints and comments in sermons by several General Authorities in the 1860s.   More recently, Joseph Fielding Smith and Bruce R. McConkie, in the 1950s and 1960s expressed their views on the subject.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="4">Email Participants</font> </strong>(the phone system went down and thus there were no phone participants)</p>
<ol>
<li>Mormons are so busy chasing after other Gods that they cannot know the one God of the Bible. I comment on this position.</li>
<li>A long email from a frequent participant denounces pursuit of our religious belief through research and study. He claims that we must turn to him; that he will tell us the truths we need to know; and that we are to pray to God, not for further knowledge, but rather, only for confirmation what this self-proclaimed prophet has declared. In my response I wandered off on to the question of, Who is Jehovah in Mormon belief in the 19th century in contrast to belief in the 20th century?</li>
<li>Another email further argues that Mormons do not believe in the God of the Bible and cannot, therefore, be Christians. The God of the Bible is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. I, of course, respond.  </li>

	I read and responded to an email which asserts that the Bible teaches there is one God expressed in three persons. I read several Biblical passages which draw a clear distinction between God and Jesus and others which refer to the existence of a number of gods.
	A caller addressed himself to this topic and we further discussed the question of the deity of Jesus as related to the New Testament.

Joseph Smith acknowledged that his views were progressive - that is, his views of God differed on a number of points from 1829 to 1844. From a number of sources I have developed the following approximate timeline for the development of Joseph Smith&#8217;s views of God.

<li>Jesus is God. 1829-1844</li>
<li>Jesus pre-existed as the Son. 1829-1844</li>
<li>In some way Jesus is the Son and also the Father. 1829-1833</li>
<li>The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are one. 1829-1844</li>
<li>The Father is a personage of spirit 1829-1835 or 1834-1835</li>
<li>The Holy Ghost is not a personage, but rather the mind of the Father and the Son. 1834-1841</li>
<li>The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit awaiting the opportunity to take upon himself a body of flesh and bones. 1841-1844</li>
<li>The Saints have the potential to become gods and goddesses. 1832-1844</li>
<li>Our God and Father has a God and Father. 1841-1844</li>
<li>The Father went through mortality and has a resurrected body of flesh and bones like that of Jesus. 1841-1844</li>
<li>There is an Eternal God of all other Gods. 1838-1841</li>
<li>There is one God above another with no end. 1841-1844</li>
<li>There was a grand council of Gods to plan and create this world. 1839-1844</li>
</ol>
<p>I discussed the four main points of the King Follett discourse of 7 April 1844.  </p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" size="3"><strong>Participation by Phone and Email</strong></font></p>
<ol>
<li>I respond to an email condemning Brigham Young and his view of Adam as God. Did he believe in a different God than the God of the Bible?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Development of Joseph Smith's

Joseph Smith acknowledged that his views were progressive - that is, his views of God differed on a number of points from 1829 to 1844. From a number of sources I have developed the following approximate timeline for the development of Joseph Smith's views of God.

	Jesus is God. 1829-1844
	Jesus pre-existed as the Son. 1829-1844
	In some way Jesus is the Son and also the Father. 1829-1833
	The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are one. 1829-1844
	The Father is a personage of spirit 1829-1835 or 1834-1835
	The Holy Ghost is not a personage, but rather the mind of the Father and the Son. 1834-1841
	The Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit awaiting the opportunity to take upon himself a body of flesh and bones. 1841-1844
	The Saints have the potential to become gods and goddesses. 1832-1844
	Our God and Father has a God and Father. 1841-1844
	The Father went through mortality and has a resurrected body of flesh and bones like that of Jesus. 1841-1844
	There is an Eternal God of all other Gods. 1838-1841
	There is one God above another with no end. 1841-1844
	There was a grand council of Gods to plan and create this world. 1839-1844

I discussed the four main points of the King Follett discourse of 7 April 1844.  

Participation by Phone and Email

	I respond to an email condemning Brigham Young and his view of Adam as God. Did he believe in a different God than the God of the Bible?
	Why are there two different trinities in LDS thought: Elohim, Jehovah and the Holy Ghost; and, Elohim, Jehovah and Michael?
	Comments on Brigham Young's position that there would be differences on God if saints ancient and modern where gathered together.
	Does not the Book of Mormon present the idea that God could cease to be God?
	A caller condemns me for not accepting his views about Brigham Young's teachings regarding Adam. I explain my preference for Joseph Smith's view over that of Brigham Young on this point.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I considered this question from notes I prepared two years ago for a formal debate on the topic with a Calvinist minister. My approach is more as a discussion than a debate due to the fact that four issues must be resolved before we could properly debate the question, &#8220;Is the God of Mormonism the God of the Bible?&#8221; They are:</p>
<p>1. Which Bible?</p>
<p>2. What is the Biblical concept of Deity?</p>
<p>3. What is the Mormon concept of Deity?</p>
<p>4. Are we referring to the identity of God or to divergent views of God&#8217;s attributes and actions?</p>
<p>Callers and Email:</p>
<p>1. The reasoning behind non-LDS Christian arguments that Mormons are not Christians; divergent concepts of salvation.</p>
<p>2. A caller and I disagreed on two main points: That the belief that Jesus and Satan are brothers demeans Jesus; and that the belief that Jesus created Satan out of nothing, flawed such that Jesus knew Satan would fall and become the author of evil, makes Jesus the creator, or the one responsible for all evil.

In this episode I compare and contrast Mormon concepts of Deity with those terms used in the historic Christian debate to identify some of the many views argued during the past 1800 years.

<p>In this episode I compare and contrast Mormon concepts of Deity with those terms used in the historic Christian debate to identify some of the many views argued during the past 1800 years. I define and discuss, as related to Mormon views, such terms as: trinitarian, unitarian, binitarian, monotheism, polytheism, tritheism, henotheism, modalism, monarchianism, homoousian, homoiousion.</p>
<p>My interest in the history, evolution and debate of these ideas has lead to my attempt to define the Mormon concepts of Deity.  Due to the fact that there have been developments of doctrinal concepts from 1829 to the present, in this episode, I focus on the first period, 1829 to 1844, the ministry of Joseph Smith.</p>

In this episode I compare and contrast Mormon concepts of Deity with those terms used in the historic Christian debate to identify some of the many views argued during the past 1800 years. I define and discuss, as related to Mormon views, such terms as: trinitarian, unitarian, binitarian, monotheism, polytheism, tritheism, henotheism, modalism, monarchianism, homoousian, homoiousion.

My interest in the history, evolution and debate of these ideas has lead to my attempt to define the Mormon concepts of Deity.  Due to the fact that there have been developments of doctrinal concepts from 1829 to the present, in this episode, I focus on the first period, 1829 to 1844, the ministry of Joseph Smith.

Callers:
What is monarchianism?

What about Brian Hale's comment that polygamy was a commandment from 1852-c.1890 after which, for some 14 years, it was an option rather than a command, before it was discontinued entirely. What was the second manifesto of 1904?

This caller falsely claimed that I am a Darwinist and thus cannot believe in God. I have denied his allegations several times previously. He proclaimed his belief that Adam is God.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="5">God as a Close Personal Father</font></strong></p>
<p>For me personally, one of the most powerful concepts taught by Joseph Smith concerns the relationship between God and man - the concept resulting in the Primary song, &#8220;I am a child of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>For me personally, one of the most powerful concepts taught by Joseph Smith concerns the relationship between God and man - the concept resulting in the Primary song, &#8220;I am a child of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesus encountered a Jewish society wherein the current views of God, the result of several centuries of evolution, placed a giant gulf between God and man. To first century Jews, God was transcendent. In theology this term refers to the degree of difference between God and the physical world and mankind. The higher the concept of transcendence, the greater the gulf between God and man. Many have, and do, believe God&#8217;s transcendence is such that, to man, God is beyond all comprehension; completely unknowable; that he is &#8220;wholly other;&#8221; he is the Creator, and we are the creation.</p>
<p>Jesus eradicated this gulf by declaring a close relationship between God and man unheard of in ancient Israel. Jesus spoke of God as even more anthropomorphic than that found in the most ancient Israelite belief before the several centuries just preceding the Chrisitan era when the concept of a transcendent God developed.</p>
<p>During his ministry Jesus introduced God as his personal Father, and the personal Father of his disciples. His view was not just that God is our personal Father, but that he is our close personal Father to be addressed with a term no Jew would have considered using for God.</p>
<p>Along the way, the early Christian church discarded Jesus&#8217; view and restored the concept of transcendence, even to what may well be the ultimate degree. During Joseph Smith&#8217;s efforts to restore primitive Christianity, he re-introduced, with great clarity, the concept taught by Jesus, including a new dimension.</p>
<p>The research of highly respected modern non-Mormon New Testament scholars, and modern translations of the New Testament have provided considerable insight into Jesus&#8217; unique view of man&#8217;s relationship to God. I discuss the research published about 50 years ago which uncovered this lost concept of Jesus and startled many modern Christian scholars. I also present a number of striking sources including a number of modern renderings of relevant New Testament passages from some of the modern translations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Creator / creation relationship between man and God.</p>
<p>Father / son relationship between man and God.</p>
<p>Potential to transcend the position of a creation to be a son with the potential to become like our Father - God.</p>
<p>Jesus&#8217;s use of the Aramaic word &#8220;Abba&#8221; for God, his Father and our Father.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphic concept of God.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="3">Callers and Email:</font></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Is not Book of Mormon theology trinitarian; discussion of different interpretations of the trinity and several Book of Mormon passages.</p>
<p>This caller is moved more by the idea of our relationship to God as a Father than as God as a Creator, like the relationship of a painter to his painting.</p>
<p>More on the theology of God in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>How is Christ the Creator.</p></blockquote>

<p>My guest was Brian C. Hales, author of Modern Polygamy and Mormon Fundamentalism. We discussed this timely, diverse and little known topic. The question is often asked, Who are Mormon fundamentalists and what do they believe. The answer is far more complex than most would think. Hales has brought together a significant body of material to address this question. Many personalities and events have lead to the great diversity which exists among the many factions included by this broad term, &#8220;Mormon fundamentalism.&#8221; We discussed many points of interest and importance in understanding the history and beliefs of this category within the Mormon tradition.</p>

He claimed that he was called to be an apostle in a stake meeting in North Carolina in 1976. He claimed that no LDS President since Wilford Woodruff has been the Lord&#8217;s anointed; that the keys were somewhere out in the wilderness from 1890 to 1978; and that he (Art) appointed someone to give him the keys and the Lord&#8217;s anointing.</p>

Authority issue, if one man holds the keys, as taught by Joseph Smith, who now holds those keys?

Lorin Wooley claimed that a priesthood organization exists outside of the LDS Church with superior authority.

Authorship of the Manifesto.

Interpretations of the Manifesto: was it a revelation, the result of a revelation or a trick by Wilford Woodruff to deceive the U.S. Government.

Issue of cohabitation after the 1890 Manifesto.

Problems with the claims that the keys had been passed to Lorin Wooley and others in an 1886.
Callers and Email:

I discussed my rather extensive exchanges last month with participants on this popular anti-Mormon website. I made every effort to follow their rules which allow anonymity, do not allow defense of Mormonism and require posts to be respectful. I confined all of my comments to historical sources pertaining to the wording and intent of a sentence included in the endowment ceremony from 1845 to 1927.   I was denied anonymity and falsely accused of defending the LDS Church. The sources I provided on this point of history, which has nothing to do with basic Mormon claims, were completely ignored, and after being attacked with a steady barrage of insults and disrespect, my hands were tied (namely, I was refused access), and this mob proceeded with their assassination.My point, which I stated and re-stated many times, is that there is a substantial body of 19th century sources, Mormon and ex-Mormon, which say that the endowment included instruction for the participants to pray for God to avenge the blood of the prophets, and also a prayer to that effect. 

Some ex-Mormons had published and testified that the endowment included an oath by participants for themselves, not God, to avenge the blood of Joseph and Hyrum. I insisted that to come to a reasonable conclusion on this matter, all source material should be gathered, sifted and assessed.

<p>A long time listener sent me a scathing email which he has published on the internet on exmormon.org, a rabidly anti-Mormon board, where I am refused participation. He claimed that I am a &#8220;puppet&#8221; and apologist for the LDS Church. I responded to his false charge by reviewing the 27 year policy of my talk show with comments on the involvement of LDS leaders in its content. Also, I listed and commented on some of my personal views, including those where I diverge from the Mormon mainstream. This is my candid effort to explain where I believe I fit in Mormonism, specifically expressing my attitude toward the Church.</p>
<p>I read this email and also my written response. The author of the email called in and we discussed and disagreed on a number of his points. We discussed:</p>

Response to an ExMormon Critic

A long time listener sent me a scathing email which he has published on the internet on exmormon.org, a rabidly anti-Mormon board, where I am refused participation. He claimed that I am a "puppet" and apologist for the LDS Church. I responded to his false charge by reviewing the 27 year policy of my talk show with comments on the involvement of LDS leaders in its content. Also, I listed and commented on some of my personal views, including those where I diverge from the Mormon mainstream.

<p>Steve Mayfield joined me to discuss our recent expedition to Page, Arizona with forensic document expert, George Throckmorton to examine a lead scroll  found in January of 2002 in a small 2 room fort built at Lee&#8217;s Ferry (named after John D. Lee) on the Colorado River in 1874. The scroll purports to be written by John D. Lee, 11 January 1872, in which he states that Brigham Young gave orders for the Mountain Meadows Massacre which were delivered by Apostle George A. Smith.</p>
<p>We spent the day with the National Parks Ranger, Allen Malmquist, who found the scroll. It is now housed in the National Parks vault/archives at Page. We examined the scroll and other items in the archives for about two hours, and Throckmorton collected some small samples from the scroll to be tested at a chemical labratory.
 
We travelled with him to a number of sites including the Fort and Signature Rock, which has more than 200 signatures of 19th century travellers, including that of John D. Lee, 25 December 1871.</p>
<p>Malmquist discussed with us, in great detail, the history of the area, especially John D. Lee&#8217;s involvement, the history of the fort, the ferry, Lee&#8217;s Lonely Dell Ranch and many other topics. </p>
<p>We traveled with Malmquist to the building at Lee&#8217;s ferry where the scroll was found. He explained, in precise detail, the circumstances of his finding of the scroll and its history to the present.</p>
<p>On this talk show we discussed further investigation of this lead scroll. There are many reasons, physical, historical, provenance, contextual and handwriting, to suspect the scroll is a forgery.</p>

<p>I have a large collection of miscellaneous quotations, sources, references and notes which I have collected on a variety of subjects while involved in specific research projects. From time to time, I bring some of these to my talk show. In this one I presented the following six:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. An allegation that Mormons murdered Lilburn Boggs, ex-Governor of Missouri, while he was on his way to California.</p>
<p>2. Peter H. Burnett, who was one of Joseph Smith&#8217;s attorneys and the first governor of California, wrote his impression of Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>3. John Taylor on truth and science. He taught that an appropriate pursuit of truth by Mormons is to set aside preconceived notions and bias and to search for truth from all possible sources, including the sciences.</p>
<p>4. Orson Pratt&#8217;s 1846 sermon, found in a journal entry of Norton Jacob, comments on the dating of creation.</p>
<p>5. Brigham Young speaks of his and Joseph Smith&#8217;s views on the resurrection as matters of individual belief. He endorsed individual speculation and belief, but not the assertion that this is the belief of the Church.</p>
<p>6. 21 January 1861 Wilford Woodruff&#8217;s synopsis of  Brigham Young&#8217;s sermon in which he speculates on the stature, in the resurrection, of those who died in infancy.</p></blockquote>
<p><font color="#0000ff" size="3"><strong>Callers and email:</strong></font></p>
<blockquote><p>All Mormons are liars, arrogant and do not believe in the Constitution and should not be protected by the first amendment.</p>
<p>Follow up from my discussion with Blake Ostler. Is there an ultimate head God, or is there an infinite order of Gods one above another?</p>
<p>Email from an evangelical Christian denouncing me and Mormonism.</p>
<p>Through the power of God, did the sun stand still for Joshua to allow him time to complete his attack?</p>
<p>Speculation regarding details of the resurrection.</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff" size="5"><strong>Authorship</strong> </font></p>
<p><img title="SpaldingMs3.jpg" height="87" alt="SpaldingMs3.jpg" src="http://www.podbean.com/wp-content/blogs/4148/uploads/SpaldingMs3.jpg" width="150" border="0" />         <img title="SpaldingMs2.jpg" style="width: 124px; height: 139px" height="139" alt="SpaldingMs2.jpg" src="http://www.podbean.com/wp-content/blogs/4148/uploads/SpaldingMs2.jpg" width="124" border="0" />           <img title="BMtitlepage.jpg" style="width: 114px; height: 146px" height="146" alt="BMtitlepage.jpg" src="http://www.podbean.com/wp-content/blogs/4148/uploads/BMtitlepage.jpg" width="114" border="0" /></p>
<p><font size="2">My guests, Wayne L. Cowdrey, Howard A. Davis and Arthur Vanick, are authors of Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon? The Spalding Enigma. The authors argue for the view that Solomon Spalding, who died in 1816 wrote two manuscripts about the inhabitants of ancient America, one from 1809 to 1812 and another from c.1812 to c.1814. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The second was acquired by Sidney Rigdon from a printing office in Pittsburg, where he was allegedly working, and then spent some 18 months meeting with Joseph Smith in Palmyra 1827-1829 where religious material was added to Spaldings story/history and published as the Book of Mormon. This has been the most popular theory among non-Mormons throughout most of Mormon history. For about the last 70 years, the theory has been discarded by most, including a number of prominent anti-Mormon advocates. This book is an attempt to resurrect the theory.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">I presented some of many points which I think demonstrate to the rational mind that the theory is bogus. The authors countered with expanations and arguments which they think establish beyond doubt that Spalding was the author of the Book of Mormon.</font><font size="2">The following synopsis was written just following this radio discussion.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">
Mr. Hale said he was skeptical of reminiscences provided by persons as late as 50 years after the publication of the Book of Mormon. He stated that the Spalding/Rigdon theory is entirely based upon alleged memories. There are no pre-1830 sources which described Solomon Spalding&#8217;s literary production or Sidney Rigdon&#8217;s acquaintance with the Joseph Smith, Sr. family living in western New York.
 Mr. Hale said that testimony of early neighbors of the Smith family should have included specific points later brought up by Lorenzo Saunders, if those points were common knowledge. The fact that Howe did not include statements that the Smiths&#8217; neighbors knew of  Rigdon&#8217;s frequent visits from 1827-1830 or rumors of Rigdon impregnating Catherine Smith seems to devastate the credibility of Saunders alleged memories on this particular point. Mr. Hale said he did not believe that such a story was in circulation at an early date.
Mr. Hale gave three reasons for finding Bennett&#8217;s 1831 article unbelieveable.</font><font size="2"> </font><font size="2">Bennett&#8217;s inability to provide the name of a visitor from Ohio beyond &#8220;Henry Rangdon or Ringdon or some such word&#8221; is inconsistent with Bennett&#8217;s claim that he was privy to Rangdon&#8217;s suggestion that the Smith&#8217;s turn their  &#8220;their digging concern into a religious plot.&#8221;  He did not know his name, but did know of his secret suggestion to the Smiths.</font></p>
<p>Bennett, six times, called this man an &#8220;ex-preacher&#8221; or &#8220;ex-parson&#8221; from Ohio, during a time when substantial evidence establishes that Sidney Rigdon was not only an extremely active preacher, establishing nine new congregations in 1828, but was, in fact, the most famous preacher in northern Ohio. Bennett, or some unamed source, seems to have purloined a suggestion already circulating that &#8220;the first idea of a &#8216;Book&#8217; was doubtless suggested to the Smiths by one Walters, a juggling fortune-teller&#8221; replacing Walters with Rangdon/Ringdon/Rigdon.</p>
<p>Further, Bennett asserts that this &#8220;Ohio man&#8221; was so &#8220;famous&#8221; for his &#8220;particular felicity in finding out the spots of ground where money is hid,&#8221; and who had &#8220;much experience in money digging&#8221; that his fame had found its way 200 miles from Ohio to upstate New York. When Rigdon became a Mormon in December 1830, he was vigorously opposed by Campbell, Scott, Bentley (his brother-in-law), along with other mininsters, including 3 cousins and another brother-in-law who had all become Disciple Ministers. However, none of these, nor others who knew Rigdon well, even in their opposition, suggested any knowledge of Rigdon&#8217;s money digging fame, which Bennett alleged stretched to up-state New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale noted that in November and December of 1833 Hurlbut interviewed or contacted at least 83 of Joseph Smith&#8217;s neighbors, and Howe published 23 of their statements. None indicate any knowledge of Sidney Rigdon&#8217;s presence in the neighborhood in 1827-1830. Mr. Hale finds it inconceiveable that, given Howe&#8217;s interest in connecting Sidney Rigdon with the production of the Book of Mormon, he would not have published such statements if he had such. Further, the alleged memories of Saunder&#8217;s, Gilbert, Chase, Lillie, Anderick and Tucker, 40 to 60 years later claim many neighbors knew of frequent visits by Sidney Rigdon to the Smiths from 1827-1830, some claiming to have been informed by the Smiths themselves and even alleging a &#8220;story was around the neighborhood that Catherine Smith was pregnant by Rigdon.&#8221; Yet, none of 83 Smith neighbors provide any recollection of such in 1833. It seems obvious that the late alleged recollections rather reflect knowledge of developing myths to which they added their own embellishments.
Mr. Hale said that he believed that Solomon Spalding only wrote one fictional story about ancient America. There were some striking, but superficial, similarities. Spalding claims that while walking near the Conneaught River, he noticed a flat stone. He raised the stone to find an artificial cave in which he found a box. Upon opening the box he found an ancient record. He translated only a portion of the record. Spalding presented himself not as the author, but as the translator of a manuscript written by a man, who with others, came to America by boat, long before Columbus. This manuscript tells of the customs, government, religion and the wars of ancient American nations now extinct. It is filled with strange names of people and places. When some Spalding neighbors were introduced to the Book of Mormon, it was suggested that it sounded like the Spalding story &#8220;Manuscript Found&#8221; which they had heard or read 20-25 years earlier. Their introduction to the Book of Mormon resulted in considerable embellishment and addition to their naturally faded memory resulting in the insertion of BoM-specific names and narrative information into their public statements. There are no known earlier statements or descriptions of a Spalding manuscript with any specific Book of Mormon names or details.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale argued that Solomon Spalding, according to the authors&#8217; theory (p. 27) produced a second fictional story regarding the ancient inhabitants of the Americas in Pittsburg 1812-1814. Following Hurlbut&#8217;s retrieval of Spalding&#8217;s Roman story with parallels to the Book of Mormon too superficial to argue for some connection, a new claim was made - two stories by Spalding on the subject of pre-Columbus America. The new claim, not supported by the 8 original statements, alleged that Spalding altered his first plan of writing and commenced writing a Ten Lost Tribes story. According to this new scenario, the Roman Story was first and the Ten Tribes story second. A beginning draft of an unrelated letter in the Roman story on page 132 of the 171 page manuscript acknowledges the receipt of 2 letters &#8220;jun 1812.&#8221; This establishes that the last 35 pages of the Roman manuscript were written after June 1812. Spalding moved to Pittsburg four months later in October 1812. This supports the authors&#8217; dating of the Ten Tribes manuscript to 1812-1814, if such were ever written &#8212; How, then, could Oliver Smith testify that he had read BoM-specific information in a Spalding MS as early as 1809, when the Spalding manuscript with BoM-specific information was not written until 1812-1814 in Pittsburg?</p>
<p>Mr. Hale argued that since 1833 statements for the claims of Spalding authorship state that the lost &#8220;Ten Tribes&#8221; began a journey from Jerusalem to the New World, that the claims were unbelieveable &#8212; that Spalding would never have brought the ten tribes forth from Jerusalem. Before being carried away to Assyria, never again to return, they were the Northern Kingdom and were never residents of Jerusalem. Spalding had studied divinity at Dartmouth College and was a licensed Congregational minister for 8-10 years. He certainly would not have defied the common knowledge among even amateur Bible students that the lost Ten Tribes, or a small group of them, would have begun their journey to America from Jerusalem which had never been their place of residence. Further, the Book of Mormon specifically declares that the Ten Tribes were elsewhere. What seems obvious is that the 8 Spalding neighbors were working in reverse. A number of early 1830 newspapers reported the common false perception that the Book Mormon was about the Ten Tribes or their descendants in America. Operating from this assumption demanded that Spalding&#8217;s neighbors, to establish a precise parallel, ascribe to Spalding&#8217;s story the common false perception that the Book of Mormon was about the Ten Tribes coming to America from Jerusalem. They presumably looked at the first few pages of the Book of Mormon where they would have encountered Lehi, Nephi, Moroni and Laban. The second sentence of the first page of the 1830 Book of Mormon identifies Lehi&#8217;s place of departure as Jerusalem. Their knowing, or unknowing, amalgation of these facts and perceptions seems to be the more likely source of their allege memories.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale doubted Aron Wright&#8217;s ability to identify the Roman manuscript shown to him by Hurlbut based upon the handwriting, having seen Spalding&#8217;s handwriting more than 20 years earlier. Modern investigators are on record as disagreeing over which old specimens of handwriting can actually be traced back to Spalding&#8217;s pen. Hale, however, does believe the manuscript shown to Wright was an authentic Spalding in his handwriting. [I was sidetracked on this point. It is of nominal significance.]</p>
<p>Mr. Hale said that the allegation that the title is &#8220;Manuscript Story&#8211;Conneaut Creek&#8221; is more probably someone&#8217;s description than Spalding&#8217;s chosen title. This line is on  a sheet of paper in which the manuscript was wrapped. None of the handwriting on the wrapper was Spalding&#8217;s. Mr. Hale observed this fact  based upon his comparison of the faint, but unmistakable, style of the 2 penciled &#8220;Cs&#8221; in &#8220;Manuscript Story&#8211;Conneaut Creek&#8221; on the wrapper, with the remarkably different style of capital &#8220;Cs&#8221; written by Spalding throughout his manuscript. The authors&#8217; claim (p. 81) that &#8220;the writing on the wrapper gives every appearance of being Solomon Spalding&#8217;s own&#8221; is clearly wrong. From the first chapter&#8217;s description of Spalding&#8217;s finding of the manuscript by prying up a stone, going into a cave, opening a box and finding 28 sheets of parchment which he translated from Latin, the title, &#8220;Manuscript Found,&#8221; would certainly be fitting and the penciled line is not relevant.
Mr. Hale discounted Mrs. Eichbaum&#8217;s reminiscence, because it was first written down at a late date (1879) and because Howe&#8217;s book quotes a Mr. Patterson as saying he did not know about Spalding&#8217;s MS. The discussion did include an 1842 Robert Patterson statement in Samuel Williams&#8217; pamphlet, nor the later reminiscence provided by Elder William Small.
Mr. Hale was certain that Sidney Rigdon visited Pittsburgh as a young man. His response to the appearance of Rigdon&#8217;s name in published Pittsburgh letter lists, was that the printing of such a list showed that the recipient had NOT picked up any such letters waiting for him &#8212; thus tending to demonstrate that he had NOT frequented the Pittsburgh Post Office to the extent Eichbaum claimed in her statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale doubts the value of Arthur B. Deming&#8217;s published statements because the witnesses were very old, and separated from the events by some sixty years and Deming offered to pay contributors to his newspaper for their submission of negative statements. Mr. Hale read Deming&#8217;s offer in his first issue of Naked Truths about Mormonism to pay a &#8220;fair price&#8221; for negative material &#8220;regarding the origin and early history of Mormonism&#8221; &#8220;if used.&#8221; It seems impossible not to find suspect this form of alleged memory, often contradictory and frequently compound hearsay.</p>

		<itunes:summary>The Spalding Theory of Book of Mormon

Authorship 

                    

My guests, Wayne L. Cowdrey, Howard A. Davis and Arthur Vanick, are authors of Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon? The Spalding Enigma. The authors argue for the view that Solomon Spalding, who died in 1816 wrote two manuscripts about the inhabitants of ancient America, one from 1809 to 1812 and another from c.1812 to c.1814. 

The second was acquired by Sidney Rigdon from a printing office in Pittsburg, where he was allegedly working, and then spent some 18 months meeting with Joseph Smith in Palmyra 1827-1829 where religious material was added to Spaldings story/history and published as the Book of Mormon. This has been the most popular theory among non-Mormons throughout most of Mormon history. For about the last 70 years, the theory has been discarded by most, including a number of prominent anti-Mormon advocates. This book is an attempt to resurrect the theory.

I presented some of many points which I think demonstrate to the rational mind that the theory is bogus. The authors countered with expanations and arguments which they think establish beyond doubt that Spalding was the author of the Book of Mormon.The following synopsis was written just following this radio discussion.


Mr. Hale said he was skeptical of reminiscences provided by persons as late as 50 years after the publication of the Book of Mormon. He stated that the Spalding/Rigdon theory is entirely based upon alleged memories. There are no pre-1830 sources which described Solomon Spalding's literary production or Sidney Rigdon's acquaintance with the Joseph Smith, Sr. family living in western New York.
 Mr. Hale said that testimony of early neighbors of the Smith family should have included specific points later brought up by Lorenzo Saunders, if those points were common knowledge. The fact that Howe did not include statements that the Smiths' neighbors knew of  Rigdon's frequent visits from 1827-1830 or rumors of Rigdon impregnating Catherine Smith seems to devastate the credibility of Saunders alleged memories on this particular point. Mr. Hale said he did not believe that such a story was in circulation at an early date.
Mr. Hale gave three reasons for finding Bennett's 1831 article unbelieveable. Bennett's inability to provide the name of a visitor from Ohio beyond "Henry Rangdon or Ringdon or some such word" is inconsistent with Bennett's claim that he was privy to Rangdon's suggestion that the Smith's turn their  "their digging concern into a religious plot."  He did not know his name, but did know of his secret suggestion to the Smiths.

Bennett, six times, called this man an "ex-preacher" or "ex-parson" from Ohio, during a time when substantial evidence establishes that Sidney Rigdon was not only an extremely active preacher, establishing nine new congregations in 1828, but was, in fact, the most famous preacher in northern Ohio. Bennett, or some unamed source, seems to have purloined a suggestion already circulating that "the first idea of a 'Book' was doubtless suggested to the Smiths by one Walters, a juggling fortune-teller" replacing Walters with Rangdon/Ringdon/Rigdon.

Further, Bennett asserts that this "Ohio man" was so "famous" for his "particular felicity in finding out the spots of ground where money is hid," and who had "much experience in money digging" that his fame had found its way 200 miles from Ohio to upstate New York. When Rigdon became a Mormon in December 1830, he was vigorously opposed by Campbell, Scott, Bentley (his brother-in-law), along with other mininsters, including 3 cousins and another brother-in-law who had all become Disciple Ministers. However, none of these, nor others who knew Rigdon well, even in their opposition, suggested any knowledge of Rigdon's money digging fame, which Bennett alleged stretched to up-state New York.

Mr. Hale noted that in November and December of 1833 Hurlbut interviewed o</itunes:summary>

<p>Joseph Smith&#8217;s basic teaching that Mormons are open to receiving all truth; that Mormonism is progressive, looking for development of its beliefs in a variety of ways including thought, pondering and continued revelation, opens the path for the consideration of various aspects and angles beyond the parameters of basic Mormon doctrine.</p>

Blake concludes that Joseph Smith believed that there is one Eternal God of all other gods.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>Polygamy Discussion </strong></font><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>with Author, Carmon Hardy
</strong></font>
My guest was B. Carmon Hardy, author of <em><strong>Doing the Works of Abraham: Mormon Polygamy, Its origin, practice, and demise</strong></em>. His book is a collection of important documents on polygamy throughout its history in 19th century Mormonism. Hardy includes his comments and footnotes throughout. It is an excellent work which I highly recommend.</p>
<p>We discussed a number of the controversial issues regarding the Mormon practice of polygamy in the 19th century, including:</p>

				<itunes:subtitle>Discussion of controversial aspects of polygamy</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Polygamy Discussion with Author, Carmon Hardy

My guest was B. Carmon Hardy, author of Doing the Works of Abraham: Mormon Polygamy, Its origin, practice, and demise. His book is a collection of important documents on polygamy throughout its history in 19th century Mormonism. Hardy includes his comments and footnotes throughout. It is an excellent work which I highly recommend.

We discussed a number of the controversial issues regarding the Mormon practice of polygamy in the 19th century, including:
the origin;

Book of Mormon references;

why there is almost no evidence that Joseph Smith had children by any wife but Emma;

why some women who were already married were sealed to Joseph Smith;

the 1879 Supreme Court ruling;

early denials of the practice;

the 1852 public announcement of the practice and subsequent defense of the principle, etc.

A number of listeners participated by phone and email.

<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><strong>King Follett Discourse: Textual History and Controversy</strong></font></p>
<p>On 7 April 1844 Joseph Smith spoke to the largest audience of Saints assembled during his lifetime. He brought together concepts he had touched upon for several years into a very important doctrinal address.
It was then, and has continued throughout Mormon history, to be a controversial declaration of his views about how God came to be God and His intent for the progression of men to become gods. Joseph Smith explained that there is much to know in regard to salvation and exaltation which will not be known until long after we leave this life, but that there is much to be known in this life by those Saints inclined to seek.</p>
<p>Several doctrinal points in the discourse have lead some, over the past 130 years, to question or dispute the accuracy of the the published report of this discourse. They are:</p>
<p>1. The plurality of Gods
2. The stature in the resurrection of those who die in infancy
3. The concept that all mankind existed as intelligences before becoming spirits.</p>
<p>I present the findings from my research of a number of unpublished sources in the LDS Archives to address these arguments.</p>
<p>I discuss the four reports which were taken, by whom and how they were amalgamated to result in the standard version published during the past 100 years.</p>
<p>I include a six column parallel of these three sections of the discourse which have been the focus of these arguments. Four columns give the text from the four who wrote reports of the discourse, one column gives the first published version of 1844, authorized by the Quorum of the Twelve, and the other column gives the version prepared in 1855, examined and approved by Brigham Young for inclusion in the History of the Church - the one which has been published during the past 100 years.</p>
<p>Several, through phone calls and email, participated with questions and comments on the King Follett discourse, the sealed portion of the Book of Mormon, criticism of other callers.</p>

King Follett Discourse: Textual History and Controversy

On 7 April 1844 Joseph Smith spoke to the largest audience of Saints assembled during his lifetime. He brought together concepts he had touched upon for several years into a very important doctrinal address.
It was then, and has continued throughout Mormon history, to be a controversial declaration of his views about how God came to be God and His intent for the progression of men to become gods. Joseph Smith explained that there is much to know in regard to salvation and exaltation which will not be known until long after we leave this life, but that there is much to be known in this life by those Saints inclined to seek.

Several doctrinal points in the discourse have lead some, over the past 130 years, to question or dispute the accuracy of the the published report of this discourse. They are:

1. The plurality of Gods
2. The stature in the resurrection of those who die in infancy
3. The concept that all mankind existed as intelligences before becoming spirits.

I present the findings from my research of a number of unpublished sources in the LDS Archives to address these arguments.

I discuss the four reports which were taken, by whom and how they were amalgamated to result in the standard version published during the past 100 years.

Several, through phone calls and email, participated with questions and comments on the King Follett discourse, the sealed portion of the Book of Mormon, criticism of other callers.

<p>This episode was an open forum. I began by responding to an email from the last program on the <strong>Oath of Vengeance</strong>. The author of the email contended that Wilford Woodruff could not be trusted in his statement about the endowment ceremony because he had not been forthright regarding some plural marriages following the Manifesto. I responded by applying common sense and common experience to the question of <strong>credibility</strong>, reading two comments by Joseph Smith.</p>
<p>The first caller lead me into a discussion of the <strong>historicity of the Book of Mormon</strong>.</p>
<p>The second caller is the disciple of Art Bulla. He defended Bulla&#8217;s previous challenge for me to meet him for a <strong>fist fight</strong>, claiming Bulla was acting, in this challenge, under God&#8217;s direction. Bulla claims to be God&#8217;s legitimate sole priesthood leader. He was followed by Art Bulla who responded.</p>
<p>A caller discussed with me the propensity of humans to keep many things <strong>secret</strong>.</p>
<p>Several other callers pursued various topics, some salient others ridiculous.</p>
<p>It was a fun program for me, but I would understand those who found portions of the discussion too outrageous to be worthwhile. This is the nature of open talk radio, it is unpredictable and can only be controlled by imposing strong censorship.

In sworn testimony in hearings in 1889, 1904-1906 a number of Mormons testified that no such Oath existed.They were joined by several ex-Mormons who also denied its existence.

He stated that this was included in the endowment ceremony by Joseph Smith in 1842 based upon Revelation 6:9-10 and this had not been changed.

<p>From his explanation it would follow that those claiming the existence of an Oath of Vengeance for the Mormons to resort to murder to avenge the deaths of Joseph and Hyrum upon the American Nation was an extreme twisting of the endowment ceremony.</p>

		<itunes:summary> The Alleged Oath of Vengeance

Beginning in 1847 the allegation was made that the Saints were required in the endowment ceremony in the Nauvoo Temple to take an oath to "use our influence to murder this nation" to avenge "for their killing the Prophet Joseph."A number of ex-Mormons wrote addition anti-Mormon exposes making similar claims regarding the ceremony performed in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City from 1855-1889. In sworn testimony in hearings in 1889, 1904-1906 a number of Mormons testified that no such Oath existed.They were joined by several ex-Mormons who also denied its existence. Other ex-Mormons testified that it was included in the endowment ceremony.

Perhaps, for a number of reasons, the one most qualified to speak on the matter was Wilford Woodruff. As President of the Church in 1889 he gave an explanation that "avenging" and "prophets" were mentioned in the endowment ceremony in an instruction given to the Saints to pray for God to avenge the murder of prophets and saints. He stated that this was included in the endowment ceremony by Joseph Smith in 1842 based upon Revelation 6:9-10 and this had not been changed. He maintained that Joseph and Hyrum were not mentioned in the ceremony nor was the American Nation considered responsible for the deaths of Joseph and Hyrum and, therefore, was not specifically identified as the object of vengeance.

From his explanation it would follow that those claiming the existence of an Oath of Vengeance for the Mormons to resort to murder to avenge the deaths of Joseph and Hyrum upon the American Nation was an extreme twisting of the endowment ceremony.

Recently, several authors and historians have claimed that this alleged Oath of Vengeance played a major role in the Mountain Meadows Massacre.

I discuss this topic presenting some of my research for a paper 20 years ago. I plan to make available some of my sources and reasoning in an article to be available in my eStore this coming week.

<p>Bagley contends that Mormons were committed by a sacred oath in the temple ceremony - the alleged &#8220;oath of vengeance&#8221; - to avenge the blood of the prophets Joseph and Hyrum murdered in 1844, to which list would have been added the beloved Apostle, Parley Pratt, murdered in May 1857 in Arkansas.</p>
<p>I reviewed some of the substantial evidence which demonstrates that there was no &#8220;oath of vengeance&#8221; administered in the temple ceremony, that this was a tale manufactured and spread by bitter ex-Mormons. Rather, the long established LDS position left all vengeance in the hands of the Lord. In the lecture portion of the ceremony, the Saints were instructed to pray that God avenge the blood of the prophets, based on Revelation 6:9-10, rather than that the Saints seek vengeance.</p>
<p>We discussed several other points, but did not cover the subject sufficiently. I had hoped to have Bagley back on my next Talk Show to pursue this further, but he is too busy. I will probably have him back in the future, but I have decided to continue the subject without him next Sunday to summarize this historical event and consider some of the many controversial points.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Mountain Meadows Massacre 1 

My guest was Will Bagley, independent historian and columnist. His book, Blood of the Prophets: Brigham Young and the Massacre at Mountain Meadows, covers a period of Mormon history, 1856-1858, laden with controversy: the Reformation, blood atonement, Utah War, murder of Parley Pratt, the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the trials and execution of John D. Lee (1874-1877). Historians and students are divided on some of the main issues and events of this era and many of the lesser ones. His book adds to the controversy. We discussed Bagley's view that Brigham Young directly ordered the Mountain Meadows Massacre as an act of vengeance precipitated by the murder of Parley Pratt.

Bagley contends that Mormons were committed by a sacred oath in the temple ceremony - the alleged "oath of vengeance" - to avenge the blood of the prophets Joseph and Hyrum murdered in 1844, to which list would have been added the beloved Apostle, Parley Pratt, murdered in May 1857 in Arkansas.

I reviewed some of the substantial evidence which demonstrates that there was no "oath of vengeance" administered in the temple ceremony, that this was a tale manufactured and spread by bitter ex-Mormons. Rather, the long established LDS position left all vengeance in the hands of the Lord. In the lecture portion of the ceremony, the Saints were instructed to pray that God avenge the blood of the prophets, based on Revelation 6:9-10, rather than that the Saints seek vengeance.

We discussed several other points, but did not cover the subject sufficiently. I had hoped to have Bagley back on my next Talk Show to pursue this further, but he is too busy. I will probably have him back in the future, but I have decided to continue the subject without him next Sunday to summarize this historical event and consider some of the many controversial points.

		<itunes:summary>First Vision Accounts

In this talk show I discuss the early accounts of Joseph Smith's First Vision - those recorded during his lifetime, 1830 to 1844. One was written by Joseph Smith in 1832, two others were dictated by him in 1835 and 1838, and another was written by him for publication in 1842. The other six are second hand accounts. Five of the accounts had not been published until after 1969.

I am specifically interested in the allegation that an examination of these accounts demonstrates that Joseph Smith fabricated the First Vision and changed it to fit new circumstances and his developing views about God. I approach the topic by resorting to common sense and comparing some variations in the several accounts. I discuss the publication history of several of the accounts and the remarkable fact that it seems Joseph Smith was reluctant to publish an account of his First Vision until 1842. I responded to several callers and email on the topic, and to one caller, who would not affirm or deny that he is an American, but who startlingly encourages that Mormons be wiped of the earth by any means possible.

I did not get to the main point I wanted to discuss, but will pursue it next week or the week following.

<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="4"></font></strong><font size="2">This past week was a remarkable week for Mormonism. &#8220;The Mormons,&#8221; written and directed by Helen Whitney, was broadcast by PBS on stations all over America on Monday 30 April and Tuesday 1 May. As would be expected, opinions regarding this portrait of Mormonism are widely varied.

<p> I discussed what many would find to be surprising: the view of Joseph Smith that our spirits are eternal/uncreated; that they did not begin to exist. I quoted the 8 sources which record his teachings on this point and read the passages from LDS scripture which teach that we become <em>begotten </em>sons and daughters of God through Jesus Christ, suggesting that we are not sons and daughters of God by a premortal spirit birth.

 I discussed what many would find to be surprising: the view of Joseph Smith that our spirits are eternal/uncreated; that they did not begin to exist. I quoted the 8 sources which record his teachings on this point and read the passages from LDS scripture which teach that we become begotten sons and daughters of God through Jesus Christ, suggesting that we are not sons and daughters of God by a premortal spirit birth. Joseph Smith taught that God organized spirits in the preexistence and, as their head, as a caring Father, prepared an earth for the advancement of these spirits as God himself had advanced - by obtaining a physical body.

		<itunes:summary>Diversity in the New Testament

I began this talk show discussing the fact that the earliest Christians of which we have any record held divergent views on some important doctrinal topics. There was no creed declaring mandatory belief on such topics which have become major points in the later development of Christian tradition, such as:

Source the Gospel of Luke - God or early written sources

Doctrinal contrast between Mark, Luke and Matthew

Was Jesus baptized for the remission of his sins?

Contrast between God and Jesus - knowledge, goodness

Doctrinal constrast between these gospels and John.

The nature of Jesus - omniscience, pre-existence, deity


Question: Why does Luke devote 20 of the 28 chapters in Acts to Paul's ministry without ever once mentioning that he ever wrote letters?
 

Discussion with callers and email on the following topics

As usual, calls and email pursue a variety of different subjects as follows:

1. Why doesn't the Church give a full detailed financial report?

2. Response by a caller. Tithing is a matter of faith not finances.

3. Email critical of my taking calls from certain callers.

4. Caller insists that I am a liar with a satanic spirit because I have talked about differences between Joseph Smith and Brigham Young on some doctrinal points. The main topic of his call regards the eternity of the spirit or the intelligence of man.

5. Email: Deuteronomy 18:20 presents the Biblical standard for a prophet, why did Joseph Smith say that it was possible for a prophet to be mistaken about the source of a revelation; that is that it might not be from God.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="2"><font size="2">My guest, Anthony Larson, has written several books and a number of articles presenting his unique view of science, which he believes supports both ancient prophets and modern LDS prophets and writers in their world view.</font></font></p>
<p>He and I differ substantially in our assessment of both science and religion, specifically the LDS beliefs. He believes in what he calls catastrophism - that changes in the world, the solar system and the universe happen quickly and suddenly; that new planets can be birthed in the space of days.</p>
<p>Tony is an advocate of the writings and speculations of Velikovsky, which have been rejected by modern science. For example, he speculated that a planet or comet passed by the earth at the time of Moses, taking about six months, causing the events at that time considered miraculous, such as the water being turned to blood, or turned red.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tony favors maverick scientists over the consensus of the various scientific disciplines, contending that the mavericks will be proven correct - that modern science is undergoing a major revolution. He further contends that the mavericks are bringing science around to the Mormon point of view.</p>
<p>Within this maverick science Tony claims there is support for the literal interpretation of Joshua 10:12-14 and Helamen 12:14-15 which speak of the sun standing still or the earth stopping its rotation.</p>
<p>Tony believes that LDS have turned from prophecy and lost sight of the imminence of the Second Coming because it has not happened and have focused on day to day needs. He contends that they need to be cognizant of prophecy and interpret it properly, which interpretations he is prepared to elucidate. He has written his books to convince LDS that Joseph Smith had the keys; that he explained them, but LDS have just overlooked them.</p>
<p>Regarding sources and interpretation, I expressed my doubt regarding the value of a number of sources which he uses to establish what he calls the Mormon position. He turns to a number of 2nd and 3rd hand sources to assemble what he claims to be Joseph Smith&#8217;s teachings. Further, he uses the speculations of 19th century LDS writers as though their speculations were in fact direct revelations. Joseph Smith, himself, claimed to be human with views acquired through normal means as well as that which he had received in his prophetic call. He made no claims to omniscience or infallibility. That is, he was not always speaking as a prophet. Also, I feel that Tony ignores the foundation laid by Joseph Smith in which he considered us to be children with much to learn; that much was withheld from ancient prophets; and that many ideas and traditions will be overturned by knowledged gleaned from many sources including study, theory and future revelation regarding the creation of the earth which has been withheld, to be revealed only at Christ&#8217;s second as stated in D&#038;C 101:32-34.</p>
<p>He believes that the future of the earth can be clearly established through interpretation of the sources he has assembled which are both clear and obvious.</p>
<p>I consider the enterprise of producing a scenario of the future to be very problematic for several reasons. I referred to Joseph Smith&#8217;s desire to know the time of the Second Coming. He was given a revelation, but he did not know what it meant, and could only speculate as to its meaning. (see D&#038;C 130:14-17)</p>
<p>A precedent established by New Testament writers demonstrates a significant problem regarding interpretation and application of prophecy. They drew passages from the Old Testament pointing to an event in the life of Jesus as its fulfillment. There is a problem with their interpretations. Upon reading the Old Testament passage in its context, in many instances, there is no way an ancient reader would have seen it as prophecy of an event hundreds years in the future to be fulfilled in the life of Jesus. I mentioned Isaiah 7:14 as an example. There are many such passages. This suggests that we not be so certain that prophetic passages we can accurately produce a scenario of future events.</p>
<p>Also, as history testifies, there is room for wide diversity of interpretation particularly of such texts as Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Revelation and forward looking sections of the D&#038;C, not to mention the reported comments of Joseph Smith and others.</p>
<p>I enjoyed our discussion and the participation of a number of callers and email.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img title="StatementsCover.jpg" height="362" alt="StatementsCover.jpg" src="http://www.podbean.com/wp-content/blogs/4148/uploads/StatementsCover.jpg" width="250" align="left" border="0" /><font size="2">I discussed the <em>Statements of the LDS First Presidency </em>with my guest, Gary Bergera. This is the title of a very handy book gathering doctrinal statements and arranging them according to topic, and also chronologically within each topic.</font></p>
<p>Gary explained his approach to the project. He drew from more than 40 sources, from 1833 to the present, which are, or contain, items which were authored by, or endorsed by, the First Presidency and thus represent those points upon which it has chosen to write, as the highest quorum in the LDS Church. Addresses and writings of individual members of the First Presidency are not included. That the unified statement of the First Presidency is of higher authority than an individual statement of a member of the First Presidency, or of another General Authority, has been declared many times by LDS leaders.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff" size="2">We discussed several points:</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="2"></font></p><dir>1. The role of the book in efforts to determine Mormon beliefs on doctrinal topics.
<p>2. Why certain sources were included and why others were not.</p>
<p>3. This book is a convenient collection of doctrinal statements; a considerable guide to the written pronouncements of the First Presidency. While very valuable, it should not be considered something which it is not.</p>
<p>4. It is not the Mormon Creed.</p>
<p>5. The book is not the handbook of official Mormon Doctrine.</p>
<p>6. It is not a comprehensive collection of Mormon doctrinal beliefs. This would require going beyond the collection in this book to the much larger body of sermons, articles and writings of Mormons which are not statements or specific endorsements of the First Presidency.</p>
<p>7. Their statements have a rather narrow focus and tend to address very basic doctrines.</p>
<p></p></dir>We discussed with each other and with callers and email a number of specific doctrinal topics in the book, including: abortion, when the spirit enters the body, evolution, the U.S. Constitution, status of books by LDS authorities, the Adam-God theory, differences on the omniscience of God, birth control, common consent, Book of Mormon geography.
<p>A few of the other topics covered are: Word of Wisdom, sexual relations, second coming, sons of perdition, marriage, Godhead, Satan, euthanasia, labor unions, intellectualism, gender, gathering, gambling, excommunication, exaltation, church discipline, child abuse, capital punishment, education, dress and grooming, debt, cremation, artificial insemination and adoption.</p>
<p>I enthusiastically endorse this work as valuable to anyone interested in LDS doctrinal beliefs.</p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">To Purchase: The book is 519 pages, published by Signature Books and sells for 34.95. I am making a special offer to those interested.

				<itunes:subtitle>Statements of the LDS First Presidency</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>I discussed the Statements of the LDS First Presidency with my guest, Gary Bergera. This is the title of a very handy book gathering doctrinal statements and arranging them according to topic, and also chronologically within each topic.

Gary explained his approach to the project. He drew from more than 40 sources, from 1833 to the present, which are, or contain, items which were authored by, or endorsed by, the First Presidency and thus represent those points upon which it has chosen to write, as the highest quorum in the LDS Church. Addresses and writings of individual members of the First Presidency are not included. That the unified statement of the First Presidency is of higher authority than an individual statement of a member of the First Presidency, or of another General Authority, has been declared many times by LDS leaders.

We discussed several points:

1. The role of the book in efforts to determine Mormon beliefs on doctrinal topics.

2. Why certain sources were included and why others were not.

3. This book is a convenient collection of doctrinal statements; a considerable guide to the written pronouncements of the First Presidency. While very valuable, it should not be considered something which it is not.

4. It is not the Mormon Creed.

5. The book is not the handbook of official Mormon Doctrine.

6. It is not a comprehensive collection of Mormon doctrinal beliefs. This would require going beyond the collection in this book to the much larger body of sermons, articles and writings of Mormons which are not statements or specific endorsements of the First Presidency.

7. Their statements have a rather narrow focus and tend to address very basic doctrines.

We discussed with each other and with callers and email a number of specific doctrinal topics in the book, including: abortion, when the spirit enters the body, evolution, the U.S. Constitution, status of books by LDS authorities, the Adam-God theory, differences on the omniscience of God, birth control, common consent, Book of Mormon geography.

A few of the other topics covered are: Word of Wisdom, sexual relations, second coming, sons of perdition, marriage, Godhead, Satan, euthanasia, labor unions, intellectualism, gender, gathering, gambling, excommunication, exaltation, church discipline, child abuse, capital punishment, education, dress and grooming, debt, cremation, artificial insemination and adoption.

I enthusiastically endorse this work as valuable to anyone interested in LDS doctrinal beliefs.

To Purchase: The book is 519 pages, published by Signature Books and sells for 34.95. I am making a special offer to those interested. I will include a $10.00 Gift Certificate for any items in the mormonmiscellaneous.com &#x3E; Catalogue

I assemble 138 sources to discuss Joseph Smith’s self characterization as a prophet, yet, typically human, imperfect, fallible and in search of further light and knowledge, all of which he viewed as consistent with his claim to be a prophet. I include many of his admissions of human weakness; his acknowledgement that he could fall; examples of his denials of infallibility and omniscience; his policy that all revelation needs to be tested, including his own, because not all revelation is from God.</p>
<p><strong>Program Notes</strong> are available for this episode. Included are all of the sources, quotations and references (138) with discussion of a number of incidents in Joseph Smith’s life related to this topic, some not covered in the Talk Show.
