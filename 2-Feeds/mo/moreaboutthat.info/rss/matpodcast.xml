	<title>3 Men Run Across the Sahara Dessert</title>
	<description>Three runners ran for 111 days straight covering six countries and over 4,000 miles across the Sahara Desert.  Their mission was to raise awareness of the need for clean water supplies in Africa.  They started the trip by touching the water in Senegal and ended by touching the Red Sea in Egypt. The trip began in Senegal and ended at the Red Sea in Cairo Egypt.  Charlie Engle from the US, Ray Zahab from Canada, and Kevin Lin from Taiwan are three of the best endurance runners in the world and the trip across the Sahara had never been done before.  A documentary called "Running the Sahara" will chronicle their adventure.  The LivePlanet production, narrated by Academy Award Winner Matt Damon, is scheduled for release in 2007.</description>

	<title>Raising Baby: A parent’s ultimate play time guide</title>

Hart encourages parents to trust their instincts and balance their needs with their baby’s.

	<itunes:subtitle>Getting Organized: Dorm Room Do-Over</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Laptops, notebooks, CD’s, laundry and soda cans all part of the landscape we call a dorm room.  But starting off on the right foot this semester can enhance your space and may even improve your grades.

There’s something to say about being organized.  When we’re not, we spend so much time and energy trying to locate or sort through our messes.  This is especially important for students says Ronni Eisenberg, The Ultimate Organizer.

	<title>Back Yard Makeovers: Tips and Tricks to Help Spruce Up Your Space</title>
	<description>The warmer weather is finally here! It's time to get rid of a winter's worth of dust and grime. Unfortunately, it's also the time of year when we all want to be outside enjoying the fresh air. The last thing on our minds is cleaning or doing major work around the house.  But the good news is that a back yard makeover doesn’t have to cost you a lot of time or money.   
America’s Home Improvement expert, Lynda Lyday will provide viewers with a gamelan that will help everyone to be able to clean up quickly and efficiently, with plenty of time left over to stop and smell the newly budding roses.
Who is Lynda Lyday?
A Southern bred lady, she wasn’t allowed to be seen with a hammer. But she needed a day job when she moved to The Big Apple to pursue an acting career.  She joined the Carpenters Union, launched a construction company, designed her own tool line, authored books and became carpenter/host for a number of television programs.  Her wit and wisdom have kept her busy with appearances on CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC news stations.

	<title>Summer Grilling Short Cuts</title>
	<description>Although summer entertaining seems like a breeze, planning ahead is important if you want to keep your cool.

You don't have to leave home to soak up the summer, says Food Network host Marc Silverstein. Have a casual backyard BBQ, with appetizers and buffet style meals. No pressure, just good food.

While it's always tempting to just open the grill and slap on some meat, America is still a diet-crazed nation, and eating healthy is on everyone's mind. After all, it's swimsuit season. From grilling light to packing on-the-go picnics, Silverstein can offer viewers the following tips:

- Creative ways to host hot parties

- How to choose the right meats, veggies, and buns for delicious (and light!) summer grilling

- How to avoid packing on the pounds.

For more information on Marc&amp;apos;s Summer Grilling Shortcuts, go to www.moreaboutthat.info, click on our Summer Grilling segment and then download our podcast to see the segment online.

	<title>Balding in America: Treatments Have Come A Long Way</title>
	<description>For men who are losing their hair, it is no laughing matter.  For some, it starts in their late teens and by age 50, about half of all men will be losing their hair.  In 95 percent of the cases, classic male pattern hair loss is to blame.  College student Ryan Mongon, 21, tries to laugh off the jokes about his receding hairline and hides under a baseball cap whenever he appears in public.  But unlike many men, he decided to do something about it.  Enter Dr. Kenneth Washenik, M.D., PhD, a professor at New York University who specializes in hair loss and its causes. In this podcast, Ryan tells his story and Dr. Washenik explains why Ryan is losing his hair and points out that hair loss treatments have come a long way in the last two decades.
