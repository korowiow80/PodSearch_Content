      <title>Motorhome and Caravan Podcast Episode 1</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1128203/600x600_868859.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the first episode of the Motorhome and Caravan Podcast. Pitch up then come on over to the rear lounge of our motorhome to join us in podcast chat about motorhomes, caravans, camping and lots more!

In this first episode of the Motorhome and Caravan Podcast, your hosts (&quot;Me and Maddy&quot;)  introduce Tina - the third and final member of their camping household when she climbs aboard the rear lounge of our motorhome. 

Together they chat, laugh, lament and curse about the camping outfits they've had since getting into the hobby, with a bit of intelligent critical comment thrown in too!

Join them as they remember the second hand purchase of a Folding Caravan (that they should have asked to see demonstrated)  to converting a filthy council van into the sort of camper that only a non-DIY inclined motorhome enthusiast could achieve! 

Find out why you can do too much research when you're seeking the right motorhome - and get it wrong. Me and Maddy and Tina have been there and done it!

Listen to &quot;Andrea's Musical Moment&quot; during a break in the motorhome, caravan and camping chat when she grabs the Camping Keyboard and sings the song she wrote 2 days ago especially for this first episode  - &quot;The Overcab Bed&quot;. 

Finally, in the Motorhome and Caravan Podcast, Andrea takes a look at the lastest edition of the Caravan Club Magazine and reads a thought provoking letter from the Letters Page, which she hopes you will want to respond to by hitting the Comments button on this web page or emailing her - for inclusion and discussion in the next episode of the Motorhome and Caravan Podcast. 

Is it a motorhome, caravan, camper, folding caravan, folding camper or RV that pops your cork? Do you love getting out and about touring, walking, camping? If you do then the Motorhome and Caravan Podcast would love to hear from you.   

Don't forget we will all be back in a fortnight's time with Episode 2 of the Motorhome and Caravan Podcast!

Thanks for listening to the Motorhome and Caravan Podcast 

Regards Andrea, Maddy (Me and Maddy) and Tina
