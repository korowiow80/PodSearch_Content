This podcast is to let those that might be seeking a faith, to know what they are getting into as far as Mormonism is concerned.  Are Mormons Christian?  Does their Doctrine coincide with the Bible?  Are these things you are about to hear Biblical?  Have we been introduced to another gospel?  Galatians 1:6-9 

Stay tuned....I will be back to bring what I think about the quotes we went over in this podcast.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Well it's finally here....Sorry for the delay folks. I was golfing my butt off over the Easter Holiday. Easter....What a holiday!!! Praise the Lord for his resurrection!! 
Well this is the final installment of the interview with Jared (a faithful Mormon). He was great to have on the show. It was good doin' the Mormon song and dance of how the Mormon Church is true. We finish the interview with topics like; excommunication, Blood atonement, salvation and many more topics surrounding the Mormon Church. Also enjoy the final question that I ask Jared....I think it is a question all Mormons should ask themselves. Why did Jared have such a hard time answering it??? God Bless....]]></description>

      <title>Livingtruth Podcast #10 Part 2 of 3</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Well after getting through part one of this interview, I am not sure that the Mormon religion is any less of a billion dollar cult than it was in my early stages of researching it. In fact after my interview with Jared I have realized the circular logic of answering a question with a question and derailing thoughts with "two wrongs make a right" is still strong among the faithful Mormons out there. 
Jared, You are one terrific guy!! And I do think that one day you will come face to face with logic staring you down and asking you to give God praise for truth which he has revealed to you in the Bible and not the Mormon gospel.]]></description>
