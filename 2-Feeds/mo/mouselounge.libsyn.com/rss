            <description><![CDATA[<p>(((HEADPHONES STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)))</p>
<p>This episode, the Mouse Lounge proffers a plethora of percussion!</p>
<p>But first, we go Behind the Mickey Bar, as Liana and I talk about our upcoming meet at Westfest&nbsp;2012 and then delve into Disney news.</p>
<p>Next, a Mouse Lounge Special Feature: &nbsp;The BBCs Russell Davis looks at how the archives have&nbsp;treated to the two faces of Walt Disney. &nbsp;Uncle Walt, who brought laughter and pleasure to&nbsp;millions, and&hellip; the rather tough businessman and social engineer. Enjoy the third of a five part&nbsp;series, Double Disney.</p>
<p>Then, from the Disney Archives: &nbsp;From the January 30, 1966 episode of Wonderful World of Color,&nbsp;Professor Ludwig von Drake introduces us to the art of Jazz and the swinging short subject,&nbsp;After You&rsquo;ve Gone from the 1946 package film, Make Mine Music!</p>
<p>Then, from Vault Disney: &nbsp;A few weeks ago I played a Disneyland Record, A Child&rsquo;s Introduction&nbsp;to Melody based on the short, Toot Whistle, Plunk, and Boom. &nbsp;Well your response was&nbsp;overwhelmingly positive but you asked, What about the original cartoon? &nbsp; The short was&nbsp;originally released to theaters in 1953 and made use of the then new widescreen format and novel&nbsp;stereophonic sound. &nbsp;It finally found life on DVD when it was released early on in the Walt&nbsp;Disney Treasures series called, Disney Rarites and I present the entire short for you here. &nbsp; If&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve never seen it, you can find it on youtube, albeit with rather poor audio quality. &nbsp;Still,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s absolutely worth seeing.</p>
<p>Then, from the original Mickey Mouse Club in 1956, the Firehouse Five + 2 join the Mouseketeers&nbsp;for a rip roarin&rsquo; Dixieland good time! &nbsp;Listen carefully during The Tiger Rag, that&rsquo;s Cubby&nbsp;O&rsquo;Brien on the skins in a wicked awesome solo!</p>
<p>Each show we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park&nbsp;West. &nbsp;Percussion in the parks was brought front and center last year, drum line and all with&nbsp;the introduction of Disneyland&rsquo;s, Soundsational parade. &nbsp;Have a listen to this drumming infused&nbsp;Mouse Lounge remix!</p>
<p>Then, we head over to Epcot where even the street sweepers must take a break and form, the&nbsp;Jamitors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll close the show with a pair of percussive tracks from Tarzan, first the original &ldquo;Trashin&rsquo;&nbsp;the Camp&rdquo; from the original soundtrack, then the rich harmony laced pop cover featuring Phil&nbsp;Collins and *Nsync. &nbsp;Lastly, as a special bonus, a battle of the drummers between the Muppets,&nbsp;Animal, and Travis Barker as he guests with the Electric Mayhem on Jimmy Kimmel live performing&nbsp;Can You Picture That!</p>]]></description>

<p></p>
<p>This week the Mouse Lounge goes again Behind the Mickey Bar, with Liana Kilgore and I disscusing the latest Disney News, including a surprise resignation!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, a very special interview with former Mouseketeer, Jennifer McGill. &nbsp;She was one of the few castmembers who was on the show all seven seasons in the 1990s! &nbsp;Jennifer has released a new extended single on iTunes, a cover of her 1993 hit, Hanging On For Dear Life, and This Little Light, an original work co-composed with her producer, Jeff Savage. &nbsp;Jennifer speaks candidly and fondly of her experience growing up a Mousketeer, and what has lead up to her new release.</p>

<p></p>
<p>This episode, the Mouse Lounge gets in the Christmas spirit, Disney style</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, in From the Vault, we dust off an old radio recording of Walt and his gang of cartoon characters circa 1934. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve never heard Donald Duck more irascible or the Three Little Pigs repressible, despite the Big Bad Wolf&rsquo;s insistence that they, come over for dinner. &nbsp;My wife was shocked to hear this sequence, commenting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so used to hearing Walt when he was older and had smoked for so many years. &nbsp;I can believe this voice could be Mickey Mouse. &nbsp;He was a tenor when he was a young man!&rdquo; &nbsp;Indeed he was.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, we journey to the Disney properties and take in live performances. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll go into the now long gone Adventurers Club, visit Yehaa Bob, hear the Daper Dans, DCA&rsquo;s Miner 49&rsquo;ers, The Jambalaya Jazz Band, and Billy Hill and the Hillbillies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, we take a spot in the shadow between the Matterhorn and Sleeping Beauty Castle to watch, A Christmas Fantasy Parade. &nbsp;This is a special Mouse Lounge Mix.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, as has become a Christmas tradition on the Mouse Lounge, I&rsquo;ll play for you some of my personal Christmas favorites. &nbsp;They may not be Disney, but they&rsquo;re sure to get you into the spirit of the season!</p>
<p></p>
<p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, the tree is trimmed, the egg nog is out, and there&rsquo;s a warm fire in the fireplace. &nbsp;Sit back and enjoy Mouse Lounge Christmas tidings&hellip;</p>
<p></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>(((HEADPHONES STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)))</p>
<p></p>
<p>This episode, the Mouse Lounge gets electrified!</p>
<p></p>
<p>I recently announced that I will be blogging for The Disney Driven Life. &nbsp;The focus of my articles will be on Disney music, from the films, parks, Walt Disney Records, and even those great 78s that preceded the formation of Disneyland records in 1955.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course I began planning my articles right away, and in doing so remembered I had produced a gem of a mini documentary nearly five years ago when I was living in Colorado. &nbsp;I looked up the show it came from and dragged it out of digital mothballs. &nbsp;Back then I believe the Mouse Lounge had two listeners, and I was one of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, it pleases me greatly, now that the show has grown and matured to at least a half dozen DFs with positively nothing else better to do, to bring you, The Musical History of the Main Street Electrical Parade. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll learn the evolution of electronic music and along the way meet such luminaries as Bob Moog, Don Dorsey, Rick Wakeman, and Jean-Jacque Perrey (composer of the familiar Baroque Hoedown) and hear the brilliant music of Raymond Scott, Wendy Carlos, Yes, The Beau Hunks, Carl Stalling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close the show with what is arguably the best iteration, and certainly most difficult to find of the parade, Tokyo Disneyland&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Dreamlights.&rdquo; &nbsp;This track does not contain character voices, to better be able to take in the marvelous music!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(((HEADPHONES STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)))<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This week, the Mouse Lounge plunges into the briar patch!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, Liana and I go Behind the Mickey Bar and discuss the film and the controversy that surrounds it.&nbsp; Be sure to login to the Mouse Lounge Blog at mouselounge.com and read my piece about the issue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next, we go in to the Disney Vault.&nbsp; Song of the South hasn&rsquo;t been on the big screen in over 25 years, and has never been released on home video in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp; As a result, an entire generation has never seen Disney&rsquo;s take on the Joel Chandler Harris stories and the exquisite performance of James Baskett, who utterly inhabited the role of Uncle Remus.&nbsp;&nbsp; We first dust off a delightful 1946 five-minute promo of the film featuring composer Johnny Mercer, Walt Disney, and the&hellip; uh&hellip; unflappable&hellip; Donald Duck.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then I&rsquo;ll tell you the tale of Song of the South with clips from the original film.&nbsp; It certainly doesn&rsquo;t replace watching it, but if you&rsquo;ve loved <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Splash</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Mountain</st1:placetype></st1:place> for more than two decades but still don&rsquo;t necessarily understand the narrative, this should help a lot!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then, go behind the curtain and learn what it took to bring Song of the South to the Silver</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Screen.&nbsp; Each show we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.&nbsp; Enjoy a ride through down Chickapin Hill into the Briar Patch on <st1:placename w:st="on">Splash</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Mountain</st1:placetype> in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Magic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Kingdom</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We close the show with popular music covers from the picture.&nbsp; First, Satchmo himself brings his unique style to Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.&nbsp; Not to be out done, listen to Rosemary Clooney with her rendition of Everybody Has a <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Laughing Place</st1:address></st1:street>!&nbsp; Next, Walt Disney and Johnny Mercer introducing June Hutton of the Pied Pipers who performs, Sooner or Later.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll wrap up the show with Uncle Remus himself performing, Uncle Remus Says.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14px; margin-right: 0.25in;"><span face="Georgia" style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14px; margin-right: 0.25in;"><span face="Georgia" style="font-family: Georgia;">Next, we move from Pirates to Epicureans as I share with you the origins of the mysterious Club 33, which opened to members only at the same time as Pirates. &nbsp;Then join Liana and I as we discuss our experiences dining, in the exclusive club. &nbsp;Also, be sure to login to the Mouse Lounge Galleries page for a photographic tour of the Club!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14px; margin-right: 0.25in;"><span face="Georgia" style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14px; margin-right: 0.25in;"><span face="Georgia" style="font-family: Georgia;">We close the show with a pair of piratical tracks. &nbsp;First, live from the Magic Kingdom&rsquo;s Pirate and Princes Party; enjoy the sea chanty, Blow, Ye Winds by the Rusty Cutlass Band. &nbsp;Finally have a listen to what has become the defacto Pirate theme, Klaus Badelt&rsquo;s, He&rsquo;s a Pirate as performed by David Garrett live at the Tempodrom in Berlin with the finale mixed with the dynamic original score we all adore!</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>(((HEADPHONES STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)))</p>
<p></p>
<p>This week, the Mouse Lounge celebrates Labor Day with a special labor of love, a glide-thru Disneyland.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now allow me to take just a moment to explain the Glide-thru. &nbsp;Most of us have heard many different live recordings of attractions and shows from the parks. &nbsp;Often, these include dialogue with the host and his guests. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Glide-thru allows you to take in the soundscape with only the sounds of the park, as you would hear it if you were somehow floating through the park by yourself, allowing you to take in details of the ambience. &nbsp;So far that may sound somewhat familiar, but the Glide-thru is crafted such so you will also enjoy a show, attraction, or live music performance during the journey, always something special. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>You never know where you&rsquo;ll start, or where you&rsquo;ll end up, but the Glide-thru will always be entertaining as you float through the parks on the breeze of the stereoscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What you are about to hear was recorded Saturday, September 3rd, Labor Day weekend 2011. &nbsp;Imagine it&rsquo;s the last hurrah of summer in the mid afternoon. &nbsp;The park is full of happy guests on a beautiful summer day. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s an electric energy in the air you can actually hear.</p>

			<title>Mouse Lounge -- Season 06 -- Episode 01 -- August 28, 2011</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://mouselounge.libsyn.com/mouse-lounge-season-06-episode-01-august-28-2011]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>(((HEADPHONES STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)))</p>
<p></p>
<p>This week, the Mouse Lounge explores what its like to have very little brain, which honestly isn&rsquo;t all that different from most days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before we delve into this episode&rsquo;s theme of stuff n fluff, we take in part two of three of a very special feature. &nbsp;Back in 2006, yours truly sat in on a Walt Disney World Audition Workshop. &nbsp;It was an intense couple of hours of enthusiastic performers needing a reality check and casting directors there to provide it, all in the spirit of better preparing those auditioning so they could earn one of the coveted performing spots. &nbsp;Whether you&rsquo;re a performer a not, enjoy an inside glimpse at what it takes to audition for Walt Disney World.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record. &nbsp;Before Disney made their now classic films, several audio interpretations of the Pooh stories were made. &nbsp;Some thirty years after the book&rsquo;s initial publication, RCA&rsquo;s Little Nipper series released an Upside Down record, which had a story on each side. &nbsp;We feature here, Winnie the Pooh and the Heffalump, narrated by Jimmy Stewart. &nbsp;Be sure to go to the Mouse Lounge multimedia page to listen to the flip side of the record, Winnie the Pooh and Tigger.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, from the Disney DVD, the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, have a listen to a brief history of Winnie the Pooh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, sidle up to the Mickey Bar, as Liana and I fling a little Pooh of our own. &nbsp;I even sing a few bars. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be scared.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meet Paul Winchell. &nbsp; Listen to the voice of Tigger tell his story in this wonderful interview with BBC Scotland in 2004, just a year before Paul passed away. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the Disneyland Attraction Archives: &nbsp;In 2005, Disney released the comprehensive, Musical History of Disneyland. &nbsp;Among the tracks are two absolute gems I&rsquo;ll play for you here: &nbsp;The queue music, When the Rain Rain Rain came Down Down Down, and the attraction music itself, without most of the character vocal tracks and sound effects. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each show we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West. &nbsp; This week we serve up both versions of Pooh, from Fantasyland in the Magic Kingdom, where many of you think the attraction truly belongs, and back to the West coast in Critter Country. &nbsp;Listen to the subtle differences between the two. &nbsp;Which do you prefer, and why? &nbsp;Be sure to comment on the podcast page on the Mouse Lounge website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We close the show with a duo of Pooh Tracks! &nbsp;First, from the Walt Disney Records archive collection, the Chieftains perform the title track, Winnie the Pooh. &nbsp;Then, while not really a Disney tune per se, its hard to separate Winnie the Pooh from one of Kenny Loggins most memorable performances, The Return to Pooh Corner.</p>

			<title>Mouse Lounge Unnumbered: The Premiere Episode (Originally aired August 18, 2006)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://mouselounge.libsyn.com/mouse-lounge-unnumbered-the-premiere-episode-originally-aired-august-18-2011-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffffff; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; margin: 8px;">
<p>Today marks the 5th Anniversary of the Mouse Lounge. &nbsp;While I'm currently in production on another epic show (the first cut was three hours!) I thought I'd drag out of moth balls an episode that hasn't seen the light of day in those five years: the very first episode of the Mouse Lounge.</p>
<p>Listening today, to me it sounds positively painful. &nbsp;However, it demonstrates how the show began, how many of the original concepts still survive, and how much it has evolved.</p>
<p>The Mouse Lounge thrives as part of the Disney fan culture because of YOU, my listeners. &nbsp;You have stuck with me through four moves and hardships that have resulted in more than a few sabbaticals. &nbsp;After five years, I still love what I do, and love the people for whom I do it!</p>
<p>With martini in hand... here's to the next five years!!!</p>
<p>P.S. The artwork included with this episode is that which I scanned from a souvenir notebook I bought in the Magic Kingdom. &nbsp;It was the art I used until the brilliant Dave Laitinen designed our logo, still in use today!</p>
<p>All the best</p>

<p></p>
<p>From the Disneyland Attraction Archives: &nbsp;Stay aboard the Mark Twain and listen to the narration and soundtrack that echoed through the decks of this classic Disneyland water faring vessel.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, take a musical trip around the Rivers of America in Disneyland with the Main Street Strawhatters performing a full set aboard the Mark Twain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We close the show with a duo of boat-themed tracks. &nbsp;First, from the original 1953 Peter Pan soundtrack, a rare Oliver Wallace demo of a song discarded before the film was complete. &nbsp;Have a listed to, &ldquo;The Boatswain&rsquo;s Song.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then disembark from the show into Old New Orleans with the classic, &ldquo;River Boat Shuffle&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A familiar tune from a very funny cartoon, "The Humphrey Hop" from the Disney short, "In The Bag" gets a Mouse Lounge Mix treatment. &nbsp;The song was so popular it was re-arranged and provided lyrics and released in 1956 as a single.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record. &nbsp; This week we present the 1982 read-along of, &ldquo;The Story of Tron&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">For more than four years, The Mouse Lounge has been entertaining listeners with an informative and irreverent view of Disney. &nbsp;On the "Extinct Attractions Club Podcast" Liana lent her depth of knowledge and sense of humor, quickly becoming a fan favorite. We are thrilled and excited to announce "Liana Behind the Mickey Bar" as a regular feature. Belly to the bar with us, as we discuss the world of TRON!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">From the Walt Disney Archives: &nbsp;Direct from the archives, learn about the history of the sometimes maligned but nonetheless visually groundbreaking picture, TRON. &nbsp;Also, in honor of Mickey&rsquo;s Birthday, who turns 82 the day this episode was released, we dig really deep into the stacks and pull out a 78 from 1937. &nbsp;Have a listen to &ldquo;Billy Murray&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Mickey&rsquo;s Birthday Party.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West. &nbsp; This week we continue our tech tour with a trip in Tomorrowland on Buzz Lightyear&rsquo;s Astro Blasters!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;"><br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.25in;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;We'll close this week&rsquo;s show a pair of tracks that produce the thunderous pulse that is the sound track for ElecTRONica&rsquo;s Laserman!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record. &nbsp; This week we present a Disneyland Little Long Playing Record. &nbsp;First, listen to a short biography about the incomparable Disneyland Story Reader, Robie Lester followed by her exquisite telling of the Story of Sleeping Beauty! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">Next: a special Mouse Lounge mini-documentary about the history of the 1959 feature film, Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West. &nbsp; This week we feature a slight departure from our typical ride-thrus. &nbsp;So often we walk through Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland on our way to our favorite Fantasyland attractions. &nbsp;This time, we stop just beyond the castle bridge and listen; to hear a beautiful medley of music from the films that define the Fantasyland sound experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">We'll close this week&rsquo;s show with a trio of unique interpretations of Sammy Fain&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Once Upon a Dream&rdquo;. &nbsp;First, from the six disc superset, &ldquo;A Musical History of Disneyland&rdquo; we board King Arthur&rsquo;s Carousel and hear a fantastic arrangement for Stinson Band Organ. &nbsp;Then, we&rsquo;ll delve in a bit of Disney Bubble Gum Pop and hear Emily Osments auto-tuned performance. &nbsp;And just about when three minutes of Disneymania convinces you there&rsquo;s no such thing as talent, have a listen to the original Aurora and Prince Philip, Mary Costa &amp; Bill Shirley from the re-mastered soundtrack.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">Enjoy!</p>

<div>"Shermania!"</div>
<div>(((HEADPHONES RECOMMENDED)))</div>
<div>Produced as a tribute to Disney Legends, the Sherman Brothers, "Shermania!" the film began life first as a song. &nbsp;Robert and Richard Sherman's Father, Tin Pan Alley tune-smith, Al Sherman, told his boys to follow the three S&rsquo;s when writing songs: make them&nbsp;singable,&nbsp;simple, and sincere.</div>
<div>With that ideal as inspiration, composer Jerry Ranger and author/lyricist Cynthia Ferrell co-wrote the song, "Singable, Simple, and Sincere". &nbsp;The song is performed by Tess Ferrell, now lead singer in "Big Band Beat," a broadway-style show on the American Waterfront at Tokyo DisneySea.</div>
<div>The film, now titled, "Shermania!" was shot over the course of two days in August 2010 in Los Angeles and Thousand Oaks, California, under the direction of&nbsp;Cynthia Ferrell &amp; Brian McDonald and stars Tess Ferrell and Jerry Ranger. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Other credits include:</div>
<div>Cinematographer: Tim Carr</div>
<div>Editors: Brian McDonald, Chuck Lewis &amp; Nick Brosco</div>
<div>Boom operator and production support: Gary Chambers</div>
<div>Script supervisor: Nancy Friedman</div>
<div>Musical arrangement &amp; performance: David Vasquez</div>
<div>Recorded, mixed, &amp; mastered: Jeff Lewis at Moonlight Studios, Los Angeles</div>
<div>With special thanks to Gregg Sherman</div>
<div>The film is distributed by the Mouse Lounge Podcast</div>
<div>Enjoy!</div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">In this episode, the Mouse Lounge brings to life what takes place in space in Tomorrowland.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record. &nbsp; This week, from a Disneyland Record 1957 release, Jiminy Cricket and Walt Disney narrate &ldquo;A Day at Disneyland&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">From the Walt Disney Archives: &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll go back in time and have a listen to the two-longest lived attractions in the Disneyland&rsquo;s Tomorrowland South building,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West. This week, we travel flashback to 1987 and take in the Captain EO Tribute!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">We'll close this week&rsquo;s show with a couple of space-themed tracks. &nbsp;First Kingsley &amp; Perry&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Spooks in Space&rdquo;. &nbsp;You&rsquo;d be right if you guessed this was the duo that wrote and recorded the original &ldquo;Barouque Hoedown&rdquo; used in the Main Street Electrical Parade. &nbsp; We&rsquo;ll finish out the episode with the perky and optimistic Sherman Brothers tune, Miracles from Molecules.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .25in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode, the Mouse Lounge tumbles down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record. &nbsp;This week Walt introduces the tale of Alice in Wonderland, and then told on Disneyland Records ST-3909, the Magic Window Series! &nbsp;Listen to the first half in the podcast, then log in to the multimedia section of mouselounge.com to download the second half.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Walt Disney Archives: &nbsp;Walt gives a tour of the Disney Studios to Winston Hibler under the auspices of being during production of Alice in Wonderland. &nbsp;While purely a promotional puff piece it is nonetheless worthy of playback for its nostalgia value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West. A year before the first major expansion of Disneyland that was to add the Matterhorn, Monorail, and subs, on June 14, 1958, Alice in Wonderland, the attraction opened. &nbsp;Adjacent to The Mad Tea Party and Mr. Toad&rsquo;s Wild Ride, this dark ride has always been exclusive to Disneyland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll close this week&rsquo;s show with a musical excerpt and live performance, both from Disneyland. Lifted from the soundtrack of the hopefully temporarily defunct Parade of Dreams, have a listen to the Alice Unit. &nbsp;Then have a seat in front of the old upright on Coke Corner as Alice and the Mad Hatter do their level best to organize the chairs for a mad tea party!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

In this episode of the Mouse Lounge, we trip the Christmas lights fantastic and over a few toys in the process.
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week from a dusty box of LPs we drop the needle on some classic vinyl.  From Disneyland Records catalog ST3913, enjoy Walt Disneys Babes in Toyland!  
<p>
<br>
From the Walt Disney Archives:  A young Walt Disney performs as Mickey and himself in 1934s Heinz Hall of Fame Christmas Stocking.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.   This week, not so much a ride-through, but a musical trip through the holiday season, with the Disneyland Band in their annual Christmas Concert.  I am told the band will improve its selection of singers from the audience in the coming year.
<p>
<br>
We close this week’s show with four of my favorite holiday tunes.  They may not be Disney, but they’re special to me and hope they will be to you too.
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<p>
<br>
In this episode of the Mouse Lounge, celebrate 70 years with the one that started it all, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. 
<p>
<br>
From the Walt Disney Family Museum: In a darkened theater filled to overflowing at the D23 Expo, I had the honor of sitting in the presence of true Disney legends and experts.  Producer, Don Hahn moderates a panel discussion about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  
<p>
<br>
In attendance were animator, Andreas Deja, who invoked life into Scar in the Lion King, and Gaston in Beauty and the Beast, Eric Goldberg, responsible for animating the Genie in Aladdin, and directing the jaw dropping Rhapsody in Blue and hilarious Flamingo with a Yo Yo sequences in Fantasia 2000, Disney historian and author, J.B. Kaufman, animation historian and prolific writer, Charles Solomon, and special guest, looking dazzling at 90 years young, Marge Gower Champion, the live action model for Snow White.
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  
<p>
<br>
This week we serve up a triple feature.  At the beginning of 1938, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was taking America by storm.  By using the radio medium, Walt was able to stoke the fire of his marketing machine promoting Snow White; while at the same time, entertaining a national audience.  On January 2nd 1938, a radio episode of The Mickey Mouse Theater hit the airwaves, coupling elements from the picture with other famous Disney characters.   Pay particular attention as Walt himself effortlessly goes from his natural speaking voice into character as Mickey.  
<p>
<br>
Next, scoop up slices of film from the cutting room floor and wonder, what if?  Have a listen right here to the marvelous but deleted soup sequence from Snow White.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.   This week, enjoy a one of a kind compare and contrast as you hear back to back versions of Snow Whites Scary Adventures, first in on the west coast in Disneyland then in Walt Disney Worlds Magic Kingdom.  There are striking differences between the two.   Which do you like better?
<p>
<br>
We close the show with unique takes from the soundtrack.  First from the newly remastered original soundtrack, the infectious Silly Song; then Satchmo Armstrong teaches you how to Whistle While You Work, and finishing with Ashley Tisdales turn at Some Day My Prince Will Come.
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

In this episode of the Mouse Lounge, we hop into our DC-3 and head south of the border.  Also, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
From the Walt Disney Family Museum: Listen as Walt describes the sights and sounds of the lands in Latin America.
<p>
<br>
Excerpted from Walt Disney -- The Triumph of American Imagination:  By 1940, the Walt Disney Studio had moved from Hyperion Avenue to the new Burbank studio still used today.  The financial windfall of Snow White was now a distant memory and Walt had two financial failures on his hands, Fantasia and Pinocchio.  The studio had been overrun by union organizers and production on Bambi was slowed to a crawl.  
<p>
<br>
Those crossing the picket line were working on Dumbo, fronted as a picture they could just knock out quickly.  While the lawyers were settling with striking workers in 1941, Walt needed to get away and find other projects.  He found it in a working trip to South America.  Learn about what prompted this material gathering tour of South America and the two unusual movies that resulted from it.
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week a very special mix from three films featuring Donald and Joe Carioca.   From 1944s, The Three Caballeros we meet Ya Ya selling cookies (and a little more) in the brilliant Baia sequence from the film.   Also from 1944 on Decca Records A-373 Charles Wolcott and his Orchestra perform the title track,  sung by Ray Gilbert.     Then, from 1948s Melody Time and 1943s Saludos Amigos, Joe gives Donald a lesson in the Rhythm of the Samba!
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.   This week, from the Mexico Pavilion in Epcot we have a listen to Mariachi Cobre and take a ride on El Rio del Tiempo.
<p>
<br>

This episode of the Mouse Lounge looks at Walt as futurist.  Also, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<P>
<BR>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week, we take a listen to the EPCOT promotional film.  Shot in October 1966, this classic footage was presented to would be  sponsors and the Florida legislature to present ideas and plans for the forthcoming Disney World.
<P>
<BR>
From the Disney Family Museum:   Learn from Walt’s own words what he thought the future would bring.
<P>
<BR>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.  This week we enjoy two journeys, one from the East coast, on the Tomorowland Transit Authority; and one from the West coast on the now defunct People Mover.
<P>
<BR>
We close this weeks show with a pair of tracks familiar in Tomorrowland, from the episode, Disneyland 61 from the Disneyland TV series, the Monorail Song and from Walt Disney at the 1964-1965 New York Worlds Fair, Progressland.

This episode of the Mouse Lounge is built with straw, sticks, and 
bricks, and relates to all three things three.  Also, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, 
Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<P>
<BR>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney 
film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week, we take in highlights from the classic Silly Symphony, Three Little Pigs.
<P>
<BR>
From the Disney Family Museum:   Learn about the music behind, Three Little Pigs with a terrific interview Leonard Maltin conducts with prolific Disney composer, Robert Sherman.
<P>
<BR>
Next, a slight deviation from the Disney domain with a pop cover 
homage to the number three.  This is a wicked cool track on target for the theme of the show.   
<P>
<BR>
Now, as Walt said, you may not be able to top pigs with pigs; but how about...frogs?
<P>
<BR>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney 
Park East or a Disney Park West.   This week we venture into 
Disneyland’s, Fantasyland for a trip into Storybookland.
<P>
<BR>
We'll close this week’s show with a rousing bonus Silly Symphony, 
The Woodland Cafe.

<p>
<br/>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week, from Walt Disney Record’s Storyteller series,1958s Cinderella, featuring a not quite Jiminy Cricket and the original cast.
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>
<br/>
We close this show with a trio of tunes from Cinderella.  The first is an operatic version on a theme from Cinderella by, uh…well suffice to say you must hear it to believe it.  Next, after taking in the original Bib-a-Dee-Bob-a-Dee-Boo we let the genius of Bobby McFerrin and Take 6 take over in a pair of a capella tours de force!

This week, the Mouse Lounge again takes you behind the scenes of Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom.  Join your host in the second of a four part series on the Keys to the Kingdom tour.   Also on the show, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week, the Mouse Lounge is full of beans; magic beans.  We have for you three very different versions of Mickey and the Beanstalk.  The first comes from its original context, the 1947 package film Fun and Fancy Free. 
<p>
<br>
The first run of Mickey and the Beanstalk is introduced and narrated by Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.  After we begin the story we’ll rewind the tape and hear the setup again, only this time with narration offered up by Ludwig von Drake and his Bootle Bettle, Herman from a 1963 episode of The Wonderful World of Color.  
<p>
<br>
Lastly you’ll hear our tale as told on a Disneyland Original Little Long Playing Record and your story reader, Lois Lane (and no, I am not making that up!)
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum:   Listen to Walt share his thoughts about critic accusations of being corny or producing picture postcard art.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.   This week from the hub in Disneyland take in a Mouse Lounge Mega Mix of Remember, Dreams Come True.
<p>
<br>
We'll close this week’s show with a trio of audio features.  First, we’ll take in the trailer of Disney Pictures upcoming fall release, Bolt.  We’ll segue into one of the cuts from the Bolt Soundtrack, a killer remix of Elvis Presley’s, A Little Less Conversation.  We’ll close the show with the rousing, True to Your Heart from Mulan.

<br>
This week, the Mouse Lounge takes you behind the scenes of Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom.  Join your host in the first of a four part series in the Keys to the Kingdom tour.   
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week, since we’ve begun summer, let’s spend some time with Donald on his vacation, circa 1947 on NBC Radio’s Story Shop.
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum:  On November 15, 1965, Walt, Roy, and Governor Hayden Burns held a press conference at Orlando’s Cherry Plaza Hotel.  Have a seat amongst the reporters and listen in as Walt discusses plans for The Florida Project.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.   This week from 2008’s DPN Westfest, enjoy a packed and enthusiastic theater in Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room.  This is a Mouse Lounge Mega Mix which makes use of both live and on board recordings of the attraction.
<p>
<br>
We'll close this week’s show with a collaboration between Thomas Newman and Peter Gabriel.  From the Wall-E soundtrack enjoy Down to Earth the haunting Horizon 12.2 by Thomas Newman.
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<br>
This week, the Mouse Lounge takes a trip to the antebellum south and Critter Country.  Also on the show, a full docket of Disney News from our departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
In our Get to know the Disney Podcasters segment we have a seat in the lounge with the man behind the golden Window to the Magic microphone, Paul Barrie.
<p>
<br>
No trip to the South would be complete without great music. The Disneyland Band is up to the task with a New Orleans themed Concert in the Park.
<p>
<br>
Each week in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.    This week take an audio journey into Song of the South.  First, excerpts from a delightful radio promotion featuring Johnny Mercer, Walt, and members of the cast.  Then again join Johnny Mercer and his group, the Pied Pipers and the original cast on the 1947 Capitol Records DC-116, the Tales of Uncle Remus.  
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum take a journey in the making of Song of the South with excerpts from a Special Exhibit about the film.  We then turn to the unabridged audio book, Neal Gablers, Walt Disney the Triumph of the American Imagination for an in depth look into the film and the politics that surrounded it.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.   Have a listen to Tim O’Brien, Senior Editor of Amusement Business Magazine and Imagineers Kathy Mangum and the late Bruce Gordon as they talk about the making of this weeks featured attraction, Splash Mountain.  
<p>
<br>
Then, grab your parka as we hop into a log for a spectacular ride through of the Magic Kingdoms version of the attraction.
<p>
<br>

We close the show with a beautifully swinging arrangement of Sooner or Later as sung by the incomparable Dinah Shore.
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<br>
This week, the Mouse Lounge finds some fun in Fantasyland.  Also on
the show, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business.
<p>
<br>
The Mouse Lounge kicks off a new segment this week, Get to know the
Disney Podcasters. We have a seat in the lounge this week with that
double trouble duo talking Disney, from Mouse Guest Weekly, Dan and
Eric.
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum:  Walt talks about his definition of
happiness.  Whom he envied may surprise you.
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney
film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  Here from Disneyland Records DQ-1342, The Mouse Factory we listen to The
Donald Duck Song and Uncle Scrooges his Rocket to the Moon.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.   As homage to the recently passed Ollie Johnston whom, as you hear later in the show, was a backyard
railroader we present the Casey Junior Circus Train in Walts Original Magic Kingdom.
<p>
<br>
We close this weeks show with a tribute to Ollie Johnston.  From the
Disney Family Album and other documentaries we hear Ollie tell his
story in his own words.  Listen then to master animator Glenn Keane as he discusses Ollie's drawings and the inspiration for his style before Snow White.  Lastly we hear some final thoughts from Ollie from his last interview in July, 2005.  Thanks Ollie.
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<br>
This week, the Mouse Lounge stakes a homestead in Frontierland.  Also on the show, as always, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
In From the Vault we present Roy Rogers and the Songs of the Pioneers telling the tale of Pecos Bill.  This true album of three 78RPM records was originally released on RCA records in 1949, six years before the inception of Disneyland Records.  
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East or a Disney Park West.   Since we're in Frontierland (and by popular request) we have a seat in Slue Foot Sue's Golden Horseshoe for a rip roarin' performance of Billy Hill and the Hillbillies.  This is an (almost) unedited performance played to a packed housein the original Magic Kingdom and the energy is wonderfully contagious!
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum:  Walt talks about how the studio produced pictures for children.  Or did it?
<p>
<br>
We close the show with Sarah Mclachlans poignant heartstrings tugging performance of When She Loved Me from Toy Story 2.
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

This week, the Mouse Lounge hangs a right at the hub, ambles down the former Avenue of Flags and into Tomorrowland.   Also on the show, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record: Here we present our first in  a series of biographies about Walts, Nine Old Men.  This week, the resident eclectic eccentric: animator, director, academy award winner, trombonist, and backyard railroad engineer…Ward Kimball.  Learn in his own words about his relationship with Walt, how he stoked Walts passion for backyard railroading, the Firehouse Five + 2, and listen to a hilarious clip from the Groucho Marx television game show tour de force, You Bet Your Life.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West.   This week from Disney Parks East we go into the Land Pavilion in Epcot and ride Living with the Land.  While in Futureworld, this is a ride into the past as this trip is through the attraction with the now long gone live narration.
<p>
<br>
In Disney Parks West we head into Tomorrowland in the Magic Kingdom and rack up some points on our way to become a Galactic Hero on Buzz Lightyears Astro Blasters!  
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<br>
This week, you can almost smell the freshly popped buttered popcorn and hot fudge as the Mouse Lounge takes a stroll down Main Street, USA.   Also on the show, a full docket of Disney News from our departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record: This week, the Mouse Lounge presents a production from toymaker Mattel, Your Trip to Disneyland.  With a total running time of 9 minutes, 32 seconds this audio comes from five 78rpm discs released not long after Disneyland opened.  
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West.   This week from Disney Parks East we go into Tomorrowland and ride the Carousel of Progress.  While showing its age, it still feels like an old comfy pair of slippers you wear around the house on weekends.
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum:  Walt talks about, The Idea for Disneyland.
<p>
<br>
In Disney Parks West we head into DCA and enjoy the newly recorded Muppet Vision 3D.  This recording includes the hilarious pre-show, so be sure to wear headphones for this one.  
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<br>
With Mouse Lounge Martini in hand, I'm your host Gary Chambers.  Welcome, to the Mouse Lounge.
<p>
<br>
To voice your comments, ask a question, or make a request, send an email to mouselounge@gmail.com or leave voicemail at 805-215-0277 for later playback on the show.  Lastly, if you like the show, be sure to post a review for the Mouse Lounge Podcast on iTunes.
<p>
<br>
Visit Mouselounge.com anytime for detailed show notes, theme park blog, and multimedia downloads that accompany each show. 
<p>
<br>
This week, the Mouse Lounge sees spots and goes to the dogs.   Also on the show, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business.
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record: This week, the Mouse Lounge takes a trip to Hollywood.  Not Disney's Hollywood Studios, but rather the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood California to see 101 Dalmatians on the big screen.
<p>
<br>
The film has been beautifully restored, but what really made the evening of January 18th special was the unique panel discussion prior to the picture's screening.  Join host Leonard Maltin and animator Eric Goldberg, actress Lisa Davis, animator/sculptor Blaine Gibson, and Imagineer, Alice Davis as they reminisce and comment about this sleeper Disney film.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West.   This week from Disney Parks East we head over to the Imagination Pavilion in Epcot and take a ride with Figment on Journey into Imagination.  Then take a trip back in time by going to the multimedia section of Mouselounge.com and download the original incarnation of Journey Into Imagination.
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum:  With the country spiraling headlong into a near certain recession, it's refreshing to hear Walt share his thoughts about money.
<p>
<br>
In Disney Parks West we head north into Fantasyland for a ride on Snow White's Scary Adventures. 
<p>
<br>
Each week we feature a unique take on Disney music.  On this podcast, you knew it was comin', two very different versions of Cruella de Ville.  First, from Disneymania 5, Payden Panettiere gives us a very smacking good bubblegum dance track, followed by a salubrious arrangement by the incomparable Dr. John. 
<p>
<br>
Now, please keep your head, arms, feet and legs inside the podcast at all times.  Driver you're clear!

<br>
This week, the Mouse Lounge trips on Latin rhythms and purdy girls.   Also on the show, a full docket of Disney News from departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record: This week, listen to Decca Records three disk collection from Saludos Amigos.  This is a rare opportunity to hear the original soundtrack sans sound effects and dialogue.  Check out the multimedia section of Mouselounge.com to download side five, Tico Tico.  
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West.   This week from Disney Parks East we head over to Epcot and cruise with Donald, Jose, and Panchito on the Gran Fiesta Tour!
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum; Walt shares his thoughts about the South America handshaking tour that turned into a fabulous filming opportunity.  We then hear part of a WOR New York interview from 1947 with Jinx from the Tex and Jinx Show about how she and Walt met in Mexico.  There’s an undercurrent in this interview that makes me extremely jealous.
<p>
<br>
In Disney Parks West we head into Tomorrowland and take a ride on Space Mountain.  <p>
<br>
Each week we feature a unique take on Disney music.  On this podcast try to keep from dancing to Perfect World from the Emporers New Groove.  
<p>
<br>
Now, please keep your head, arms, feet and legs inside the podcast at all times.  Driver you are clear!
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/mouselounge/Epcot_-_Futureworld_-_Spaceship_Earth.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>Season Two kicks off with a preview of the all new Spaceship Earth from Epcot.<br/><br/>It took three days and nearly six hours of diligent waiting during Mousefest for this recording to become a reality.&nbsp; From my point of view Disney brass has made it very clear to cast members that they are not to divulge any details as to when the attraction will preview or for how long.&nbsp; In truth, they may not know!&nbsp; This evening (Sunday) the attraction walls were well staffed with low level CMs answering the incessant question.<br/><br/>VIPs clearly are being allowed privileged sneak peeks and guests are being brought in on a pacify the masses basis.&nbsp; <br/><br/>The attraction is not yet finished.&nbsp; Perhaps Disney is relying upon the feedback from podcasts such as this to learn which direction to take in order to put the finishing touches on the work.&nbsp; As focus groups and preview audiences are the norm in motion pictures it would make sense that the Mouse would like to know what you think of the current incarnation of this work in progress.<br/><br/>Log onto the DPN Forums and let your opinion be heard!<br/>]]></description>

<br>
This week, the Mouse Lounge celebrated Independence Day with this very special supplemental: The Mouse Lounge Fourth of July Special!
<p>
<br>
Featured in this show is the unique American experience from Epcot’s World Showcase American Pavilion.
<p>
<br>
First, enjoy the patriotic rhythms and melodies of the Fife and Drum Corp.  We follow the corp as they exit and into the rotunda where we hear a full set of the beautiful harmonies from the Voices of Liberty.  After their breath catching rendition of the Star Spangled Banner, we move upstairs and take in The American Adventure.
 <p>
<br>
As if that weren’t enough, the rousing applause dovetails into a very special American Trilogy performed by one of America’s best loved singers.  
<p>
<br>
Be sure to stay tuned all the way to the end of this stirring performance for a spectacular finale!
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<br>
This week, the Mouse Lounge goes to Adventureland!  Also on the show, a full docket of Disney News from our departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record: This week we listen to a very faithful audio rendition of the probably NOT so faithful Disney animated film version of Kenneth Graham's, The Wind and the Willows. The recording features most of the original cast including the wonderfully ‘fruity’, Eric Blore as eccentric Mr. Toad and J. Pat O' Malley as Cyril the horse.  This album was produced in 1949 on Capitol Records.  Be sure to check this week’s show notes for more details and images of the set.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West. This week in Disney Parks West, we present our featured attraction, Tarzan’s Treehouse <p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum; learn about the evolution of Adventureland from those who had a hand in creating it.<p>
<br>
From Disney Parks East, we head over to The Land Pavilion in Epcot and take flight on Soarin’. This is a unique Mouse Lounge mix of ambient audio and the studio soundtrack and should be a lot of fun.<p>
<br>
Each week we feature a unique take on Disney music. On this podcast, from ‘Walt Disney Takes You to Disneyland’ enjoy the fantastic Adventureland selection, composed and conducted by the great, Tutti Camarata.<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

       RATED PG FOR MILD ADULT LANGUAGE
<p>
<br>
This week in the Mouse Lounge: A full docket of Disney News from our departments Entertainment (including a GREAT guest correspondent!), Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
Each week in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  Walt may not have been an auto aficionado; practical transportation (with the notable exception of a backyard train) was his moteris operandi. He did realize however that car junkies and other addled nitwits that occupy the road make for some great comedic and educational material.
<p>
<br>
From 1950, we take in the entirety of Motor Mania. Now like several weeks ago with the short, Reason and Emotion this cartoon got the Ludwig von Drake treatment for the Wonderful World of Color anthology series. The difference however, is that the former was a wartime cartoon, and was edited for content when it was presented to television audiences. Motor Mania on the other hand is plain old Goofy silliness and the narration remains intact. That said, the delivery of the narration is much funnier with Ludwig, so that version is featured on the podcast.
<p>
<br>
Next up you'll hear a segment from the classic 1970 Dad, Can I Borrow the Car? If you’re at a computer, log into the multimedia section of mouselounge.com where I have posted the script from this sequence and screen captures as well.  Plus, without cheating (Google or Wiki, etc.), see if you can pick out who's narrating the short and who's voice is in the training film sequence. If you do get it, it'll be just barely. 
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West. This week in Disney Parks West, we present our featured attraction; Autopia. (Just kidding!)   Actually, what better way to exemplify a road trip than with one of the first loonies on the road, Mr. Toad on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. 
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum; Since The Walt Disney Company has recently reacquired the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and announced a December release of Oswald shorts on Wave VII of the Walt Disney Treasures series, hear in Walt's own words how he lost the character and what happened to him. 
<p>
<br>
From Disney Parks East, we head over to Epcot and Futureworld and take a wild ride of our own, on Test Track. 
<p>
<br>
Each week we feature a unique take on Disney music. On this podcast, enjoy a special Mouse Lounge Mix from the movies, with fantastic references to cars and their drivers. This is a real hoot!
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!
<p>

<p>
<br>
This week in the Mouse Lounge:  A full docket of Disney News from our departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, and Business 
<p>
<br>
Each week in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  It has long been thought that the Mickey Mouse Club lead-ins recorded in 1955 were the last time Walt ever voiced the famous mouse.  With a recent discovery in the Disney Archive, that is no longer true.  Presented in 1962 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, Walt filmed a special Cinemascope presentation of, Disneyland USA, interacting with a costumed Mickey Mouse performing live on the stage.  The voice of Mickey is irrefutably Walt.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West. This week in Disney Parks West, we present our featured attraction; Pirates of the Caribbean recorded in January 2007.  From the sounds of bayou water lapping up against the side of the boat, to the rattling percussion of cannon fire; don your headphones and do not miss this exceptional ride-through.
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum; Listen to Walt as he talks about his relationship with the new medium of television and how that leads to the beginnings of Disneyland.  Then hear Diane Disney Miller as describes to Leonard Maltin those days when she was very young and she and her sister Sharon used to spend Saturday afternoons with their famous father at the then new Disney Studios in Burbank.
<p>
<br>
From Disney Parks East, we head over to the Magic Kingdoms Liberty Square, just in front of the docked Liberty Belle at the Pirates and Princess Party and take in a set of the Riverboat Roulettes.  They wrote the third song in the set, Jolly Roger, which was re-tooled and used on the pirate hijacked Liberty Belle throughout the party.
<p>
<br>
Each week we feature a unique take on Disney music. On this podcast, enjoy the Dixieland sounds of New Orleans, Disney-style as we take in a set of the Firehouse Five Plus two, traversing thirteen years.  One number is from their 1949 debut album, The Firehouse Five Plus Two Story, while the other two songs in the set are from Live from the Golden Horseshoe in Disneyland, circa 1962.
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

			<title>Mouse Lounge Supplemental: An Evening in World Showcase</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/mouselounge/an_evening_in_world_showcase.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[(((HEADPHONES STRONGLY RECOMMENDED))) 
<p>
<br>
I consider this show supplemental because it doesn't even remotely resemble the Mouse Lounge format. 
<p>
<br>
In this departure, we take a clockwise musical tour of most countries in World Showcase, sampling live music from each. I have selected what I consider to be the best from each set recorded last week. 
<p>
<br>
Mexico: Mariachi Cobre 
All the musicians in this group are outstanding vocalists. The soloists in this number are fantastic examples. 
<p>
<br>
Norway: Spellmans Gledge 
While the audience wasnt exactly enthusiastic, there is no shortage of musicianship in this group. The double-bass player was using a decrepit old thing that sounded wonderful! 
<p>
<br>
China: Si Xian 
Anne plays a modern 21-string floor standing harp. About the size of a pedal steel guitar with both nylon and steel strings, this instrument sings in her capable hands. 
<p>
<br>
Germany: Oktoberfest Musikanten 
What can I say...Uber Oom-pa-pa! 
<p>
<br>
America: The Voices of Liberty 
Among the finest a capella groups I have yet heard, under the dome they sound absolutely spectacular! 
<p>
<br>
Japan: Matsuriza 
Taiko drumming that takes your breath away. See this fine group live whenever possible. 
<p>
<br>
Morocco: Mo Rockin 
Ethnic Moroccin rhythms fused with jazz and rock to create a sound that is utterly unique. This track features an absolutely incredible electric bass solo. The lead vocals are a bit hot (saturated) in this recording but the instrumentals more than make up for the technical shortfall. Listen for a foreshadowing to the next group, which is... 
<p>
<br>
United Kingdom: British Invasion 
Pure unadulterated kitsch, but great musicianship and loads of fun. 
<p>
<br>
Canada: Off Kilter 
The band was completely ON this night, and they closed out their set with a wicked jig. 
<p>
<br>
World Showcase Lagoon: Illuminations 
I wasn't happy with the raw, live Illuminations: Reflections of Earth audio. So, what you'll hear is a synchronized mix of live and on board (pre-recorded) audio to get the best of both! 
<p>
<br>
Five For Fighting: World 
A fitting tribute to World Showcase and a fine conclusion to the show. 
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!!
<p>

<p>
<br>
From Melody Time we hear the legend of the rootinest tootinest cowboy in the West! Nope, its not Woody; back in 1948, it was Pecos Bill. Not to be outdone, Riders in the Sky pay homage to Woody and his crew; from Toy Story 2, enjoy Woodys Roundup Medley.

<p>
<br>

<p>
<br>
This week in the Mouse Lounge:  A full docket of Disney News from our departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, News from the Ships, and Business 
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week we present what we call, Swing Disney; several shorts culled from the forties that have a beat you can dance to!  We start out with, All the Cats Join In, then Benny Goodmans After Youve Gone, both from Make Mine Music.  Then from Melody Time the Andrews Sisters sing about Little Toot and then we join Donald and Joe Carioca and that wacky Araquan as they Blame it on the Samba.
<p>
<br>
This week in Disney Parks West, we slide all the way to the back of the park on a dead night in Toontown and experience, Roger Rabbits Cartoon Spin.  The queue (not the queue line!) was almost empty so listen carefully for the story setup as we wander through.
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum; With Disneyland now running smoothly, Walt sought new challenges and found it when Pamela Travers finally agreed to let Walt film her classic tale of Mary Poppins.
<p>
<br>
From Disney Parks East, we take a classic adventure aboard, The Jungle Cruise.  With a hysterically pithy skipper on board, this trip around the rivers of the world is a real hoot!  Listen carefully for a simultaneous homage to Paul Barrie and a cough drop.
<p>
<br>
Each week we feature a unique take on Disney music.  On this podcast: We take a musical journey traversing the world.  From EPCOTs ground breaking parade that ran during the millennium celebration, we are reminded that America is among, a Tapestry of Nations.
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<br>
This week in the Mouse Lounge:  A full docket of Disney News from our departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, News from the Ships, and Business </p><p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week we feature from Disneys American Legends, the story of John Henry introduced by James Earl Jones and Narrated by Alfre Woodard.  
</p><p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West.  I do capture most live audio myself, but will give proper credit when its due. This week in Disney Parks West, we take journey through Americas musical past and take in the now Yesterland attraction, America Sings!
</p><p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum; tap into the well that was Walt and politics.  While he still considered his studio a fraternity, Unionization was on the rise in Hollywood and the Disney studio wasnt immune.  Nor was it spared the effects of the growing conflict in Europe which would soon hit very, very close to home.
</p><p>
<br>
From Disney Parks East, we cross the lagoon in Epcot and disembark in the America Pavilion where we hear the Fife and Drum Corp march into the square.  We then go inside the Rotunda and hear the Voices of Liberty perform a rousing rendition of The Star Spangled Banner.  Lastly we climb the stars and enter the theater to listen to, The American Adventure.
</p><p>
<br>
Enjoy!

<p>
<br>
This week in the Mouse Lounge:  A full docket of Disney News from our departments Entertainment, Theme Parks East, Theme Parks West, News from the Ships, and Business. 
<p>
<br>
Each week, in From the Vault we sample a clip from a classic Disney film, short, television or radio program, or Disneyland Record.  This week we feature a new segment, Revisionist Disney.  
<p>
<br>
Fans of the show, The Wonderful World of Color may remember a classic cartoon within a 1962 episode called, Ducking Disaster with Donald Duck.  The show featured Ludwig von Drake illustrating what can happen when you let emotion run away with your common sense.
<p>
<br>
What fans of the series may not know is this segment is derived from a 1943 Academy Award nominated short short called Reason and Emotion. Back during WWII this cartoon had a completely different connotation, as emotion was largely thought to be the lynch pin through which Hitler could wield his evil influence.

<br>
Join us in the Mouse Lounge as we compare the similarities and differences in the 1943 versus the 1962 audio tracks.  I think youll then understand why this segment is called, Revisionist Disney.  Logon to http://www.mouselounge.com/multimedia.html to follow along with the script.
<p>
<br>
Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West.  I do capture most live audio myself, but will give proper credit when its due. This week in Disney Parks West, we go to Disneys California Adventure and take in the High School Musical Pep Rally.  
<p>
<br>
From the Disney Family Museum, sit in on a conversation between Leonard Maltin and Diane Disney-Miller, Walts oldest daughter and learn about the future of the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco.
<p>
<br>
From Disney Parks East: Since closed for an extensive refurb, we head over to World Showcase in Epcot and take a ride on the one attraction whose viral soundtrack just might be more annoying than its a small world, El Rio del Tiempo.
<p>
<br>
Each week we feature a unique take on Disney music.  On this podcast, take a ride on the Old Mark Twain for a second helping of Satchmo goodness from a 1962 episode of the Wonderful World of Color, Disneyland After Dark.  
<p>
<br>
Enjoy!

Each week we present a high definition ride-through from a Disney Park East and a Disney Park West. I do capture most live audio myself, but will give proper credit when it is due. This week from EPCOT, we go shopping in Mouse Gear and catch the funky mechanical percussive rhythms of the stores soundtrack.

<BR>
From the Disney Family Museum, the Studio goes to war!
<P>
<BR>

This week we unearth the twenty-three year-old VHS cassette, The Wonderful World of Disney Double Feature and play a clip from Goofing Around With Donald Duck. This is a rare treat since this trip through Ludwig von Drake and Ranger of Brownstone hilarity still languishes in the Disney archives.

Enjoy (bump bump!)

<p>
<br>
This week in the Mouse Lounge, another Kissimmee Comfort Suites edition of the Mouse Lounge.  Fantastic audio about the Lilly Belle Riverboat.
<p>
<br>
First, take an audio tour of the vessel, with every clank, click, hiss, whirr, and rumble inundating your senses.  Then, cast off and listen to Mark Twain narrate as he navigates the Rivers of America.
<p>
<br>
*Bonus Track*
<br>
Recorded TODAY (Thursday, October 12) in the Canadian Pavillion!  The last track of Off Kilter's 5:30 set!  The entire performance will appear on a future show.
<p>
<br>
Once settled into my new digs out West, fresh full-size shows will resume.  I've some excellent material in the pipe.
<p>
<br>
Please send questions, requests, regrets and comments to mouselounge@gmail.com. You can leave voicemail at 206-909-7427.
