<p>Zach and Evan take a break from news and pontification, and are joined by JD and Sunny to have some fun. A long time ago, Zach and Brooks had an episode in which our heroes re-casted the entire Star Wars saga. It was another one of those episodes that had listeners yelling at their iPods about how right or wrong they were, but it was all in good fun. On this episode, our panel casts the major, minor, and cameo roles for a what-if Old Republic movie! They also share their long-overdue thoughts on this year&#8217;s SWTOR-MER character tournament!</p>

<p>Welcome to the third annual March Madness tournament for Star Wars: The Old Republic!  If you’re new to MER, you should feel free to go<a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/2011/04/15/mer-episode-36-bracket-buster/"> back and listen</a> to the last two years’ editions of this special event, wherein the hosts matched up classic Star Wars characters to each of SWTOR’s Classes and debated the age-old question: in a straight-up fight, who’s gonna win?</p>
<p>The first year, we didn’t know any of the advanced classes so we only had eight spots to fill. Year two we knew all the AC’s and had to plumb the depths of the Expanded Universe to fill out the brackets. This year, now that the game is actually out and we’ve been playing for several months, we are switching things up and drafting the brackets with each classes’ first two companions!  Why the first two only?  It’s the least biased and most spoiler-free way to do this and still have fun.  Also, we won’t be the ones picking the winners.  We will be leaving that up to you!  This won’t be a one night brawl either.  Each day, we will post a new match-up which you can cast your vote for in our forums. The person with the highest amount of votes at the end of the day will win and move on to the next round. We will continue to do this throughout the entire bracket until we reach the end. -</p>
<p>So, get your office brackets set, start your betting pools, and since the fate of your favorite companion depends on votes, get your friends in on it and rally others to your cause!</p>
<h2><strong>Championship Round: Elara vs Vette</strong></h2>

<p>In this episode of MER, we are excited to introduce a special guest joining us from sunny California for a time of Q&#038;A. The wonderful &#038; talented <a href="http://www.cattaber.com/">Catherine Taber</a> was kind enough to come on our show &#038; explain what it was like to be a part of the recording process of Star Wars: The Old Republic. Catherine, who is the voice behind the Sith Warrior companion Vette, is most know for her role on the Clone Wars animated series as the actress who plays Padme. </p>
<p>In this episode she gives us an idea of her experiences with such a massive video game project &#038; shares a little insight on how things work behind the scenes. She also takes time to tell us about founding  Games for Soldiers, which we highly encourage MER listeners to check out. Don&#8217;t forget to thank her via <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cattaber">Twitter</a> for coming onto our show!</p>

<p>The first official week of The Old Republic is in the books and the MER crew has gathered to see how it&#8217;s going and look ahead to upcoming patches. Besides the recent patch 1.0.1, they also take a look at James Ohlen&#8217;s developer preview of the first big patch of 2012. Alan, Leo, Zach, and Evan lay down their thoughts, predictions, and only a few gripes regarding their experiences and what they&#8217;d like to see happen in the coming months. Also, they answer a whole lot of your questions and give us another update on the activities of MER&#8217;s official guild.</p>
<p>Quick note: iTunes did not show all of our recent 5-star reviews at the time of recording, but we do thank all that have left us 5-stars and we will give you the proper shout-out next week! Thanks again!</p>

Alan, Leo, Zach, and Evan lay down their thoughts, predictions, and only a few gripes regarding their experiences and what they&#039;d like to see happen in the coming months. Also, they answer a whole lot of your questions and give us another update on the activities of MER&#039;s official guild.

Quick note: iTunes did not show all of our recent 5-star reviews at the time of recording, but we do thank all that have left us 5-stars and we will give you the proper shout-out next week! Thanks again!

<p>Happy SWTOR launch eve! With the servers down in preparation for the big day, MER was still at work, taking a look at the past week&#8217;s Early Game Access and mulling over what changes the community is likely to see after the hard launch. Zach, Alan, and Evan welcome back the long-absent Dover of Darth Hater to discuss the resolution of the supposedly late deliveries and take a look at the first active week of the official MER guild, MERC.  Oh, and the winners of the Razer peripheral contest are announced. Pay attention, listen for your name, and contact the crew as soon as you hear it!</p>

<p>Zach and Evan return to form joined this week by not one, but two special guests!  Sunny and Radicool from <a href="http://sunnysdiner.podbean.com/">Sunny&#8217;s Diner</a> join the fray for this landmark episode where the crew can finally break their silence on beta impressions.  With the NDA having dropped, they mull over their initial reactions, gush, nitpick, and also go over some aspects of the Legacy system.  Then they get carried away talking about every nerdy thing possible, yet still find time to answer a LOT of your MERQ&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Get nerdy with the rest of the team at this episode&#8217;s forum thread.  Oh, yeah, it&#8217;s right <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=1870">here</a>.</p>

<p>Fearless leader Zach returns after a long, hard weekend at the BioWare Austin offices.  Guild Master Alan also joins the fray to share with Evan all the happenings at the second SWTOR Fansite Summit.  Although this event was not meant to be so much about new game material, they sure came back with a lot of it!  New flashpoints, new PvP, new hands-on with classes, and more.  Plus, they touched the Collector&#8217;s Edition box!  That big one in the picture!</p>

We recap everything from E3 and speculate every chance we get. </p>
<p>Joining us in the second half of the show is my good friend Brett Steinbrink aka Steiny. We reminisce about the raiding days of old in WoW and look ahead at Operations in TOR. If you still play WoW and are looking for a great 10 man raiding group <a href="http://www.animosity-cr.com/">check them out</a>. </p>

Hey guys and gals, we have kind of a special episode for you today. We are joined by Alan of our forums to discuss the latest Star Wars novel Deceived. Deceived takes place during the TOR time period and focus on three key characters, one of which is Darth Malgus. There are a lot of spoilers in this episode so if you are planning on reading the book you might want to finish it before you listen.</p>
<p>Also we have a contest that we are starting in this episode as well. The winner will get a copy of deceived that has been signed by Daniel Erickson and the rest of the SWTOR writing team. Even if you already own Deceived you still will want to tune to hear the details on the contest. If you are afraid of listening to the podcast because of spoilers but want the contest info we will post it shortly. Join in the discussion about this episode on our <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=904">forums</a>. </p>

<p>PvP details are here! In this episode we discuss, at length, what we experienced during our second day at BioWare Austin&#8217;s FanSite Summit last week. We were able to participate in several rounds of the Alderaan Warzone in SW:TOR and we&#8217;ll give you every gory and tantalizing detail.  Also, we discuss the latest breaking information on the next Warzone in SW:TOR.</p>
<p>Before we even get to the PvP, we’ll share our personal experiences with the Bounty Hunter and Imperial Agent classes in more detail.  Believe it or not, we have even more to share on top of Alderaan, Nal Hutta, and killing our fellows across the room.  So, get a snack, sit back, and enjoy as we bring you 90 minutes of SW:TOR&#8230; and kittens. Our first regular episode with the new duo is a big one!  Join in on the discussion in our <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=759">forums</a>!

<p>Everyone say hello to Evan Lewis and give him a warm welcome. Evan joins us this week as the new co-host for MER. If you haven&#8217;t heard the latest news by now, Brooks was recently hired by BioWare and is unable to continue being a part of the website. You can read all about that <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&#038;t=624">here</a>. </p>
<p>Since this is Evan&#8217;s first episode, we decided to do something special. As you may recall from last year, we did a SWTOR Class Bracket because Zach loves March Madness. We decided to do the same thing again this year, only step up the bracket size to 16 from 8. The main reason for this is to include the new advanced classes which weren&#8217;t announced last year during this time. </p>
<p>We have had a great time breaking down our thoughts on who would match up the best in a fair or &#8220;unfair&#8221; fight. If you want to discuss this episode, please feel free to head over to our <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=684&#038;p=7291#p7291">forums</a> and do so. </p>

<p>In this this week&#8217;s episode of Mos Eisley Radio we are joined by Stephen Reid (Senior Online Community Manager) and David Bass (Senior Community Coordinator) to discuss the ins and outs of planning a massive conference presence like PAX East. From booth design to queuing to why Bioware probably wouldn&#8217;t announce a release date at PAX, Stephen and David share some great insight into the community team.</p>
<p>Also, the time has come that I (Brooks) can announce this will be my last show with Mos Eisley Radio. Many of you know that I&#8217;ve been on the job search recently, and through a fantastic series of events, I&#8217;m joining Bioware as an audio editor on the creative services team.

		<itunes:summary>In this this week&#039;s episode of Mos Eisley Radio we are joined by Stephen Reid (Senior Online Community Manager) and David Bass (Senior Community Coordinator) to discuss the ins and outs of planning a massive conference presence like PAX East. From booth design to queuing to why Bioware probably wouldn&#039;t announce a release date at PAX, Stephen and David share some great insight into the community team.

Also, the time has come that I (Brooks) can announce this will be my last show with Mos Eisley Radio. Many of you know that I&#039;ve been on the job search recently, and through a fantastic series of events, I&#039;m joining Bioware as an audio editor on the creative services team. The best thing though? Mos Eisley Radio and Open Bounty aren&#039;t going anywhere! Zach has some great plans in place to continue to bring the community top notch discussions about SWTOR. I&#039;ve spelled out many more details and thanks on the show and on my &quot;goodbye thread&quot;.

Of course, we really want to hear your thoughts on the PAX East discussions, and there&#039;s no better place to do that than on our FORUMS!

<p>The past couple of weeks have been extremely exciting for Mos Eisley Radio. We&#8217;ve launched two new series, Podcasting in Basic and Open Bounty, and have received some fantastic response from the community thus far. That said, the podcast is still our bread and butter, and this week we sit down to discuss the news and hot topics from the past two weeks. Bioware has confirmed SWTOR&#8217;s presence at this year&#8217;s PAX East in Boston, and we dig into the possibility of a release date announcement, as well as other expectations for the conference. Also, story keeps rolling in with the addition of the 17th planet, Quesh. This triggers a discussion on planet size, and whether or not it actually matters to most players. Finally, we round everything out with the current status of playable species, and some comments from Lead Writer Daniel Erickson on why we haven&#8217;t seen more. Of course, we want you to give us your thoughts by joining the discussion of this episode on the <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=373">FORUMS</a>!</p>

<p>Happy TOR Year! Outside of some catastrophic delay to 2012, in mere months it&#8217;s very likely that we&#8217;ll each be rolling our very first toons in The Old Republic. We start the year off right by diving into some questions from listeners about servers, advanced classes, the official forums, and even the lore-heavy world of lightsaber crystals. </p>
<p>The advantages of PVP versus PVE servers were laid out right alongside the decision we would have to make at level 10 if the advanced class choices remain permanent. Based on replies from questions sent out via Twitter, we also take a hard look at the state of the official forums and why most of our listeners tend to avoid them. While we didn&#8217;t have it in time for the official show, be sure to check the notes below for an official word from the Senior Online Community Manager, Stephen Reid. The podcast is rounded out this week with some observations about lightsaber crystals and whether or not Jedi or Sith players should be able to choose any color of the rainbow. As always, we would love for you to join the discussion of this episode on the <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=335">FORUMS</a></p>

<p>Publishing a podcast two weeks in a row? Unprecedented! But given the holiday spirit (and the finale of Brooks&#8217; collegiate career), it seemed fitting to put out a brand new episode. This week we&#8217;re joined by the SWTOR Editor over at <a href="http://massively.joystiq.com/">Massively</a>, Larry Everett. He&#8217;s been following The Old Republic just as long as we have (most of you should be familiar with his &#8220;<a href="http://massively.joystiq.com/category/hyperspace-beacon/">Hyperspace Beacon</a>&#8221; column), and for some reason it took us this long to have him as a guest. </p>
<p>Of course, this week was also saw the lifting of the embargo on information regarding the Jedi Knight, Consular, and the Jedi homeworld of Tython, dubbed Jedi Immersion day, that a few members of the press were shown back in November. Keeping with our recent trend, we used some of the bigger topics as basis for discussion about the current state of SWTOR and what the new info means for folks following the game. For some of the finer details, we&#8217;ve added links below. Amidst the new Jedi info we also cover everything from the control schemes used for DC Universe Online to the Sidekicking system in City of Heroes. Needless to say, we wandered a bit, but we think you&#8217;ll love the discussion Don&#8217;t forget to join us on the forums as well to give us your thoughts!</p>

<p>We asked for details about game mechanics, and Bioware answered with almost an entire month dedicated to The Old Republic&#8217;s crafting system, which will henceforth be referred to as &#8220;Crew Skills&#8221;. While on the surface the solution may seem simple, this is actually a very deep system that took us, well, mostly Brooks, a fair amount of time to wrap our heads around. Once we had things figured out, though, we ventured into some great discussions about what it means to be a crafter and the impacts that this system will have on how players interact not only with the crafting system, but with their companions as well. Also, since the both of us have just recently starting playing World of Warcraft again, we talk a bit about this week&#8217;s launch of Cataclysm and what Bioware stands to learn from the work Blizzard has done.</p>

		<itunes:summary>We asked for details about game mechanics, and Bioware answered with almost an entire month dedicated to The Old Republic&#039;s crafting system, which will henceforth be referred to as &quot;Crew Skills&quot;. While on the surface the solution may seem simple, this is actually a very deep system that took us, well, mostly Brooks, a fair amount of time to wrap our heads around. Once we had things figured out, though, we ventured into some great discussions about what it means to be a crafter and the impacts that this system will have on how players interact not only with the crafting system, but with their companions as well. Also, since the both of us have just recently starting playing World of Warcraft again, we talk a bit about this week&#039;s launch of Cataclysm and what Bioware stands to learn from the work Blizzard has done.

We want to offer a big thanks to Wraithgate428, Honey Dijon, mminer, and Steiny for taking the time to leave us reviews on iTunes.

<p>We&#8217;re back! The past month has given us some much-needed time to get caught up on our lives outside of the podcast, as well as make some decisions about the future direction of Mos Eisley Radio. Helping implement the first round of changes are very special guests, Kathy and Carla of <a href="http://corellianrun.com/">Corellian Run Radio</a>. The four of us had an absolute blast discussing the past month&#8217;s updates, including the most recent announcements regarding Warzones and Bioware&#8217;s decision to revisit the Jedi Wizard name. We also take a look into what all the fuss was about EA Louse, and the effects the situation has had on the community at large. Listen in and join us on the forums to discuss your thoughts!</p>

<p><a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=285">DISCUSS THIS ON THE FORUMS</a></p>
<p>I know it’s taken us a little bit longer than we had originally intended to get this out to everyone, but given the subject matter, we wanted to make sure we were approaching the topic with as much knowledge as possible. Of course, I’m talking about the <a href="http://ealouse.wordpress.com/">EA Louse debacle</a> that popped up a couple of weeks ago. Well, that’s sort of what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been following the community goings-on as of late will know that most of what was said in the rant in regards to TOR is pure conjecture with absolutely no basis in fact. What sparked my attention, and also the attention of TOROcast’s Fodigg in his most recent “Don’t Be Surprised If…” <a href="http://torocast.com/index.php/editorials/item/341-dbsi-mmo-gamers-hate-swtor">column</a>, is the inability for fans to defend our MMO of choice against the naysayers that came creeping out of the dark depths of the internet. Now is a very popular time to predict that The Old Republic is going to be a massive failure because of the lack of firm announcements regarding core game mechanics beyond the Fourth Pillar. The “Bioware, I’m rooting for you, but you’re shooting yourself in the foot” <a href="http://swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=217175">thread</a> has about 2000 replies and over 45,000 views. This is obviously a hot button issue.</p>
<p>Our question to you this week is a bit more general than it has been previously, but I feel that this topic warrants more of a 30,000 foot discussion rather than nit-picking certain issues. We want to know where you stand on the amount of information released beyond story and lore. A lot of people would love to see more about combat systems or crafting, but we’re curious to know why you’ve developed that viewpoint. Would knowing how PVP is going to work now affect your choice to play the game at launch 6 months from now? Or are you simply frustrated that you can’t come up with an answer for “Why should I play The Old Republic?” from friends and guildmates? Of course, any viewpoints in between are also extremely welcome.</p>
<p>As always, we would LOVE for you to join us on the forums, but you can also send an email or an MP3 reply to moseisleyradio@gmail.com. Thanks to everyone who’s continued to give us Twitter and Website plugs in our absence, and I can assure you we’re both incredibly excited to record the new show! Keep an eye out for it soon, we’ll be sure to keep you updated. </p>

<p><strong>Community Discussion</strong><br />
<em>Racial abilities</em><br />
-Majority of folks were extremely weary of racials. Either felt that they imbalanced the game or were completely useless.</p>
<p><em>I remember in WoW that the troll and tauren were the &#8216;best&#8217; for warriors because of their racial abilities. I hated that. If they give racial abilities, it better not sway towards which is race/species is better for class &#8216;x&#8217;. &#8211; Acaulescent (from The Imperial Guard)</p>
<p>Rodians and Mon Calamari were given bonuses to crafting and penalties to toughness or something along that line. Zabrak had combat and endurance &#8230; While there still were a lot of humans, it was more typical to see Zabrak Teras Kasi masters and Rodian Weaponsmiths. Now playing as a human Weaponsmith, I never had the success as my non-human competition. I constantly had to lower prices because my merchandise just wasn&#8217;t as good, and never could be because I was human. &#8211; Ben Nighthawk</em><br />
(Adaram brought up a possible situation almost just like this, but Ben’s point about the inability for Humans to be viable top-end crafters seems to go against Bioware’s previous decisions)</p>
<p>Blackferne has a <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2256#p2256">GREAT breakdown</a> from a theorycrafting standpoint as to why racials are a bad idea. <em>“So overall I&#8217;m against racials because I&#8217;d prefer racial diversity based on player preference, not because of theorycraft.”</em></p>
<p>-Some interesting ideas&#8230;<br />
<em>Perhaps there can be racials that are attached to your companions. Assuming players generally have access to several races as companions, this would be a way of implementing the concept without inspiring a player to choose a race based on racial alone. &#8211; Adaram</em><br />
(Mixtrate also brought this up, specifically in regards to KOTORII companions. For example, Visas Marr, the Miraluka, had “Force Sight”, and eventually passed that ability on to you. Also, the Wookie Hanharr had a “Rage” ability that would make him more powerful every time he killed an enemy.)</p>
<p>Kalak had a great way to evolve the Biographies system based off what was done with Neverwinter Nights 2<br />
-After you choose your race and class, pick a &#8216;package&#8217; of stat bonuses that increase a stat in one area, and detract from another<br />
-Related to what your character&#8217;s early days/childhood was like.<br />
-If your character was Rowdy as a child, he might have increased Strength and Constitution, but a negative of the same value to Intelligence and Wisdom.<br />
-Depending on how crafting and professions are done, you could pick a second package that would give you a bonus to a specific profession because, as a child or in your early years, you showed skill in that field</p>
<p>AxeFaktor had a great point that racials could be implemented in different ways for each specific class.<br />
<em>“For example let&#8217;s say as a trooper you can play as a human, a zabrak, a mon calamari, or a trandoshan. As a Zabrak you get better ranged damage. As a mon cal you get bonuses to crafting/upgrading weapons, armor, grenades, etc, like you get an additional upgrade slot to every weapon/armor or something. As a trando you get strictly better damage absorbtion/resistance abilities (due to your natural scaly armor) making you a much more effective tank. As a human, you get more skills/abilities to start, and more frequent opportunities to rank them up.”</em></p>

Community Discussion
Racial abilities
-Majority of folks were extremely weary of racials. Either felt that they imbalanced the game or were completely useless.

I remember in WoW that the troll and tauren were the &#039;best&#039; for warriors because of their racial abilities. I hated that. If they give racial abilities, it better not sway towards which is race/species is better for class &#039;x&#039;. - Acaulescent (from The Imperial Guard)

Rodians and Mon Calamari were given bonuses to crafting and penalties to toughness or something along that line. Zabrak had combat and endurance ... While there still were a lot of humans, it was more typical to see Zabrak Teras Kasi masters and Rodian Weaponsmiths. Now playing as a human Weaponsmith, I never had the success as my non-human competition. I constantly had to lower prices because my merchandise just wasn&#039;t as good, and never could be because I was human. - Ben Nighthawk
(Adaram brought up a possible situation almost just like this, but Ben’s point about the inability for Humans to be viable top-end crafters seems to go against Bioware’s previous decisions)

Blackferne has a GREAT breakdown from a theorycrafting standpoint as to why racials are a bad idea. “So overall I&#039;m against racials because I&#039;d prefer racial diversity based on player preference, not because of theorycraft.”

-Some interesting ideas...
Perhaps there can be racials that are attached to your companions. Assuming players generally have access to several races as companions, this would be a way of implementing the concept without inspiring a player to choose a race based on racial alone. - Adaram
(Mixtrate also brought this up, specifically in regards to KOTORII companions. For example, Visas Marr, the Miraluka, had “Force Sight”, and eventually passed that ability on to you. Also, the Wookie Hanharr had a “Rage” ability that would make him more powerful every time he killed an enemy.)

<p><a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=267">DISCUSS THIS ON THE FORUMS</a></p>
<p>Before we actually get to the question for episode 25, I want to let you all know that we’re hard at work on the new show, as well as bringing some new segments to MER to keep things lively after the con season. And keep in mind there’s a <a href="http://moseisleyradio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&#038;t=163">suggestion thread</a> stickied on the forums, and we would love to hear ideas from everyone on how we can continue to improve the show to be exactly what the community is looking for.</p>
<p>Now, the past couple of weeks have given us some fantastic updates: <a href="http://swtor.com/news/news-article/20100910">Corellia</a> has been announced as the 15th playable planet, looks at the Jedi classes with the <a href="http://swtor.com/news/news-article/20100917">“Designing the Light Side”</a> developer video, and especially the EPIC <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZHu_iEPkNY">Smuggler video</a> posted by Machinima.com. We recommend every check these out, as well as the detailed break-downs from <a href="http://darthhater.com/2010/09/16/smuggler-class-video-reveal-at-machinima/">Darth Hater</a> and <a href="http://jediarchiveonline.com/2010/09/anatomy-of-an-update-smuggler-trailer/">others</a>, before the next show. We’re incredibly excited to discuss what these will mean for the TOR community. However, for this week’s community discussion topic, we want to tackle a subject that we have been sitting on for a while now: Racial benefits, also known as Racials.</p>
<p>Bioware has previously approached this topic from, no surprise, a story-based standpoint in the form of player backgrounds. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect#Player_creation_and_character_classes">Mass Effect</a>, you could have been the sole survivor of a battle or a ruthless soldier, and overall these had little impact on your game. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Origins#Gameplay">Dragon Age</a>, your origin story played a much stronger role in your progression as a Warden. However, rarely has Bioware ever incorporated these backgrounds into specific in-game abilities. There are a number of MMOs who have used racials as a way to differentiate between the races or species beyond cosmetics.  For example, in <a href="http://lorebook.lotro.com/wiki/Category:Racial_Traits">LOTRO</a>, each race has an ability to quickly to return to their race’s home city. In <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Every_Man_for_Himself">WoW</a>, humans have a special ability to escape all movement impairment effects.  So our question to you is, <strong>how should The Old Republic implement racials?</strong> Would you like Bioware to build upon the biography model as a way to incorporate special abilities, or should they include the systems already in place in other MMOs?</p>
<p>We want you guys to be as detailed as you want on this one: everything from general ideas to which racial abilities a Chiss should have and why. As always, we want you to send us your thoughts either through the forums, email, or in the form of an mp3. When it comes time to record the episode, we will pull some of your comments and use them as a basis for discussion on the show.  Like I said, get detailed guys. This is also a great time to check out the forums if you haven’t already…there are some seriously great discussions going on over there, and I would invite everyone to check them out.</p>

<p>After taking an extra week to get used to new schedules and make sure we can talk about PAX as soon as possible, we&#8217;re back with a brand new episode of Mos Eisley Radio! This week we get caught up on all the details about space combat, the reveal of the previously unknown advanced classes, and all of the juicy bits so far revealed from last weekend in Seattle. We also get to discuss the community discussion topic about how space will fit into story, and we greatly appreciate everyone who took the time to share their thoughts. There is still a lot of information from PAX Prime to be revealed, so you can be sure it will be a major topic in episode 25!</p>
<p>We want to offer a big thanks to Zabalth, Reddog DL, Sgt Invincible, and Almighty Cow for taking the time to leave us reviews on iTunes.</p>
<p>Music for this show was provided by General Fuzz. Check out more of his work at <a href="http://generalfuzz.net">generalfuzz.net</a></p>

Will space be a completely set apart side experience that bears no meaning on how characters develop or will the missions provide important context for the quest lines we will find ourselves following? Of course, the development team has yet to show us, but we’re incredibly curious to hear YOUR expectations for how space will fit into your experience.</strong><br />

<p>This week we get back to the classic style of MER, breaking down the latest news and getting to the heart of community conversations. We get caught up on all the details for Space Combat and the new Jedi Knight advanced classes, and take a good look at the four new playable species. The community really brought their A-game for this week&#8217;s discussion topic, and they helped us dissect the concerns surrounding class restrictions. Also the mail bag has gotten significantly lighter, and we&#8217;ll continue to answer our backlog of emails in the next couple of shows.</p>
<p>We want to offer a big thanks to Rel82aStarkiller, Mesirav Darkcrest, Kathy from <a href="http://corellianrun.com/">Corellian Run Radio</a>, camensmasher, Robhellboy, Lordhammer from <a href="http://www.guildumbra.net/">Guild Umbra</a>, Timsobuff, Xavier, and Sebastian0 for taking the time to leave us reviews on iTunes.</p>

<p><strong>Stories From the Outer Rim</strong><br />
<em>Community Discussion &#8211; Class Restrictions</em></p>
<p><em>Listener Questions</em><br />
GoodRevan &#8211; Do you think there will be expansion packs released to keep things with TOR new and up to date, or do you think that this is a one off deal? And if there are expansion packs, do you think that they will add new planets, or weapons, etc?<br />
Couldn’t find an official word from Bioware, but it’s very likely there will be expansions</p>
<p>Mads from Denmark &#8211; I&#8217;ve been wondering for a while now, how much of a role the companion characters will play in the end game play of swtor. I loved them in both Kotor and Mass Effect and I wonder how much different they are going to be in this game. Specifically if you lose a character, lets say a healer-type, because they don&#8217;t like the way you do things, does that mean that you have a disadvantage in endgame? Are more than one of your companions capable of filling a certain role?</p>
<p>Sergio &#8211; Do you guys plan on making a guild in SWTOR?</p>
<p>Tygran &#8211; One major theme in most SW movies/books/games is redemption and the fall from grace. Do you think they will allow players to switch sides? Such as a Jedi losing his way and switching to Sith. Not sure how that would work for the other classes. If they did this, I would hope it would come with a cost such as a long quest chain and loss of abilities while you learned new ones.<br />
No faction swaps. Ever. &#8211; James Ohlen, Lead Designer</p>
<p>KondorHawx &#8211; Once the game comes out and we&#8217;re all enjoying the wonderful universe of Star Wars, what are your plans on the occurrence of the show? Weekly, bi-weekly?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that time again for a community discussion topic! We&#8217;re both incredibly excited to get back to the gritty details of the most recent news, some rumors, and most importantly, what you guys and gals are thinking about The Old Republic. For anyone new to MER (or in case you have forgotten), here’s how the community discussion topic works: The week before each episode we will put up a short audio clip detailing the new topic. We then want you to send us your thoughts either through the forums, email, or in the form of an mp3. When it comes time to record the episode, we will pull some of your comments and use them as a basis for discussion on the show. So, now for this week’s question…</p>
<p><strong>The recent announcement of the four new playable species for The Old Republic has brought to a head the conversation about non-human species being limited to specific classes. For example, this past week we learned that the Zabrak will be able to force-lightning their way through the game as Sith Inquisitors, and the blind Miraluka can force-feel their way through the world as Jedi Knight. While it has been announced that there are many details missing, including more race/class combinations, two primary schools of thought have come to light on this subject: Those who want a completely open system to create and customize their character exactly as they see fit, and those who defer to Bioware’s judgment. A strong argument for the latter is the possibility of some very detailed class stories based specifically on the history of a given species.</strong><br />

<p>Continuing with our summer of amazing guests, this week Scott Johnson of <a href="http://theinstance.net/">The Instance</a> and the <a href="http://frogpants.com/">FrogPants</a> network of shows joins us to discuss all things SWTOR! We take another step back to discuss what makes a great gaming podcast, whether or not Bioware has the formula in place to make a fantastic game (hint: they do!), parenting and MMOs, and in general completely geek out on our most anticipated game of the next year. We also hit the recent news, including the announcement of ship combat at Comic-Con 2010 and the newest playable planet (which is actually a moon), Nar Shaddaa.</p>
<p>Also, stick around after the show is over to hear us geek out even more on what we&#8217;ve been playing (mostly Starcraft II) and some of the games we&#8217;re looking forward to in the coming months.</p>
<p>We want to offer a big thanks to Rel82aStarkiller, Mesirav Darkcrest, Kathy from <a href="http://corellianrun.com/">Corellian Run Radio</a>, camensmasher, Robhellboy, and Lordhammer from <a href="http://www.guildumbra.net/">Guild Umbra</a> for taking the time to leave us reviews on iTunes.</p>

Well, with con season in full swing, the news cycle from Bioware starts to slow down and instead of putting out a show where we only discuss a few topics, we feel it’s better to let the news pile up a bit and then really tackle it with some great, in-depth discussion.</p>
<p>Speaking of discussion, we want to bring back the polls we did for a while in the form of community discussions. So here’s how it’s going to work: The week before each episode we will put up a short audio clip detailing the new topic. This could range anywhere from a piece of news released from Bioware or some ridiculous rumor we heard floating around the web. We then want you to send us your thoughts either through email or, preferably, on the forums. When it comes time to record the episode, we will pull some of your comments and use them as a basis for discussion on the show. Simple enough, right? Here’s the question for this week…</p>
<p><strong>The overall reaction from Bioware’s showing at E3 has been mixed. Some people, like us, were incredibly excited by the Hope trailer, player ships, and the small bits we saw of warzones. On the other hand, a lot of folks were disappointed with the conference. We want to know what your impressions were. Did Bioware do a good job showing off their work or could they have done much more. We’re also curious to know what you are looking forward to hearing at conferences like Comic-Con, GamesCom, and PAX in a couple of months.</strong><br />

<p><em>Hey guys,<br />
I have recently become a fan of your podcast, and it&#8217;s totally amazing! As I have never played an MMO before, but am a huge fan of the original KOTOR, so I think that I am willing to give this game a try. But I have a couple of questions (actually only one at the moment):<br />
Does it cost extra to create different accounts? Or like, could I play as a Smuggler, and then switch to a Bounty Hunter, and then to a Jedi, and then a Sith Warrior, on the same account, but be able to keep all of my characters? Like in KOTOR you could have several different characters and they were all separate. Is that possible in an MMO? Or do you need to pay the subscription fee for every single character that you have?<br />
Thanks for your time.</em><br />
-Stephen</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;d just like to tell you that it&#8217;s really fun listening to your radio show and i hope ya&#8217;ll keep them up. It&#8217;s very informing because for some people, like me,  dont get to hear the interviews and know the backgrounds of the designers and characters on the other games. I know a lot about Star Wars but not the ancient lore as a lot of people do, but i really enjoy any type of lore from other fictional world. Especially warcraft, starcraft, lord of the rings, and star wars. Thanks again for the service and keep it up!</em><br />
-Hunter</p>
<p><em>Love your podcast. Been listening to it since I stumbled across it last fall. I like your old outro music, but really love the outtakes. I have a few more podcast question then for SW:ToR.<br />
  1) how do you get on the zune store (ie I am itunes but looking to expand).<br />
  2) how do you play audio for both of you to listen to in Skype.</em><br />

<p>Advanced Class System before E3? We weren&#8217;t expecting that at all. The two of us venture into the details of the system, and speculate on what it could mean for the other classes. We also cover the newly added planet of Hoth, as well as the Inhabitants section of the Holonet. Like we mention in episode 17, there was a huge backlog of listener questions so we take the time to get caught up, touching on everything from land mounts to whatever happened to Revan and Bastila. And don&#8217;t forget to check out the new segment covering general Star Wars news. All that and more inside!!</p>
<p>We want to offer a big thanks to Farscape29, Twintwisters, and Darth_Entropius for taking the time to leave us reviews on iTunes.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Advanced Class System before E3? We weren&#039;t expecting that at all. The two of us venture into the details of the system, and speculate on what it could mean for the other classes. We also cover the newly added planet of Hoth, as well as the Inhabitants section of the Holonet. Like we mention in episode 17, there was a huge backlog of listener questions so we take the time to get caught up, touching on everything from land mounts to whatever happened to Revan and Bastila. And don&#039;t forget to check out the new segment covering general Star Wars news. All that and more inside!!

We want to offer a big thanks to Farscape29, Twintwisters, and Darth_Entropius for taking the time to leave us reviews on iTunes.

<p>It has been much too long since we&#8217;ve been able to record a new show&#8230;and the ridiculous amount of news we cover in episode 17 reflects that! Going all the way back to Voss, we touch on all of the updates through the new Developer Video #4 on Combat. In an effort to give new features like the &#8220;Inhabitants&#8221; section and the new webcomic the attention they deserve, we&#8217;ll be discussing those on episode 18. But there&#8217;s more here than just official updates! Based on the recent news around Blizzard&#8217;s Celestial Steed mount, we dive headfirst into a great discussion on micro-transactions and how Bioware will likely include them in The Old Republic.</p>
<p>We want to offer a big thanks to jg1001 and flippa299 for taking the time to leave us reviews on iTunes.</p>

<p>Holy crap PAX East was a blast! Between playing new games, sitting in on some great panels, and listening to the best in nerd music, we had our weekend cut out for us. The conference was a resounding success, and we&#8217;ve chosen to highlight some of the best games and panels we saw. But don&#8217;t fret! There&#8217;s also a solid amount of The Old Republic news to get caught up on, including discovery of the game testing portal, the addition of the Biographies tab, and a word from Damion Schubert on group XP versus solo XP. All that and more! Give it a listen and let us know what you think in the comments.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Holy crap PAX East was a blast! Between playing new games, sitting in on some great panels, and listening to the best in nerd music, we had our weekend cut out for us. The conference was a resounding success, and we&#039;ve chosen to highlight some of the best games and panels we saw. But don&#039;t fret! There&#039;s also a solid amount of The Old Republic news to get caught up on, including discovery of the game testing portal, the addition of the Biographies tab, and a word from Damion Schubert on group XP versus solo XP. All that and more! Give it a listen and let us know what you think in the comments.

<p>After taking a month off, we knew you guys would want a packed show&#8230;and we&#8217;ve delivered! Beyond catching up on all the recent news like Belsavis and the Consular developer blog, Darth Hater&#8217;s Emlaeh joined us to talk about her hands-on experience with the Trooper last week at LucasArts. We also get to the listener questions that have been sitting in the inbox for a while, and our pal JD joins us for an Old Republic class March Madness! Hope you all enjoy the long format, and we look forward to bringing you our experience at PAX East next week.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Episode Poll</strong><br />
<em>Which Unannounced KOTOR planet should be added to the game?</em><br />
-Kashyyyk (36%, 24 Votes)<br />
-Dantooine (27%, 18 Votes)<br />
-Yavin System (19%, 13 Votes)<br />
-Manaan (13%, 9 Votes)<br />
-Rakata Prime (Lehon) (5%, 3 Votes)</p>
<p>&#8220;I’d love to see them explore Dantooine where it says “Buried beneath the deserted Enclave was a hidden facility in which the ancient Jedi Knights carried on mysterious cloning experiments.” in the wiki link. I love the idea of the serene planet surface, but beneath the surface are either jedi ghosts or decayed jedi walking around doing immoral experiments for warped and skewed reasons that were at one time good.

-Lazenca</p>

-Axe Faktor</p>
<p><strong>Listener Questions</strong><br />
What are your opinions on flyable ships as opposed to the system in KOTOR where you were automatically taken to another planet?<br />
-Sith Tyro Revan<br />
<em>Check out Gordon Walton&#8217;s <a href="http://darthhater.com/2010/03/12/gdc-biowares-walton-on-adding-space-combat-to-star-wars-galaxies--customer-retention/">thoughts on space combat</a></em></p>
<p>So I have played (and will play again) the Star Wars pencil and paper D20 RPG game. It plays really similarly to D&#038;D and both KOTORs adapt a bunch of their play styles from it. The big difference between it and D&#038;D is the weapon damage. You would have similar HP, but the weapons just shell out tons of damage, both for the heroes and mobs. Do you think this would be an appropriate play style for SWTOR? Having tons of damage dealt from you and to you, speeding up the game play. Or do you think it should be slowed down to match other MMORPG&#8217;s?<br />
-Peter Corey</p>
<p>Hi guys great cast been listening for a few months now. Just wondered what you guys think the planet areas are going to be like and what you will be hoping for in respect to size and exploration. Obviously there will be a lot of instances within open areas for solo and different size groups/raids but what would you like from the open areas? You talked a little about exploration with regards to SWG and Krayt dragons and a little on easter eggs which will be cool to come across but what would you really like from the open areas with respect to size/ random spawns/ gated areas or not?/ random,scripted,GM events/ cool things/ crafting nodes and drops&#8230;&#8230;.etc.<br />

<p>With Con season right around the corner, the news from Bioware has just barely been trickling out. But that&#8217;s okay! With a month break from the show, we&#8217;ve had plenty of news pile up to talk about including a new Holonet entry, a Dev Blog on the Sith Inquisitor, and the newly announced playable planet, Taris! It&#8217;s not all news either, as we launch into an epic speculation rabbit hole about the nature of the Spring 2011 release announcement. You won&#8217;t want to miss it!</p>
<p>Also, we want to extend a huge thanks to JThompson6577, DEDMON5811 (who left a seriously hilarious review and has been active in the forums as well), and Peterisjustok for taking the time to leave us reviews on iTunes!</p>
