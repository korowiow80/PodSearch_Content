What is Kingdom Tunes?

Kingdom Tunes is a group of Christian (Bible Believing Christ Following) Servant/Artists who have set aside a portion or all of their musical talents and recordings to be given and distributed freely to all who will have it. Kingdom Tunes is not a record label or a distributor of any sort. It is simply a place where Servant/Artists can freely give what was freely given to them, and thus making Kingdom Tunes also a place where anyone can access the music and art of those in the Servant/Artist group, and hopefully be inspired and blessed by the service.</itunes:summary>

There is such a simple and powerful expression of adoration and worship that is reflected in these short lines. When I don&#039;t know what to pray and when I feel anxious, I just reflect on this prayer and God seems to put things into their right perspective.

Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

    <itunes:subtitle>Well, I have given this much thought.  And, while I don&#039;t think that it will really change anything at all, I have decided to put all these songs and future songs into the &quot;Public Domain&quot;.

    <itunes:summary>Well, I have given this much thought.  And, while I don&#039;t think that it will really change anything at all, I have decided to put all these songs and future songs into the &quot;Public Domain&quot;. 
What does this mean?
Well, previously, all songs were under a creative commons license that allowed people/artists to download, share, and even add to the music as long as credit was given to the contributing author and not made commercial. But as I thought about this I felt that even those loose restrictions are not suitable for this music or it&#039;s contents. So according to wiki, public domain is...&quot;an intellectual property designation for the range of content that is not owned or controlled by anyone. These materials are &quot;public property&quot;, and available for anyone to use freely for any purpose.&quot;
It seems to work for me. Do I think everyone should go &quot;Public&quot;? I think everyone should seeks God and follow His leading on what to do with their art. For this art, this is it.
But what if someone takes your songs and makes a fortune off of them, and never gives you credit?
MY response is this: the glory in these songs is meant to point to Christ. So the glory, or credit, was not mine in the first place. So wherever these songs find themselves, they will always be giving credit where credit is due...GOD.
The only exception to the public domain for this site will be anything that I collaborate on with other artists. For those songs, I will be respectful of the licensing wishes of the other artist.

Broken people sharing a perfect message. As God fills us he sends us. As followers of Christ, we are called to share His love and message with the world around us. Even when we feel too broken or flawed to do so. But our shortcomings should not stand in the way of our service and outreach, because even our greatest abilities and our shiniest days fall way too short in comparison with Christ and His greatness. But God calls us and He sends us with His spirit so that we can become the hands, eyes, and feet of Christ to the weak the hurt and the broken.



So don&#039;t wait until you have your act together to serve and share God&#039;s love. Just ask God for His spirit which He freely gives. And His spirit will enable you do spread the good news with those around you, in a way that you could never do on your own.</itunes:summary>

    <itunes:subtitle>I was going back over some old posts and this one stuck out. I thought I would release it again. Let me know your thoughts....

    <itunes:summary>I was going back over some old posts and this one stuck out. I thought I would release it again. Let me know your thoughts....

I&#039;ve been thinking a lot lately about what it means to be a &quot;Servant Artists&quot;. When you take those two words and put them together it&#039;s almost an oxymoron. Yet I feel like this is something that God is wrenching in my heart. Here what I mean...

“Servant”. Servants are concerned with one thing, their master. Everything the servant says and does is in service. That is, they do not think about how something will affect them, or to what loss it would be for them to serve. A servant&#039;s actions point to and honor those they serve. They are not concerned with fame or fortune, because that is not the fuel behind their deeds. They are driven by a heart of humility, debt, and gratefulness. They don&#039;t treat others as beneath them, but rather they lift them up. Self promotion is not in their vocabulary. They serve with confidence, not in their own gifts to serve but in the freedom of service they have been given.

&quot;Artist&quot;. In a commercial sense, artists strive to be noticed. They must be noticed to survive. Being seen and heard is what makes them important. Humility is just another label that is used for promotion. In this sense artists must always be selling themselves. This is what I would consider as a common perspective of an artist in today&#039;s culture.

In a more generic sense, artists create to bring attraction to and inspire thought on the subject of their art. This is the definition of &quot;artist&quot; that I would like to marry to the word &quot;servant&quot;.

So what is a &quot;Servant Artist&quot;? What does their art look like?

A servant artists are artists whose art is created in such a way that it points to and honors the one it was created for. Their desire to create is not driven by attention or wealth, but rather it is moved by a humble, indebted, and grateful heart. They want the spotlight to be moved to the one they serve, the subject of their art. Their art points attention to the beauty of the subject. Their hope is to be a highlighter for the beauty of their master (the salt on the table, not the centerpiece).

The best example of this is seen the life of Christ. He humbled himself for our sake. He turned down earthly riches and power for our eternal hope. He came to serve not to be served. Always pointing to the Father in word and with demonstration through creativity and humility. He is exalted of God, not of himself. That is the image of a true servant artist.

God, give us the grace to follow your lead and live as servant artists; using artistic expression to bring your beauty and splendor to the forefront.

    <itunes:subtitle>There are good parts of life and there are not so good part; mountains and valleys; victories and defeats. God gives us, through His spirit, a peace that is outside of our surroundings, and only dependent on Him.

    <itunes:summary>There are good parts of life and there are not so good part; mountains and valleys; victories and defeats. God gives us, through His spirit, a peace that is outside of our surroundings, and only dependent on Him. 

This song is about worshiping, following, and honoring God when the circumstances are against us, and when the circumstances are with us.  Because on both ends of the scale it is easy to forget our dependence on Him for peace, joy, hope, love, life...

In the valleys we doubt and questions, we are prone to feel that God has left us. On the mountaintop, we easily forget that God is our provision and our hearts can quickly fill with pride. 

The place to strive for is not on the mountain and it&#039;s not in the valley. Our desire needs to be in a relationship with the living God. Because when we are in relationship with Him, the rest are just details.
God Bless,
Dan</itunes:summary>

This is song is about jump starting that heart of flesh into the love and passion we have in Christ. I find that this is a daily (if not bi-daily) thing I need to do to keep focus on the prize. This focusing is renewing our hearts and minds in Christ, and dying daily to ourselves. Of course we must submit to God and His spirit. This is what gives us the ability to renew.

    <itunes:subtitle>This song focuses on the tangible experience of God&#039;s embrace when our hearts are dry and broken, God&#039;s touch can bring warmth and healing.

    <itunes:summary>This song focuses on the tangible experience of God&#039;s embrace when our hearts are dry and broken, God&#039;s touch can bring warmth and healing. 

We know that God does not stop with the experience of His presence, however it is in those moments that we are able to setup a flagstone, a marker in our journey to remember His presence and strengthen our faith.

The tag on this song is a side note that I might expand on later.

&quot;With our hands in the air, a songs we will sing, all good comes from You, and to You all our praise.&quot; 

This is something God is working in me. It&#039;s the idea that when we use our hands in worship, we are declaring that our value does not come from our works and the things we are able to produce with our hands. But rather our value comes from God, because he is the maker of all things that are good. So then to Him all the honor and praise belongs. More on this later...-Dan

    <itunes:subtitle>I decided to create a website community called &#8216;Kingdom Tunes&#8217;[www.kingdomtunes.com]. Basically just a community of artists that would like to offer their music for free in a similar way to More Rain.

    <itunes:summary>I decided to create a website community called &#8216;Kingdom Tunes&#8217;[www.kingdomtunes.com]. Basically just a community of artists that would like to offer their music for free in a similar way to More Rain. 

	There will be a regular podcast specifically just for the Kingdom Tunes site that will feature the submitted songs. And if an artist submits 5 or more songs then a unique podcast will be created for that artist.

	There are two primary purposes for Kingdom Tunes.

          1. To facilitate a community of servant artist who 
              choose to offer their music as a free service to lift us 
              others and build up the body of Christ [the Church]  

          2. To encourage each other in helping those in need of 
              fresh water, food, and shelter in the world. The goal 
              is to build up website traffic and leverage that traffic 
              100% to provide aid to those that need it.

	Things are still in the makings, but the more artists we can get involved the faster we can make this dream a reality.

	Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome to not only share our songs of worship freely, but also to provide help for the less fortunate in the same effort?

	Help spread the word.

    <itunes:summary>For a period of about 5 years I was the worship leader for my churches youth group. I remember having my first opportunity to lead for that group. I was so excited and passionate about experiencing God&#8217;s presence through worship. God&#8217;s presence was very real and very clear to me in the first year of leading. I remember instances where students would just come to the front as a sign of their devotion to God. I also remember seeing the hunger in those students&#8217; lives to experience a relationship with God that was deeper than any program or religion could fill. They were hungry for intimacy with God, and it showed in the way they worshipped God at those meetings. They sang their hearts out.

	After that year passed it seemed like every following year I was striving to recapture the passion and expressions of that first year. It&#8217;s funny because during that first year I remember wishing that I could make changes to the band and to the style of music we played. Then when the second and following years came I was able to implement some of those changes, but things felt like they got off center. So I tried to change back and still nothing was quite like the expression and passion of the first year.

	Looking back after those 5 years I see now how even though our expression in music was never the same as that first year, God&#8217;s presence was increasingly with us. More and more students began to reach out to each other and to the community. There was a passion for God, but the students just weren&#8217;t as excited about the music. I wish I would have realized this in those last 4 years. Too much stress and wasted energy went into trying to re manufacture God&#8217;s presence through music.  

	It wasn&#8217;t until the last year that it started to sink into me. Before I was teaching and reinforcing that worship isn&#8217;t about the music, but I was still chasing that expression and I wanted other to chase it as well. Then that last year I remember a weight lifting off my shoulders as I realized that chasing God is more valuable than chasing the expressions and experiences of worshiping Him.

	Expressions will fail, but a relationship with God endures. Seek God.

	The point of this whole podcast thing is really for me to give this stuff out freely. I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone for selling their music (whether it be for music or for art (if there is a difference)). It is just where God has me right now. 

	If anyone would like to for whatever reason put these songs onto a CD for resell, then I would like to discuss this before hand.
