				<title>The Problem in Nonresidential Real Estate: How Big, How Bad, How Soon?</title>
				<itunes:summary>The valuation declines that have laid waste to the housing market have also impacted commercial real estate with values reported to NCREIF down 25% from the peak through 2Q 2009.  As with the housing market, there is weakness in demand for commercial space bringing occupancy down across property types to lows not seen since early in the decade. Although supply is less of an issue this time, the concentration of construction activity in a few markets will add to the overhang of space created by the recession.  Property owners that need to roll-over their balloon debt are faced with the loss of securitization financing and tightened standards among the commercial banks that have been their stalwart investors.  Is this slow-motion train wreck large enough to warrant a TALF II financing program or generate the second-leg down in a W-shaped recession?</itunes:summary>

				<title>Are Foreigners Losing Their Interest in U.S. Investments?</title>
				<itunes:summary>Despite extremely low yields, foreign investors flocked to the safety of U.S. Treasury securities last autumn. However, budget deficits as far as the eye can see are causing some investors to question whether the relatively low yields of U.S. Treasury securities adequately compensate them for the risk of potentially higher inflation. Will foreign investors eschew U.S. Treasuries and other fixed income investments? What are the implications for the external accounts of the United States and the value of the dollar?

Dowell Myers, Professor and Director, Population Dynamics Research Group, University of Southern California.

Falling home prices characterize this business cycle and are now affecting manufacturing industries indirectly as consumers retrench, moderating the demand for durable and non-durable goods and then feeding back to orders and production.

Specifically, the nation’s power delivery systems could be expanded to accommodate electric vehicles.

				<title>Global Health Care: Medical Travel and Medical Outsourcing</title>
				<itunes:author>Milica Bookman and Rudy Rupak</itunes:author>
				<itunes:summary> Global competition is an emerging trend in the health care industry, as a growing number of high-quality health care facilities in developing countries have begun catering to so-called "medical tourists" or "medical travelers" from other countries. Uninsured patients and those from countries where care is rationed by waiting are also attracted to high-quality health care that is up to 80 percent less expensive than the cost of care in the United States. The speakers are Prof. Milica Bookman, Saint Joseph’s University , author of a new book, "Medical Tourism in Developing Countries," and Rudy Rupak, founder and CEO of PlanetHosptial, a firm dedicated to connecting patients with health care facilities abroad. Teleconference held 7/25/2007.</itunes:summary>

				<title>Death Spirals, Summer Swoons, Volcanic Rebounds and All That--Whither Goes Steel?</title>
				<itunes:author>Peter F. Marcus</itunes:author>
				<itunes:summary> Steel is pervasive in manufacturing, touching virtually every manufactured product. The steel industry has undergone profound change, with manifold implications for manufacturing. A wide array of forces is affecting the steel price outlook making it hard to read clearly at the present time. In this important teleconference, Peter Marcus of World Steel Dynamics examines the transition from the old continuum to the new continuum for steel, metallics supply and demand, consolidation, and the implications for pricing power among steel suppliers.  This teleconference is a must for any manufacturing company, trade association, or observer of this important industry. A paper is available for NABE members.

				<itunes:summary>Concerns about the subprime mortgage market have been making the news lately. In the last NABE Outlook, subprime mortgage lending was identified by the NABE forecasters as posing the greatest risk to financial markets.

Take a closer look at this issue from the viewpoint of the mortgage banking industry with Douglas Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association; from the standpoint of the credit ratings industry, with David Wyss, chief economist of Standard and Poor's; and from the standpoint of Fannie Mae, with chief economist David Berson.

				<title>NABE Podcasts- Preliminary Estimates of R and Ds Role in GDP Growth</title>
				
				<itunes:author>Carol Robbins, Cliff Waldman and Jeremy Leonard</itunes:author>
				<itunes:summary>Innovation is considered one of the drivers of economic growth. The U.S. spends more on R and D than any other country in the world and that is thought to be one of the country’s economic strengths. How much does R and D contribute to GDP growth? What role does R and D play in innovation and what other factors are important in that process? The Manufacturing Roundtable is pleased to announce a NABE teleconference on the topic of Innovation and R and D in the U.S. economy. Our speakers will be Carol Robbins of BEA and Cliff Waldman and Jeremy Leonard of the Manufacturers Alliance. Carol Robbins, the director of the R and D satellite account project, will discuss the preliminary estimates of Rand D’s role in GDP growth. Cliff Waldman and Jeremy Leonard will discuss their research on innovation and its determinants, the work they have done to model innovation in the U.S. manufacturing sector and the role R and D plays in innovation.

				<title>Transfer Pricing Economics- Issues Raised By The IRS Proposed Cost Sharing Regulations 4/27/06</title>
				
				<itunes:author>Russell Kwiat, George Carlson, Dan Peters, John Wills</itunes:author>
				<itunes:summary>U.S. tax regulations permit companies within an affiliated group to share the costs of developing technology and other valuable intellectual property. In establishing a new cost sharing arrangement (CSA), invariably a key issue is how much the cost sharing participants should pay for the rights to existing or in-process IP that will be used in the development of new IP under the CSA. The IRS has been concerned that some taxpayers have used existing regulations to justify low buy-in payments for CSAs and, as a result, transferred valuable IP to offshore entities, often in tax advantaged locations, with inadequate compensation to the U.S. parent company. In response, the IRS issued proposed regulations that would change the way buy in payments must be determined. Central to the proposed regulations is an income method, which is new to the transfer pricing regulations but is commonly used in other valuation contexts. A distinguished panel of practitioners and current and former government officials will discuss some of the key economic issues raised by this proposed change in the cost sharing regulations.

Hear about the economics of climate change: stock externalities, discounting, distribution of costs, and mitigation (quantity, price, and technology). Bob Shackleton has served as a senior analyst in the Macroeconomic Analysis Division at the Congressional Budget Office since 1999, working on climate change, global demographics, retirement preparation, and international remittances. From 1991 to 1999 he worked on climate issues at the Environmental Protection Agency.
