      <description>The show continues through our &quot;break&quot;.  This time Thunder Down Under joins the show to do what else?  Flirt with our 3rd mic girl.  JP breaks in our new co-host in with what  JP calls the best thing on the internet.....we are not so sure.  Speaking of not being sure Thunder Down Under makes one hell of a clap.......kidding this isn't that kind of a comedy show....ehhh....Thunder Down Under finds a way to make JP uncomfortable in one ball clinching 30 minutes of &quot;Holy shit I hope I brought a napkin&quot; radio.  Later the producer/announcer of the Offensive TV Network comes on to give us some of what to expect.  We have a feeling this network won't be alive long nor will anyone associated with it.  Uninentional gay moments and a lot more.....Just download it already.</description>

      <description>The unofficial hiatus show continues through summer with Ricky and Jazzy.  On this show: how Jazzy is into a lot of guy stuff.  Age of consent and related subjects like stripping were brought up.  What is best the part of going to a strip club?...the Food duh.  Food talk continues briefly that'll make you hungry and blow your diet while listening to us.  To fix that the image of 'water fall period' will be in your head after hearing this.  To fix that sex talk.  Small or big?  What you would do if you could hide your identity and JP joins the show and discusses his marathon of hell catching up on Harry Potter</description>
