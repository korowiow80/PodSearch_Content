			<title>Class 11:  The Third Noble Truth-- The End of Suffering and the 'end' of our class with Thich Chan Phap Hai, Thich Chan Phap Ho, and Sister Chan Bich Nghiem</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Thay, Dear Sangha, Dear Virtual Community</p>
<p>Today, we close our Three Month Winter Retreat and our Moment by moment class. &nbsp;The Third Noble Truth--the end of suffering is discussed by our teachers. &nbsp;We are encouraged to look into our suffering and to be aware of what is real and how much we create in our own mind. &nbsp;What is our real experience and what is suffering because that is what we label it? &nbsp;We are reminded that the path is not a straight line and our view of our suffering can change depending where we are on the path.&nbsp;We are reminded that we are not just one thing, we are many things. &nbsp;We can look deeply to see where we have a skillful relationship with our suffering and where we have a not-yet-skillful relationship. As&nbsp;our monastics recite, 'when a monk goes into the world, he looks straight ahead and walks mindfullly'. &nbsp;May we all cultivate the ability to stay compassionately on the path--walking with mindfulness and concentration. &nbsp;In this way, we offer our beauty, presence, and practice each other. &nbsp;Our practice is not a conceptual exercise, it is one to be lived in real life, moment by moment, each and every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our teachers ask, does anything really end? &nbsp;With Right View we see there is no beginning and no end. &nbsp;Our course has ended, but it has also just begun as the 3,000 practitioners in 40 countries who are following the course walk mindfully into the world. &nbsp;We bow in gratittude to all of you and to our wonderful teachers who show us the way in this life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find your path. Enjoy your step. Enjoy your breath. Treasure your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

			<title>Class 10: The Second Noble Truth, the Cause of Suffering with Thich Chan Phap Hai</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://deerpark.libsyn.com/class-10-the-second-noble-truth-the-cause-of-suffering-with-thich-chan-phap-hai]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, we learned about the first turning of the wheel-the recognition of our suffering and our situation. &nbsp;With the second turning of the wheel, Thich Chan Phap Hai encourages us to explores the causes of our suffering. &nbsp;We learn more deeply about the three poisons-- Greed (or 'ever-seeking' or 'always wanting'), Hatred (or ill-will or 'closed-down heart') and ignorance or delusion (not ignorance as in lack of learning but in the inability to see things as they really are). &nbsp;These are the three roots of suffering that the 4 noble truths offered by the Buddha will transform leading to liberation. The weekly practices focus on 'bare recognition' or 'bare experience' and handout includes many important readings.</p>
<p>Tonight's talk is a beautiful offering of the dharma that is practical for us to use. &nbsp;It offers guideposts that help us on the journey in the Dharma that each of us must experience for ourselves. &nbsp;We hope you will find it immediately useful and effective.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Virtual Family:</p>
<p>For the past 8 weeks, we have studied the Noble 8-fold path, the 4th of the 4 Noble truths. &nbsp;In a kind of Zen order, we have studied the last, first. &nbsp;Tonight, we look into the first of the Four Noble Truths- The Existence of Suffering/Stress. &nbsp;Thich Chan Phap Ho (Protection of the Dharma) guides us to look deeply into the fact that we have suffering, what it is, and how to handle it. &nbsp;We can bring our awarness to the reality of our suffering and bring our courageous Buddha nature in us to face it and not run away any more. If we can cultivate the courage and stability in ourselves necessary to turn toward our suffering, we are closer to the peace and freedom offered by our practice. &nbsp;We aren't afraid and we don't need to run away any more. &nbsp;We can look at the base situation and see what is the real suffering and what is our mind adding to the situation. &nbsp;Our teacher discusses the three poisons and the things that our suffering is often attached to. &nbsp;Remembering the original fear and the original desire, we can liberate ourselves in this life. &nbsp;Together, we can reflect on how transformation happens within us, and how we can be as alive and transformative as &nbsp;the beautiful Deer Park compost pile!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, sit with stability, breathe deeply, and enjoy this talk. &nbsp;It can bring a lot of healing to ourselves, our families, and our world.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Tonight we learn about another step on the Noble Eight Fold Path- Right Livelihood.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends</p>
<p>Tonight we are offered a very inspiring and empowering teaching on Right Effort. &nbsp;Right Effort is the first in the Concentration Triad of steps on the 8-fold path, the place where we are able and ready to collect our mind. &nbsp;At this point in our training, our mind begins to calm down. &nbsp;Right effort in Buddhist teaching is not hard labor. &nbsp;It is appropriate attention or appropriate effort. &nbsp;We will learn how to examine what we are being fed by others and what we are feeding ourselves. &nbsp; We are offered a clear, basic definition of mindfulness and you will share in the creation of helpful new acronyms-- THNYA and THAA. &nbsp;There is also a pop-quiz on the Prajana Dyad so be mindful! &nbsp;Best of all, you will be given the best homework in the world history of teaching-- the requirement to be lazy.</p>
<p>The handout is here&nbsp;<a href="http://deerparkmonastery.org/teachings/moment-by-moment/course-material-week-6/view">http://deerparkmonastery.org/teachings/moment-by-moment/course-material-week-6/view</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome Back and Happy New Year to our virtual Dharma classmates!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed your holiday and were offered many beautiful opportunities to cultivate, enjoy, and share your practice.&nbsp;Tonight's class is on Right Action. &nbsp;Sr. Bich Nghiem shares that the practice of Right Action can help us be happier. &nbsp;Right action means right action of the body, the practice of being in touch with love and preventing harm, &nbsp;non-violence, and doing everything in mindfulness. She shares that our actions need to be good for ourselves <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>for others to be right action. &nbsp;If it is good for others and not good for ourselves or good for ourselves and not good for others, then it is not right action yet. &nbsp;We review the 1,2,3, and 5th mindfulness trainings. &nbsp;You will also learn how to share the &nbsp;dharma with snakes and our other animal friends.</p>
<p>Enjoy your practice and see you next week.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Dharmacast Family:</p>
<p>We hope you are having a wonderful winter (or summer depending on where you are) and are enjoying the fruits of your practice.&nbsp;We continue with the <em>Moment to Moment</em> exploration with today's class on Right View. &nbsp;The handout can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://deerparkmonastery.org/teachings/moment-by-moment/course-material-week-2/view">http://deerparkmonastery.org/teachings/moment-by-moment/course-material-week-2/view</a>&nbsp;and it is highly encouraged that you download and review this. &nbsp;It provides much wonderful information and insightful suggested practice ideas and reflection questions that can be put to very beneficial use by an individual or a sangha. &nbsp;We learn from Sr. Bich Nghiem how to bring the joy of practice into our daily life. &nbsp;She also offers a reminder that, at their base, all views are wrong views (having only one point of viewing) but that, through practice, the quality of our views can always be improved.&nbsp;</p>

"<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 14px; background-color: #efefef;">This is the final Dharma talk offered by Thay in the Together We Are One Retreat at Deer Park Monastery on the North American Tour, on September 11th, 2011. Thay shares compassion, love, and great understanding: Understanding of suffering allows compassion to arise, and the energy of compassion can be very healing. You feel much better after having understood your own suffering. <span>&nbsp;</span>And your own suffering reflects somehow the suffering of the world. That is why once you have understood your own suffering, it is much easier and easier to understand his suffering, her suffering. <span>&nbsp;</span>And when you are able to see the suffering in him and in her you're no longer angry. <span>&nbsp;</span>He goes on to share about right view and how it can free us from notions of being and non-being. He finishes the talk discussing what is right action.'</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends</p>
<p>Today's talk is from the annual Meditation and Education Retreat at Deer Park Monastery. &nbsp;Dharma teacher Sister Huong Nghiem shares insights about the practice and offers beautiful teachings for the group of students and educators gathered at the retreat. She urges us to look for and find the teacher in ourselves and to find ways to be in the drivers seat of our own lives. &nbsp;We meditate to see what should be done and doesn't need to be done. &nbsp;She asks us to look to see if we want to react to life or respond to life. &nbsp;If we practice, we can see what we want from our lives.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this beautiful talk.</p>

			<title>Verse 13 of 14 on Meditation:  Not discriminating between the practice offered by the Tathagata and that of the ancestral teachers</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://deerpark.libsyn.com/verse-13-of-14-on-meditation-not-discriminating-between-the-practice-offered-by-the-tathagata-and-that-of-the-ancestral-teachers]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Verse 13 &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Not Discriminating</p>
<p>Between the practice offered by the Tathagata and that of the ancestral teachers,</p>
<p>the Four Noble Truths perfectly interwoven</p>
<p>should serve as the foundation of an authentic transmission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thay Phap Hai offers a deep class today reminding us that the universe has a way of teaching us the lesson we are ready to learn. &nbsp;We alsways want to ask, "How does this teaching help me to transform?" &nbsp;If it doesn't it is not the right teaching at this time. &nbsp;The dharma should be immediately useful and effective.</p>
<p>The reflections for this week are:</p>
<p>What is my experience of giving and receiving?</p>
<p>Is it easier for me to give or to receive?</p>
<p>Why do I think this is?</p>
<p>Enjoy this wonderful class.</p>]]></description>

<p>We are so happy and thankful to Thay Phap Hai for this beautiful teaching. &nbsp;The readings are also a wonderful reminder how much all of us non-monastics owe Anathapindika. &nbsp;He is the one who, on his deathbed, shared with the sangha that us laypeople could understand the deep teachings of the dharma. &nbsp;Let us live in such a way as to be worthy of his confidence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflection Questions:</p>
<p>1) Do I notice times when I feel the need to be right? How does this manifest in&nbsp;thought, word and action?</p>
<p>2) What situations do I notice more of a push to be right, or to prove my point?&nbsp;How does this feel in my body? In my mind?</p>

Dear Virtual Study Group
We apologize for the delay in posting. &nbsp;We are only able to upload 250 MB a month so when we exceed our limit we have to wait a bit. &nbsp;We hope you will understand as the podcast is run on donations and volunteer time.
Here is Verse 9:
Emptiness, signlessness, and aimlessness
liberate me from suffering,
so that in my daily practice
I am not caught in mere intellectual understanding.
Our Sister reminds us that we can learn to let go, that we already have everything we need inside of us. &nbsp;We can stop running, stop aiming, and make use of what we already have.
A good reflection is to look at our life right now and find out what is making us feel not free. &nbsp;
This beautiful sharing is closed with the deep insight, "Thank you for allowing myself to see myself more."
&nbsp;Enjoy

			<title>Verse 8 of 14 verses on meditation:  Impermanence is one with nonself</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://deerpark.libsyn.com/verse-8-of-14-version-on-meditation-impermanence-is-one-with-nonself]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends</p>
<p>Tonight, we are introduced to the concepts that can, with practice, become our reality. &nbsp;Thay Phap Hai reminds us that intellectual understanding is not one with wisdom and that whatever we learn we always have to ask 'how does this apply in my life?' &nbsp;We also are introduced to interdependent co-arising which is at the core of the buddhist teaching. This is, because that is.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 8</strong></p>
<p><em>Impermanence is one with nonself.</em></p>
<p><em>Nonself is one with interdependent origination,</em></p>
<p><em>is one with emptiness, is one with conventional designation,</em></p>
<p><em>is one with the middle way, is one with interbeing.</em></p>
<p>Please enjoy this very deep teaching on Verse 8</p>]]></description>

<p>Dear Thay, Dear Sangha</p>
<p>Tonight's teaching is on the 7th Verse. &nbsp;Thay Phap Ho shares that we can be aware that our happiness depends on my mindful attitude and not external conditions. &nbsp;We review the 4 recollections and we are encouraged to seek to recognize what is bringing happiness and joy to our lives. &nbsp;The Mindfulness Trainings are discussed and we can see that if we are practicing and living according to the Mindfulness Trainings we are at peace because we are not regretting anything.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>Dear Friends on the Path,</p>
<p>Here is the teaching on Verse 6.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Verse 6</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Looking deeply into the heart of reality</em></p>
<p><em>to see the true nature of things,</em></p>
<p><em>practicing vipashyana enables me to let go</em></p>
<p><em>of everything I am searching for, my desires, and my fears.</em></p>
<p>Our sister shares the teaching with us that the practice is to be closer to our hearts. The more I know myself, the more I can connect with what is outside.</p>
<p>There are some wonderful suggestions for reflections that we can all benefit from too for the new year.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Reflections: &nbsp;Ending a year and starting a new:</strong></p>
<p>- what nourishment did 2010 offer</p>
<p>- what were the challenges</p>
<p>- how do I aspire to continue</p>
<p>Happy New Year Everyone!! &nbsp;May your year be filled with peace and stability of living in the Present Moment.</p>
</p>
</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Classmates on the Path</p>
<p>Tonight's transmission is on the 4th Verse. &nbsp;We begin the podcast after those present in the class all shared how our practice was progressing with each other. &nbsp;Maybe you, too, would like to reflect how your practice has been going for you.</p>
<p><strong>4th Verse:</strong></p>
<p><em>My breathing and my steps</em></p>
<p><em>Enable me to generate the energy of mindfulness,</em></p>
<p><em>So that I can recognize and touch</em></p>
<p><em>the wonders of life within and around me.</em></p>
<p>Our teacher, Thay Phap Hai, reminds us that stopping and calm abiding allow us to uncover what is already there. We also will benefit if we can ask, 'We're stopping what?'</p>
<p>Another wonderful practice that our teacher urges us to try this week is 'Lazy Hour'.</p>
<p>Enjoy your breath this week--and your laziness.</p>]]></description>

<p>Here is Sister Su Co Bich Nghiem's beautiful transmission on Verse 3.</p>
<p><strong>Third Verse:</strong></p>
<p>The practice of Vipashyana is to Look Deeply</p>

<p>so that I may develop understanding</p>
<p>and transform suffering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this sharing, our sister encourages us to "Give yourself time to be with yourself more so that you can know yourself more. &nbsp;So that we can better know ways to care for ourselves."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends</p>
<p>What a great fortune to have been born a human, to be in harmony with others, and to have a chance to take this wonderful course! &nbsp;The second session is offered to us by Thay Phap Hai and is rich with insights into our beautiful practice.</p>
<p><strong>The Second Verse:</strong></p>
<p>Stopping (Shamatha) means to be still</p>
<p>In order to recognize, to be in contact,</p>
<p>To nourish, to heal,</p>
<p>To calm, to soothe, and to refocus the mind.</p>
<p>Thay offers us a guided meditation, an introduction to the five hindrances, and three means to plunge ourselves into the cool water of the present moment.</p>
<p>The reading materials for this class are available on the Deer Park Monastery website at www.deerparkmonastery.org</p>
<p>May all enjoy calm abiding in the present moment during the week ahead.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p>The 3-month Winter Rains Retreat began today at Deer Park. &nbsp;Also, today this course on the Fourteen Verses on Meditation course held its first class. &nbsp;A group of around 30 people have joined together to be taught by Thay Phap Hai, Thay Phap Ho, and Su Co Bich Nghiem and we have all committed to  following the course during the coming 14 weeks. We hope that you will join us online. &nbsp;In this way you can join us  in our study, reflection and practice when and where it is suitable for you. &nbsp;The text material for the respective classes and the outline of the  course can be found on this website under Teachings, Fourteen Verses on  Meditation here: http://www.deerparkmonastery.org/teachings/fourteen-verses-on-meditation-course-nov-21-2010-feb-20-2011 or go to http://www.deerparkmonastery.org</p>
<p><strong>First Verse on Meditation:</strong>&nbsp;Just as a bird has two wings,&nbsp;the practice of meditation has "stopping" and "deep looking." The two wings depend on each other. &nbsp;Stopping and deep looking go in tandem.</p>
<p>The Podcast team will do our best to put the recording online as soon as we can after the class. &nbsp;Because we want to keep up with the class, these podcasts will not have the usual introductions so we hope that is acceptable. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we all enjoy our stopping and looking together during this winter reflection time.</p>

Dear friends,

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Dear friends,</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Thich Nhat Hahn shows us very clearly that while we practice for our own transformation, it is just as important to practice for our relationships with those we love.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">In this dharma talk Bother Phap Dung, the Abbott of Deer Park, encourages us to be present with exactly who we are, with all our strengths and weakness, rather than an impossible image of how we should be. He shows us how, by being present with ourselves and families in this way, we can clearly see the time, space, and attention needed to care for ourselves and our loved ones.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Please enjoy these offerings, and may they guide us toward acceptance of the miracle of this present moment.</span></p>

<u1:p></u1:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Gathas
are short verses to recite in the routine moments of our lives - waking up in
the morning,&nbsp; brushing our teeth, turning on a car – to bring mindfulness
and connection to those moments. In this dharma talk, Sister Huong Nghiem
encourages us in our practice of using these gathas, showing us how to use them
to cultivate gratitude and stoke the fires of understanding, directing our
hearts and minds toward the wholesome seeds stored in our consciousness. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Please
enjoy these offerings, and may they be nourishing to your practice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Thich Phuoc Tinh, known to the Sangha as The Venerable, here offers a wonderfully direct talk to encourage us forward in our practice. He reminds us that if we stop practicing when we are feeling good, we are like a person rubbing sticks together to start a fire, and stopping just as the sticks grow warm, before the real fire begins. The Dharma, he tells us, is a dharma of action, not of intellect.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This dharma talk is offered for Tet, the Vietnamese lunar new year. May the renewal and rejoicing that is going on at the Monastery carry deeply into your life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">A collection of The Venerable&rsquo;s dharma talks is available as a book. <em>Be Like a Tree, Zen Talks by Th&iacute;ch Ph</em></span><em><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">ướ</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">c T</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">ị</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">nh</span></em><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> is a collection of the Venerable&rsquo;s uniquely practical and inspiring talks, helping us in our practice with non-fear, recognizing our thoughts and feelings, creating space in our lives, loving and being loved, cultivating our spirituality, and tasting the enjoyment of our own lives. The talks were compiled by OI Member Karen Hilsberg, and the book is available at lulu.com and amazon.com.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Please enjoy these offerings, and may there be renewal in your every mindful breath.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Dear Friends</span><font size="3">,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>In our next focus on the Elements of Practice we look at the first of two basic practices of the dharma: stopping and looking deeply.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this dharma talk, Brother Phap Ho guides us in Stopping – coming to rest in the present moment, allowing our minds to become clear and rest in awareness. <span>&nbsp;</span>We are then able to look deeply, to see that there are so many conditions for our happiness right around us that we might not notice otherwise, that we lose in the busy-ness of our lives. <span>&nbsp;</span>And through this awareness, we are also able to look deeply into ourselves, to look at how we are constrained by the habits of our lives and minds, as so find freedom. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Please enjoy these offerings, and may they guide us toward the crystal clarity of the present moment.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Dear Friends,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In this dharma talk Sister Dang Nghiem explores neurologist Paul MacLean’s idea that our brains actually consist of three brains layered by evolution atop one another – the reptilian brain, the mammalian brain, and the intellectual Neocortex. Through the practice of mindfulness, Sister Dang Nghiem shows us how we can train ourselves to react from the highest level of our brain’s evolution, and so cultivate our minds to bring us greater happiness and peace, and to be a calm presence in the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Please enjoy these offerings, and may they guide us toward the peace of a carefully cultivated mind.</span></p>

Three of our brothers, Phap Hoi, Phap Tu and Phap Sy have been taken and have not been seen. The rest of the monastics have been pulled out into the rain, and are apparently waiting for a truck to bring them away--where we don't know. Please practice to send your energy of peace and support. Your help now is more urgent than ever. If any of you can help in any way, especially those who might be present in Vietnam, thank you.

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>Dear Friends</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>Our practice is to learn to listen to the innate wisdom that is inside of us, instead of the voices of judgment and expectation that battle for our attention.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this dharma talk, through sharing of very personal stories of care-taking for her mother, Sister Tue Nghiem helps us to see this wisdom within ourselves and to listen to, as she calls it, “our voice.” In this talk she shows us that by being present with ourselves we are able to keep from taking for granted the precious elements in our lives that support us – our health, family, friends, sangha, and our spiritual practice.<span>&nbsp; </span>The dharma talk concludes with a guided meditation in which Sister Tue Nghiem teaches us to make room inside ourselves to listen for this voice of wisdom.</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span>Please enjoy these offerings, and may they guide us toward who we really are.</span></em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/>Dear Friends,<br/><br/>The 21-Day Retreat is now underway in Plum Village. Thay offered this talk to the newly arrived retreatants, beginning with a sharing on his meetings with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and continuing on to discuss how we can support President Obama in his practice of using loving speech and deep listening.<br/><br/>&quot;When Barack Obama manifested, I regretted a little bit, because Martin Luther King, Jr. was not there to witness the fruit of our efforts. ... But finally, I saw that we are the continuation of Martin Luther King. He is happy to know that everything he has done has borne fruit. <br/><br/>Obama is not an individual, Obama represents a Sangha. So our work is to keep the Sangha close to Obama, to offer our support. I offer this for you to reflect on it. There must be a way. Wherever there is a will there is a way.&quot;<br/><br/>]]></description>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Dharma teachers Thay Phap Ho and Sister Dang Nghiem offer a recitation of the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings of the Order of Interbeing. <span>&nbsp;</span>Thich Nhat Hanh says in this book,<i> Interbeing</i>, “If we practice these trainings deeply enough, we will recognize that each training contains every other training.</span><font size="3"> </font><span>Studying and practicing them can help us understand the true nature of interbeing-we cannot just be by ourselves alone; we can only inter-be with everyone and everything else.</span><font size="3"> </font><span>To practice these mindfulness trainings is to become aware of what is going on in our bodies, our minds, and the world. With awareness, we can live our lives happily, fully present in each moment we are alive, intelligently seeking solutions to the problems we face, and working for peace in small and large ways. I hope you will join me in practicing these mindfulness trainings or the equivalent from your own tradition. It is crucial for our own well-being and the well-being of the world.”<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>You may like to recite&nbsp;these once a month to help nourish your&nbsp;practice. </span></span><span><span>Please enjoy!</span></span></p>

Loved ones of people of all nationalities remembered those who died in wars and in boats during the past century in Vietnam by writing their names on hundreds of sheets. These sheets were carried on trays during the ceremony. The ceremonies have given many people here a chance to be released from the suffering caused&nbsp;by the violent death of loved ones.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Greetings from Bat Nha (Prajna) Temple near Bao Loc in Lam Dong Province, Vietnam. Thay and the Sangha arrived here over a week ago and, after a three day trip to Da Lat where Thay lived and taught as a young Dharma Teacher, offered a retreat for lay pracitioners which is finishing today.

Questions include: How can we continue the practice after Thay and the Sangha leave? What can we do about capital punishment? Can we ordain as monastics, and how do we convince our parents to let us ordain? <br/><br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week Brother Phap Luu offers readings of two sutras on mindful breathing translated from Chinese by our teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. These sutras were the main texts used during the 21-day retreat this past June entitled &quot;The Breath of the Buddha.&quot; Included as well are some recent news items from Deer Park, and a brief introduction to sitting meditation.<br/><br/>We look forward to a Question and Answer session to take place in the coming week, so please e-mail us any questions you may have about the practice of mindfulness in daily life. A panel of monks and nuns will share based on these questions. You may also put a question in the comments to this week's show.<br/><br/>A PDF of Sutra 803 is available <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/deerpark/803_Eng_05-05-28.pdf">here</a>, and of Sutra 810 <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/deerpark/810_Eng_05-05-28.pdf">here</a>. The Chinese texts with Pinyin and Sino-Vietnamese are available <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/deerpark/803_Pinyin_Viet_05-05-28.pdf">here</a> (803) and <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/deerpark/810_Pinyin_Viet_05-05-28.pdf">here</a>&nbsp; (810). <br/><br/>May you breathe in peace.<br/><br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[It has only been a week since our first DPCast but it feels as though Deer Park has been apart of my life forever.&nbsp; We have had some wonderful feedback from the e-community and we have read every word!&nbsp; Thank you so much for such encouraging e-mails and comments.<br/><br/>Not to keep you, our second DPCast is hosted by Sister Jewel.&nbsp; This is the talk the Dharma Teacher Larry Ward offered on the third day of the retreat. I haven't listened to it yet, so lets breathe in together, breathe out together and enjoy this wonderful gift from the Hidden Mountains of Escondido, CA.<br/><br/>Be sure to check the <a href="www.deerparkmonastery.org" target="_blank">Deer Park website</a> for more information about living in the present moment.<br/><br/>Friend of DP,<br/>Michael Nguyen<br/>]]></description>
