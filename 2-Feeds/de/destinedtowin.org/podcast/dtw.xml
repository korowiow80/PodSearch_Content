<title>The Potential Of The Redeemed Mind</title>
<link>http://www.destinedtowin.org</link>
<guid>http://www.destinedtowin.org/podcast/potential%20of%20the_redeemed_mind_1.mp3</guid>
<description>
At a young age in the Lord The Holy Spirit revealed to me the nature of a lying spirit and gave me understanding concerning his mission against humanity. A lying spirit is a spirit of seduction sent to seduce our mind causing us to accept a lie as the truth. This will cause us to follow a course of actions fueled by wrong decisions that will lead to our destruction. This is what the bible refers to as a stronghold in 2 Cor 10:3-5 
Through this series of teachings you will grow to understand \n 
1. Why Satan wants to control your mind. \n 
2. why it is important to renew your mind by understanding covenant promises, \n 
3. understanding the purpose of water baptism, \n 
4. you will understand the voids of the human soul and how to fill them.

<title>Facing Up To Failure</title>
<link>http://www.destinedtowin.org</link>
<guid>http://www.destinedtowin.org/podcast/faceing_failure_1.mp3</guid>
<description>
Knocked Down But Not Knocked Out! Falling does not make someone a failure however living in the shame of failure does. When you can’t get passed the self-pity produced by the shame and guilt of the fall from grace, you become a prisoner of the fall. Like any prisoner you will do one of two things, you will accept your life sentence and plan your life around your failure or you will plan life centered on your release. To have freedom you will have to make a decision to get up from your fall and fight back. In a modern translation of the Bible Paul says “I am knocked down but I am not knocked out” This principle applies to every area of life, marriage, business, friendship, an investment, a pastorate even bad grades. You are only defeated when you refuse to stand up and fight for what you want to accomplish in life.
