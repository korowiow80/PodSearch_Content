Happy New Year everyone! We are now in 2009, which is going to prove to be a most excellent year! We wish you all the best!

With a new year comes some change at Geocentric... Today is a new day. From now on, we will no longer be known as Geocentric. We will be known as TagSurfer! To check out the new site that aggregates all of our content, go to www.tagsurfer.com. We're all surfers and beach bums now!

On this show we'll tell you all about the new blog and podcast. We'll tell you what has changed and what has stayed the same.

We're still bringing 5 topics to break the awkward silence! These are the new topic categories (starting next week):

1. Business &amp; Communications
2. Political Buzz
3. Tech &amp; Gadgets
4. The Good Life
5. Odds and Ends

The podcast will still be hosted by your friends, Nate Long and John Newman.

The blog contributor team will consist of:
John Newman - Political Science &amp; Anthropology
Nate Long - Public Relations, Marketing &amp; Travel
Ethan Clark - Tech, Film &amp; Advertising
Patrick Newman - Music Managing and Theater

Remember when we said, &quot;we're totally better than Mashable!&quot; Well, really we're just different. They're a machine. They have &quot;all that's new on the web.&quot; We have some of what's new on the web. We just surf the stuff we think is cool and bring it to TagSurfer! But, for the sake of baiting, we'll say, &quot;Mashable, watch out...&quot;

Check out the official TagSurfer website at www.TagSurfer.com, which now has the blog, the podcast, links to our Twitter page and even a way to contact each of us by email.

This week John and Nate are feeling a little under the weather.  However there is no need to fear as this is barely noticeable (ha!) and our heroes of hostile takeover are dedicated to you!  ...disheveled as they may be.

Here's what's comin' up in the show today:

Election Talk:
How has technology changed our political climate?  We run through the top 7 election influencers that weren't around back in '04.

Business Finance and Marketing:
...We'll get back to you on that.

Are You Kidding Me?!
Some fetchy nerd proposes to his girlfriend by hacking her Chrono Trigger game.  Did she say yes?  You'll have to listen to find out.

Tech and Entertainment:
There's a serious problem in the world when hookup maps become available online.  Besides, how do you know it's not some stalker just waiting to get a picture of you that he can upload into his computer which will then generate for him a naked image of you in 3D?  Yes, that's for real.  Anyway, if you've ever wanted to know what surfing the web in China was like, now you can.

Break the silence with these five topics!

Business, Finance &amp; Marketing:
We'll talk about a site that could show the music industry a thing or two about variable pricing for music.

Current International Events:
The RIAA bill was signed and we lost the battle, but have no fear, we will win the war!
Iranian parliament votes in favor of a draft bill imposing the death penalty on men who leave Islam.
Remember that Austrian far-right guy, Joerg Haider? Well he's dead. It's kind of sketchy how he died, but we won't miss him!
North Korea is taken back off the terrorist list.

Are You Kidding Me?!: 
The Bra Bandit has stolen 452 bras!
Remember that woman who was stuck to her toilet? Well her &quot;beau&quot; won the lottery... TWICE!
A man who caused damage at a waste water treatment plant in Wisconsin has decided to pick public humiliation over jail time to pay for his crime. What would you do?
A PETA girl changes her name to CutoutDissection.com. I guess it makes sense coming from the people who told Ben &amp; Jerry's to use human breast milk for their ice cream.
A couple in Cambodia decides to end their marraige by sawing their house in half.
A San Diego man is caught with a &quot;bulge&quot; of Lobsters in his pants. That's pretty wierd...
We'll play the audio from a ridiculous story about a demonic/Islamic &quot;hate doll&quot; reported by Fox News. Huh??

Election Talk:
Still undecided on who you're going to vote for in November? We'll give you the Top 10 Web tools for the election season so you can be informed and ready to vote!

Tech &amp; Entertainment:
How would you like if it if when you checked into a hotel, you were handed an iPod touch? We'll tell you all the cool stuff it can do.
Want to jam out to Rock Band with synchronized lighting and fog? Soon you will be able to!

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1142477/600x600_1269757.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Episode 16 - What About Economy Goggles? 10/9/2008.

Here's five ways you can break the awkward silence this week in your (potential) conversations!

Business, Finance &amp; Marketing: We'll give you some tips to beat the credit crunch and the Top Ten solutions for dealing with a personal credit crisis.

Current International Events: Oil prices slip on global woes, what is OPEC's reaction? We'll tell you one more reason we need to gain independence from foreign oil.

Are You Kidding Me?!:  Amy Winehouse's nose is about to fall off due to drug use, cocaine dealers institute surcharges on their goods (what's next? a checked bag fee?), a bank robber fools cops on Craigslist with a clever decoy plot and finally Canadian Greyhound is in the news again, this time for a tuberculosis outbreak!

Streetwise:  Has human evolution Ended? One man thinks so and we'll give you his argument (actually, John just shoots him down).

Tech &amp; Entertainment: Ford introduces MyKey allowing parental controls that limit speed, volume level of music, and seat belt indicators. Google Goggles checks your soberness before you send an embarrassing email. And finally, the LoJack of laptops just made stealing your laptop a little less appealing to thieves.

This week's extras in the podcast:

New album release highlights for the weeks of Tuesday, Oct. 1 and Tuesday, Oct. 8
The weekly &quot;Tech Byte Update with Ethan Clark&quot;
