The list of clients is long and illustrious, including <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>, <a href="http://www.sky.com/">Sky</a>, <a href="http://www.bentleymotors.com/">Bentley</a>, <a href="http://www.dunhill.com/">Dunhill</a>, <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">ebay</a> and <a href="http://www.stellaartois.com/">Stella Artois</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t experienced augmented reality, it&#8217;s the overlaying of computer-generated imagery onto a real-world view as seen through a smartphone or tablet camera. The applications are myriad, from showing a video when the camera sees a billboard poster to providing information about the artist when looking at a painting.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-34256" title="Aura" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/universal.jpg" alt="Aura" width="238" height="149" />Aurasma&#8217;s augmented reality app is available for both <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/aurasma/aurasmalite">iOS</a> and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.aurasma.aurasma">Android</a>, and once loaded on your smartphone, you can start looking for enhanced adverts, which Aurasma call &#8220;<a href="http://www.aurasma.com/auras">Auras</a>&#8220;. These have additional content which you can only see through your phone. Auras can also be created for real locations and while most of the Auras add animals or cars into the scene, they can also be used to put tourist information in the view.</p>
<p>In the last of my interviews from Gadget Show Live, I chat to Tamara from <a href="http://www.aurasma.com/">Aurasma</a>, who told me more about Aurasma and Auras.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-34134" title="Jumbo Games" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PICT4066a-300x196.jpg" alt="Jumbo Games" width="240" height="157" align="left" hspace="10" /><a href="http://www.jumbo.eu/ipieces/">iPieces</a> from <a href="http://www.jumbo.eu/">Jumbo</a> are a new range of games that join traditional tabletop games with iPad game apps. In a nutshell, the iPad becomes the game board and game pieces are placed on the iPad. The game app displays the board but being an app, can bring animation and other effects to the game. Sheer genius.</p>
<p>There are four games which can be download from the Apple AppStore; Snakes &amp; Ladders, Fishing Game (Magnetic Fish), Game of Goose and Air Hockey. I didn&#8217;t recognise Game of Goose, but it&#8217;s a traditional Dutch game: Jumbo is a Dutch company.</p>
<p>The iPieces themselves are sold in small packs, with different iPieces for each game &#8211; the picture below shows the pre-production packaging. Each iPiece pack is £9.99.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34144" title="iPieces Games from Jumbo" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PICT4089-490x280.jpg" alt="iPieces Games from Jumbo" width="490" height="280" /></p>
<p>Here are the game pieces, the iPieces themselves. On the left are two fishing rods for Fishing Game, in the middle the pucks for Air Hockey and on the right, two &#8220;men&#8221; and a ladder from Snakes and Ladders. As with any game, the number of players varies. The Game of Goose has six players, but Air Hockey only two.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34145" title="iPieces" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PICT4092-490x347.jpg" alt="iPieces" width="490" height="347" /></p>
<p>If you are worried about the iPieces scratching the iPad screen, there are felt pads on the bottom of the iPieces which I imagine would be good enough for occasional use. Hardcore Air Hockey players might want to invest in a screen protector.</p>
<p>The game boards are brilliantly reproduced by the apps and unlike the original board games, these can have animations and sound. I&#8217;ll be reviewing each app in more detail in a future post.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34148" title="Game of Goose" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PICT40671-490x266.jpg" alt="Game of Goose" width="490" height="266" /></p>
<p>New iPieces games are coming soon, including Peppa Pig, Fireman Sam, Ludo, Pool and Stratego.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, listen to my interview with Catherine from Jumbo.</p>

<p>New to the UK, Nanodots come in a range of four colours &#8211; original, silver, gold and black &#8211; but they&#8217;re all the same size and fit together. Purchased in packs of 216 balls, there are enough to make small cubes, pyramids, diamonds and so on, but the fun really starts when you have lots of balls. Here&#8217;s a chess set.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-34109" title="Nanodots Chess Set" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PICT4050-490x367.jpg" alt="Nanodots Chess Set" width="490" height="367" /></p>
<p>If you look closely, you&#8217;ll see that the chess pieces are on a Nanopad. It&#8217;s a magnetic mat that works with the Nanodots to help build structures that would otherwise be impossible (because the balls would slip or skid away on a ordinary surface). There are more amazing Nanodot creations at <a href="http://www.dotpedia.com/">Dotpedia</a>.</p>
<p>The Nanodots are available direct online and from other good retailers. Listen to my interview with Daniel to learn more.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-34091" title="TP-Link WR702N wireless-n router" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TL-WR702N_450x270-041.jpg" alt="TP-Link WR702N wireless-n router" width="175" height="270" />TP-Link had a large stand at <a href="http://www.gadgetshowlive.net/">The Gadget Show Live</a> with a huge range of different products on show. Switches, ADSL modems, wireless routers, IP cameras, Powerline adaptors; you could easily build a complete home IT infrastructure using only TP-Link products.</p>
<p>What caught my eye was a range of portable mini wireless routers, &#8220;nano routers&#8221;, that were smaller than paperback books. Three different models were on show; the first was the <a href="http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/?categoryid=241&amp;model=TL-WR702N">TL-WR702N</a>, a relatively standard 11n wireless router but only 57 mm square and 18 mm deep &#8211; it&#8217;s the one shown in the picture left.</p>
<p>Second was the <a href="http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/?categoryid=218&amp;model=TL-MR3020">TL-MR3020</a>, a bit bigger at 74 x 67 x 22 mm but offering 3G connectivity via a dongle as well.</p>
<p>Finally, a brand new wireless router was on display, the <a href="http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/?model=TL-MR3040">TL-MR3040</a>, that included a rechargeable battery giving several hours of use. More rectangular than square, it uses a 3G dongle (rather than integrated SIM tray), to get mobile connectivity. Price is expected to be less than £50.</p>
<p>Eric from TP-Link took me through their range in more detail.</p>

Three different models were on show; the first was the TL-WR702N, a relatively standard 11n wireless router but only 57 mm square and 18 mm deep - it&#039;s the one shown in the picture left.

Second was the TL-MR3020, a bit bigger at 74 x 67 x 22 mm but offering 3G connectivity via a dongle as well.

Finally, a brand new wireless router was on display, the TL-MR3040, that included a rechargeable battery giving several hours of use. More rectangular than square, it uses a 3G dongle (rather than integrated SIM tray), to get mobile connectivity. Price is expected to be less than £50.

Eric from TP-Link took me through their range in more detail.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-34034" title="WD TV Live" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/groupfs_1011.jpg" alt="WD TV Live" width="200" height="200" />Western Digital&#8217;s <a href="http://wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=330">TV Live</a> series of media players has been around for a couple of years and they&#8217;ve gained a sizeable following with over 3.5 million devices sold. The 3rd generation WD TV Live has been released recently and Daniel Mauerhofer was kind enough to give me an interview at <a href="http://www.gadgetshowlive.net/">The Gadget Show Live</a>.</p>
<p>The new WD TV Live model introduces wi-fi connectivity which was absent on the previous model and it&#8217;s now been localised for the UK market with the inclusion of iPlayer and Spotify. Coming in two models, one without an internal hard drive (£99), which is available now, and a second which will have a 1 TB drive and will be available later in the year (approx. £129).</p>
<p>As ever, there&#8217;s a complementary <a href="http://wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=330#tab9">remote control app</a> for Android and iOS devices, which looks pretty useful; it&#8217;s certainly more than just a button-for-button replacement of the IR remote control.</p>
<p>My personal pet peeve in this area was that media players seemed either play from the local network or stream from the Internet but it was a rare device that could do both. The WD TV Live does both so it&#8217;s a thumbs up from me.</p>

However, having listened to their pitch, I&#8217;d consider a pair for use at the gym or during sport. Why? Because JayBird specialise in headphones and earbuds that are sweat-proof and difficult to dislodge.</p>
<p>On show were two Bluetooth headsets, the Sportsband and the Freedom. As you might expect, the Sportsband is a traditional headband model with modern styling (shown left), whereas the Freedoms are earbuds (show below) with a twist.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-34013" title="Jaybird Freedoms" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JF3-10-72-300x296.jpg" alt="Jaybird Freedoms" width="240" height="237" />Keeping earbuds in during exercise is a constant problem, and the Freedoms solve this problem but having a cunning in-ear hook that latches onto part of the ear. This ensures that the earbuds stay in the ear no matter how active and sweaty the wearer gets.</p>
<p>If you are in the UK and are interested in picking up a pair, JayBird headphones are sold online by <a href="http://www.dadaudio.com">DAD Audio</a>. Both models are currently £99.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Portable speakers were much in evidence at <a href="http://www.gadgetshowlive.net/">Gadget Show Live</a>, though frankly some had the acoustics of a tin can rather than than anything close to hi-fi. Fortunately the <a href="http://www.woweeone.com/">WOWee ONE</a> range of portable speakers tend towards the latter and while I doubt that musical purists will be impressed, those of us who simply want our tunes out-and-about will be satisfied.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-33977" title="WOWee ONE Pro" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pro-300x131.jpg" alt="WOWee ONE Pro" width="300" height="131" /></p>
<p>There are three models in the WOWee ONE line-up; the Classic, the Slim and the recently announced Pro (shown left). Although there is a conventional speaker included, all of these portable speakers are designed to vibrate the surface they&#8217;re lying on to produce sound using a unique gel pad on the bottom of the WOWee ONE that helps transmit the vibration from the speaker to the surface.</p>
<p>The Classic and the Slim need a cabled input (3.5mm jack) but the new Pro can make a wireless Bluetooth connection with a smartphone. The Pro also has a mic and can pair as a handsfree kit. With built-in rechargeable batteries, expect to get 10 hours of music from the Slim and the Pro but double that to 20 hours for the Classic.</p>
<p>I listened to both the Classic and the Slim at the Gadget Show and I though the sound was great for an impromptu party. The Classic seem to have the edge in the quality and range, probably because of the greater mass. Prices are a penny shy of £50, £80 and £130 for the Classic, Slim and Pro respectively.</p>
<p>I interviewed Magnus Hammick and he told me more about their products.</p>

Sticker Munch offer a range of novelty stickers that put the fun back into technology by incorporating the logo as part of the design or by trading on the geekiness of it all.</p>
<p>The stickers themselves are high quality vinyl decals and can be stuck to almost anything, from laptops to books, skateboards to vehicles. Some of the decals will be for particular models or devices, e.g. iPad, especially when the logo is integral to the design, but others can be stuck anywhere!</p>
<p>Prices range from an astonishingly low 50p up to £10.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Novelty sticker company Sticker Munch launched at last week&#039;s The Gadget Show Live and I was able to grab an interview with MD and founder, Sufian Hassan. Sticker Munch offer a range of novelty stickers that put the fun back into technology by incorporating the logo as part of the design or by trading on the geekiness of it all.

The stickers themselves are high quality vinyl decals and can be stuck to almost anything, from laptops to books, skateboards to vehicles. Some of the decals will be for particular models or devices, e.g. iPad, especially when the logo is integral to the design, but others can be stuck anywhere!

Prices range from an astonishingly low 50p up to £10.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fordlogo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-33826" title="fordlogo" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fordlogo-150x75.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="75" /></a><br />
I got a chance, this week, to drive the 2013 Ford Escape that will be at dealers in late April or early May. The all-new design of the Escape has a more streamlined look than past Escapes. It’s more “car-like” instead of truck-like.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2012/04/19/all-new-2013-ford-escape-first-drive/2013escapestage-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-33821"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-33821" title="2013EscapeStage" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2013EscapeStage1-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>The engine choices are a 2.5L 4 cylinder non-turbo with 168hp, a 1.6L EcoBoost with 180hp and a 2.0L EcoBoost with 237hp. These engines get better fuel economy than the outgoing engines. The 2.0L engine (the one I drove) have a 3500lb towing capacity, which is the best in the compact SUV class. With the 2.0L EcoBoost, the car felt as if it had a much bigger engine. You would never know you had a 4 cylinder under the hood, until you get to the gas pump. I averaged 25mpg on my test drive, which was over 180 miles in hilly Northern California (San Francisco area). On the highway, the 2.0L is estimated to get around 30mpg.</p>
<p>The new Escape brings many new technologies to the small SUV class that were not available before. Of course, there is SYNC with My Ford Touch and the active park assist that are found on many other Ford products. There is an available hands-free tailgate option that is really handy. All you have to do is have the key in your pocket or purse and you simply kick your foot under the back of the car and the lift-gate opens so you don’t have to put your stuff down to open the door. It will also close the same way if you are unloading your car and you have your hands full, it keeps you from having to go back to the car to close it up. VERY COOL in my book!</p>
<p>Speaking of capacity. The new design of the Escape has more room then past models. Enough room to put 4 golf bags and take you and 3 friends golfing. Try that in another small SUV.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2012/04/19/all-new-2013-ford-escape-first-drive/escapeback/" rel="attachment wp-att-33822"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33822" title="EscapeBack" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EscapeBack-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>The interior was very roomy and has more drink holders than I’ve ever seen in one car. The fabrics inside the car feel very rich and are made of a lot of recycled materials. The carpet in each Escape, for instance, is made from 25 20-ounce water bottles. So even if you get a red one, it’s green.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed driving the new Escape and would put it on my short-list of new cars if I were in the market. The 2013 Ford Escape starts at around $22,000 and will be available soon.</p>
<p>For more information about the new Escape, go to <a href="http://ford.com/suvs/escape">ford.com/suvs/escape</a> or see your Ford dealer this spring.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BubbleScope is an optical attachment for smartphones that takes 360° pictures and video called &#8220;Bubbles&#8221;. The BubblePix smartphone app is used to capture, view and share online the Bubbles, which can be hosted free at <a href="http://www.bubblepix.com/">bubblepix.com</a>. The pictures below gives you a feel of wraparound nature of a Bubble but when it&#8217;s in the BubblePix app, it joins up seamlessly. Here&#8217;s one in a <a href="http://www.bubblepix.com/bubbles/115">fountain</a> - the effect is amazing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bubblepix.com/bubbles/103"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33789" title="Gadget Show Bubble" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gadgetshow_bubble-490x105.jpg" alt="Gadget Show Bubble" width="490" height="105" /></a></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33787" title="Rollercoaster Bubble" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rollercoaster_bubble-490x111.jpg" alt="Rollercoaster Bubble" width="490" height="111" /></p>
<p>Shaped a bit like a periscope, the BubbleScope attaches to the to the smartphone and uses the phone&#8217;s built-in camera to record the imagery. The optical part of the scope pops up and down to keep it clean and undamaged. Available initially for the iPhone 4 &amp; 4S, it will be on sale this summer for £64.99. Versions compatible with other leading smartphones (Android) will be released shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>In the interview at the <a href="http://www.gadgetshowlive.net/">Gadget Show Live</a>, I talk with <a href="http://tomlawton.com/">Tom Lawton</a>, the inventor of BubbleScope about the device and how it took ten years to turn it from idea to product.</p>
<p>This is my favourite interview from the Gadget Show Live, so if you only listen to one of these, listen to this one.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-19682" title="3M Logo" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/3m.png" alt="3M Logo" width="89" height="52" />Powerpoint and data projectors have become synonymous with business presentations and I dread to think how many people I have bored over the years. As with almost any technology, the data projectors have got smaller and cheaper, but this was the first time I&#8217;d seen how small <a href="http://www.personalprojector.co.uk/">personal projectors</a> had become. As you can see from the photograph, most would actually fit in a (large) pocket.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33513" title="3M Pocket Projectors" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PICT4069-490x367.jpg" alt="3M Pocket Projectors" width="490" height="367" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.3m.co.uk/pocketprojector">3M</a> have a range of seven projectors, of which four were on show at <a href="http://www.gadgetshowlive.net/">The Gadget Show</a>. Unsurprisingly, the different models have different capabilities and there&#8217;s more product information <a href="http://www.3m.co.uk/pocketprojector">here</a> (not all the new models are on the site yet), but I was genuinely impressed by how good the pictures were. The NEC is not a darkened room and yet it was easy to see the presentation or film that was being projected.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;d expect the different models have different features; battery size, wireless connectivity, in-built memory and a new model, the MP220, runs Android (it&#8217;s the one on the left side of the photograph). I chat with Peter from 3M about the new additions to the range.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22077" title="Buffalo Logo" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/buffalo_logo_sm.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="34" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" />Earlier in the week at <a href="http://www.gadgetshowlive.net/">Gadget Show Live</a>, I spoke with Fabian Rousseau, <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/">Buffalo</a>&#8216;s Director of Product Marketing about the <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/comparison-charts/network-storage/business/">TeraStation</a> network storage units. The TeraStation range is being revamped with a new numbering scheme to make it easier to understand the different models and the number of drives in each one. On display was the TeraStation 5800, which has eight drives, making it a fairly substantial unit as you&#8217;ll see in the picture below. The 5600 will have six drives, 5400 four drives, 5200 two drives. R will indicate rackmount.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-33456" title="Buffalo TeraStation" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PICT4051-490x367.jpg" alt="Buffalo TeraStation" width="490" height="367" /></p>
<p>The TeraStations are generally aimed at the small business market: the full feature set and redundant / failover components mean that they&#8217;re more expensive than the consumer products. However, some prosumers are purchasing the two and four drive units for home servers. The new TeraStations are expected on the market in a few months and will be priced competitively.</p>
<p>[Disclosure - Buffalo gave me a free Lego Buffalo which will appear in a future post.]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.idaptweb.com/">IDAPT</a>&#8216;s solutions bring order to the chaos with <a href="http://www.idaptweb.com/universal_chargers_section/">multi-device chargers</a> that have interchangeable charging tips to suit the device being charged &#8211; smartphones, portable game consoles, tablets, digital cameras, even rechargeable batteries.</p>
<p>The i4 can charge three devices on top with a fourth on the side (right) and the i2+ takes two on top (bottom left). The i1 eco is a portable charger (middle) and only charges one device but is made from recycled plastic.</p>

<p>The bright yellow IDAPT S1 <a href="http://www.idaptweb.com/music_section/">Universal Speaker</a> is shown below with an iPad but it&#8217;s device agnostic and uses Bluetooth rather than the device connector to transmit the music.

<p>The <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/uk/product">Fitbit Ultra</a> wireless tracker is the 21st century equivalent of a pedometer, recording the steps taken during the day for later upload to your home PC. It&#8217;s tiny and can easily be clipped to a waist band or left in a pocket. In addition to recording physical activity, it can also record your sleep &#8211; how long were you in bed, were you restless, did you have to get up?</p>
<p>The second gadget is the <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/uk/product/aria">Fitbit Aria</a>, smart scales that measure weight, BMI and % body, and wirelessly transmits the information on to your PC.</p>

<p>The Fitbit combines all this information with smartphone apps (<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/uk/product/mobile/iphone">iOS</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/uk/product/mobile/android">Android</a>) and dietary information to create a personal portfolio of your lifestyle. Of course, you can also tweet your successes to friends and family, though you might want to keep it quiet when you pile on the pounds.</p>
<p>You can find out more from their website or you can listen to this interview with Peter Groom, Fitbit&#8217;s UK Country Manager.</p>

However, these all suffer from the same problem&#8230;.you never have it when you want it. <a href="http://www.stickems.co.uk/">Stickems</a> solve this problem by sticking to the back of your phone or tablet, ready for use at anytime.</p>
<p>Coming in a good range of <a href="http://www.stickems.co.uk/shop/">sizes and patterns</a>, Stickems have ultra fine microfibre cloth on one side to clean the screen of dust, fingerprints, ear smudges and make-up, with a self-cling backing on the other side. The Stickem simply peels off for use and sticks back on when done. Prices range from £2.99 to £4.99.</p>
<p>I caught up with Alex from Stickems at <a href="http://www.gadgetshowlive.net/">The Gadget Show Live</a> and he told me more. I suspect he hasn&#8217;t actually wiped 10,000 times and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s really a guarantee&#8230;.</p>

<p>In comparison to ordinary paper, it&#8217;s less environmentally damaging on a number of fronts. Production uses no water and there&#8217;s no damaging acids or alkalis used in the process. Parax Paper is recyclable and it photo-degrades in about a year. On the downside, inks take a little longer to dry as the surface isn&#8217;t as porous as normal paper and it can&#8217;t be used in laser printers as the carbon-based toner won&#8217;t bind with the surface.</p>
<p>However, there was wide range of Parax Paper products on show, including notepads, stationery, envelopes, paper bag and plates. Their website doesn&#8217;t yet seem to have an on-line store but in the meantime, you can listen to my interview with Parax Sales Director Simon Stockford.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="gazelle" class="alignleft" style="padding-right: 10px;" src="http://m1-beta.gazelle.com/images/page_frame/header/gazelle_logo_with_tagline.png?1326383222" alt="Gazelle" width="218" height="62" /> If you have old gadgets lying around your house, there are a couple things you can do with them, keep them, throw them in the trash, try to sell them on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> or <a href="http://craiglist.org">Craiglist</a> or you could use <a href="http://www.gazelle.com/">Gazelle</a>. Option one isn’t very practical. Option two is bad for the environment and is illegal in most states. Option three can be a hassle. The best option to me is option four, Gazelle. Whenever I have an old gadget I want to sell or get rid of I go to Gazelle. Currently I am waiting for the box to ship my iPad version 1 to them. I am going to get $140.00 for it, which will go toward the purchase of an iPad 3.</p>
<p>Gazelle has been around 2006. You can trade in your old gadgets for money or recycle those that aren’t worth anything. Around 95 percent of all items they receive are worth something, the other 3 percent they will recycle properly. They handle products in 23 different categories everything including cellphones, gaming consoles, laptops and mp3 players just to name a few. Gazelle takes data removal very seriously any data that is on the device is removed using the most secure method. Gazelle gets most of their business from people who wanted to get the latest and greatest and trade in their old device. Since the release of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 4s</a> in Oct they have received over 150,000 iPhones in trade in. They are currently getting ready for the release of the iPad 3.</p>
<p>The thing I didn’t know about Gazelle is they have a store, where they sell the items they receive that are in good working order. So when the iPad 3 comes out you maybe able to pick up a iPad 2 for a good price. In fact many people will buy a device from the Gazelle store and then later sell the same device back to Gazelle to get some money. In case you haven’t noticed I am a big fan of Gazelle, so if you have old gadgets you are trying to get rid of you may want to check out Gazelle.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="tvman" class="alignleft" style="padding-right: 10px;" src="http://www.tvman.mobi/upload_file/product/81/clone_360X360.png" alt="TVman" width="180" height="180" /> Do you want to watch over the air TV on your laptop or tablet while traveling, then the <a href="http://www.tvman.mobi/product/tvman/81">TVman Wireless DTV Tuner</a> by <a href="http://www.dediprog.com/">Dediprog</a> maybe what you are looking for. It is a digital TV receiver that allows you to watch over the air TV. It transfers the signal to any computer or tablet by Wi-fi. So there are no extra wires to carry around. The cord is the antenna. Because it doesn’t depend on 3G connectivity you get a full high def signal. Unlike other options available now which depend on the 3G signal and are often compressed. Dediprog distributes the product themselves and also  through other vendors. They expect to sell it in the US for around $100.00. It is available now in Japan and South America. They hope to have it available in Europe within 3 months and the US by end of the year.</p>
<p>Dediprog also showed off a second item which combines the wireless DTV tuner with 3G. The device can be used as a mobile hotspot or a digital TV receiver. Dediprog is trying to build partnerships with various mobile service providers which would provide the 3G connectivity. They also need to get <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a> approval for both devices.</p>
<p>Both products are small enough to fit into a man’s front pocket. You carry them with you and as long as there is an over the air signal available you can watch TV. Not sure how long the battery last or how far the wi-fi signal travels. I expect you need to be in the same room as the device, but that is an assumption on my part. Both products will works with Android, iOS and Windows. I would love to get a hold of the device to test it, to see what kind of signal it picks up</p>

<p>Fulton Innovation have developed an inductive coupling solution that scales from simply making a magazine cover light up as you walk past to being able to charge a whole bag of devices without taking them out of the bag.

<p>Not all of these products are ready for market just yet, but inductive charging efficiencies are on a par with plug-in chargers though economies of scale are needed to bring the prices down to a point where it&#8217;s built-in as standard. Palm&#8217;s Pre range of smartphones used inductive charging with the <a href="http://www.hpwebos.com/us/products/accessories/touchstone-technology.html">Touchstone</a> and the Motorola Droid 4 has inductive charging as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/16/2802430/motorola-droid-4-verizon-wireless-charging">an option</a>. As a Pre 3 owner, it&#8217;s brilliant not having to fiddle with cables and I hope more devices come to the market with inductive charging in 2012.</p>

One of the consumer products they are currently developing is called <a href="http://www.skifta.com/">Skifta</a>. It is a media shifting platform which works through  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance#DLNA-certified_devices">DLNA</a>-certified and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">UPnP</a> -compatible devices. DLNA protocol has been around for about eight years. Most TVs today which are over 36 inches and Internet enable are DLNA capable. The Web site of your TV’s manufacture should let you know if your TV is DLNA capable. DLNA is a nonprofit trade organization which enables the sharing of digital media between various consumer devices by defining interoperability guidelines. Because DLNA is a nonprofit organization they don’t have the money to spend on advertising and promotion, so its adoption has been slow but steady. The growth of the Smart or Connected TV market has help to increase its popularity over the last 12-18 months. Its biggest rival is Apple’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPlay">Air Play</a>.</p>
<p>Qualcomm was showing off its software platform <a href="http://www.skifta.com/">Skifta</a> at CES 2012, which works with the DLNA platform. Think of Skifta as Airplay for <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>. Once Skifta is installed on your Android device, it will go out and find any DLNA enabled device including TV’s, computers and the Playstation. You can then sending any media that is available on your network to that device. Skifta also gives you access to various Internet providers including <a href="http://revision3.com">Revision3</a>, <a href="http://www.ted.com">Ted Talks</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> and others.</p>
<p>Qualcomm is also developing a Skifta audio adapter which you attach to a receiver that is not DLNA enable and enable it. They are also making a DLNA platform that can be installed easily by the manufacture into a receiver. I installed the Skifta application on my <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> phone and it almost immediately connected and found the media on my network. Once I set up an account it also let me pick up media from <a href="http://revision3.com">Revision3</a> and <a href="http://www.ted.com">Ted Talks</a> among others. Unfortunately I don’t have a connected TV, so for me its use is limited, but I love its possibilities.</p>

<p>The Vertix hardware comes in a couple of different styles so that it can be used with both full-face and open-face helmets.  Both the speaker and microphone can be easily mounted to almost any helmet.  In fact, they claim an installation time of only minutes.  The buttons can easily be tapped while riding to allow communication with other riders in your group or access to a cell phone.  The units can paired with a group of up the three riders, and of course between rider and passenger as well.  The published range for communication is 500 meters, but Vertix claims it can sometimes reach up to 1 km.  One final feature, a handlebar-mounted remote control will be coming out soon.  The MSRP is $160 and you can find out more at the <a href="http://www.vertix.com.sg/">Vertix</a> site.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Wireless communication has been around for several years in the sport of professional bicycle racing.  Team managers use it communicate back and forth with their riders during races.  Vertix has it&#039;s own wireless communication solution, but this one is added into motorcycle helmets.

The Vertix hardware comes in a couple of different styles so that it can be used with both full-face and open-face helmets.  Both the speaker and microphone can be easily mounted to almost any helmet.  In fact, they claim an installation time of only minutes.  The buttons can easily be tapped while riding to allow communication with other riders in your group or access to a cell phone.  The units can paired with a group of up the three riders, and of course between rider and passenger as well.  The published range for communication is 500 meters, but Vertix claims it can sometimes reach up to 1 km.  One final feature, a handlebar-mounted remote control will be coming out soon.  The MSRP is $160 and you can find out more at the Vertix site.

I use to carry it with me when I went camping or to a ball game. If I wanted to watch TV would simply turn it on and pull out the antenna and I was ready to go. Unfortunately when everything went digital, the TV became useless. <a href="http://www.themcv.com/">Mobile Content Venture</a> has joined with <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung</a> and <a href="http://www.metropcs.com/metro/">Metro PCS</a>, the 5th largest wireless carrier to bring mobile live TV back to the US consumer. The handset is made by Samsung and has an embedded mobile E. DTV tuner. Mobile Content Venture created the software application called <a href="http://www.dyle.tv/">Dyle</a> which allows you to watch live TV over the device. Once the device is released in the US it will be available in 14 cities. They hope to expand to up to 32 cities. Depending on your location you can receive up to 6 channels including ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, PBS and ION. You can also use Twitter, Facebook on the device.</p>
<p>If you already have a iOS device, then you might want to consider a Belkin accessory. This is a small dongle which connects to your iOS device using the 30 pin connector. Normally you would need an antenna to watch live TV however Belkin and Mobile Content Venture have developed a way around that problem by making the headphones the antenna. When you are ready to watch TV, just hit the Dyle application and you are ready to go.</p>
<p>At this time there is no pricing or availability date for the US for either of these two devices. The Dyle application will be free and available from the iOS store.</p>

Let’s face it most of us have a handful of people or business that we are truly interested in, our family and close friends, maybe a company we are interested in or a favorite band. In the flood of social media, those are the things that are so easy to miss. That is the problem that <a href="http://www.qubeey.com/">Qubeey</a> is trying to solve.</p>
<p>It is a cube that sits on your desk top. It captures the information from those you are really interested in and saves them for you to view when it’s convenient. Qubeey also has more visual cues, videos and images than other methods have. It allows you to stay connected with out having a web page open. When you get home at the end of the day you can see that your favorite band has released a new album and has one of their songs on <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>. Click on it and watch it. Maybe you get a kick out of the crazy things your best friend says on Twitter, but you miss half of them because you are at work, well no more. It also allows business to target people who are truly interested in them. You can also use <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> or <a href="https://www4.gotomeeting.com">GoToMeeting</a> with out ever leaving Qubeey. No more having to have an extra window or tab open in a browser and then having to click on it everytime you want to check your updates. Qubeey sits on your desktop and notifies you when something important to you is posted. Qubeey is currently free and still in beta and unfortunately I haven’t had the chance to try it out yet, Have you used Qubeey what do you think of it</p>

Andy talks to Dave from Polkast on how they do this but still give you access from your smartphone.</p>
<p>Polkast consists of <a href="http://www.polkast.com/download/">two components</a>, a server app that&#8217;s installed on the PC or Mac where all the documents and files are stored. A client app goes on your smartphone or tablet, and both <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/">iOS</a> and <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> devices are supported, including the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=sa_menu_kdpo3">Kindle Fire</a>.</p>
<p>The client app is much like any media player interface with icons for music, photos, videos, documents and so on. You can browse for the media you want and show photos or play music.</p>
<p>For a single PC or Mac, Polkast offer a free service, no matter how many client devices connect. For multiple PCs or Macs, the premium service costs $4.99 per month (though this option doesn&#8217;t seem to be available on the website yet).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="swissvoice" class="alignleft" style="padding-right: 10px;" src="http://www.swissvoice.net/uploads/tx_templavoila/Banner_ePure_red_03.jpg" alt="Swiss Voice" width="316" height="95" /> Swiss Voice has been making phones for over 100 years since 1893. They are known for their beautiful designs and technology. More and more people especially the younger generation are using their mobile phones as their home phones. <a href="http://www.swissvoice.net/eu/home.html">Swiss Voice</a> makes a line of beautifully designed phones call <a href="http://www.swissvoice.net/eu/products/product/epure-1.html">ePure</a> which combine the security of a landline along with the mobility of a mobile phone. On the front of ePure you can dock your iPhone and recharge it or stream music from it. When a call comes in you can either use the hands free option or you can pick up the handset for a more private call. The handset can also be used as a speaker with a push of a button. So if you want to listen to some music in another room just take your handset with you, push the button and you will hear the music playing on your iPhone. Swiss Voice also makes a non-iPhone version that allows you to connect your smart phone by USB cable.</p>
<p>Swiss Voice also makes a station which plugs into both your landline and your network by Ethernet. It allows you to answer your landline number using your mobile phone. Currently, the ePure is only available in Europe and Asia, they expect to be available in the US in July 2012. The iPhone ePure version should round around $199.00, the non-iPhone version will be around $159. The base station will be $99.00. If you still have a landline or know someone who does, this maybe a nice option the security of a landline with the advantage of a mobile phone</p>

<p>The Magellan eXplorist line of GPS units. Instead of having to type in a waypoint, the explorist units have a number of geocaches in the unit already. The Explorist 610 even has Turn by turn directions up to the nearest road and then walking point-to-point directions for the hike to the cache. Some models even have a camera so you can take a picture of the waypoint instead of typing it in manually.</p>

The standard allows for multiple screens at high resolutions and the aim is to replace VGA, DVI and HDMI with a single connector. Cleverly, DisplayPort has backwards compatibility with the legacy devices as the DisplayPort itself is powered, so cable adaptors can be used to convert the signals to an older connection types.</p>
<p>Moving forwards, the basic DisplayPort can drive a 4096 x 2048 display with 30 bit colour depth at 60 Hz. Other resolutions and bit depths are possible but there&#8217;s a trade off between resolution and bit depth as it&#8217;s the overall bandwidth that&#8217;s the constraining factor. DisplayPort v1.2 also supports the daisy chaining of video displays, which is pretty cool.</p>

Ford showed off the <a href="http://42concepts.com/cars/ford-evo-oh-my-god">Evo Concept</a> car at <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">CES 2012</a>. It shows off the technology that they are working on and maybe in their full line of cars five to seven years from now. For example five years ago the idea of the app link was just a dream. The engineers and research at Ford were not sure how they were going to do it or if they could. Today it is what people talk about when they talk about Ford vehicles.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes for Ford that has happen over the last five years is Ford no longer thinks of itself as a car company, it sees itself as a technology company that also makes the car. The researchers and engineers at Ford get their inspirations from consumers, their colleagues and from other industries. One of the areas that Ford is currently working on is connecting the car to the cloud. They are developing vehicle to vehicle communication. So if the tires of your car hit an ice slick, that information can be communicated to the cars around you, or your car could get a message from a stop light telling you it’s about to change and you need to be prepared to stop. These are just a few examples of what Ford is working on for the future. Ford has been around now for over a 100 years, and I believe that Ford is innovating more today then it has for a long time, perhaps since Henry Ford was in charge.</p>

Instead of starting from scratch, they took a vehicle that was both familiar and popular with the consumer and the critics and turned it into an electric vehicle. Unlike many of their competitors electric cars which can take up to 8 hours to do a full charge on a 240 volt system. The Ford Focus Electric Vehicle can do a full charge in three to four hours. The addition of <a href="http://www.ford.com/electric/focuselectric/2012/?searchid=||">MyFord Mobile</a> allows you to control when your car is charging from your computer. So you can charge your car during off-peak hours and stop and start it when you want too. Another third-party that Ford has partner with was <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a>. So now you can map your trip on your computer or tablet and send it to your car so it there when you are ready to leave.</p>
<p>It can get from 75 to 100 miles per charge and reach up to 100 mph. Ford has placed two battery packs in the car one behind the rear seat and the other under the floor panel in the rear. This allows for maximum capacity while not taking up room where the consumer may want it, such as the trunk. The batteries are encased in steel and protected by the car itself. Ford did a lot of testing to make sure they were safe in case of a crash. This vehicle is made mostly in the U.S. The Michigan plant that is building the powertrain for the Ford Focus Electric Vehicle also builds the powertrain for other vehicles. Ford continues to invest in technology of the future.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="vitallink" class="alignleft" style="padding-right: 10px;" src="http://vitallink.net/images/VitalLink_Logo.png?1328962464" alt="Vitallink" width="237" height="55" />Did you know that there are 78 million baby boomers in the US and over 1 billion world wide. That the fastest growing age group are adults over the age of 85. Many of these adults are separated from their children and grandchildren and live alone often in isolation. A coalition called <a href="http://www.agetek.org/">AgeTek</a> was created to try to solve this problem. One of the members of this coalition is <a href="http://vitallink.net/">Vitallink</a>.</p>
<p>Vitallink is a system that is installed on the older persons computer and it allows them to use applications such as Skype, or check the weather or answer email with a touch of a button. To answer email the elderly person can either type the answer as you would normally, or they can speak the reply. The use of video applications such as <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home">Skype</a> are important because  they  allow the caregiver or relative to see their parent or grandparent.  Seeing someone can tell you a lot more about their condition then a simple call. Elderly people are often reluctant to bother their off-spring because they don’t want to be a burden. Besides which would be better having grandma read a story over the phone to her grandchild or having grandma read the story through video chat, where the child can see and interact with their grandma. I know which method I would choose. The subscription for Vitallink is only $5.00 a month.</p>
<p>The two hardest groups to sell the product to is the elderly adult who are often computer phobic and the person who does the purchasing for the big box company who often are young and don’t recognize the elderly as an important market. Once the elderly adult uses the Vitallink technology for just a short time they are almost always sold on it. Unfortunately it takes a lot more time and effort to try to convince the young sales person of its necessity.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Did you know that there are 78 million baby boomers in the US and over 1 billion world wide. That the fastest growing age group are adults over the age of 85. Many of these adults are separated from their children and grandchildren and live alone often in isolation. A coalition called AgeTek was created to try to solve this problem. One of the members of this coalition is Vitallink.

Vitallink is a system that is installed on the older persons computer and it allows them to use applications such as Skype, or check the weather or answer email with a touch of a button. To answer email the elderly person can either type the answer as you would normally, or they can speak the reply. The use of video applications such as Skype are important because  they  allow the caregiver or relative to see their parent or grandparent.  Seeing someone can tell you a lot more about their condition then a simple call. Elderly people are often reluctant to bother their off-spring because they don’t want to be a burden. Besides which would be better having grandma read a story over the phone to her grandchild or having grandma read the story through video chat, where the child can see and interact with their grandma. I know which method I would choose. The subscription for Vitallink is only $5.00 a month.

The two hardest groups to sell the product to is the elderly adult who are often computer phobic and the person who does the purchasing for the big box company who often are young and don’t recognize the elderly as an important market. Once the elderly adult uses the Vitallink technology for just a short time they are almost always sold on it. Unfortunately it takes a lot more time and effort to try to convince the young sales person of its necessity.

You know how difficult it is some times to find a folder and how often they are misfiled. <a href="http://www.imicrodata.com/">iMicroData</a> is introducing a new system which uses a systems of RFID tags and integrated circuits to enable users to locate folders quickly by title or keyword. The standard filing cabinet is modified electronically. The rails along the inside of the file cabinets are used to conduct both power and information. Each folder will have a conductive contact installed on the tab that sits on the rail and an integrated circuits and a led light installed along the top. There is a motherboard installed in the cabinet, which generates the system address of a given folder. When you want to search for a folder you go to the application on a computer, input in the keyword or title for folder and the file cabinet where that folder is will light up. Once you open up the cabinet up the correct folder will light up.</p>
<p>The system can handle up to 5300 cabinets or about 530,000 files. They are still establishing pricing but are looking at about $800 per three drawer file cabinet with folders included. Extra folders are expected to cost between $1.50 and $2.00. For more information about the product at the ImicroData Web site. This the type of product where a company can start small and build up overtime. There is a high initial cost, but overtime it can save a lot of money in man hours.</p>

So I have to go out and buy a new one. <a href="http://caseinity.com/cord-on-board">Cord on Board by Caselnity</a> is trying to solve that problem. Their case for the iPhone 4 or 4s has a place where you can store a custom sized cord right in the case. So it is always there and doesn’t get tangled up with other cords. To fit the cord the case has to be curved, which makes it more ergonomic and nice to hold in your hand. It is also doesn’t slip as much as many other iPhone cases. The case is made of shock-resistant thermo-plastic and comes in black or white. They hope to have other colors available at a future date.</p>
<p>Cord on Board started out as a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> project, although that ends on February 22. All cases come with the custom sized cord included. At this point in time pricing is not available. Although if you pledge $25.00 or more on Kickstarter they will reserve a case for you. They hope to have cases available in March and are looking for retail partners. If I still had my iPhone 4 I would take a good look at the Cord on Board. I hope they still make it even if the Kickstarter support doesn’t come through.</p>

<p>The team at World Pride visit factories in Asia and try to spot cool gadgets that haven&#8217;t yet made it to market in the US.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="timbuk2" class="alignleft" style="padding-right: 10px;" src="http://cloud.timbuk2.com/static/images/campaigns/spring2012/2012-02-20/2012-02-20_hp_frame1.jpg" alt="Timbuk2" width="220" height="120" /> If you like high quality bags and sleeves for your iPad or laptop, then you will be familiar with <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/">Timbuk2</a>. Timbuk2 started in 1989 in San Francisco making bicycle messenger bags. Over time more and more of their clients were asking them if they had anything they could carry their laptops in. One of the first additions to their bicycle bags was a padded pouch in front where a laptop can put. Over time they added a cover over the zipper to make it more waterproof.</p>
<p>They also have padded sleeves for tablets, or ultra-books. These are made with a material that looks likes a waffle with small holes that allow air to flow thru and cool the product. Timbuktu calls this crater mesh. They also sleeves which allows you to carry a tablet and a laptop together. There is a strap on the back of the case which allows you to easily carry it. They also make a backpack which is great for students walking from class to class or going through an airport. The knapsack opens up and lays out flat, making it easier to get through airport security. They also make cases for the various Kindle products, known as the Professor line. By folding these cases you can turn them into stands.</p>
<p>Timbuk2 is still in San Francisco. Their prices range from $35 for tablet sleeve up to $129.00 for the messenger bag, Timbuk2 is a boutique brand. They will do <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/custom">custom bags</a>, so you can choose the color and material that you want. You can buy Timbuk2 products from their Web site and through the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/search?find=timbuk2">Apple store</a> or through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=timbuk2&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Amazon</a>. If you are looking for a US made bag that well constructed and customizable than you may want to take a look at Timbuk2.</p>

		<itunes:summary>If you like high quality bags and sleeves for your iPad or laptop, then you will be familiar with Timbuk2. Timbuk2 started in 1989 in San Francisco making bicycle messenger bags. Over time more and more of their clients were asking them if they had anything they could carry their laptops in. One of the first additions to their bicycle bags was a padded pouch in front where a laptop can put. Over time they added a cover over the zipper to make it more waterproof.

They also have padded sleeves for tablets, or ultra-books. These are made with a material that looks likes a waffle with small holes that allow air to flow thru and cool the product. Timbuktu calls this crater mesh. They also sleeves which allows you to carry a tablet and a laptop together. There is a strap on the back of the case which allows you to easily carry it. They also make a backpack which is great for students walking from class to class or going through an airport. The knapsack opens up and lays out flat, making it easier to get through airport security. They also make cases for the various Kindle products, known as the Professor line. By folding these cases you can turn them into stands.

Timbuk2 is still in San Francisco. Their prices range from $35 for tablet sleeve up to $129.00 for the messenger bag, Timbuk2 is a boutique brand. They will do custom bags, so you can choose the color and material that you want. You can buy Timbuk2 products from their Web site and through the Apple store or through Amazon. If you are looking for a US made bag that well constructed and customizable than you may want to take a look at Timbuk2.

<p>The iGrip Universal Mount can hold any phone from the standard 3.5 inch models like the iPhone up to the largest Android models on today&#8217;s market.  It has a standard suction-cup mount and the 3 adjustable arms.  Once you set the arms for your handset you simply slide it in and out.  The mount will auto-lock your device in place.  It even rotates between portrait and landscape modes.</p>
<p>In addition to the universal car-mount, iGrip has also produced a mount for bicycle handlebars.  The case that fits to the handlebar mount can also be used with one of their car suction mounts, plus it has a kickstand for the desk or nightstand.</p>

<p>The novel feature about Skunk Juice earphones is that they have a patented inline magnetic coupler which provides two benefits. One, if you move away from your music player, the coupler snaps open rather than yanking your player onto the floor and, two, you can insert more than one inline magnetic coupler in the chain, letting you and your friends listen in to the same music. Up to four friends can tune in at the same time before the sound volume starts to fall. Neat.</p>
<p>Skunk Juice will be bringing new over-ear headphones to market later in the year, along with a Bluetooth version as well. The current <a href="http://www.skunkjuiceearbuds.com/shop.html">earphones</a> are $35.99 (available in black and white), the new larger headset will be around $100 and the smaller headset will be about $50. Skunk Juice earphones are <a href="http://www.skunkjuice.co.uk/">available in the UK</a> too.</p>
<p>If you are thinking that you&#8217;ve seen a magnetic coupler like this on a fruity laptop power supply and are wondering how Skunk Juice managed to get a patent, the answer is that Skunk Juice got there first.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;It provides a new family television entertainment experience. It is an <a href="http://geniatech.com/pa/ATV2000.asp">Android TV tuner box</a>, an <a href="http://geniatech.com/pa/ATV1000.asp">Android HD Media player</a>, a <a href="http://geniatech.com/pa/ATV300.asp">Mini Android PC</a>, an <a href="http://geniatech.com/pa/ATV300.asp">IPTV Set-top box</a>, a <a href="http://geniatech.com/pa/ATV3000.asp">home media Hub &amp; NAS</a> and a <a href="http://geniatech.com/pa/ATV4000.asp">DLNA server</a>. With it, Internet live streaming &amp; Video-on-demand, live TV, music, games and more, all instantly on your TV.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Not only is this a video solution, but you can use all Android apps through it, even gaming.  The box comes with a small, simple remote control as well.  The remote even has a gyro sensor in it so it doubles as a wireless mouse as well.  The MSRP is expected to be under $100, but retailers will be able to customize the box with additional features that could raise that price.  There is also an alternate remote, which is geared to the enthusiasts.  It&#8217;s already available is some parts of Europe and will be released is the U.S. sometime in 2012.  You can find it at <a href="http://tpnmedia.tv/ces/CES-2012-Live-AM-Geniatech.mp4">Geniatech</a>.</p>

We all have good intentions, but unfortunately for most of us we often fall short and at the end of the year we are scrambling to make up the difference. Many times we fail miserably. The process starts all over again with the start of the new year. This is the treadmill that <a href="https://snoball.com/">Snoball</a> was created to stop.</p>
<p>Snoball is built around triggers. A trigger can be anything from contributing every time some one retweets one of your tweets, checking in somewhere using foursquare or perhaps a weather event to name a few. Businesses can also set up a trigger on Snoball, such as for every person who likes their Facebook page they will give a $100.00 to a specific charity.</p>
<p>When you sign up you choose what the trigger will be, how much you want to donate and what charity you want it to go to. You can also set the maximum amount you want to contribute per month. You can contribute to any charity that is listed with the government as a 501c or an 170c charity (charter school). If you don’t know what charity to contribute to Snoball highlights a different charity each month. You can also search for charities that are local to your area. You can search by keyword, and any charity with that keyword in its title will show up. Snoball is attempting to do a listing of charities by categories and they hope to have that available to roll out soon. Snoball itself is for profit, however any money that you contribute to the charity of your choice thru Snoball is tax deductible. At the end of the year you get a report on how much you contributed and to whom. Ninety five percent of what you contribute goes to the charity, five percent is used by Snoball to pay for processing fees and overhead. Have you tried Snoball, did it work for you or did you run into some problems.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img id="catch" class="alignleft" style="padding-right: 10px;" src="https://catch.com/wp-content/themes/catch_theme/assets/images/logo.png" alt="Catch" width="161" height="47" /> If you are like me, keeping yourself organize is a never-ending and not always successful process. I have tried a lot organizers, both applications and web-based. One by one I have abandoned them, either because they are too complicated to use or because they don’t sync between my mobile device and my computer. <a href="https://catch.com">Catch</a> is built for someone like me, it is easy to use and syncs between the mobile and web platform. You can add notes by text, voice or even images. You can organize them by stream or tag. They are also automatically organized by date and location if that is turned on under settings. You can star your most important notes. If you want to collaborate on a stream, you can invite people to join you. Once they have accepted the invitation, they can add notes and comments to the stream. They can edit and delete their own notes and comments. Only the creator of the stream can remove another persons content from the stream.</p>
<p>Catch works on all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">iOs</a>, most <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> devices and through the web. With the free version of <a href="https://catch.com/pricing">Catch</a> you get three streams and 70MB of new content per month. The Pro version is $4.99 a month or $49.99 a year you get 10 streams, 1 GB per month of new content, plus project brainstorm and conversation along with the ability to add office documents. A Premium account offers the same thing as the Pro Version except you get 5 GB of new content per month and up to 50 streams for $19.99 a month or $179.99 a year.</p>
<p>I just started using Catch and so far I like it.  I especially like that you can organize by tags and it syncs between all my devices. Have you tried Catch, if you have what do you like and don’t like about it.</p>

		<itunes:summary>If you are like me, keeping yourself organize is a never-ending and not always successful process. I have tried a lot organizers, both applications and web-based. One by one I have abandoned them, either because they are too complicated to use or because they don’t sync between my mobile device and my computer. Catch is built for someone like me, it is easy to use and syncs between the mobile and web platform. You can add notes by text, voice or even images. You can organize them by stream or tag. They are also automatically organized by date and location if that is turned on under settings. You can star your most important notes. If you want to collaborate on a stream, you can invite people to join you. Once they have accepted the invitation, they can add notes and comments to the stream. They can edit and delete their own notes and comments. Only the creator of the stream can remove another persons content from the stream.

Catch works on all iOs, most Android devices and through the web. With the free version of Catch you get three streams and 70MB of new content per month. The Pro version is $4.99 a month or $49.99 a year you get 10 streams, 1 GB per month of new content, plus project brainstorm and conversation along with the ability to add office documents. A Premium account offers the same thing as the Pro Version except you get 5 GB of new content per month and up to 50 streams for $19.99 a month or $179.99 a year.

I just started using Catch and so far I like it.  I especially like that you can organize by tags and it syncs between all my devices. Have you tried Catch, if you have what do you like and don’t like about it.

No, really.</p>
<p>The SpinKix motorised shoes are the result of over 5 years research and development. Two 6&#8243;-ish wheels on the inner and outer sides of the shoe are driven by an electric motor powered by batteries will take the rider two to three miles depending on terrain and surface. Top speed is 10 mph and a wireless handheld unit controls the power.</p>
<p>Pre-order now ($649) for delivery in March &#8211; the production was funded as a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/petertreadway/spnkix-wearable-mobility?ref=live">Kickstarter</a> project. There&#8217;s a also a <a href="http://www.spnkix.com/#top">video</a> of the spnKiX in early product testing on their website. Totally awesome.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nuances of human interaction are so complex that even as adults we often misunderstand one another and at other times, we want to shout our message plainly from the rooftops. So to help us communicate more effectively, <a href="http://www.snapcuts.com/">SnapCuts</a> offers video messaging using prepared clips from film and TV to help pass on the message with clarity. Think &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;, &#8220;Thanks for being my friend&#8221;, &#8220;I got the job!&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-31413" title="SnapCuts" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/interface-490x310.jpg" alt="SnapCuts" width="490" height="310" /></p>
<p>The SnapCuts website lets you create the message you want to convey from a fair selection of clips from film and TV. Some are definitely classics, others are unknowns (to me anyway), but there&#8217;s enough to get your message over, which is probably the main thing. There is tag search, so if you are looking for clips that have a particular theme, you can find them easily enough. The site has an easy-to-use editor &#8211; the snapper &#8211; that lets you set up a string of clips, if that&#8217;s what you need.</p>
<p>The site is free to use and all the clips are legally licensed too, so there&#8217;s no dodgy stuff here. The business model is to encourage rights owners to license the clips in return for a link from SnapCuts to where the full film or TV show can be purchased. Nice idea.</p>

<p>USB 3.0, branded &#8220;USB SuperSpeed&#8221; has recently arrived and is beginning to find it&#8217;s way into products hitting the market now.  The organization recently certified two new Intel chipsets for USB SuperSpeed, bringing the total number of certified products now on the market to more than 360.  In the video below you can find out a little bit more about what to expect from USB 3.0, such as syncing speeds, power efficiency, and charging speed.  You will also get a sneak peak about a new power delivery spec that is coming out soon.  Find out more <a href="http://www.usb.org/home">here</a>.</p>

<p>The new headphones are designed mainly for sports.  They boast a healthier environment because they go over, instead of in, the ears and reast on your cheekbones.  This means you aren&#8217;t closed off from the world while you&#8217;re running, biking, or whatever.  That&#8217;s important because you certainly need to hear that horn beeping behind you.  The membranes are waterproof, meaning they can easily be cleaned, which is again important for athletes because of sweat.</p>
<p>There are three different models of the AfterShokz, one of which has an inline microphone making it suitable for phone calls as well.  The models begin at $59.95 for the Sport, and go up slightly for the Mobile and Gaming models.  There is also a Bluetooth model in the works.  You can learn more in the video below and by visiting <a href="http://www.aftershokz.com/Default.asp">AfterShokz</a>.</p>

Each mouse is wireless, operating on the 2.4 GHz frequency.  This year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas they unveiled the third-generation of their lineup.</p>
<p>Regardless of if you are looking for a Ford, Nissan, or even a Lamborghini, you will find it here.  The latest model utilizes the HP Comfort Mouse technology and operates on a single AA battery, with a promised 4-6 month battery life.  You can get a  little extra life if you decide not to enable the working headlights, which come on when motion is detected.</p>
<p>Roadmice also has matching mouse pads and USB drives available for purchase and are working on releasing keyboards as well.  Prices for the mice range from $39.99 to $49.99 depending on the car model you want.  You can find out more at <a href="http://www.roadmice.com/">Roadmice</a> and see a demo in the video below.</p>

Andy finds out what its capable of from Akash at <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">CES</a> Showstoppers.</p>
<p>The basic premise of iTwin is a pair of USB devices, one of which goes in your work desktop, the other in your home (or laptop) computer. Files can then be copied securely to and from the work computer across the internet to the laptop.</p>
<p>The devices are cryptographically paired together to ensure the security of the connection and the creators seem to have solutions for most of the issues that might arise, such as dynamic IPs or theft.</p>
<p>The brilliance of iTwin is that it offers a personal cloud solution where the data is completely under your control but not actually in your possession. No risk of theft, loss or nosey border guards rifling through your files.</p>
<p>Works with both Windows PCs and Mac &#8211; available now for $99.</p>

		<itunes:summary>iTwin is billed as an &quot;infinite capacity thumb drive&quot; but this sells the device short - it&#039;s much more than this. Andy finds out what its capable of from Akash at CES Showstoppers.

The basic premise of iTwin is a pair of USB devices, one of which goes in your work desktop, the other in your home (or laptop) computer. Files can then be copied securely to and from the work computer across the internet to the laptop.

The devices are cryptographically paired together to ensure the security of the connection and the creators seem to have solutions for most of the issues that might arise, such as dynamic IPs or theft.

The brilliance of iTwin is that it offers a personal cloud solution where the data is completely under your control but not actually in your possession. No risk of theft, loss or nosey border guards rifling through your files.

Works with both Windows PCs and Mac - available now for $99.

Andy and Courtney take a peek with John Palmeri.</p>
<p>Taking a photograph with a smartphone (or any camera for that matter) is somewhat obvious and there are times when you&#8217;d like to be a little more discrete. The MirrorCase is an iPhone case with an angled mirror which allows a photo or video to be taken when the iPhone is held horizontally. A free camera app is included which has a &#8220;boss&#8221; mode, showing a fake app screen with a flick of the finger.</p>
<p>The MirrorCase is on pre-order at the moment for $80, with deliveries expected before the summer. An iPad version is in development.</p>

<p>PureGear have completely fixed this problem by building the applicator into the packaging so the screen protector goes on right first time. No air bubbles and it all lines up.

<p>It&#8217;s a little pricey at $24.99 on-line (according to the video it&#8217;s $19.95) but the protector is a high quality film with self-healing properties that should last a year.</p>

<p>iPowerUp offers a range of <a href="http://www.ipowerup.net/index.php/component/virtuemart/iphone">charging cases</a> for iPhone that provide physical protection combined with a lithium-polymer battery to double the usage time. Both the phone and the battery can be charged through micro-USB port without removing the iPhone. Price is $60. Further variants have a built-in FM transmitter to play music through car radios and another has a solar cell on the back.</p>
<p>Amazingly, iPowerUp has managed to cram a <a href="http://www.ipowerup.net/index.php/component/virtuemart/iphone/2011-12-22-23-24-554-detail">mini DLP projector</a> into a charging case that&#8217;s only a little bit bigger than an iPhone. The iPower Pro will display at 640&#215;360 resolution but can create a projection up to 60&#8243; from 9&#8217;6&#8243; away. Of course it will need to be in a darkened room to achieve this full size and a smaller projection will be far more watchable. Priced at $229, it&#8217;s on sale now.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-31195" title="GreenSmart Laptop Sleeve" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/is.jpg" alt="GreenSmart Laptop Sleeve" width="240" height="240" align="left" hspace="5" />A good bag can make travelling a pleasure and it&#8217;s important to choose the right bag for your needs. It&#8217;s even better if its a &#8220;green&#8221; bag. Andy and Courtney interview Tom Larsen from <a href="http://www.greensmart.biz/">GreenSmart</a> on their range of eco-friendy travel bags and gadget gear.</p>
<p>GreenSmart&#8217;s unique selling point is not just that the bags are good-looking and functional, it&#8217;s that the bags themselves are made from recycled materials, hence both the &#8220;green&#8221; and &#8220;smart&#8221;.</p>
<p>On show are <a href="http://store.greensmart.biz/laptop_sleeves.htm">laptop</a> and tablet sleeves in a neoprene-like material made from recycled plastic bottles. There&#8217;s also a <a href="http://store.greensmart.biz/backpacks.htm">backpack</a> made completely from recycled materials.</p>
<p>To reduce packaging waste, GreenSmart designs the retail display of the product as part of the bag itself. For example, a carry handle is used to hang the bag from the display rail while it&#8217;s on show in-store.</p>
<p>GreenSmart bags are on sale <a href="http://www.greensmart.biz/">on-line</a> and in select retail locations.</p>

		<itunes:summary>A good bag can make travelling a pleasure and it&#039;s important to choose the right bag for your needs. It&#039;s even better if its a &quot;green&quot; bag. Andy and Courtney interview Tom Larsen from GreenSmart on their range of eco-friendy travel bags and gadget gear.

GreenSmart&#039;s unique selling point is not just that the bags are good-looking and functional, it&#039;s that the bags themselves are made from recycled materials, hence both the &quot;green&quot; and &quot;smart&quot;.

On show are laptop and tablet sleeves in a neoprene-like material made from recycled plastic bottles. There&#039;s also a backpack made completely from recycled materials.

To reduce packaging waste, GreenSmart designs the retail display of the product as part of the bag itself. For example, a carry handle is used to hang the bag from the display rail while it&#039;s on show in-store.

GreenSmart bags are on sale on-line and in select retail locations.

		<itunes:summary>These days many of us own the Amazon Kindle, and unfortunately many have found out just how fragile the device can be.  Solarmio, who recently won an Innovation Award at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, has some solutions to protect your favorite e-reader.  The new Solarmio Kindle case will not only protect the device, but it has a few other handy features like a light for nighttime reading with a separate battery to power it for up to 50 hours.  The case not only can be charged by a standard USB cable, but also has a solar panel cover that can keep it charged as well.

The Solarmio cover is available now for $79.99.  You can see a full demonstration in the video below, as well as find out more by visiting Solarmio on the web, where you can also purchase this cool case for your Kindle.

I even seem to remember that it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VL-BUS">VL-bus</a> card, so that dates it to a pre-Pentium era. Anyway, it&#8217;s great to see that Diamond is still around when so many others have fallen by the wayside. Todd interviews Louis Kokenis from Diamond Multimedia on the latest products.</p>
<p>The Diamond Wireless Range Extender has three functions in one. First, it&#8217;s a wireless repeater that eliminates deadspots in wireless coverage. Second, it&#8217;s a wireless bridge that will connect a wired network device to the wireless network and third, it&#8217;s a standalone wireless access point, creating wireless hotspot from a single network point. With regard to the last mode, the WR300N&#8217;s small size means that it&#8217;s great for travelling and creating a wireless network in a hotel room. On-sale now for around $60.</p>
<p>Diamond will be introducing an <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>-based TV set-top box that combines web browser, media player, ebook reader, game console, anything that can be downloaded from the <a href="https://market.android.com/">Android Market</a>. It won&#8217;t be tied to any particular media provider as it will either be able to download an app, e.g. <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, or else it will be able to browse to any website and play media directly. Sounds cool, especially if it runs <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-4.0-highlights.html#UserFeatures">ICS</a>.</p>

Typically stylish and yellow-lensed, Todd occasionally wears a pair of Gunnars while doing the GNC show.</p>
<p>Joe Croft dropped in to show off the latest specs and Gunnar currently has a <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/products/">four-way</a> line-up with Advanced Computer, Advanced Gaming, Premium 3D and Advanced Outdoor eyewear. As you might guess, three out of the four are primarily for indoor use only.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/shop/Advanced-Computer-Eyewear/">Advanced Computer</a> eyewear is for those people who use computer screens all day and the glasses help with the typical symptoms of prolonged computer use, such as a lowering in the blink rate leading to dry eyes, tired eye muscles from short range focussing and poor light quality from fluorescent lights. The technology in Gunnar glasses addresses each of those issues to make the eyes more comfortable while using a computer screen.</p>
<p>The new Spring 2012 collection is now out at <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/shop/Advanced-Computer-Eyewear/">Gunnars</a>. Prices from $80 &#8211; $300 for standard lenses. Budget up to $700 for custom prescription lenses from <a href="http://www.zeiss.co.uk/">Zeiss</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18637" title="Green Plug Logo" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/GREENPLUG.png" alt="Green Plug Logo" width="150" height="109" align="left" hspace="10" />As energy prices rise and green credentials come under scrutiny, each step in the energy path is being examined for inefficiency. Andy and Courtney listen to Paul Panepinto from <a href="http://www.greenplug.us/">Green Plug</a> on their technology.</p>
<p>Green Plug have developed a digital controller to optimise the conversion of electricity between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power">AC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Current">DC</a>. For the non-engineers, AC (alternative current)  is what is in your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity">wall socket</a> and DC (direct current) is what most of your gadgets use. All those power bricks and wall warts are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer">transformers</a> combined with AC to DC converters to change 110 V AC to 12V / 5V DC.</p>
<p>Green Plug has pioneered the use of intercommunicating digital power and load processors to optimise the AC-to-DC power conversion and increase efficiency. It&#8217;s an area that has been typically overlooked in power management but Green Plug has reduced the implementation cost to make the inclusion of the technology cost-effective. Over the next few years, it&#8217;s likely that this technology will start to appear laptop and phone chargers, so keep an eye out for it.</p>

Andy and Courtney breathe a sigh of relief and chat to Stewart Oldroyd from Leonar3Do.</p>
<p>Hungarian start-up have created &#8220;the world&#8217;s first desktop VR kit&#8221;, consisting of the scary controller above, 3D glasses and three line sensors that affix to the computer monitor to track the position of the controller and the glasses.

<p>The innovative part is that it&#8217;s an out-of-the-box environment which costs around $1500 rather the $10,000+ usually associated with VR systems. Currently only available for enterprise and education markets, the consumer version will arrive in late spring.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-31010" title="ClearSounds Logo" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/logo3.gif" alt="ClearSounds Logo" width="195" height="98" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" />Surprisingly, one in five Americans over the age of 12 has hearing loss severe enough to affect communication and in over a third of the cases, the loss is from noise exposure, not age. <a href="http://www.clearsounds.com/">ClearSounds</a> produces a range of stylish products that help people overcome their hearing loss and communicate again. Andy and Courtney talk to company president, Michele Alman of ClearSounds.</p>
<p>Suffering from a hearing loss is less about the physical impairment and more about the isolation and withdrawal that occurs when it becomes difficult to hear what&#8217;s going on. The problem doesn&#8217;t only affect the afflicted; friends and family stop calling and phoning because it&#8217;s simply too hard to have a conversation. In turn, the lack of contact leads people into depression.</p>
<p>ClearSounds have a range of products aimed at remedying everyday situations &#8211; people with hearing loss want to use cool tech too. The <a href="https://www.clearsounds.com/product/clearsounds-i700-icreations-phone">ClearSounds i700 iCreations Phone</a> is combination landline and iPhone dock. The enhanced handset combines a DECT cordless phone with a Bluetooth receiver so only one handset is needed to take both landline and mobile phone calls.</p>
<p>For watching TV, the <a href="https://www.clearsounds.com/product/clearblue-bluetooth-tvaudio-listening-system">ClearBlue Bluetooth TV/Audio Listening System</a> is a Bluetooth transmitter and headphones receiver. Rather than turning the TV volume up until it rocks the house, the headphones let the individual set the volume just right for them.</p>

Andy and Don get a demo from Peter on what the app offers.</p>
<p>The Line2 app provides a second line by using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VoIP</a> connection over 3G or wi-fi. All the features of a telephony service are present with a phone number, voicemail, text messaging, call-forwarding and so on. There&#8217;s also HD audio if you are calling another Line2 user.</p>
<p>Being a data service and able to use wi-fi means that it&#8217;s possible to send and receive calls where there&#8217;s no mobile phone signal but there is a wireless connection. SIM-less devices such as iPod Touches or wi-fi-only tablets can become phones too.</p>

<p>The Canon G1X boasts a very large 1.5 inch sensor, making it almost as good as an entry-level DSLR.  The large sensor allows for great low-light performance and the ability to give your photos that professional-looking &#8220;background blur&#8221;.  Other features include a 4x optical zoom, a rotating 3 inch LCD display, 1920 x 1080 video recording, 14-bit RAW shooting, and the ability to attach EOS accessories to the lens.  That last feature is perhaps the coolest part, because now amateurs can begin experimenting with upgrading their photos without making the DSLR investment.  Plus, those EOS accessories can be used later if you do decide to make the jump to a Canon DSLR.</p>
<p>You can expect about 250 shots out of the lithium-ion battery between charges and you can use any standard SD card.  The Canon G1X will be available later this month with a MSRP of $799.  Keep an eye on the <a href="http://shop.usa.canon.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/subCategory_10051_10051_-1_17755">Canon PowerShot</a> site for it&#8217;s release.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year <a href="http://xi3.com/">Xi3</a> showed off a tiny modular computer that they were planning to bring to market, but now it&#8217;s actually available and there is some new software to make it even more capable.  As the name implies, almost everything about these tiny computers can be swapped out easily to change their functionality.  In addition, Xi3&#8242;s new software allows one of these little PC&#8217;s to power multiple users.</p>
<p>These computers pack a serious punch, with dual-core processors, 64-bit OS (either Windows or Linux), SSD storage, and they boast a Windows 7 Pro boot-up time of only 30 seconds.</p>

<p>They also showed off some new server solutions which are essentially the same as the modular desktop computer, but the ports on the back are somewhat different, as they are geared towards the server market.  You really need to see the mobile data center they created on the CES floor with these tiny micro-servers, but you will have to watch the video below for that.</p>

<p>The list included NPR Radio, for those who can&#8217;t live without their &#8220;This American Life&#8221; fix (guilty), Stitcher Radio, Tune-In Radio, and IHeartRadio.  In addition, they debuted Sync Destinations and announced that Scout, another location app, will be integrating into Sync in the future.  Be sure to watch the video below to get a demonstration of how all of these apps, running on your phone, will integrate right into the Sync touch-screen built into your Ford car.  Your phone, and it&#8217;s apps, will integrate into your car right over a Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>Currently Ford is not only looking at adding Sync to all new vehicles, but actually looking at ways that they can add it to previously released vehicles.  All of the Sync features are voice-controlled.  You&#8217;ll hear a complete list of features and vehicles in the video.</p>

Allante takes in the latest audio extravaganza.</p>
<p>First up are the flagship <a href="http://soulelectronics.com/shop/products/sl300wb/">SL300</a> flagship noise-cancelling headphones, with built-in amplification giving great sound even within noisy environments such as aircraft.</p>
<p>The little brother to the SL300s are the <a href="http://soulelectronics.com/en/shop/products/sl100ub/">SL100</a>s, a smaller headset; still very stylish, but without the noise-cancellation.</p>
<p>And if you prefer earbuds, the <a href="http://soulelectronics.com/en/shop/products/sl49/">SL49</a> and <a href="http://soulelectronics.com/en/shop/products/sl99/">SL99</a>s are good choices depending on budget.</p>
<p>Finally, the brand new &#8220;Party in Box&#8221; is a portable iPhone dock&#8230;but when I say &#8220;portable&#8221;, I don&#8217;t mean slip-it-in-your-pocket portable. It&#8217;s the size of a small suitcase and has a carrying handle. Granted, the sound quality should be amazing and it will blow any other sound dock into the weeds but if you want it, prepare to fork out $1299. Wow!</p>
<p>Pity we missed the party&#8230;</p>

		<itunes:summary>SOUL by Ludacris can be guaranteed to have some nice gear on show and they don&#039;t disappoint. Allante takes in the latest audio extravaganza.

First up are the flagship SL300 flagship noise-cancelling headphones, with built-in amplification giving great sound even within noisy environments such as aircraft.

The little brother to the SL300s are the SL100s, a smaller headset; still very stylish, but without the noise-cancellation.

And if you prefer earbuds, the SL49 and SL99s are good choices depending on budget.

Finally, the brand new &quot;Party in Box&quot; is a portable iPhone dock...but when I say &quot;portable&quot;, I don&#039;t mean slip-it-in-your-pocket portable. It&#039;s the size of a small suitcase and has a carrying handle. Granted, the sound quality should be amazing and it will blow any other sound dock into the weeds but if you want it, prepare to fork out $1299. Wow!

Pity we missed the party...

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ProDock is a new way of hooking up your mobile device to your TV.  Many smartphones and tablets these days have mini HDMI ports, but ProDock goes one better with a 6 foot cable that plugs into the USB port on your device allowing you to then connect a full-size HDMI cable to the other end of the dock.  With this added 6 feet of room you no longer have keep your phone uncomfortably close to your TV.  There are a few things required though.  First the device must have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_High-definition_Link">MHL</a> built-in and the technology is fairly new, so only the latest Android smartphones currently have this.  According to their literature,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;MHL is a high definition video and audio interface standard designed for connecting mobile devices to HD TVs. Supports up to 1080p HD video, 60 fps and digital audio output, Dolby 7.1 support. Technology was established by the MHL™ Consortium and is supported by multiple handset vendors.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.clarityoneaudio.com/">ClarityOne</a> visited <a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2011/02/12/puresound-technology-and-clarityone-earbuds/">GNC</a> at last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">CES</a> with their prototype earbuds and this year, Dean Kurnell returns to report on progress and to show of the new headset. Alex and Courtney listen in on the pursuit of sonic perfection.</p>
<p>ClarityOne&#8217;s PureSound processor is at the heart of their products and it completely eliminates distortion from the speaker, no matter how small. According to Dean, the dual-unity coupled coil creates a magnetic break by cancelling out the inductive reactance, which allows the audio signal to travel without distortion. We&#8217;ll have to take his word for that, but it&#8217;s covered by six awarded patents and two pending ones.</p>
<p>There will be three earbuds in the range. $149 for the pro music version that has inline music controls, $129 for the smartphone version which has a microphone and calling features, and $109 for just the earbuds. At the moment, only the $129 set is on sale but the other models will be along soon. Available <a href="http://www.clarityoneaudio.com/Buy/Buy">on-line</a> and in retail stores.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-30770" title="iShower Bluetooth Speaker" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/logo1-300x84.gif" alt="iShower Bluetooth Speaker" width="240" height="67" />At last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">CES</a>, <a href="http://www.idevicesinc.com/">iDevices</a> showed off the <a href="http://www.igrillinc.com/">iGrill</a>, a Bluetooth-enabled cooking thermometer. This year, they&#8217;re back with <a href="http://www.ishowerinc.com/">iShower</a>, a waterproof speaker. Andy and Don tune in with Jonathan Conelias from iDevices.</p>
<p>As with the iGrill, the iShower is Bluetooth-enabled, playing audio from <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> and <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">Blackberry</a> phones. In fact, any device that can stream music via Bluetooth will work with the iShower and up to five devices can be paired. Naturally the iShower is waterproof, making it suitable for the shower, swimming pool and beach. Buttons on the iShower can control the music, skipping backwards and forwards through the playlist.</p>
<p>The iShower&#8217;s rich sound speaker cuts through the noise of the shower and in good taste, there&#8217;s no microphone. If you were thinking of taking a phone call in the shower, think again. A mounting bracket is supplied and complementary accessories such as a mirror make this a complete shower solution.</p>
<p>The iShower will be available from March both online and in good retail stores with an MSRP of $99.99.</p>

Andy and Don talk with co-founder Rebecca Levey about the site&#8217;s features and how they&#8217;re tailored to children.</p>
<p>Children are often left out of the on-line world as the major social networking sites such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> enforce age restrictions on their members, and rightly so. KidzVuz encourages junior members to join in but addresses child protection issues by seeking parental permission, moderating all content and preserving anonymity. The site is completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Online_Protection_Act">COPA</a>-compliant.</p>
<p>KidzVuz encourages children to upload video reviews of toys and games; to reward participation, many activities are turned into games with worldwide leaderboards. The site is categorised with different areas such as games, books and film. Food and travel has proved popular with children reporting back on family holidays.</p>
<p>KidzVuz is free to use by children and there is complementary <a href="http://blog.kidzvuz.com/">blog</a> for parents.</p>

<p>Silentium has developed an active noise reduction system that can be implemented in a single chip. The complex (and proprietary) algorithms programmed into the chip use noise cancellation (destructive interference) to reduce the amount of sound coming from a machine to make it quieter.

<p>nVidia was at the Consumer Electronics Show last month to show off their Tegra 3 quad-core processor running Windows 8 tablets.  The new chipset allows these tablets to be extremely thin, have longer battery life, and high-resolution graphics.  In the video below you can get a look at a little bit of what they are capable of, such as HD video playback, and full Windows multi-tasking.</p>
<p>The exact specifications and pricing aren&#8217;t yet available, but you can learn more by visiting the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html">nVidia</a> site.</p>

		<itunes:summary>As you have almost certainly already heard, one of the big things coming in Windows 8 will be it&#039;s support of ARM processors.  The main feature of the new operating system, though, is the radical new Metro interface.  The Metro Start screen displays a series of &quot;live tiles&quot;.  These are the apps, some of which come with Windows 8, and some which will be installed by the user from the new Windows Store, which are constantly updating with new information.  You could display such things as current weather, Twitter, news, and a lot more on your personalized start screen.

nVidia was at the Consumer Electronics Show last month to show off their Tegra 3 quad-core processor running Windows 8 tablets.  The new chipset allows these tablets to be extremely thin, have longer battery life, and high-resolution graphics.  In the video below you can get a look at a little bit of what they are capable of, such as HD video playback, and full Windows multi-tasking.

The exact specifications and pricing aren&#039;t yet available, but you can learn more by visiting the nVidia site.

<p>TPN&#8217;s own Jeffery Powers stopped by the Verizon booth and got a first-hand demonstration of how it works.  The touchscreen allows for seamless scrolling through all of the music, but even better, you can snap a photo and immediately upload it to email, Facebook, or other locations.  The photo editor has multiple filters to allow the user to choose the exact photo they want.</p>
<p>Users may or may not like the fact that their video is also captured during karaoke, but that aside, the device is available right now, although it&#8217;s probably more for the bar than the home.  Users can even access the device from their phone, so there&#8217;s no need to walk over to the touchscreen.  Head over the <a href="https://www.lte.vzw.com/">Verizon Innovation</a> site for more info.</p>

<p>The new camera is called the Smartcam and it&#8217;s designed to keep an eye on your home while you are away.  The camera is tiny and dead simple to set up.  Simply push a button on the camera and one on your router and you should be up and running.  While it isn&#8217;t said in the interview below, we will assume that this means the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup">WPS</a>&#8221; button, which all modern routers and extenders come with.  The camera uses motion-detection and audio-detection to activate it and will send you an alert if it has been activated.  In addition, it will record what it picks up to a personal, password-protected YouTube account.  Features include night-vision up to 15 feet, free apps for all mobile platforms, and an always-on setting to allow you to view it anytime, even when it hasn&#8217;t picked up activity.</p>
<p>The Samsung SmartCam will be available this March for $149.99.  Keep an eye out for it at the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung</a> site, and check out the video below to get a first look at it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-30668" title="Siano Mobile Silicon Logo" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/siano-logo.gif" alt="Siano Mobile Silicon Logo" width="204" height="66" vspace="5" />Although not present in the USA and Europe, viewing broadcast TV on mobile phones is very popular in Asian countries and parts of South America. Andy and Don talk to Guy from <a href="http://www.siano-ms.com/">Siano Mobile Silicon</a> about the technology behind this cultural phenomena.</p>
<p>Watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_TV">broadcast TV on mobile phones</a> has been very popular in China, Japan and Korea, particularly with people who commute on buses and trains. Much as those of us in the US or UK listen to an MP3 player as we trundle to work, they watch TV. Siano produces the chipset which decodes the broadcast signal and they have a TV accessory that plugs into the Apple connector on an<a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone"> iPhone</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> to show broadcast TV on the screen.</p>
<p>Phones that can show broadcast TV are expected in the US market during 2012, with coverage available in most major cities. Pricing to be announced.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Although not present in the USA and Europe, viewing broadcast TV on mobile phones is very popular in Asian countries and parts of South America. Andy and Don talk to Guy from Siano Mobile Silicon about the technology behind this cultural phenomena.

Watching broadcast TV on mobile phones has been very popular in China, Japan and Korea, particularly with people who commute on buses and trains. Much as those of us in the US or UK listen to an MP3 player as we trundle to work, they watch TV. Siano produces the chipset which decodes the broadcast signal and they have a TV accessory that plugs into the Apple connector on an iPhone or iPod to show broadcast TV on the screen.

Phones that can show broadcast TV are expected in the US market during 2012, with coverage available in most major cities. Pricing to be announced.

<p>Announced at <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">CES</a>, the <a href="http://store.makerbot.com/replicator.html">MakerBot Replicator</a> is bigger and better, with an increased volume capacity and the dual extrusion, i.e. able to create objects from two materials, most usually two colours. Model files can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL file format</a> and there&#8217;s no shortage of different objects to try out.</p>

<p>The new Replicator costs $1750 for a single extruder and $1999 for a dual extruder. There&#8217;s a bit of a lead time at the moment because of its popularity with deliveries expected in a couple of months.</p>

Andy and Don chat to Carla of <a href="http://www.smithmicro.com/">Smith Micro Software</a> to find out what else the company does.</p>
<p>Smith Micro has a portfolio of products in the mobile wireless space, delivering solutions for telcos and cable operators. As Carla points out, if you&#8217;ve ever connected your laptop to a 3G network, you&#8217;ve probably used some of their software.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smithmicro.com/about/news/sprint-selects-mobile-network-director-data-offload-from-smith-micro.aspx">Sprint</a> chose Smith Micro&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smithmicro.com/products/mobile-network-director.aspx">Mobile Network Director</a> to intelligently manage traffic between 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi connections. A software client on the smartphone works with the carrier&#8217;s systems to select the connection technology that will give the best performance in the particular situation. For example, in a very congested 4G area, the software will transfer the data connection to a quieter and consequently faster 3G network.</p>
<p>From the interview, it sounds like <a href="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</a> has learnt from the CarrierIQ debacle and while the software on the smartphone works transparently, the owner can override the connection selection manually. Good.</p>

Andy finds out more.</p>
<p>PrivacyStar is a smartphone app to block unwanted calls and SMS texts. At its simplest, user-specified phone numbers can be blocked to prevent calls or texts coming through and bothering you. The app also features SmartBlocking which blocks the top 25 numbers blocked by other users in the past week, so if there&#8217;s a major calling campaign on, those numbers pretty quickly get blocked.</p>
<p>Other features include CallerID lookup, where if the phone doesn&#8217;t know who is calling, the app consults with an on-line directory and displays the caller. For really persistent callers, complaints can be filed directly with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">FTC</a>.</p>
<p>The app is currently only available for <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.privacystar.android">Android</a> and <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/4890">Blackberry</a>, an iPhone version will be released before the summer. The app is free for a week and then $2.99 per month after that.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-30633" title="ContourRoam video camera" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/roam2-150x92.jpg" alt="ContourRoam video camera" width="150" height="92" />Snowboarders, skiers, mountainbikers, sky divers, hunters &#8211; if you want to show off your latest adventures to your friends and enemies, then Contour&#8217;s new bullet cam is the way to do it. Andy gets the deets from Marie at <a href="http://contour.com/">Contour</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://contour.com/products/contour-plus">Contour+</a> was launched back in spring 2011 and quickly gained a following among the extreme sports crowd for the great video quality but at $499, it&#8217;s a little pricey, even if it does come with GPS, Bluetooth and an excellent lens.</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://contour.com/products/contour-roam">ContourRoam</a> arrived in the autumn and is a more affordable $199. It doesn&#8217;t have all the <a href="http://contour.com/products/compare_cameras">features</a> of its more expensive sibling but it does have the 170 degree wide angle lens and it&#8217;s very easy to use with a simple on-off slider switch suitable for gloves or cold hands. Battery life is around 3 hours.</p>
<p>In the video, Marie claims that the camera doesn&#8217;t support microSD cards, but all the literature on Contour&#8217;s website suggests otherwise. There&#8217;s some great video footage on the site, too.</p>

The Contour+ was launched back in spring 2011 and quickly gained a following among the extreme sports crowd for the great video quality but at $499, it&#039;s a little pricey, even if it does come with GPS, Bluetooth and an excellent lens.

The new ContourRoam arrived in the autumn and is a more affordable $199. It doesn&#039;t have all the features of its more expensive sibling but it does have the 170 degree wide angle lens and it&#039;s very easy to use with a simple on-off slider switch suitable for gloves or cold hands. Battery life is around 3 hours.

In the video, Marie claims that the camera doesn&#039;t support microSD cards, but all the literature on Contour&#039;s website suggests otherwise. There&#039;s some great video footage on the site, too.

Courtney gets into the fast lane to find out more about this app which was awarded a <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">CES</a> Innovation Honoree prize.</p>
<p>Available for <a href="http://goo.gl/DEai9">Android</a> smartphones now and the <a href="http://www.ionroad.com/ios">iPhone</a> soon, the app uses the smartphone&#8217;s camera, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gps">GPS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer">accelerometer</a> to provide warnings and guidance to car drivers as they drive. By looking at the white lines, the car in front and correlating data from the GPS and accelerometer, the app can warn about lane departures, tailgating and speeding. The iOnRoad includes a couple of other features, including reading text messages and a car locator.</p>
<p>Obviously the phone has to be mounted on the dash with a view to the front of the car, but you can test the app using the video <a href="http://www.ionroad.com/test">here</a>. The app is currently free with a charge of $9.99 to be introduced in the future.</p>

<p>The new line of Canon cameras also allows users the choice of recording in AVCHD or MP4 format.  The cameras also have enhanced low-light performance, plus a new user interface, better stabilization, and higher zoom.  The entry level R series starts out at $349, so these cameras are affordable for average users, but go up to a level that is acceptable to professionals as well.</p>
<p>The video below packs a lot of information in about these new Canon cameras, so you will definitely want to check it out.  You can also visit the <a href="http://www.canon.com/">Canon web site</a> to learn even more.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Canon was recently at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to show off a new line of camcorders.  There are six new cameras in the Vixia line and the cool new feature is built-in WiFi.  With the WiFi users can now not only transfer their video to computers and other devices, but even upload and post it to places like Facebook and YouTube.  With this new ability comes a new app called &quot;Movie Uploader&quot; that will allow users to seemlessly handle all of their high-def video.

The new line of Canon cameras also allows users the choice of recording in AVCHD or MP4 format.  The cameras also have enhanced low-light performance, plus a new user interface, better stabilization, and higher zoom.  The entry level R series starts out at $349, so these cameras are affordable for average users, but go up to a level that is acceptable to professionals as well.

The video below packs a lot of information in about these new Canon cameras, so you will definitely want to check it out.  You can also visit the Canon web site to learn even more.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/2012/02/04/mxl-tempo-microphone-for-ipad-and-computer/mxl-logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-30591"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-30591" title="mxl logo" src="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mxl-logo.png" alt="" width="186" height="97" /></a>MXL joined Jeffrey powers last month at the Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas to talk about their new Tempo Microphones.  The new Tempo Mics work with both laptop and desktop computers, but they are also compatible with the iPad.  That last part is key because the iPad isn&#8217;t typically able to work with microphones due to power issues.  However, the Tempo works with the lower power by connecting with the camera connector kit, which requires an adapter, but that&#8217;s a cheap price to pay for this ability.</p>
<p>The Tempo will turn your iPad into a mobile recording station, allowing podcasters and others to travel much lighter than was previously possible.  These are condenser mics, not dynamic, so it will need power.  This will provide much better sound than the built-in microphone that Apple provides.  Of course, if you are just doing video chat then that mic will be fine, but for serious recording this is the first real option to come along.  To top it off, the MXL Tempo retails for $79.95.  You can check them out at <a href="http://www.mxlmics.com/">MXLMics</a>.</p>

		<itunes:summary>MXL joined Jeffrey powers last month at the Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas to talk about their new Tempo Microphones.  The new Tempo Mics work with both laptop and desktop computers, but they are also compatible with the iPad.  That last part is key because the iPad isn&#039;t typically able to work with microphones due to power issues.  However, the Tempo works with the lower power by connecting with the camera connector kit, which requires an adapter, but that&#039;s a cheap price to pay for this ability.

The Tempo will turn your iPad into a mobile recording station, allowing podcasters and others to travel much lighter than was previously possible.  These are condenser mics, not dynamic, so it will need power.  This will provide much better sound than the built-in microphone that Apple provides.  Of course, if you are just doing video chat then that mic will be fine, but for serious recording this is the first real option to come along.  To top it off, the MXL Tempo retails for $79.95.  You can check them out at MXLMics.

<p>Universal Plug and Play (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">UPnP</a>) is the standard by which IP networked gadgets advertise their services and intercommunicate. Formed in 1999, nearly all the big vendors are signed up with over 1000 members, the notable exception being Apple who tend to do their own thing. Think <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung</a>, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a>, <a href="http://www.philip.com/">Philips</a>.</p>
<p>The most common example of UPnP (AV spec) is <a href="http://www.dlna.org/">DLNA</a>-certification which governs media management, discovery and control and this effectively determines how music is streamed from one device to another. Set-top boxes know how to use different router ports based on UPnP techniques. Almost any consumer device attached to the network in the home will have some element of UPnP built-in.</p>
<p>(No, Andy, it&#8217;s not the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_Plug_and_Play">ISA PnP</a> but thanks for the trip down memory lane.)</p>

Andy and Courtney finds out what makes Ivee tick.</p>
<p>The Ivee Digit understands natural language and can respond to 35 voice commands and speaks the date, time and temperature. The big sister, Flex, includes a radio as well. You can tell Digit to set the alarm, tell you the time or snooze for another five minutes as you roll over for more ZZzzs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a typical conversation with Ivee.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You: Hello Ivee<br />
Ivee: Say a command<br />
You: Set alarm 1<br />
Ivee: Please tell me the alarm time<br />
You: Seven o&#8217;clock am<br />
Ivee: Alarm 1 is set to 7:00 am</p>
<p>Aside from the novelty value, it&#8217;s great for people who are short-sighted.</p>
