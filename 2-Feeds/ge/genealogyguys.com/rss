            <description><![CDATA[<p>The news includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Guys will be at the <a href="http://www.scgsgenealogy.com/">Southern California Genealogical Society</a>&rsquo;s Jamboree on June 8-10, 2012.</li>
<li><a href="http://rootsmagic.com/">RootsMagic</a> announces new webinars and additions to its catalog of recorded webinars.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.familysearch.org/">FamilySearch</a> announces the addition of millions of new records on its site <i>and</i> the completion of almost half of the 1940 U.S. federal census.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://fgs.org/">Federation of Genealogical Societies</a> announced that its Malcolm H. Stern-NARA Gift Fund has participated with NARA recently in digitizing and making available the records of the Sultana Disaster at the <a href="http://www.fold3.com">Fold3.com</a> website.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ancestry.com">Ancestry.com</a> announced that it has added its 10 billionth record to its site.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ancestry.com">Ancestry.com</a> announced its AncestryDNA<sup>TM</sup> service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listener email includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael asks about the notation on the 1880 U.S. federal census of &ldquo;NG&rdquo; under the birthplaces of an ancestor&rsquo;s parents.</li>
<li>Chris sent a link to a fascinating article about using DNA to determine the origin of the Melungeons.(<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/dna-study-seeks-origin-appalachias-melungeons-201144041.html">http://news.yahoo.com/dna-study-seeks-origin-appalachias-melungeons-201144041.html</a>) Rich also sent another link on the same subject right after the podcast was recorded. (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/24/melungeon-dna-study-origin_n_1544489.html?ref=fb&amp;ir=Black+Voices&amp;src=sp&amp;comm_ref=false%23s=1022230">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/24/melungeon-dna-study-origin_n_1544489.html?ref=fb&amp;ir=Black+Voices&amp;src=sp&amp;comm_ref=false#s=1022230</a>)</li>
<li>Laurie asked about the available DNA tests, and Drew weighs in based on his experience.</li>
<li>Walter asks whether there is a DNA test available to determine whether his mother and a good friend, who looks like his mother&rsquo;s twin, are related.</li>
<li>Susanne asks about genealogy sites that are free.</li>
<li>Bob talks about the work he and his wife are doing as arbiters for the 1940 indexing project.</li>
<li>Tom asks when we think an index to the 1940 census will be available, and comments about the indexes not being made available until an entire state is indexed.</li>
<li>Amy shares information about <i>Titanicat</i> by Marty Crisp.</li>
<li>Linda writes about resources for the descendants of the Armenian Genocide. She tells us that University of Michigan Professor Fatma Muge Gocek has done extensive research on this issue with other area specialists (one is also here at U Michigan &ndash; Ronald Suny in Political Science). If the person who asked the question in an earlier podcast is still trying to find resources that might help her find information on her ancestors, she might send an e-mail to either Professor Gocek (<a href="mailto:Gocek@umich.edu">Gocek@umich.edu</a>) or Professor Suny (<a href="mailto:rgsuny@umich.edu">rgsuny@umich.edu</a>) to see if they know where information on where people were moved or killed and records that might be useful. Gocek, Suny, and another scholar, Norman Naimark at Stanford, co-wrote a book, <i>A Question of Genocide: Armenians and Turks at the End of the Ottoman Empire</i> (<a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/MiddleEastern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195393743">http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/MiddleEastern/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195393743</a>) about the genocide. The Guys both recommend checking the University of South Florida&rsquo;s Holocaust &amp; Genocide Studies Center site at <a href="http://lib.usf.edu/hgsc">http://lib.usf.edu/hgsc</a>.</li>
<li>Ann has a question about her husband&rsquo;s paternal grandfather who was born in international waters while his mother was emigrating from Wales to the United States. In another email, she reports on remarkable files uncovered in the possession of a library.</li>
<li>Jo wrote to provide some clues and resources to Moshe who is researching a Jewish man named Markowsky.</li>

<li>Many condolences have been received from around the world for the passing of Fletcher, our dilute calico cat who "spoke" on many podcasts over the years. She died on 8 December 2011 and is deeply missed.</li>
<li>Carole advises us that the Do&ntilde;a Ana County Genealogical Society in Las Cruces, New Mexico, will be holding its first conference in April 2012. She also discusses the recurrent problem of the accuracy of documentation and the conflicting data that can result.</li>
<li>Dave recently wrote about his research in St. Croix. Listeners may be interested in reading his blog at <a href="http://200inparadise.blogspot.com/">http://200inparadise.blogspot.com</a>.</li>
<li>Mac tells us that if you are going to order any New York certificates, you might also want to cross-reference the databases at <a href="http://italiangen.org/">italiangen.org</a>.</li>
<li>Rich asks a fascinating question about how to represent the correct country in his RootsMagic software for Canada at different historical periods.</li>
<li>Wayne reports that he cannot download the podcast using the latest version of the Ubuntu operating system. The Guys ask other listeners about their experiences with this.</li>
<li>Maria asks Hank Jones and The Guys about Palatines in Australia.</li>
<li>S&eacute;bastien has had good results with the DNA genealogy study between Coombs and Comeau descendants.

<li>Mark shared with us a publication by the <i>St. Louis Post Dispatch</i> that discusses the new National Personnel Records Center facility. The 12-page PDF document is an excellent overview of the NPRC, where many U.S. military service records are stored.</li>
<li>Noi asks for a recommendation of a good website that compares genealogy database software programs. We recommend going to Wikipedia and searching for the phrase &ldquo;Comparison of Genealogy Software&rdquo; for some excellent comparisons.</li>
<li>Susan asks about whether she should use Family Tree Maker 2012 or RootsMagic. This spurred a detailed discussion by The Guys about the GEDCOM standard and how data is exported from one program and imported to another. They talk about the fact that there will be a need to manually handle some data after the transfer.</li>

He believes his ancestor appears on the 1852 California State Census for Placer County, Page 60, Line 28. However, the digitized image at Ancestry.com is so dark that he is having difficulty reading the first initial. He is hoping that the original census page or a better copy of the microfilm exist and can help him discern the intial.

Some have even attacked Drew's position on the importance of source citations, stating that citing sources takes the fun out of genealogy. The Guys talk about how important and integral source citations are in everyone's research.<br/> ]]></description>

			<title>The Genealogy Guys Podcast #191 - 2009 December 7 UPDATE</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://genealogyguys.com/the_genealogy_guys_podcast_191_2009_december_7_update]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Guys published a new podcast dated December 7, 2009. However, one
of our listeners reported a problem with the repetition of material
following the first commercial break. This is the second time this has
occurred. We rechecked the file and verified the problem. We believe it
is a software problem with GarageBand, the software we use to record and
process the podcasts. We believe that the &quot;mix down&quot; process that
occurs after the editing of the podcast, and what actually produces the
MP3 file, has a bug in it.<br/>
<br/>
We are searching for details about this problem. However, in the
meantime, we remixed the file, created a new one, and
uploaded/published the podcast again.<br/>
<br/>
The new, corrected file was republished this evening (12/10/09). If you
want to obtain the corrected file, please visit The Genealogy Guys
Podcast website at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://genealogyguys.com/" target="_blank">http://genealogyguys.com</a> and open or download the new file.<br/><br/>Sorry for the problem, but we're on it!            <br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://genealogyguys.com/the_genealogy_guys_podcast_179_2009_july_31]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This week's news includes: <a href="http://www.ancestry.com" target="_blank">Ancestry.com</a> launches a new feature called Member Connect to make connecting with others easier; and the <a href="http://fgs.org" target="_blank">Federation of Genealogy Societies</a> (FGS) reminds our listeners that the 2009 FGS Conference is only a month away, September 2-5, in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Guys reminds listeners that they will be there doing a LIVE podcast recording session with an audience.<br/><br/>The Guys welcome Julie Miller, CG, and Drew interviews her at the <a href="http://www.scgsgenealogy.com" target="_blank">Southern California Genealogical Society</a>'s Jamboree about research into the ancestors and relatives of a certain Denver celebrity.<br/><br/>This week's listener email includes: Clive asked George to also share the fact that The National Archives (TNA) in the UK also produces podcasts at <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/podcasts/default.htm" target="_blank">http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/podcasts/default.htm</a> on many topics; he also asks if we can find out when the &quot;Criminal Registers, 1791-1892,&quot; from Ancestry's World Archive Project will be available online (and George will check); Clive also tells us another story of the use of the word &quot;craic.&quot; (Drew also discusses the Geo Challenge game on <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook.com</a>.) Bill reminds us that PAF (Personal Ancestral File genealogy software from the LDS Church) is still an excellent free option for creating and maintaining your database; Noi asked about <a href="http://www.footnote.com" target="_blank">Footnote.com</a>'s calculation of the percent completed in the Civil War Widows' Pension Files collection, and received an answer from Footnote Support that she shared with everyone; Damien thanked The Guys for information about photo tagging software; Michael asked which death date to use in his database when his great uncle died at home about 11:00 PM and the doctor did not arrive to create the death certificate until about 12:30 AM on the next day; Michael also shares his difficulties working with the New Jersey state government to obtain an old death certificate -- the search was $25.00, regardless of outcome, required an extensive set of proofs of his relationship to the person for whose record he was requesting, <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> the office was exceptionally rude when he followed up by telephone. Ann Gulbransen, Historian for the Ohio Society of Mayflower Descendants, responded to a listener's inquiry in Episode 177. She tells us that the official books that trace Mayflower ancestry are called &quot;The Mayflower Families Genealogies through Five Generations.&quot; Also known as the Silver Books, the completed books and indexes can be purchased through the online store at the Society's website at <a href="http://www.themayflowersociety.com" target="_blank">http://www.themayflowersociety.com</a>. Kay is concerned about Ancestry's Hints and their application to potentially incorrect data. Rabbi Gary M. Gans has a new iPod and has been listening to the show since the first day he got it, and he inquired about the &quot;Brisco&quot; name he has heard George mention.<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week's news includes: NBC has temporarily shelved the U.S. edition of the popular show, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;; and <a href="http://www.ancestry.ca" target="_blank">Ancestry.ca</a>, the Canadian version of <a href="http://www.ancestry.com" target="_blank">Ancestry.com</a>, has released a new database, Border Crossings from the U.S. to Canada, 1908-1935, which contains more than 1.6 million names. Drew eulogizes genealogist Donna Dinberg, the noted librarian from the <span>Library and Archives Canada and an expert in Jewish genealogy, who died of cancer on 11 April 2009</span>. <br/><br/>George's new book, the second edition of <span style="font-style: italic;">How to Do Everything: Genealogy</span>, has just been published by McGraw-Hill, and the book is available from Amazon.com at <span><a class="smarterwiki-linkify" href="http://tinyurl.com/HTDE2-GGM" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/HTDE2-GGM</a></span><span>.<br/><br/>George and Drew discuss upcoming seminar appearances. George will be hosting a Webinar for Ancestry.com titled, Planning a Perfect Family Reunion, 14 May 2009 at 9:00 PM (Eastern). You can register at </span><span><a class="smarterwiki-linkify" href="http://tinyurl.com/ReunionWebinar">http://tinyurl.com/ReunionWebinar</a>. </span><br/><span><br/>Listener email this week includes: Sharon reports that My Yahoo! is not updating the podcasts listings, and The Guys ask for any suggestions from other listeners; Melanie discusses contacting other researchers who have errors in their online family trees; Jill suggests having DNA testing done for your oldest relatives before it is too late; Timothy, a Mac user, asks for advice about how to use Windows-based CDs from his genealogy society that are DRM protected; Stella reports that she followed George's suggestions in his &quot;The Genealogist as CSI&quot; seminar, went back to reread everything on one ancestor, and was able to verify his participation in the War of 1812; Rollin reports on a free Windows-based program, Winsplit Revolution, available at <a href="http://www.winsplit-revolution.com" target="_blank">http://www.winsplit-revolution.com</a>, that &quot;</span>allows you to easily organize your open windows by tiling, resizing and
positioning them to make the best use of your desktop real estate&quot;; Matt Combs has developed a new piece of Windows-based software called Surname Findit, available for download at <a href="http://mattcombs.webs.com/sfmain.html" target="_blank">http://mattcombs.webs.com/sfmain.html</a>, that helps decipher possible surnames from fragments you may have discovered in hard to read documents; Beth in Ontario, Canada, found an old cookbook from New York and wonders whether people would be interested in her digitized images of the pages (and Drew responds with his expert research method used to locate the book and digitized images); Rich forwarded the text of a 1984 death notice of a man whose wife's maiden name is Weinglass (one of Drew's ancestral lines); George asks for suggestions about how to cite alternate spellings of a surname in his database and source citations; The Guys thank Gus for his extensive research into articles in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> concerning services that digitize photos, and these include:<br/><br/><div style="margin-left: 40px;">- ShoeboxReprints.com/ScanMyPhotos.com (<a

Click <a href="http://rootstelevision.com/players/player_dearlydeparted.php?bctid=1721792910" target="_blank">here</a> to go directly to the episode about &quot;The Miltons.&quot; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> The Genealogy Guys Podcast's fans at Facebook.com got an email as soon as the new episode was released!<br/><br/>Listener email this week included: Roger (Marathon Man) shared information about school censuses and cited a database of these from Kent County, Michigan, at <a href="http://data.wmgs.org/SchoolCensus/" target="_blank">http://data.wmgs.org/SchoolCensus/</a> with samples to view; Confederate service records are available and accessible at <a href="http://www.footnote.com" target="_blank">Footnote.com</a> (various states are still being added); Kay shared another family story about a son who acidently shot his father; a listener asked about how to locate Web pages that have disappeared, and The Guys provided some methods, including the use of the Wayback Machine (<a href="http://www.archive.org/" target="_blank">http://www.archive.org/</a>), a part of the fascinating Internet Archive; Richard shares a response from the Millennium Corporation about available genealogy software it produces for mobile devices; the USCIS has established a new genealogy program for obtaining immigration and naturalization records, rather than requesting them through the Freedom of Information Office - click <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=5f5b15d8c1dbb110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=68439c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD" target="_blank">here</a> to go to the USCIS site; Connor has compiled an index to newspaper records and asks advice for how to disseminate the information; Laraine writes about her experiences visiting her old hometown of Marietta, Ohio, and the importance of citing sources; the Fulton County Genealogical Society has a new home for its genealogy collection in the Evergreen Community Library in Metamora, Ohio. <br/><br/>In last week's episode, George reviewed a new book by Timothy N.

It should have been <a href="http://www.blackcoalminerheritage.net/" target="_blank">http://www.blackcoalminerheritage.net</a>. It's been corrected in last week's show notes, but please visit his site for details about the great little book.<br/><br/>Drew discusses his new volunteer assignment as editor of the <a href="http://www.fgs.org" target="_blank">Federation of Genealogical Societies</a>' <span style="font-style: italic;">Delegate Digest</span>, an monthly email newsletter sent to the delegates of FGS member societies. This is a great benefit to having your society be a member of FGS.<br/><br/>Drew also discusses CAPTCHAs (corrected spelling), the images containing letters and numbers that we all type in at Web sites to provide security from hackers. People are now working with OCR'd books to interpret problem characters and making the indexes correct. <br/>]]></description>

The Commons provides access to the LOC collection and more are being added, making this a premier destination on the web.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Digital Genealogist</span>, a terrific online e-zine, is published 6 times a year and delivered to your e-mailbox in PDF format. Both of The Guys write articles for DG and are joined by some of the greatest, most technology knowledgeable people in the genealogy community. Learn more at <a href="http://www.digitalgenealogist.com/" target="_blank">http://www.digitalgenealogist.com/</a>. <br/><br/>Our listener email this week includes: Tim Skinner, whose e-mail we read on episode #143 (7/7) concerning using Google Maps to trace ancestors' movements, wrote again to ask us to share the Web address (<a href="http://www.familytreeassistant.com" target="_blank">http://www.familytreeassistant.com</a>) for his software, Map My Ancestors; Judy wrote to ask about the wisdom of adding digitized photos to Family Tree Maker and other programs; Michelle asked if NARA had information about substitute soldiers for both the Union and Confederate armies; Tim wrote about he availability of genealogy-specific back-up sites; Bill also wrote to tell us that FamilySearch (<a target="_blank" href="http://">http://www.familysearch.org</a>) has published Ohio Death Records (1905-1953) in their Record Search Pilot; Patti reports that she has been working on the Home Study Course offered by the National Genealogical Society and that, as a result of refocusing on her source citations, she has made a huge breakthrough AND has been doing the Genealogy Happy Dance; and Sharon is a new fan and asked for The Guys' recommendations for the best genealogy database software program. <br/><br/>Joel Weintraub, an association of Steve Morse and the <a target="_blank" href="http://stevemorse.org/">One Step Website</a>, wrote to describe another technique for digitizing microfilm.&nbsp;  View the article at <a href="http://blog.eogn.com/eastmans_online_genealogy/2008/02/st-genie-conver.html" target="_blank">Eastman's Online Genealogy Newsletter of 19 February</a> and please read the comments, especially those of Joel's.<br/><br/>George reviewed a great new book by Timothy N. Pinnick, <span style="font-style: italic;">Finding and Using African American Newspapers</span>. George has been aggressively promoting the addition of African American newspapers and publications to libraries' and archives' collections. The <a href="http://">John F. Germany Public Library</a> has been trying to obtain copies of African American newspapers on microfilm and microfilm from the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu/libraries/" target="_blank">University of Florida's libraries</a> in Gainesville, and has met with resistance and refusal for several years. I and other people believe that the hoarding of such materials and refusing to allow for replication (at the JFG's offered expense) is an unconscionable act that prevents the open access of information to the originating community. Tim Pinnick's book is an excellent reference for every genealogical library collection and for every African-ancestored individual who seeks to learn more about his or her ancestors' records as included in newspapers. More information and an extract of the book are available at Tim Pinnick's website at <a href="http://www.blackcoalminerheritage.net" target="_blank">http://www.blackcoalminerheritage.net</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://" target="_blank"></a>and atGregath Publishing Company at <a href="http://www.gregathcompany.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gregathcompany.com/</a>. Congratulations, Tim, on a very fine addition to our reference resources!<br/><br/>The Guys talked about three conferences at which you can meet one or both of them.<br/><br/><ol><li>The Federation of Genealogical Societies Conference will take place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 3-6 September 2008. Online registrations end on 22 August 2008 but registrations will continue on-site at the conference. Look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fgsconference.org/rebate/">http://www.fgsconference.org/rebate/</a> to learn about society discounts when multiple members of your society attend!</li><li>The Florida Genealogical Society (Tampa) will celebrate its 50th Anniversary with a full-day Fall Seminar with the fabulous Paula Stuart-Warren giving four excellent lectures. Paula is a master genealogical researcher, author, and speaker. She also will provide the dinner speech at the Gala 50th Anniversary Banquet the night before. (Seating is limited.)

            <description><![CDATA[This week's news includes: the Vatican has issued a letter instructing all dioceses not to give any information to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, due to concerns about the Mormons' practice of posthumous rebaptism; a new Midwest Genealogy Center (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mcpl.lib.mo.us/genlh/mgc.htm">http://www.mcpl.lib.mo.us/genlh/mgc.htm</a>) will open in Independence, Missouri, on 21 June 2008 with the largest collection of genealogical materials in the U.S.; DNA links have been found from the ancient &quot;iceman&quot; found in British Columbia in 1999 to at least 17 living people; an American couple touring in Germany visited a gasthaus in Binningen and were introduced to a relative -- a man who looked exactly like the husband. The men shared the same great-great grandfather.<br/><br/>Listen e-mail included: loss of HeritageQuest Online in the Satellite Beach, Florida, library; a thank you for our discussions of the Mozy (<a target="_blank" href="http://mozy.com/">http://mozy.com/</a>) computer backup facility; Catholic parish family books (Familienbuecher) in Germany; suggestions for locating information about Black Seminole people (see <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Seminoles">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Seminoles</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~texlance/seminoles/index.htm">Seminole &amp; Apalachicola Indian Records</a>); a listener asks for help when his own DNA and that of his family members disagrees; teaching genealogy to and for kids; the occupation of &quot;vanman&quot; is defined; and the origins of the surname <span style="font-weight: bold;">Turtle</span> are discussed. [Drew referred to the book, <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">A Dictionary of English Surnames: The Standard Guide to English Surnames</span> by P.H. Reaney and R.M. Wilson, published by OxforndUniversity Press in 1995.]<br/><br/>George discusses the practical use of DNA in conjunction with genealogy, archeology, and geography in the research of the Lost Colony Center for Science and Research (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lost-colony.com/">http://www.lost-colony.com/</a>). The &quot;Lost Colony&quot; was the second settlement on Roanoke Island on the Outer Banks of what is now North Carolina. It began in 1587 and it was there that Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the New World, was born on 18 August 1587. When the relief ships finally returned from England in 1590, the settlement was deserted, and a single word -- &quot;Croaton&quot; -- was carved into a post of the fort. Croaton was the name of one of the local Indian tribes. One suggestion is that the settlers were assimilated into one or more of the three tribes. The DNA testing and analysis being done by the Lost Colony Center for Science and Research is seeking to validate or refute this hypothesis, and the project is infinitely interesting. <br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week's news includes: condolences to the family of Chuck Knuthson, a great genealogical speaker, researcher, and former board member of FGS, GSG, and other organizations; Halvor Moorshead, head of Moorshead Magazines [<span style="font-style: italic;">Family Chronicle, History Magazine, Internet Genealogy, </span>and the new <span style="font-style: italic;">Discovering Family History</span>] is retiring and has sold the company to staff members Ed Zapletal and Rick Cree.<br/><br/>Listener e-mail includes: Greek genealogical research links are available at Cyndi's List (at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyndislist.com/greece.html">http://www.cyndislist.com/greece.html</a>) and at Kimberly Powell's column at About.com (at <a target="_blank" href="hhttp://genealogy.about.com/od/greece">http://genealogy.about.com/od/greece</a>); a request for help reading an occupation on a 1920 census schedule for Flint, Michigan, draws a unanimous opinion from The Guys [Quarry]; thanks for suggestions for recording an interview with a mother who transcribed contents of a now-lost Bible; an explanation of the source for information used by a census enumerator to complete a mortality schedule in the 1880 census; and a true life story of backing up one's data.<br/><br/>Drew describes and discusses Mark Tucker's brilliant <span style="font-weight: bold;">Genealogy Research Process</span> map and textual description at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ThinkGenealogy.com">http://www.ThinkGenealogy.com</a>. It is derived from concepts of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bcgcertification.org">Board for Certification of Genealogists</a> and by Elizabeth Shown Mills, expert on the genealogical proof standard and author of <span style="font-style: italic;">Evidence Explained</span>, the new and definitive book concerning citation of genealogical evidence.<br/><br/>Drew discusses the use of dictionaries to locate the definitions of older, more obscure terms found in historical and genealogical documents. The example he cites is the term, &quot;Fresno,&quot; a piece of equipment once used for scraping road surfaces.<br/><br/>The Guys discuss databases for historical newspapers and more recent (ca. 1980 to present) newspapers. The companies discussed are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/">LexisNexis</a> (the Nexis portion); <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsbank.com/">NewsBank</a>'s &quot;America's Genealogy Bank&quot; database; and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.proquest.com/">ProQuest</a>. Newspaper databases may be available through your local public library and/or your local college or university library. Drew discovered that sometimes the newspapers available in a database inside the library are greater in number than when you access the database remotely from outside the library. This can be due to differences in licensing contracts. George encourages listeners to check out all the databases available through their libraries.<br/>]]></description>

celebrated its 101st consecutive family reunion; Michael loves U.S. Federal Agricultural
Census records, but hates the microfilm – and he and George urge Ancestry.com
and HeritageQuest to bite the bullet and digitize these and the remaining U.S. census
records; several users commented on the need for the GEDCOM facility to be
updated to also include graphics, while The Guys agree that software packages
and online sites should be able to synchronize the data between both!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[The Guys go straight to listener e-mail this week: the value of contacting genealogical societies for obit &amp; funeral notice lookups and copies; Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps that have been made available at state sites, such as Florida (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/UFDC/?c=sanborn%29">http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/UFDC/?c=sanborn)</a>, Georgia (<a target="_blank" href="http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/sanborn">http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/sanborn</a>), and South Carolina (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sc.edu/library/digital/collections/sanborn.html">http://www.sc.edu/library/digital/collections/sanborn.html</a>) and digital cameras used by The Guys: Pentax A20 Option Megapixel camera (see review at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0608/06082103pentaxa20.asp">http://www.dpreview.com/news/0608/06082103pentaxa20.asp</a>).<br/><br/>Drew recaps the instructions for accessing older podcasts. He also shares his &quot;Genealogy Society Tip of the Week&quot; about expending a little extra money for name/quality speakers for your society to attract visitors <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> new members.<br/><br/>George recaps the importance of making contact with and/or joining genealogical societies where your ancestors lived. They can also provide obituary and funeral notice lookups and copies from their local card or online computerized index files. <br/><br/>The Guys discuss the negative side of sharing information about living family members, especially when one becomes a debtor who becomes the subject of debt collectors. Some debtors are now accessing genealogical database as vehicles to persecute and ride relatives of a debtor, and that is illegal <br/><br/>Listener Nancy details the underhanded tactics of collectors who began contacting siblings, children, aunts, uncles, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">and </span>grandparents of the debtor to harass and dun then for their relative's debt. George discovered that every state in then Union has laws governing collection agencies. Most, if not all, cannot by law contact anyone other than the debtor and his/her spouse directly. Contact with your state Attorney General's office to determine what YOUR rights are and what a collection agency can and cannot do. You will often find that the collection agent/agency is exceeding his or her authority. <br/><br/>George discusses his Pentax Option A20 (10 megapixel) digital camera, its features, and how he uses the Text setting and other features in his genealogical research. <br/><br/>Drew talks about Chris Dunham's &quot;The Genealogy&quot; site at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.genealogue.com">http://www.genealogue.com</a> and the Genealogue Challenge. George reminds listeners that The Genealogy Blog Finder is also one of the features of this great site.<br/><br/>George reviews William Dollarhide's new two-volume book set titled <span style="font-style: italic;">Census Substitutes &amp; State Census Records</span>. Volume I covers the Eastern States and Volume II covers the Western States. The books are available through Family Roots Publishing Company at&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.familyrootspublishing.com">http://www.familyrootspublishing.com</a>.<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[News this week includes: the first ten years (1908-1917) of issues of Chicago's historic Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy (translated, <span style="font-style: italic;">Alliance Daily</span>) has been digitized by the Center for Research Libraries and is fully searchable at <a href="http://ecollections.crl.edu" target="_blank">http://ecollections.crl.edu</a>, along with other interesting collections;&nbsp; GenWed.com (<a href="http://www.genwed.com/" target="_blank">http://www.genwed.com/</a>) is  a new and growing Web site that will help you locate free online marriage records, and you can submit records for inclusion in the databases; and finally, on 30 October 2007, a gravestone has been set in St. Louis' Memorial Park for George's great uncle, Brisco Washington Holder -- his brick wall for over 20 years.<br/><br/>The Guys will be featured presenters at the Texas State Genealogical Society Conference in Tyler, Texas, next weekend -- 9-10 November 2008. More information is available at <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~txsgs/conference.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.rootsweb.com/~txsgs/conference.pdf</a> and The Guys hope you can drop by and say hello! George will be autographing limited numbers of his latest book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Official Guide to Ancestry.com</span>.<br/><br/>Mister Edd in Cape Coral, Florida, asked for advice for websites that help reunite people with old photos of their family members. George suggested Megan Smolenyak's &quot;Honoring Our Ancestors&quot; site at <a href="http://www.HonoringOurAncestors.com/orphanphotos.html" target="_blank">http://www.HonoringOurAncestors.com/orphanphotos.html</a> and DeadFred at <a href="http://www.deadfred.com" target="_blank">http://www.deadfred.com</a>. <br/><br/>Drew's &quot;Society Tip of the Week&quot; was a recommendation of the use of a Web site called SurveyMonkey.com at <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank">http://www.surveymonkey.com/</a>. Basic surveys for less than 100 responses are free; other size responses are reasonably priced for a monthly or annual basis. SurveyMonkey may be an ideal way to allow electronic voting in society elections, conducting surveys of members for preferred meeting and seminar topics, and obtaining feedback on programs, projects, and other subjects.<br/><br/>George's &quot;Web Site of the Week&quot; is a new Web site called GenDisasters at <a href="http://www.gendisasters.com" target="_blank">http://www.gendisasters.com</a> which contains dates, descriptions, newspaper transcripts, drawings/photos of fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, train wrecks, bridge collapses, and more, with dates spanning from the 1800s to the 1950s. The site is searchable by state and county, and browseable. It is ideal for helping place your ancestors into historical context with these calamitous events and/or to determine which courthouses and other repositories may have been damaged and their records lost or destroyed.<br/><br/>The Guys share a collection of entertaining epitaphs from gravestones around the world. <br/><br/>Drew reviews a book by Andro Linklater titled <span style="font-style: italic;">Measuring America</span>, and then The Guys discuss land measurement systems that have been used in the United States.<br/><br/>Finally, Drew discusses how to deal with missing data, such as maiden surnames, or no data whatsoever in your genealogical recording systems.<br/>]]></description>
