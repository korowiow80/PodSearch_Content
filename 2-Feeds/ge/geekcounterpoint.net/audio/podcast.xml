			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>Now that we've gone through the science behind climate change, and knocked down most of the kooks surrounding the issue, it's time to talk about what we're up against.  In this episode, I spend a bit under 30 minutes laying out the most likely future impacts of climate change -- and while I wouldn't call it a catastrophe, things don't look too pretty.  Since this is the eighth episode in a series, I'd recommend that before listening to this episode, you first listen to episodes 45, 47, 54, 56, 57, 58, and 59.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/5G471m6OtBc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC058 Swindled!</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>A couple of Geek Counterpoint listeners (thanks, Travis and Bill!) pointed me to a show recently aired on BBC channel 4 called "The Great Global Warming Swindle."  It purports to be a documentary, and is uniformly critical of the science behind climate change and the global warming concensus.  It's generated a lot of heat both in British papers and online, and has been accused of playing fast and loose with the truth.  Since video of the show is available online on both YouTube and Google video, and it rehashes arguments often made by climate change skeptics, I thought it would be a good topic for an episode.

So this week's episode is my overview of the show, a discussion of how it's put together, and a little background on people appearing in (or quoted by) the show.  See the blog post for this episode for a minute-by-minute commentary on the show.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/UQcddb80ySk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC055 Space Weapons</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>When the Chinese government demolished one of its aging weather satellites a few weeks ago, they did more than just test out a potentially useful technology.  They also cluttered up low Earth orbit with a huge amount of debris, and stirred up a comparable amount of controversy in the press.  While nobody is yet quite sure what the motivation behind the test was (to send a message to the White House?  to start discussions on a new space treaty?), there's been no shortage of speculation on the subject.  What hasn't received much attention is the history of this technology.

So this episode is all about the history of efforts to militarize space.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/7Epjo0SJvMo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC054 Climate Change: the Skeptics (part 1)</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>It's taken some time to do a reasonable level of fact checking, but my climate cats have now been successfully herded, so it's (finally!) time for another climate change episode.

Since (at least in the media) the discussion over climate change has been boiled down to two "sides," I'll start with the case made by various parties skeptical of the mainstream view.  Mind you, as in any argument, a given position is held by a variety of parties -- some sincere and rational, some sincere and irrational, some merely misinformed, and some with nefarious motives.  Since all of these approaches tend to get equal time in the mass media, I'll try to cover as many of them as possible in this episode and a few to follow.

In this episode, I'll briefly discuss the history of climate change science, then start looking at some general arguments used by a variety of parties against the theory of global climate change.  Subsequent episodes over the next few weeks will look at additional general arguments against climate change, then discuss some specific climate change skeptics and their arguments.  Since this is the third episode in a series, I'd recommend that before listening to this episode, you first listen to episodes 45 and 47.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/2Aad6bnP_5c" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC053 Sergey Korolyov</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>Today is the 100th anniversary of the birth of a giant of space exploration -- Sergey Korolyov (sometimes also transliterated as Sergei Korolev).  For much of the 20th century, Korolyov was the prime driving factor behind the Soviet space program.  He led the efforts to launch Sputnik, put Yuri Gagarin into orbit, and hold up the USSR's end of the race to the moon.  Yet during Korolyov's life, even his existence was a Soviet state secret -- he was only ever publicly referred to as the "Chief Designer."  After his death, he finally received some recognition for his accomplishments, yet many parts of Korolyov's life and work were more rumor than fact until after the collapse of the USSR.

Tune in this week, and you'll learn more about the impressive contributions made by a man who, until recently, was almost unheard of.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/3O_gPIG416U" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC051 Stardust Preliminary Results</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>Yes, I know -- I just talked about Stardust in episode 50.  But in the meantime, the first batch of preliminary science papers was released on the 15th of December in the journal Science.  There's a full set of material available (currently, at least, freely available) on the Science website, but many folks could probably use a bit of help in interpreting the news, and putting it into some sort of context.

Tune in this week, and I'll try to explain it all to you.  If you're new to the podcast, I'd recommend you listen to episodes 16, 17, and 37 before this one.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/VoOWu6Ke5hA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC049 Reactionless Drives</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>It's the holy grail of flight -- propulsion without the expenditure of reaction mass.  A practical reactionless drive system would render wheeled vehicles (flying cars, anyone?), aircraft with wings, and rockets as we know them obsolete.  But is it real?  Can it ever be real?

This episode covers the history of attempts at reactionless drives, and some recent news on a related controversy that "New Scientist" magazine unwittingly stirred up.  In a first for this podcast, this episode has been researched and presented by a Geek Counterpoint listener -- Jason, from Brisbane, Australia.  Let's all give Jason a warm welcome, and listen in as he gets us up to speed on this technology that lies somewhere between science and science fiction.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/nzhspRr4kLg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Before you listen to this episode, I'd recommend you listen to the episodes on Piltdown (#9, 12/2005), Flores Man (#15, 1/2006), and the original Neanderthal episode (#36, 8/2006) first.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/nbw0yRBy0SM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC047 Climate Change and Logical Fallacies</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>This episode, the second in a series on climate change, is intended to give everybody a little background in logical fallacies.  In particular, a number of logical fallacies seem to be particularly prone to use in news reports, political debates, and various pundits' writings on climate change -- so this episode will cover my own "top 10" list of climate change fallacies.  With both episode 45 and then this episode under our belt, we'll be ready to start putting all sorts of climate-related arguments to the test.  Oh, and you get a promo too -- for a science fiction serial drama called Silent Universe.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/HD-Ps95kCyQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC046 Flying Aircraft Carriers</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>A few weeks ago, researchers finished the first exhaustive study performed of the wreck of the USS Macon, a U.S. Navy airship.  What's unique about this particular wreck is that the Macon isn't alone on its piece of ocean floor off the California coast -- it's debris also contains the wreckage of four fighter aircraft.  The Macon was one of a handful of flying aircraft carriers to have been in operation over the years.  In the process of doing some research on the Macon, I discovered that there's actually an interesting slice of technological history tied up in the varied approaches taken to flying aircraft carriers, so I thought it'd make a good podcast topic.

Listen in this week, and you'll find out all about these odd and wonderful beasts!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/pzbursQLL6w" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC045 Climate Change 101</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>At least in the U.S. (and judging by material on the net, increasingly in Canada and Australia as well), debate about climate change long ago left the scientific arena, and entered the world of politics.  As a result, if you're trying to figure out for yourself where the truth lies, you're confronted with a confusing mess of information -- some of it is scientific, but much of it is pure garbage packaged as science.  In the interest of helping people sort out solid science from the deliberate misinformation (as well as from well-intentioned but poorly-informed material), I'm going to be doing a series of episodes on climate in general, and climate change in particular. 

This episode is the first in that series, and is intended to give everybody a very quick background in some terminology and concepts involved in climate science.  In upcoming weeks, I'll be lining up all the arguments I can find on all sides of the climate change argument, then essentially throwing bricks at them all.  The idea is to subject all arguments to a scientific "acid test," then once the arguments are reduced to a subset with a reasonably sound scientific basis, we'll see what the "surviving" data has to tell us.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/V0FA8JviN84" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC044 The 2006 U.S. National Space Policy document</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>A few days ago, the White House released an update to the United States' "National Space Policy" document.  In a sense, an update is overdue as this document hasn't been tweaked since 1996, when Clinton was president.  It's release got a number of folks spun up, labeling the document agressive and unilateral.  Some commentators got even more excited, bringing North Korea into their commentary, and talking about the militarization of space, Orwell's 1984, the war in Iraq, and even stories of allegedly faulty body armor.  Since there seems to be a dearth of solid analysis online, I thought this would be a good time to give the document a good scrub, compare it to the 1996 version of the policy document, and see what's really changed.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/V-ctuJgA7eo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>MRO, a.k.a. the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, just got into its science orbit.  As a result, you should expect to soon see a flood of new images and other interesting data coming back from Mars (adding, of course, to the goodies already coming back from MGS, Odyssey, and the MER rovers).  Anyway, I thought this would be a good time to get folks up to speed on the MRO spacecraft, the instruments it carries, and the mission of exploration that it is only now really starting.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/ehig8hjEVuo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC039 Politics and Science</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>This episode started as an examination of political interference in science.  But while doing research for the episode, I ran across two studies on the brain activity involved in partisan politics, and decided to also look at what science has to say about politics (or at least, partisan thinking).

Listen in this week, and find out how politics really is "all in your head."  Before you listen to this episode, it'd help if you listened to last year's Haloween show (episode 5, 10/30/05, a bit too macabre to be child-safe) and the episode on Lamarckian inheritance (episode 34, 7/18/06).&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/OJj7bYEqe8I" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC037 What's in a Name?</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>Planetary science used to be so simple.  Our solar system had 9 planets, and a bunch of little leftover scraps called asteroids and comets.  But over the last few decades, improvements in observing technology have helped astronomers to discover hundreds of new objects -- and they don't all fit the old, tidy categories (many of them don't even fit well into new categories).  Since we now know of a dizzying variety of objects both in our solar system and elsewhere, astronomers have been caught up in "nomenclature wars" over how to describe and categorize things.

Listen in this week to find out how this whole mess got started, and how astronomers may (or may not) tidy things up.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/7qEGnfIimS0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC034 Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was a French biologist in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and can be credited with a number of advances in the study of species origins and (in particular) invertebrate biology.  Lamarck was an early proponent of evolution via natural causes, decades before Darwin's introduction of natural selection as the mechanism behind it.  Despite Lamarck's bona fide contributions to science, he's now remembered mainly in connection with the discredited theory of evolutionary change as the "inheritance of acquired traits" (a.k.a. Lamarckism or Lamarckian evolution).  While he did promote a form of the theory that now bears his name, it should be noted that he didn't originate it, he was far from the only scientist to promote it, and many of the excesses of "Lamarckism" can be traced to proponents of the theory that lived long after him (Kammerer and Lysenko, in particular).  

After years of abuse in textbooks, it's ironic that Lamarckian evolution actually has some basis in fact -- but only at the cellular level, and in sociological studies of cultural evolution.  Listen to this week's episode, and you'll have a much fuller understanding of this poorly understood, and often unappreciated scientific pathfinder.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/WZlIyrk947g" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC032 Net Neutrality</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>There's a battle under way in the U.S. Congress over Net Neutrality -- and it's got broad implications for all internet users, regardless of where they live.  Unfortunately, the mass media haven't been paying much attention to the debate, and some of the internet-based coverage tends to be a bit TOO focused to give a balanced view of things.  In this week's episode, I attempt to give you some context in the form of an overview of the arguments on both sides of the debate.

			<itunes:summary>There's a battle under way in the U.S. Congress over Net Neutrality -- and it's got broad implications for all internet users, regardless of where they live.  Unfortunately, the mass media haven't been paying much attention to the debate, and some of the internet-based coverage tends to be a bit TOO focused to give a balanced view of things.  In this week's episode, I attempt to give you some context in the form of an overview of the arguments on both sides of the debate.  While Net Neutrality protections were rejected by the U.S. House in recent weeks, the COPE bill that's at the center of the action is under discussion in the U.S. Senate, so the debate is far from over.</itunes:summary>

			<title>GC031 Stuck in the ITAR</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>Many a blog entry has been written in complaint about the difficulties of working in space with the U.S., or about the hurdles U.S. aerospace companies face in dealing with partners abroad. As is often the case, these difficulties come from good intentions, and revolve around a valid need -- for regulations on export of sensitive technologies. The crux of things is a set of U.S. State Department regulations known as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), a 4-letter word in many circles (particularly for small companies attempting to re-invent access to space). In this week's episode, I summarize the recent history of U.S. export control regulations, and give a brief overview of just what ITAR compliance entails. 

When you're done listening, you may not be any happier about the situation, but you'll at least have a good feel for what the current situation is.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/ZIPUU7qbBzg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>Anybody that's been keeping up with the news lately (at least in the U.S.) has heard about the recent allegations that the NSA is collecting call routing information on most phone calls made within the U.S.  Social network analysis (SNA) seems to be the leading candidate for the presumed use of all this data.  So in this week's episode, I struggle mightily to keep my personal politics in check (this isn't a political podcast, after all) while discussing a bit of the mechanics of SNA, as well as the potential for mischief in the use of this data.  Listen in, and at the end of things, see how concerned you may / may not be about this program (attire: tin foil hats optional).&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/81Wy_IpG4Ug" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC028 Love at Goon Park</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>A quick overview of an excellent book by the same name -- a description of the career of Harry Harlow and his studies of the science of affection, with special attention to the conflict between Harlow and the then-prevailing view of the subject.  Whether you love Harlow or hate him, the animal studies that he and his students conducted resulted in dramatic changes in science's views of affection and the life-long impacts of children's home environments.  It's a good example of paradigm shifts in science, and of how (to use Harlow's expression) sometimes science has to catch up with common sense.

			<description>This week, I wrap up my treatment of the loss of the Titanic with a simplified (if not brief) failure analysis.  How the ship broke up and sank is fairly straightforward -- so I don't spend much time on that.  On the other hand, the decisions that went into how the ship was built and operated are less often discussed, and far more pertinent to the modern day -- so they are the focus of this episode.  It's been nearly 100 years since the Titanic sank, but you'll learn how some of the mistakes that played a role in that disaster are still being repeated in modern times.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/WN-nMG_fWGc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

I also go through the results of the "Topics" survey I had on the website last month.

			<description>Now that we've got a little background in stem cells (and if you don't know what I'm talking about, make sure you listen to episode 18), let's talk about recent news. This week's topic is South Korea's own Hwang Woo-Suk -- his meteoric rise to prominence, and his even faster fall from grace. The story has patriotism, vast sums of money, and international prestige on one hand; lies, arrogance, coercion, and scientific fraud on the other -- a modern greek tragedy all tidily packaged in one man.

			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>The White House just released its proposed 2007 budget for NASA, and it seems the administration has an interesting perspective on both science and its own "Vision for Space Exploration" (VSE).  While the Bush administration isn't reducing anything it's asking NASA to do as part of VSE, the White House is increasingly reluctant to actually provide money for any of it.  As a result, since the space shuttle continues to overrun every "official" estimate ever made of its future costs, NASA's space science program will now be drained of at least $2 billion over the next five years in an attempt to keep shuttles flying and the VSE moving forward.  In this episode, I give you all the gory details, along with a bit of historical perspective.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/exNNDDRnGC8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>Last week, I gave you the story of where the Stardust mission came from -- technically, scientifically, and politically.  With the background out of the way, we're ready to dive into the really good stuff.  In this week's episode, we continue the Stardust story -- but focus now on Stardust's mission and science.  The end result was a historic success -- the first successful return of cometary material to Earth.  But the road that culminated in this success was anything but smooth.  Tune in and find out just how many spills &amp; chills &amp; thrills are involved in a round-trip flyby of a comet.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/AOasHAtv1AQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>GC015 The Hobbits of Flores Island</title>
			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>In 2003 and 2004, a team of Australian and Indonesian anthropologists made some interesting discoveries in a cave on Indonesia's Flores island -- bones from small creatures, that may just prove to be cousins of humanity.  Since these bones came from adults, but they apparently stood only about 3 feet tall, they were almost immediately christened "hobbits."  These creatures seem to be more closely related to ancient hominids than to modern humans -- but were still alive 18,000 years ago, long after Neanderthal died out.  While the initial fossil discovery was well publicized, more recent news hasn't been covered as thoroughly.  Listen in, and I'll give you a summary of what's been found, and where things stand.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/5il3aPPxRsM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Many of us were taught that long-distance oceanic voyages had to wait for the compass to be invented, then imported into Europe from China.  Unfortunately, this treatment of history leaves out the fact that Polynesian sailors were criss-crossing large areas of the Pacific ocean TWO THOUSAND YEARS before Columbus was born.  Even more impressive is the fact that it was done without navigational instruments or charts, in canoes built with tools made of stone, bone, and shells.  This episode describes the low-tech but scientifically based Polynesian approach to long distance oceanic navigation.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/kOxw-nj3sos" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Lorne Ipsum</itunes:author>
			<description>A recent survey has revealed that a significant number of personal computer users is so baffled by computer "geek" jargon that they don't take even simple security precautions in their computer usage.  In this week's episode (and a bit more in next week's episode), I try to give everybody a basic grounding in jargon you'll run across in discussions of security threats to your computer usage.  

Also, please check out the geekcounterpoint.net web site -- I've drawn up a handy reference sheet of all the terms used in this episode and next week's followup episode as well.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GCP_Podcast/~4/_OuTLSCKeHo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
