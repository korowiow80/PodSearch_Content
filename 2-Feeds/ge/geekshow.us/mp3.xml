<p>Robin can&#8217;t let go of the past when she discovers that Ted has kept possessions accumulated during previous relationships. In a bid to please her, he discards the offending items which results in an unexpected revelation about her past. Meanwhile, Lily coaxes the gang to attend a play she is in and in the process initiates a conversation with Barney about how a &#8216;real&#8217; friend should act.</p>
<p>How much stuff did Ted get from previous girlfriends? Who becomes part of Lily&#8217;s play? How will Barney prove his point? And where did Robin actually get her dogs from?</p>

<p><span id="more-9103"></span></p>
<p>After threat of not being able to return to their favourite bar, Ted rallies the group to make a pact to go 18 hours without finding out the score of the Superbowl so they can keep their tradition alive and watch the game together. Barney struggles with his gambling addiction; Marshall hides out in Lily&#8217;s Kindergarten classroom; and Robin jeopardizes her career, all to keep the pact alive.</p>
<p>Will Barney win or lose his money? Can Robin go a whole news cast without hearing the sports segment? Who is Marshall&#8217;s rival for Lily&#8217;s heart? And what on earth is the Sensory Deprivater 5000?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first episode of 2012 Hayley discusses episode &#8220;First Time in New York&#8221;.<span id="more-9052"></span></p>
<p>Robin&#8217;s younger sister Katie comes to visit New York for the first time. Unfortunately her boyfriend is in tow and Katie is preparing to lose her virginity to him, which alarms Robin.

<p>Lily has gone all out decorating the apartment in a Winter Wonderland as a reward for Marshall finishing his paper.

<p>What did Ted <em>really</em> call Lily? Can she forgive him? What has a beer got to do with it? What has Marshall secretly been doing all day? And can the Winter Wonderland be restored before he arrives home?</p>

<p><span id="more-8976"></span>Poor Barney is left out in the cold as the rest of the gang are too busy enjoying being in &#8216;couple hibernation&#8217; to go out on the town with him. Enter Barney&#8217;s gay and ultimate wingman brother, James.

<p>Robin freaks out when the gang want to go to a mall. Not wanting to reveal why she doesn&#8217;t like malls, Ted is left to make up his own ideas (assisted by the others) as to what her secret might be. Marshall falls on one side of the argument, thinking Robin got married at a mall, while Barney believes she has a hidden past as a porn star. The two make a slap bet over who is right about Robin&#8217;s secret.</p>
<p>How will Ted cope if he learns his girlfriend is secretly married? What rulings will Lily lay down in her role as Slap Bet Commissioner? Who is right: Marshall or Barney? And what does a bedazzled jean jacket have to do with why Robin doesn&#8217;t want to go to the mall?</p>
