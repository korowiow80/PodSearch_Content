No, the real source of disagreement between us is over chocolate: Nosher likes dark and I like milk. To me, there&#8217;s nothing better than a ganache made with lots of heavy cream or even the most simple melt-in-your-mouth milk chocolate bar. To Nosher, the slightly bitter, fruity, and arguably more complex flavors of dark chocolate, particularly those with higher percentages of cocoa solids and cocoa butter , send him over the moon. Happily, minor disputes like ours find their ideal resolution at events like this weekend&#8217;s <a href="http://www.chocolateshow.com">10th Annual Chocolate Show</a>, a gathering of over 50 of the finest chocolatiers and artisanal chocolate producers, all in one location at the Metropolitan Pavilion on 18th Street. Visitors to the yearly choco-fest can find everything from classic French truffles to fudge brownies to nouvelle cuisine concoctions filled with wasabi cream and curry. And in true <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Project_Runway/">Project Runway,</a> style, the launch of the Chocolate Show included an over-the-top chocolate fashion show where models strutted up and down the runway covered in garments made from a minimum of 40% chocolate. Take that, Tim Gunn. You can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nycnosh/sets/72157603075971990/show/">view a slideshow of pictures of the event on our Flickr photostream</a> as you listen to our podcast from the show.

Two weeks ago, we stayed up all night with the graveyard shift bakers at Amy&#8217;s Bread, the ones responsible for most of the artisanal bread sold at Amy&#8217;s shops. Along the way, we learned some fascinating things about Amy&#8217;s Bread (it does most of its business to restaurants, not retail), breadmaking (overproofing French white bread dough can yield Italian white bread, if done right), and the people who work the overnight shift (they listen to a truly bizarre mix of music as they work: Rammstein and Barbra Streisand). Musical taste aside, they&#8217;re also some of the most generous and gracious people we have met in the food world to date. During our all-nighter with the Amy&#8217;s crew, we recorded more than five hours of audio, which we have managed to edit down to 51 minutes, and as with all of our podcasts, you have the option either to <a href="http://nycnosh.podbean.com/medias/web/aHR0cDovL255Y25vc2gucG9kYmVhbi5jb20vd3AtY29udGVudC9ibG9ncy8yMzQvdXBsb2Fkcy8vQnJ1bm9KYW1haXNOWUNub3NoQ2FzdC5tcDM/BrunoJamaisNYCnoshCast.mp3">download the file</a> (right-click that link to save the file to disk) to listen on your mp3 device, <em>or </em>, if you have a speedy Internet connection, you can just stream the podcast by clicking the ‘play’ button on the audio player below.

So have a look at both as you listen to the podcast. We are also holding a contest with a fantastic food-related (non-perishable) prize to the first person who e-mails us the correct answer to this question: <em>What third-party shop sells more Amy&#8217;s Bread baguettes than all three of Amy&#8217;s own retail stores combined?</em> Send answers to nycnosh at gmail.

The concept, as he explained it, was a sedate venue where Boomers could go, eat a meal, perhaps dance a little, and then be home in bed by eight at night&#8211;hence the name: Home By Eight. Little did he know that Bruno Jamais had a similar audience in mind when he created his eponymous restaurant. But Bruno&#8217;s Place (as it is called by those in the know) gives mid-century babies a bit more credit for endurance; his supper club stays open until 4:00 a.m. and serves dinner until 2:00 a.m.. So when Bruno&#8211;former maitre d&#8217; at Restaurant Daniel and Alain Ducasse&#8211;invited us to visit and chat with him and the restaurant&#8217;s young chef, John Keller, we thought we should see what they&#8217;re doing to keep patrons lingering long past midnight.
