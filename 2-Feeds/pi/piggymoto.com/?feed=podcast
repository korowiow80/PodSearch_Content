This episode is late.nbsp; sorry.nbsp; It's been an insane week and an even crazier weekend.nbsp; But, that's all done, and the episode is here.nbsp; I'm pretty damn proud of this one too; a LOT of extra work went into polishing it up.

There are only a few episodes left.nbsp; 3 or 4 in fact.nbsp; I have no idea what I'm going to do after that.nbsp; I'm in the middle of revising another novel.nbsp; This one is more urban fantasy, not a fable like Piggy Moto.nbsp; So, I think my next podcast project will either be that, or I may look into podcasting short stories until I get the next novel-cast idea.nbsp; We'll see.nbsp; In the meantime, though, you can drop me a line and let me know what you think.nbsp; What would you like to hear and whatnot.nbsp; If you've picked up a copy of the novel, tell me what you think of it, and be sure to go to wherever you got it, and leave a review there as well.nbsp; You can e-mail me at piggies@piggymoto.comnbsp; or drop me a voice message at (260) 20 - piggy.

With only one or two exceptions, this episode features the voices of every single major-part cast member, so this episode was a BEAR (rarr) to put together.nbsp; But, it was a lot of fun :)nbsp; I still haven't made any new promos, but I do plan to record the files for the Piggy Moto Voicemail line today, so be sure to keep an eye on mynbsp; Twitter and Facebook for that.

Also, keep downloading and posting the fliers (big and small).nbsp; There may be a convention coming to town near you.nbsp; Why not print out a bunch and help out the show? *wink*

The manuscript is done and edited.. and I've entered it into a publication contest.nbsp; Even if I don't take first prize, runners up and finalists get critiques of their work, and that would be great as well.nbsp; So, I'm all kinds of excited.nbsp; I'll let you know on the 25th when I do.

* * *

Once again, please, please, please, head over to Podcast Alley and iTunes and give Piggy Moto a vote and nice comment! If you'd like, feel free to follow me on Twitter or Facebook, as I'll be posting periodic updates there.

Note to musicians and artists, podcasters, etc:
If you would like to do a link or promo exchange with me, please drop me a line! I really could use all the help I can get spreading the piggy word. Or, if you're moved to make a doodle of something you hear about in the story, then PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE share it! I'd love to expand the gallery! Or perhaps you've recorded some music that you'd like to submit for an outro, or for bed music. Let me know! I'm always on the lookout for talent.

Man!nbsp; I didn't realize how long this one would be 'till I looked at the final time of it!nbsp; Sheesh!nbsp; But I'm pretty happy with the way it came out, and am proud to drop it this morning. :)nbsp;nbsp; I wanna send out a special thanks to MandoAndy, who let me use one of his songs for this episode.nbsp; He's got a lot of great stuff, and I'm really glad to have been allowed to use this one.nbsp; So, Thanks, Mandoandy!

There are only a couple episodes left in Act II!nbsp; I can't believe it, how time has flown.nbsp; I listened to some of the early promos, and they are all like "coming in September of 2008!"nbsp; That's crazy!nbsp; But we're getting to the final stretch, and a LOT had changed.nbsp; I can only imagine what things are gonna be like when we reach our final episode.nbsp; Sheesh!nbsp; What will I do THEN?!

I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.nbsp; Right now, though, I'd like to mention the voicemail line I'm getting for Piggy Moto.nbsp; Now, I'm not droping the number right now; I'm still setting it all up, but when I do get it finalized, I will drop the number on Twitter and Facebook.nbsp; This'll let me test the system out a bit before I start putting the number out for everyone else.

I dropped a promo into this episode for Paulette Jaxton's The Empress Sword podcast novel.nbsp; She just started dropping episodes last week, so you can still get in on the ground floor.nbsp; She's got a lot of great voice talent there, and her production is just top notch.nbsp; Not to mention the great story!nbsp; Go check it out.nbsp; You won't regret it at all.

I'm polishing the manuscript up, and I'm getting it ready to farm out for publication.nbsp; You all have been more encouraging than I can put into words.nbsp; I love you all!

		<itunes:summary>One Year, Y'all!
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode Twenty-two.


I hope everyone had a great Labor day.nbsp; This is the official one-year episode, and I have a great guest voice for you.nbsp; Yup, the one and only Mur Lafferty, the Godmother of podcast noveling,nbsp; has lent me her talent for this episode.nbsp; When you are done listening, pop over to her site (if you haven't already) and check out her Heaven series of podcast novels.nbsp; They are fantastic, and are some of the novels that got me into podcast novelling to begin with.

My weekend was pretty insane (as usual).nbsp; My sweety and I headed down to Houston to see my family, and while we were there, I got some water dumped into the laptop by my 4 1/2 yo niece.nbsp; HEEE!nbsp; She's a hoot, and nothing got destroyed, but it was still a scare.

Next episode will e rather late, as I have to print out scripts and get with all my actors to do recording.nbsp; So, There will probably not be an episode until the middle of the month or so at the absolute earliest.nbsp; But, I am doing my best to get it out. :)

Aff the cuff composed this week's closing music.nbsp; Mevio's Podsafe Music Network has really been an invaluable resource lately!

		<itunes:summary>Short but fun episode.
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode Twenty-one.


So, here's a short episode for you.nbsp; The piggies need a break occasionally, too.nbsp; It was actually quite nice to have a quick ep (only about 6 hours post production)nbsp; I would've dropped it yesterday, but there were some issues with the sound effects that i wanted to fix.

This has been a crazy week!nbsp; work's been picking up at the day job, so that means more to do there and a little bit more pay.nbsp; *and* I started a new manuscript.nbsp; now, this one is not part of the Piggy Moto story line.nbsp; in fact, it's not even in the same story world.nbsp; It's a fantasy thriller sort of story, and I'm making pretty good progress so far.nbsp; if you'd like, feel free to follow me on Twitter or Facebook, as I'll be posting periodic updates there.

Guardian Mind Mix composed this week's closing music.nbsp; Mevio's Podsafe Music Network has really been an invaluable resource lately!

If you liked this episode please leave a comment or drop me a line! I'd love to hear from you
* * *
Once again, please, please, please, head over to Podcast Alley and iTunes and give Piggy Moto a vote and nice comment!
* * *
The guest cast for this episode includes:

	Laird Wetzel: as Eberhard Berringer
	Bill Vandegraph: as the stay-at-home local

and

	Sloane Cochran: as Corbin Zellig

* * *
The opening theme, AaAaAaAa, was created and performed by Lazz.

The closing tune, england days of old, came from the Guardian Mind Mix

Many of the sound effects I used came from the Freesound Project. Check them out for all your sound effect needs.
Please be warned.. FA has some adult (and in some cases disturbing and disturbed) art. so.. if you don't wanna see the bad stuff, then don't sign up for an adult account :P.

What an episode!nbsp;nbsp; It's long, and it's intense (imho) and it has lots and lots of voices, INCLUDING a cameo from the amazing Phil Rossi.nbsp; He's got a dead tree book out, which was one of my favorite podio novels: Crescent. If you like being scared sh*tless, this dude will do it to ya.nbsp; He'll downright make you forget it's mid day.

Now, let's talk about the closing music!nbsp; Marina V is one of the musical artists who's work I found on Mevio's Music Alley.nbsp; She's got lost of music available on her site, and a player there as well, so you can sample it.nbsp; Great stuff, I'm tellin' ya.

Now, I don't know exactly when my next episode is gonna drop.nbsp; I need to get with a couple actors to re-record several lines, AND I'm going out of town for about a week.nbsp; I'm going to hope to get it done by Sunday, but you know me and these deadline promises.nbsp; I'll do my best. :)

Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode Seventeen.


OOh man, this one kicked my BUTT!nbsp; Through the last couple weeks, I have been dealing with a lot of personal stuff, but at the same time, I've been working very closely with Chris to compose the music that you'll hear the pigs rehearsing in this episode.nbsp; Now, *I* am no composer, but Chris is all professional and stuff.nbsp; And patient as a saint to put up with me though this process.nbsp; He also went ahead and gave me a GREAT bunny voice, which I think really gives the end of this episode a nice kick.nbsp; So, Special thanks to my sweetheart!nbsp; Thanks more than words can express, Chris!

I also have a bit of good news!nbsp;nbsp; I was contacted by someone from MEVIO, and they wanted to pick me up!nbsp; So now, Piggy Moto can also be found on MEVIO.nbsp; Go there to earn me some piggy food (advertising pays) but come HERE for the recipes and all the inside scoop!

		<itunes:summary>Good Production = Less Post Production
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode Sixteen.


I paid a bit more attention to the recording process this time around - rewinding and rerecording rather than just doing retake after retake.  I really think it's made a HUGE difference.  I shaved about an hour off of my post production.

Regardless, though, I was up STUPID late last night. So, I'm pretty exhausted right now  *chuckle*  I wanted to mention next episode, though.  There will be a need for LOTS of music in the scoring.  So, if you are a musician, or know of one, please drop me a line.

I wanna give a thankful shout out to Woyro.  'E's gonna drop one of the Piggy Moto Promos into the 


Woyro's Warren podcast.  Go over and check it out when you get a chance :)

Many of the sound effects I used came from the Freesound Project.  Check them out for all your sound effect needs.

		<itunes:summary>It should have been an earlier night
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode Fifteen.


So, I figured I'd get an early, early start on this episode.nbsp; I woke up, brushed my teeth, took a shower, and sat down to get busy.nbsp; Well, then I needed to do something about breakfast, and I needed to check my e-mail.nbsp; After that, I wanted to play a little bit of the video game that Chris got me hooked on: Mana Khemia.nbsp; That only took about 4 hours.nbsp; Well, then I wanted to respond to some family e-mails and that took a couple more hours, and during this time I needed to figure out lunch, and then later, dinner.

Long story short, it was about ten o'clock before I got to work in earnest.nbsp; Which means, I didn't get into bed until about four.nbsp; Then enter insomnia.nbsp; I had a really weird dream about a ghostly entity that dwelt in the forest and stalked its human prey to feed on their life force.nbsp; The thing could only attack someone who's heard of it, so it more or less had to move from victim to victim by word of mouth.nbsp; It would feed slowly until its current host mentioned it to another person - or until another person learned of the ghost's existence, and then it would consume the previous victim and go on to the next.

I remember that there were a couple defenses against the ghost.nbsp; First, It could not move on until it killed its previous host, so there was always a time that the entity could not feed.nbsp; When it chooses its next victim, it always appears as a flash of light in the forest, and can only attach itself if its prey looks directly at it.nbsp; I.e.nbsp; You see a flash out of the corner of your eye, and instinctively look at it to see what it was.nbsp; If you never look, it can't latch on, and you can starve it to death in a few days.nbsp; Or, you can just stay out of the forest for a week while it tries to get your attention.

Even if it did manage to attach to a person, there is still a way to poison it.nbsp; Though, I forget how, now.nbsp; I think it had something to do with mirrors or animals.. not sure..

Anyway, in the dream, I was a paranormal investigator, and had gone out to interview this old village woman who was being attacked by the ghost.nbsp;nbsp; I turned around for a moment, and she slipped away from me.nbsp; She got into a dug out canoe and paddled out onto a lake to die.nbsp; I gathered up my notes and her own findings and headed out, back to civilization.nbsp; As I was driving through the woods that night, I saw a flash in the trees, out of the corner of my eyes.

And did not turn my head.

Anyway, that has nothing to do with this episode.

** this episode contains explicit language **



Sorry to drop this at ten o-clock, but I got to listening at it after I got all the prelim clean up done, and I realized that I'd left too much dead space in the file, so I went in to clean it up a bit, and then I got to ftuzing around with the tags and whatnot.. and next thing I knew, it's night time.

But here it is, we had a great cast for this episode, and I'm really happy with the way it came out.

**WARNING**nbsp;nbsp; The show's second "F" bomb is dropped in the outtakes.

I had a lot of fun with this episode.nbsp; There were some late night recording sessions going on, but that just made it even more fun.nbsp; Best off, NEXT episode will be the Act One Finale!nbsp; Oh yes, cliff hanger ending, with a tension-building hiatus to follow!nbsp; After that, though, I will be dropping episodes weekly, as opposed to bi-weekly. So, every Wednesday, there will be a new Piggy Moto to enjoy.nbsp; Also, in the spirit of the weekly, episodic thing, I've produced the next episode as well, and will be dropping it next week, on schedule, so be SURE to check it out.

I'm serious.nbsp; Tell all your friends.nbsp; Get them all involved.nbsp; Post to pig-lovers websites, story websites, friends' liveournals!nbsp; Download, print out and post the Piggy Moto Fliers in your favorite grown-up hangouts - coffeeshops, barts, etc (cause, you know, not for kids)nbsp; They have a week to listen to all ten episodes and get ready for the cliff hanger!nbsp; Do itnbsp; Do itnbsp;nbsp; DOOO EEEEET!nbsp; Seriously.nbsp; They have the whole weekend to listen.nbsp; Cancel their plans.. Shut them in and duck tape headphones to their noggins.nbsp; Make them all listen!!

Once again, the opening theme: AaAaAa! came from Lazz.

The closing music, Baile de los caballeros reales, came from Andros.

		<itunes:summary>Now, let's see some REAL magic in action
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode nine.

**WARNING**nbsp;nbsp; The show's first "F" bomb is dropped in the outtakes.

This has got to be one of the most COMPLEX episodes I've ever produced!nbsp; Sheeeesh!nbsp; But, I'm extremely proud of how it's come out.nbsp; We meet a new character in this chapter, and hear from a couple guys from a few episodes back.

Once again, the opening theme: AaAaAa! came from Lazz.

The closing music, Postcard, came from Since we Last Spoke.

Please be warned.. FA has some adult (and in some cases disturbing and disturbed) art. so.. if you donrsquo;t wanna see the bad stuff, then donrsquo;t sign up for an adult account :P.

Many of the sound effects I used came from the Freesound Project.nbsp; Check them out for all your sound effect needs.

Guest voices for this episode were performed by:

Kurtbatz : as Roger

Ryuuie: as Erik

Joseph Smith: as Renard the Druid

Felicia Hornsternburgerler : as Water Elemental #1

Limbdana Gray: as Water Elemental #2

Jessuahna Plinger: as Water Elemental #3

Mary-Sue Ettinger: as Water Elemental #4

Gina Van'Dennis: as Water Elemental #5

George MacBastard: as Water Elemental #6

Sloane Cochran : as Corbin Zellig

and

Laird Wetzel : as Eberhard Berringer.

War on Pigs
Curious thing!nbsp; There are a couple people who've taken steps AGAINST Piggy Moto!nbsp; Ain't that f*ckin' weird?!nbsp; Tell you what, though.nbsp; It means I'm getting under someone's skin, which means the message is true.nbsp; People want us under their heels.nbsp; So, I've decided to step up.nbsp; I will be organizing our loyal sounder for mutual defense and life embetterment (does that even make sense?!)nbsp; More information to come, or drop me a line.. you KNOW the address...nbsp; Let's fight back against these jerks - at all the jerks around the world who are jeleous and afraid of a handful of pigs enjoying a crap of equality!

		<itunes:summary>Drama, Danger!
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode Eight.

First thing's first, Welcome to all the new listeners out there!nbsp; I sent a handful of sample CDs to Furry Fiesta this last weekend, and the response had been downright inspiring so far.nbsp; So, Welcome, everyone, and I really hope you enjoy the show!

I do apologize about the delay, I had some serious technical issues with my original files, and had to replace them entirely, but I got everything put back together, and I've got a GREAT episode for you.

I'd like to give a shout out to one of my favorite author / podcasters: Phil Rossi.nbsp; He's scared the hell out of me so many times with his stories, and was generous enough to lend me his voice for the surly Mr. Stookesburry.

Once again, the opening theme: AaAaAa! came from Lazz.

(Please be warned.. FA has some adult (and in some cases disturbing and disturbed) art. so.. if you donrsquo;t wanna see the bad stuff, then donrsquo;t sign up for an adult account :P)

The closing music, The Mechanics of a Blue Sky, was composed by George Gidley. His performers were:

Marcus Goodlow playing Soprano Sax

Summer Odom playing Flute

and

Dwight Pierce on Piano

This was a live recording of a performance at the Rothwell Recital Hall at Lamar University, in December of 2004

Many of the sound effects I used came from the Freesound Project.nbsp; Check them out for all your sound effect needs.

Guest voices for this episode were performed by:

Jenn Baker : as the three mink sisters

Sloane Cochran : as Corbin Zellig

Sven Kindelmeyer : as George Raphael, the news crier

Laird Wetzel : as Eberhard, and Mr. Bobo - the chimp

Corie Sprague: as The Consierge

and of course

Mr. Phill Rossi: as Mr Stookesburry

		<itunes:summary>Things are heating up!
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode Seven.

Here it is folks!nbsp; I delayed this episode a little because I thought that since last episode came out on Chinese New Year (which is my first birthday) then the following episode should come out on the 11th, which is my terrestrial birth day.nbsp; (February 11, 1975 was Chinese New Year)

In the closing banter this time around, I mentioned This Post.nbsp; Check it out for some explanations of the slang that people will use in Piggy Moto.nbsp; I also dropped in a promo for Phil Rossi's Eden.nbsp; It drops today as well. He is a fantastic horror / sci-fi writer and a damn good story teller.nbsp; You absolutely MUST stop over and listen to his work.

Once again, the opening theme: AaAaAa! came from Lazz.

The closing music, Key Od D, came from Icewolf747. (His music gallery has disappeared :( )

Please be warned.. FA has some adult (and in some cases disturbing and disturbed) art. so.. if you donrsquo;t wanna see the bad stuff, then donrsquo;t sign up for an adult account :P.

Many of the sound effects I used came from the Freesound Project.nbsp; Check them out for all your sound effect needs.

Guest voices for this episode were performed by:

Sloane Cochran : as Corbin Zellig

Sven LuBone : as thunderclap #4

Ryuuie: as Angry Shouter

Joshua Muetz: as Angry Shouter

and

Laird Wetzel : as Eberhard Berringer

		<itunes:summary>After long last!nbsp; The pigs have returned!
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode five.

I'm back from my break.nbsp; November didn't treat me very well at all, I'm afraid.nbsp; My NaNo count only came up to about 54,000 before I abandoned Nano to deal with a pile of personal issues hat came up.nbsp; December was crazy with holidays and family stuff, but I am finally back.

Over the holidays, I acquired a Mic stand and a Script stand from my father (thanks, Dad!), and I also picked up a nice Pop Filter, which should help me produce better quality in the future.nbsp; (let me know if ep 5 sounded any better or worse than previous)

There's not much banter for this episode 'cause I came down with a nasty upper respiratory infection that knocked out my voice for about a day and a half.nbsp; I'm just NOW getting over it, I think.

I'd like to say thanks to y'all who messaged and e-mailed me to ask about this episode.nbsp; I'm sorry to have made you wait so damn long, but your kindness and curiosity have meant the world to me.nbsp; So, here it is.nbsp; I really hope you enjoy.

Once again, the opening theme: AaAaAa! came from Lazz.

The closing music, This Time It's Enough, came from Kurtbatz.

Please be warned.. FA has some adult (and in some cases disturbing and disturbed) art. so.. if you donrsquo;t wanna see the bad stuff, then donrsquo;t sign up for an adult account :P.

Many of the sound effects I used came from the Freesound Project.nbsp; Check them out for all your sound effect needs.

Guest voices for this episode were performed by:

Corey Sprague : as the unnamed mouse barmaid

Burgun Hurngurgler : as Warg the grumbly beer drinker

Sloane Cochran : as Corbin Zellig

and

Laird Wetzel : as Eberhard Berringer and one of the unnamed wolves.

I also fielded a listener question.nbsp; Drop me a line if you come up with any.

Once again, the opening theme: AaAaAa! came from Lazz.

All the music you heard when the pigs arrived at the Sheltering Arms came from Andros:nbsp; La tarantela loca, El vals del ruisentilde;o and Baile de los caballeros reales.

Finally, the closing music, RavingDragon did a remix as a tribute to Tony De Vit who died of bone marrow transplant failure when HIV positive back in 1998.

Many of the sound effects I used came from the Freesound Project.nbsp; Check them out for all your sound effect needs.

Please be warned.. FA has some adult (and in some cases disturbing and disturbed) art. so.. if you donrsquo;t wanna see the bad stuff, then donrsquo;t sign up for an adult account :P.

Guest voices for this episode were performed by:

Corey Sprague : as Felicity the concierge

Spoonfed Badger : as Candlebox the hotel porter and valet

Sloane Cochran : as Corbin Zellig

and

Laird Wetzel : as Eberhard Berringer

I did mention that I'll be doing a Pig Watch with every episode, and I went ahead and talked about the Hearts On Noses - Mini Pig Sanctuary for this one's link.nbsp; There's a post about the H.O.N. sanctuary in the previous blog post, to.nbsp; So, go ahead and drop in on them.

I also answered a couple questions from listeners.nbsp; Drop me a line if you have any.

At the end of the episode, I played a promo for Time Well Wasted.nbsp; Check it out.nbsp; It's a great place to discover diversions and passtimes.

		<itunes:summary>Well, ladies and gentlemen, here it is!
Piggy Moto, All Star Boar Band, Episode one.


I lied to you in the banter!!nbsp; It was late, and I am sorry!!nbsp; but, I said that ep two was gonna drop on the 22nd, which is a Monday and a new moon.nbsp; well, I MEANT to say, the 29th.. which is a Monday and the new moon.nbsp; So, the OFFICIAL ep 2 is due on the 29th.. BUTnbsp; if I am super diligent, I might just get it out on the 22nd.nbsp; No promises though.

Also, my cast mention recording got lost in the jumble last night, so I'll probably be recording and inserting that tonight for a re-upload.nbsp; So, if you're seeing this after Thursday, then it should be in there. At any rate, the guest cast for this episode includes:
Edward Parrot as Crewman Toofer
Sloane Cochran as Corbin Zellig
Wanton Soup as Chesterfield the cabin boy
and
Laird Wetzel as Eberhard Berringer

The opening theme, AaAaAaAa, was created and performed by Lazz.nbsp; Check out his stuff over on Fur Affinity

The closing theme, The Monsters They Saw, was created and performed by Eshmasesh.nbsp; He, too can be found over on FA.

Please be warned.. FA has some adult (and in some cases disturbing and disturbed) art.  so.. if you don't wanna see the bad stuff, then don't sign up for an adult account :P.

Chris Caps helped me out with some of the musical sound effects, and the rest came from the Freesound Project.

At the end of the episode I played a promo for one of my absolute favorite podcast novels, New World Orders, and I strongly advise you pop over and check it out.nbsp; It's some great stuff!

In this episode, I mentioned the following recipes: Gingerbred noblemen (with bits of rasins for eyes), and Brandied Cherry Cordials.nbsp; Heh heh, well, I make no claim to be able to make the later, but check back soon for a nice noblemen gingerbread recipe.nbsp; I might even include a recipe for gumdrop trees!nbsp; *evil grins*nbsp; There is still the recipe for the prologue's Rindswurst simmered in mild lager, smothered in saeurcraut and drouned in spicy mustard.nbsp;nbsp; So, that's another thing to look out for.

Curiosities mentioned that should be in the wiki soon: the Shadow weird - a frightening, urban monster from the realm of darkness.nbsp; Look for it's d20 writeup on the wiki, coming soon.
