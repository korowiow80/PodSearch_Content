Rhinoplasty is often given as a present because those who do not like their nose usually feel they have no choice but to voice that they are unhappy with the shape, or size of their nose since everyone can see that it is out of proportion. Have a nose that is too large, too small or awkwardly shaped can make a person look drastically different; therefore, changing the shape or size of ones nose can change ones appearance completely. In &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/rhinoplasty.htm" title="Beverly Hills rhinoplasty"&gt;Beverly Hills rhinoplasty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; commonly known as a nose job is a procedure performed in order to reshape the nose, this procedure is commonly known and performed all around the world. Rhinoplasty is most commonly desired for cosmetic reasons but can be done in order to correct structural defects that may cause breathing problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/rhinoplasty.htm" title="Beverly Hills nose job"&gt;Beverly Hills nose job&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s are often given as graduation or birthday presents, but rhinoplasty candidates must be fifteen for girls and slightly older for boys because at this age the nasal bone is mature and the shape of the nose is stabilized.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When undergoing any plastic surgery one should have realistic expectations especially when undergoing rhinoplasty which is known to be one of the most if not the most difficult plastic surgery procedure. Ones surgeons will discuss what is surgically possible for them because no one knows is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Cost for rhinoplasty varies depending on how greatly known the surgeon may be to which area one is having their surgery in. It is certain that having a &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon"&gt;Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; performs one rhinoplasty will cost more than having a surgeon in a smaller metropolitan area perform their surgery. The cost may also increase if ones rhinoplasty procedure may take more time, is more difficult, and calls for extra attention. Rhinoplasty is costly and most surgeons do have financing options available in order to make such a highly desired procedure affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Like any &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Cosmetic surgery Beverly Hills"&gt;Cosmetic surgery Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; patients must be aware that rhinoplasty does come with risks.

Some patients may also require a second reversionary procedure to remove or correct tissue. When undergoing rhinoplasty it is highly important that a patient understand everything their surgeon may say about what is and is not surgically possible in their situation, because many patients do not and then desire to have a second rhinoplasty procedure.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-6562813665310490241?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/6562813665310490241/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/08/beverly-hills-rhinoplasty-rhinoplasty.html#comment-form' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/6562813665310490241'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/6562813665310490241'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/08/beverly-hills-rhinoplasty-rhinoplasty.html' title='Beverly Hills rhinoplasty - Rhinoplasty Guide'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/TFqfJfg5XMI/AAAAAAAAAQM/KnQHA_B0_ag/s72-c/drkapoormd+aug10+1st+pic.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-6748055723094570511</id><published>2010-07-29T21:39:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-07-29T21:46:29.060-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast augmentation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly hills plastic surgery'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tummy Tuck Los Angeles'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Liposuction Beverly Hills'/><title type='text'>Beverly Hills plastic surgery - Self Improvement: Plastic surgery</title><content type='html'>&lt;a title="tummy tuck Los Angeles" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 173px; height: 309px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/TFJY92HwjVI/AAAAAAAAAPs/fs-GZDMTY8g/s400/drkapoormd+july+4th+pic.jpg" alt="tummy tuck Los Angeles" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5499555914496118098" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Everyone contemplates plastic surgery at least once in their lifetime.

Those who feel self conscience about their nose generally have low self-esteem. One can be unhappy with their nose or any part of their face for many reasons, some are unhappy with the nose they were born with and others have had the shape of their nose inflicted by age and or accidents. Ones can choose to have &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/rhinoplasty.htm" title="rhinoplasty Beverly Hills"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;rhinoplasty Beverly Hills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for medical reasons as well as aesthetic reasons. Breathing problems can sometimes be blamed on the nose and there for rhinoplasty can be done to fix the problem and with that being done some patients say there nose looked slightly different after the operation. The nose is the focal and defining point of the face the slightest alteration can drastically change a persons appearance and that is why it is important for those who are looking to have rhinoplasty and other facial plastic surgeries to think the decision through, and understand that once the surgery is done one may never have their old looks back.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;Like with any plastic surgery one must have realistic expectations and thoroughly communicate with their surgeons on their goals for their surgery. More than half of all rhinoplasty procedures are revision, and this is why the importance of communication can not be stressed enough. Leading &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s agree that rhinoplasty is the most difficult plastic surgery procedure there is, because no one nose is the same. The surgeon’s job is to improve the physical appearance of the nose while making it harmonize better with the other facial features. Skin type and ethnic background are also very important factors one must discuss with their rhinoplasty surgeon. These details are important because one may one to preserve the ethnic features which lay in the nose. Patients under going rhinoplasty should be above the age of sixteen, so their nose is fully grown and one can make sure that they are going through with the surgery for the right reasons. Experts suggest those who undergo plastic surgery should be eighteen and over for reasons like making adult decisions and because some surgeons may suggest they have other facial enhancing procedures for example &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/lip-enhancement.htm" title="Lip augmentation Beverly Hills"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Lip augmentation Beverly Hills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;This is done because plastic surgeons want to provide the best possible results and a lip augmentation may be needed in order to make the face more harmonized. Before undergoing &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/rhinoplasty.htm" title="Beverly Hills rhinoplasty"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Beverly Hills rhinoplasty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; one should fully understand the procedure by not only listening to all that surgeons tell but also researching and seeing for ones self what the procedure entails. The definition of rhinoplasty is shaping the nose. The first incisions are made and the bone and cartilage support system of the nose are then accessible. Most incisions are made on the inside of the nose to prevent scaring; sometimes an incision is made on the skin that separates the nostrils. After, set amounts of underlying bone and cartilage are removed, added to, or rearranged to provide a newly shaped structure. One example is when the tip pf the nose is too large; the surgeon can sculpt the cartilage in the area to reduce the size. To provide a more youthful look and correct distortion the angle of the nose in relation to the upper lip can be altered. The tissues are then re-draped over the new frame and the incisions are closed. To help retain the shape of the new nose as it heals a splint is applied to the outside of the nose. Soft, absorbent material may be&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;used inside the nose to maintain stability along the dividing wall of the air passages called the septum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-2102754261779273179?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/2102754261779273179/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/07/rhinoplasty-beverly-hills-rhinoplasty.html#comment-form' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/2102754261779273179'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/2102754261779273179'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/07/rhinoplasty-beverly-hills-rhinoplasty.html' title='rhinoplasty Beverly Hills : Rhinoplasty'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/TD1UBP9uzoI/AAAAAAAAAPI/TN0T3cd2AU4/s72-c/drkapoormd+july+2nd+pic.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-4688910852388365366</id><published>2010-07-02T21:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-07-07T05:12:04.699-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly hills tummy tuck'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills neck lift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Facelift Beverly Hills'/><title type='text'>facelift Beverly Hills : Facial plastic surgery to reverse signs of aging</title><content type='html'>&lt;a title="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon " href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/default.htm"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 420px; height: 117px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/TCl5xQwc0DI/AAAAAAAAAOw/Py_fbCSIZEA/s400/drkapoormd+june+3+pic.jpg" alt="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon " id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5488051508146393138" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Plastic surgery is done for many reasons which all lead back to change the things that are other wise unfixable. Aging is the great inevitable mediator that can not be reversed any other way. Several face creams and wash claim to reverse aging and sell very well, but most people know that these products may do their job at moistening the skin but they certainly cannot take years off the face. Facial plastic surgery can make a person look significantly younger and as if they have lost a major amount of weight. A &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/face-neck-rejuvenation.htm" title="facelift Beverly Hills"&gt;facelift Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a very popular procedure but not the only procedure which is performed to make a patient appear younger. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;All facial plastic surgery is generally done to make a patient appear younger or to lost a significant amount of weight. Some patients have lost a significant amount of weight but have trouble losing a double chin or feel that their cheeks are too larger. Procedures that are done to make the face appear younger are lifts and facial liposuction. Some question whether it is the same liposuction that is generally combined with a &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/tummy-tuck.htm" title="Beverly Hills tummy tuck"&gt;Beverly Hills tummy tuck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and it is the same type of liposuction with a smaller tube. This liposuction is generally done on the chin and chicks. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The most popular procedures for older patients seeking to reverse the aging processes are facelifts, neck lifts, brow lifts, and eyelid surgery. Every patient has a different need and idea of what they would like to change to look younger, and &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon"&gt;Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s will help the patient decide and advise the patient on what is best for their face. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;A facelift is done to lift and tone the skin in the muscles of the face. It helps to dramatically reduce the signs of aging, wrinkling, and sagging by smoothing and tightening the forehead, around the eyes and the jowl area. Usually a &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/face-neck-rejuvenation.htm" title="Beverly Hills neck lift"&gt;Beverly Hills neck lift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is done in conjunction to a facelift, Botox or liposuction. This is done on patients who complain or a turkey gobble or double chin. This procedure removes excess fat, skin and muscles creating a tighter appearance. Generally for patients who feel that their facial expressions are altered due to eye brow sagging Surgeons suggest a forehead lift other wise known as a browlift. The surgeon will remove the muscle in the forehead to create a tighter, brighter and more youthful appearance. Eyelid surgery removes the excess skin, fat, and tissue from the upper and lower eyelids. This surgery is to correct bagginess or puffiness around the eyes which generally makes the patient appear several years older, but this procedure does not correct crows’ feet, dark circles or sagging of the brows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-4688910852388365366?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/4688910852388365366/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/06/facelift-beverly-hills-facial-plastic.html#comment-form' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/4688910852388365366'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/4688910852388365366'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/06/facelift-beverly-hills-facial-plastic.html' title='facelift Beverly Hills : Facial plastic surgery to reverse signs of aging'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/TCl5xQwc0DI/AAAAAAAAAOw/Py_fbCSIZEA/s72-c/drkapoormd+june+3+pic.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-6434701703051406060</id><published>2010-06-02T19:36:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-06-02T20:00:53.737-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tummy tuck Beverly Hills'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast augmentation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Liposuction Beverly Hills'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills liposuction'/><title type='text'>Beverly Hills Breast augmentation - Plastic surgery a tool in the war against low self-esteem</title><content type='html'>&lt;a title="Tummy tuck Beverly Hills" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 427px; height: 148px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/TAcaNnTFKyI/AAAAAAAAAOo/WjuhTOmYGgM/s400/drkapoormd+june+1+pic.JPG" alt="Tummy tuck Beverly Hills " id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5478376292909132578" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Plastic surgery has been called one of the most beneficial medical discoveries of all time. Plastic surgery has indeed helped to push science, surgery and human improvement forward. Plastic surgery is very popular and was created to salvage self esteem, although some plastic surgery patients have taken it beyond self esteem that will improve they way they feel when they look in a mirror. Those who desire plastic surgery generally do so for one and at the most two procedures. All the most popular plastic surgery procedures are those that change a woman’s figure. Women are heavily concerned with having the “perfect” body and according to what the media has to show our perception of the “perfect” body changes, but one thing that has yet to change about a women feeling ‘perfect” is being in proportion. Being in proportion to woman means having a thin hour glass shaped body, but although most women long to be thin one part of their body that most women don’t mind a little large is the breast. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;In most places around the world including &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm" title="Beverly Hills Breast augmentation"&gt;Beverly Hills Breast augmentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is one of the most popular plastic surgery procedures next to those that will make the body thinner. Having proportioned breast is more than just about being attractive to the opposite sex. Having small breast makes a woman self conscience about her body mostly because clothing does not fit as well or look as good. When young girls grow up with small breast they are teased, taunted and most opt out of social gatherings like pool parties because of this “issue”, and that is why breast augmentation is an essential plastic surgery in the war against low self-esteem. Women and men alike both worry about their weight or their muscle looking to flabby in a set area, not being able to show mid drift if desired, double chins. These things that indicate being out of shape is not attractive and can definitely make a person feel inferior and aware of what people think of them. This is why &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm" title="Liposuction Beverly Hills"&gt;Liposuction Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is such a hit among people of all cities all over the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;Women and men can undergo &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm" title="Beverly Hills liposuction"&gt;Beverly Hills liposuction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on their face. Legs, things, arms, abdomen and back to achieve best thinning results generally after weight loss. Liposuction is not to be used as a means to lose weight but instead should be used on patients who are within ten percent of their body weight and trying to rid themselves of stubborn fat. Some people more than others have a hard time losing weight in the inner thigh area or the arms so although they might look fit everywhere else on the body the flab on the arm of inner thigh can make them feel as if the hard work and exercise has gone to waste. Other major weight loss patients feel that way about their stomach flab as well. So people lose large amounts of weight rapidly and this can result in flabby skin or loose muscle in the abdomen that can only be fixed with a &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm" title="Tummy tuck Beverly Hills"&gt;Tummy tuck Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. whether it be breast augmentation, liposuction or tummy tuck these surgeries have played an essential role in making me and women comfortable with their bodies. Also, because different men and women underwent these risky surgeries advances have been made that have lessened all the risk, recovery time and even the severity of plastic surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-6434701703051406060?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/6434701703051406060/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/06/beverly-hills-breast-augmentation.html#comment-form' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/6434701703051406060'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/6434701703051406060'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/06/beverly-hills-breast-augmentation.html' title='Beverly Hills Breast augmentation - Plastic surgery a tool in the war against low self-esteem'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/TAcaNnTFKyI/AAAAAAAAAOo/WjuhTOmYGgM/s72-c/drkapoormd+june+1+pic.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-7711536581741188684</id><published>2010-05-28T03:02:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-05-28T03:18:42.896-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills neck lift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills facelift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills liposuction'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast implants'/><title type='text'>Beverly Hills neck lift - Facelift and Necklift Overview</title><content type='html'>&lt;a title="Beverly Hills neck lift" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5476262529566059410" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 381px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 260px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="Beverly Hills neck lift" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S_-XwZORK5I/AAAAAAAAAOY/mWyJeqhCaFk/s400/drkapoormd+4th+pic.JPG" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;Facial plastic surgery can take up to ten years off the face or give a more serious, sophisticated, contoured face to a young person.

Patients in their 40s, 50s and 60s are the most common &lt;b&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills Facelift" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/face-neck-rejuvenation.htm"&gt;Beverly Hills Facelift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; patients but patients in their 70s and 80s also have successful surgeries.&lt;span style="font-size:0;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Facelift surgery is used to correct:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc"&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;Deep Creases below the lower lids &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;Deep creases along the nose extending to the corner of the mouth &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;Loose skin and excess fatty deposits under the chin and jaw that make even a fit a person look as if they had a double chin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;Fat that has fallen or is displaced &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;Loss of muscle tone in the lower face that may create jowls &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;Sagging mid-face &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;A traditional facelift can make a patient not only look younger but slimmer, another procedure that has great success in making a patient appear as if they have trimmed off a few pounds is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills neck lift" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/face-neck-rejuvenation.htm"&gt;Beverly Hills neck lift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. A necklift can also be done in combination with a facelift and generally is done for best results. A necklift generally includes in &lt;b&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills Liposuction" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm"&gt;Beverly Hills Liposuction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to remove fat , Cervicoplasty to remove the excess skin and platysmaplasty to remove and tighten neck muscles this process gets rid of band lines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"&gt;A traditional facelift comes with more risk than Botox and other chemical peal treatments but nothing can do all that a facelift can do. Although like &lt;b&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills Breast Implants" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm"&gt;Beverly Hills Breast Implants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a facelift is an extreme surgery and should be researched before consulting with a surgeon. Unlike breast implants that can be taken out later in life if one changes their mind a facelift can not be reversed and therefore it is very important to have a goal and speak with a surgeon about how realistic the goal is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-7711536581741188684?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/7711536581741188684/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/05/beverly-hills-neck-lift-facelift-and.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/7711536581741188684'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/7711536581741188684'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/05/beverly-hills-neck-lift-facelift-and.html' title='Beverly Hills neck lift - Facelift and Necklift Overview'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S_-XwZORK5I/AAAAAAAAAOY/mWyJeqhCaFk/s72-c/drkapoormd+4th+pic.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-8132152307146313465</id><published>2010-05-22T03:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-05-22T03:27:00.829-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly hills cosmetic surgery'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast augmentation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Liposuction Beverly Hills'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills liposuction'/><title type='text'>liposuction Beverly Hills - Beverly Hills Cosmetic Treatments</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills liposuction" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 389px; height: 138px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S_ew7OKksuI/AAAAAAAAAOA/vFKPzSJFAcQ/s400/drkapoormd+3rd+pic.JPG" alt="Beverly Hills liposuction" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5474038403553342178" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;If you are looking for that something extra to help you feel like a million bucks, you might be looking at a procedure like a &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm" title="liposuction Beverly Hills"&gt;liposuction Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If you need to get rid of that midsection fat, you might not have another option beyond lipo surgery. There are many ways that liposuction can help patients suffering from unwanted weight. Getting rid of this excess fat can help heal joint pain and allow you to look and feel your best without the routine of diet and exercise. Your health and happiness could vastly be improved with this simple treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm" title="Beverly Hills liposuction"&gt;Beverly Hills liposuction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; can also help patients who have lost a lot of weight but can’t seem to reach their goals no matter what they do. For example, some people suffer with chin or underarm fat that they would like to get rid of. Liposuction is the answer for these kinds of problems. This surgery is very simple, and it should have you in and out within the matter of a day. You should always try other options before choosing any medical or cosmetic procedures, but when you are out of options, this is a very pleasing last alternative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;When you are looking at having a &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgery"&gt;Beverly Hills cosmetic surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, you know that you will come out stunningly attractive no matter what procedures you choose to go through. There are a number of surgeries that you could try out, including those on your face, arms, breasts, legs, rear, etc. Though some people may tell you that cosmetic surgery is addictive, that is not the truth. The process of having the surgery is not what patients find addictive, but rather it is their desires for perfection. As long as you get the surgery for your needs rather than your desires, you should be just fine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;Getting &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills breast augmentation"&gt;Beverly Hills breast augmentation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;will get you a lot of results for seemingly little effort. If you are looking to improve your appearance and self esteem, you can do so with breast surgery. Note that breast augmentation is not only for people looking at increasing their breast size but it is also used in patients that have had breast cancer and no longer have breast tissue. If you suffer from such a problem, this could be the answer that you’ve been looking for. Never assume that you are out of options. You may just need some plastic surgery to make your body better than it currently is. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-8132152307146313465?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/8132152307146313465/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/05/liposuction-beverly-hills-beverly-hills.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/8132152307146313465'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/8132152307146313465'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/05/liposuction-beverly-hills-beverly-hills.html' title='liposuction Beverly Hills - Beverly Hills Cosmetic Treatments'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S_ew7OKksuI/AAAAAAAAAOA/vFKPzSJFAcQ/s72-c/drkapoormd+3rd+pic.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-7058669550757785481</id><published>2010-05-21T03:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-05-21T03:51:49.410-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast augmentation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tummy Tuck Los Angeles'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Liposuction Beverly Hills'/><title type='text'>Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon - Plastic surgeons for male plastic surgery</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a title="Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/photo-gallery-liposuction.htm"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 196px; height: 228px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S_ZjHxVDTAI/AAAAAAAAAN4/_dprWronfCY/s400/drkapoormd+2nd+pic.jpg" alt="Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon " id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5473671382267284482" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When men opt for plastic surgery their desire is completely different than that of a woman’s. Women go in to plastic surgery wanting to look beautiful. Yes it is true that some women opt for plastic surgery to look and feel more youthful, but truth is that most women opt for plastic surgery to look more beautiful at the age in which they stand. On the contrary men desire plastic surgery to look more youthful and vibrant, so the plastic surgeon must be skilled in plastic surgery for men rather than women. A mans shape is more muscular, tougher and his angels are very different and; therefore, need to be contoured differently.   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;For some men gynecomastia is their one reason to have plastic surgery and even for such a small procedure leading &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon"&gt;Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; say the surgeon must understand the difference in the before during and after care of male plastic surgery. Gynecomastia is a condition where men develop excess skin or breast tissue causing them to look as if they had breast. Although exercise does help some it does not help enough to stop the discomfort and embarrassment. &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm" title="Beverly Hills breast augmentation"&gt;Beverly Hills breast augmentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (breast reduction) is the only way to get rid of gynecomastia. For gynecomastia &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm" title="liposuction Beverly Hills"&gt;liposuction Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can also be used to remove the excess skin and fat on the male breast. Traditional and less invasive liposuction can also be done on male patients to remove the fat from any area required. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Most men who undergo liposuction generally have liposuction at the abdomen area. As men get older fat deposits around the abdomen and becomes harder to burn off with exercise. Although &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/tummy-tuck.htm" title="Tummy tuck Los Angeles"&gt;Tummy tuck Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a procedure often done on women because of loose stomach muscles after giving birth it has gained popularity in the male community. More men are opting for tummy tucks because of the difficulty to lose fat in the abdomen area as they age. The fat that has deposited around the abdomen becomes extremely hard to burn off as men lose physical activity. In most cases even men who begin to exercise and lose weight can not get rid of the stomach fat and gain there ideal body. Plastic surgeons often contour a women body during such surgery and must be experienced in contouring a male’s body during such surgery because there is a grave difference. It is important for men to do extra research and speak to surgeons in order to get a feel of his or her experience in the countering and care of male plastic surgery patients. &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-7058669550757785481?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/7058669550757785481/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/05/los-angeles-cosmetic-surgeon-plastic.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/7058669550757785481'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/7058669550757785481'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/05/los-angeles-cosmetic-surgeon-plastic.html' title='Los Angeles cosmetic surgeon - Plastic surgeons for male plastic surgery'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S_ZjHxVDTAI/AAAAAAAAAN4/_dprWronfCY/s72-c/drkapoormd+2nd+pic.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-6227662225334119830</id><published>2010-05-11T00:43:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-05-11T00:50:03.686-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tummy tuck Beverly Hills'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cosmetic surgeon Beverly Hills'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly hills tummy tuck'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon'/><title type='text'>Beverly Hills tummy tuck - Seroma After tummy tuck surgery</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a title="cosmetic surgeon Beverly Hills" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 214px; height: 233px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S-kLigANS8I/AAAAAAAAANc/oplqCqRFf28/s400/drkapoormd+1+pic.jpg" alt="cosmetic surgeon Beverly Hills" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5469915909752441794" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every surgery including plastic surgery has its complications some more riskier than others, but all are treatable at different levels. It is important for a patient to be very observant after having any kind of surgery, so that they are aware of if and how they are healing, and are able to identify quickly if something does not look normal. Leading &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/tummy-tuck.htm" title="Beverly Hills tummy tuck"&gt;Beverly Hills tummy tuck &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;surgeons say the possibility of a tummy tuck patients developing a Seroma is about 1%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;After tummy tuck surgery Leading &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon"&gt;Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; place drain tubes and a baggie to drain the fluid from inside of the abdomen after the surgery. After about two weeks of having the drain it is removed and&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;the site is expected to heal, but in a tiny percentage of patients fluid is still building with no where to drain. This fluid is called a seroma, a seroma is build up of yellow tingeish or Kool-Aid colored fluid build up in the dead part of the tissue. A seroma can occur after having any surgery that involves the removal of fat, skin and tissue. A seroma is different from a hematoma, an abscess and is not an infection. If a seroma is left untreated it can become an infection. When a seroma occurs after &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/tummy-tuck.htm" title="tummy tuck Beverly Hills"&gt;tummy tuck Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; surgeons say although it calls for several more visits to the surgeon than did before, the seroma is definitely treatable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;A seroma generally requires three to five visits to the surgeon’s office, so he can drain the site. The surgeon drains the site using a syringe and removing the fluid from the specific area. A seroma does not affect the final out come of the surgery and the patient should still have the desired body after the drainage. Leading &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="cosmetic surgeon Beverly Hills"&gt;cosmetic surgeon Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; say the aspiration of the seroma is painless because the site where the seroma occurs should be numb for about six months. Although for some patients a seroma is inevitable because they had excellent after care form some patients the best medicine is prevention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;In order to prevent a seroma a patient could take a hemostatic. Hemostatic is an agent that stops bleeding and other fluids from secreting. Measuring the amount of fluid in the drainage bag can always tell how much fluid is built up and draining, and can predict a seroma. Spraying adhesive which the surgeon provides in the flap where seroma can form can stop a seroma from forming as well. After a seroma is detected most surgeons prescribe a binder in order to decrease mobility, but a binder that is had before the seroma will prevent seroma. Plastic surgery is major surgery and has plenty of risk and variables involved but when well taken care of plastic surgery can change a persons life drastically for the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-6227662225334119830?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/6227662225334119830/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/05/beverly-hills-tummy-tuck-seroma-after.html#comment-form' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/6227662225334119830'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/6227662225334119830'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/05/beverly-hills-tummy-tuck-seroma-after.html' title='Beverly Hills tummy tuck - Seroma After tummy tuck surgery'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S-kLigANS8I/AAAAAAAAANc/oplqCqRFf28/s72-c/drkapoormd+1+pic.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-4973810778108792501</id><published>2010-04-26T21:53:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-04-25T22:06:36.746-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='eyelid surgery Beverly Hills'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills neck lift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills facelift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Facelift Beverly Hills'/><title type='text'>The city of beauty</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills facelift" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 476px; height: 132px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S9Uc48hwujI/AAAAAAAAAM8/0iVBHcVoqMw/s400/drkapoormd+april+3rd+pic.jpg" alt="Beverly Hills facelift" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5464305487529949746" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Can where a person lives influence their life so much that they would change their body to fit their surroundings. Recently there was an article in MSNBC stating that where a person lives might determine the cosmetic procedure of their choice. Realself.com and ASPS have done research which calculates the amount of people in different areas that elect the same procedure. According to the article more people from the northeast elect to have rhinoplasty than those from anywhere. The question posed was if it was possible that most of the women were electing to have rhinoplasty, because that is the part of their face that is shown most often. The study shows that according to where a patient or prospective patient lives determines what kind of plastic surgery they will have. &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The study was even able to narrow down the searches by city.   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;The study discovered the obvious, meaning that in every state and city plastic surgery was done on the body part or parts that are shown and flaunted most often according to the area.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Although &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;California&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; has plenty of beaches it is not tropical, therefore the stomach and thighs are not seen by all, and do not need to be altered depending on what city the patient resides in. The study claims that in &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; the most popular procedure is of lip augmentation. Lip augmentation is very popular in &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/st1:city&gt; and &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; because it is a procedure that is ultimately altering the face. Although a Blog writer blames stars like Angelina Jolie for setting the trend in fat lips, studies beyond the article show that in &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/st1:city&gt; and &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Beverly&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; any procedure involving work on the face holds great popularity. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills facelift"&gt;Beverly Hills facelift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s is one of many procedures which have gained popularity throughout the years. &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; leading facial surgeons say it is because women and men are noticing sudden changes in there face in their late 30s early 40s and decide to fix it soon before the problem becomes worse. A &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="facelift Beverly Hills"&gt;facelift Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; plastic surgeons say makes the patient appear younger and the skin even look softer, but for some of the patients in their late 30s a facelift might be too drastic for their need and instead they opt for &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="eyelid surgery Beverly Hills"&gt;eyelid surgery Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; surgeons even recommend it in some cases. Saddle bags around the eyes are a dead give away of age, and in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Beverly   Hills&lt;/st1:city&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; where beauty is glorified there is no room for aging. Is it possible that older people in &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; are trying to fit in with the surrounding the young, beautiful, A-list celebrities and super stars? &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Also In &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills neck lift"&gt;Beverly Hills neck lift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s has been a growing trend, because Fat around the neck makes a person look heavier and even older due to the wrinkling. Therefore leading facial plastic surgeons say a necklift makes the patient look as if they have lost a significant amount of weight ultimately making the patient look rejuvenated.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-4973810778108792501?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/4973810778108792501/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/04/city-of-beauty.html#comment-form' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/4973810778108792501'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/4973810778108792501'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/04/city-of-beauty.html' title='The city of beauty'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S9Uc48hwujI/AAAAAAAAAM8/0iVBHcVoqMw/s72-c/drkapoormd+april+3rd+pic.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-7809235500916154324</id><published>2010-04-09T23:42:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-04-09T23:45:37.480-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly hills cosmetic surgery'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast augmentation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tummy Tuck Los Angeles'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Liposuction Beverly Hills'/><title type='text'>Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgery – Liposuction, Breast Augmentation and Tummy Tucks</title><content type='html'>&lt;a title="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgery " href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5458395863816506994" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 429px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 136px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgery " src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S8AeHko-jnI/AAAAAAAAAM0/0Sg8WqUBiaw/s400/drkapoormd1.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="justify"&gt;Beverly Hills is the first place to think about when considering cosmetic surgery.

The plastic surgeons of Beverly Hills strive to make these life changing procedures a positive relaxing experience. In liposuction, breast augmentation or tummy tucks, the surgeon’s artistic touch is as important as their skills. Body shaping is an art form as well as a science. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="justify"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title="Liposuction Beverly Hills" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liposuction Beverly Hills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular procedures. This procedure floods the desired areas with a fluid and then a small wand is injected which removes the fat. This is a permanent procedure. However if there are continued excesses in diet new fat could form. This can be performed on thighs, hips, buttocks, abdomen, waist, arms or anywhere there is excess fat to be removed. Liposuctions are generally for those within 30% of their idea weight. It is important to have a positive realistic outlook and clear goals regarding the procedure. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="justify"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decision to have &lt;a title="Beverly Hills breast augmentation" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beverly Hills breast augmentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a very personal one. The social pressure for women of Beverly Hills can cause women to seek cosmetic surgeries that may not be in their best interests. It is very important to find a skilled and sensitive plastic surgeon to assess the body and discuss the best options that will give the client the look that they desire but still maintain a natural healthy body and perspective. Because breast implants can dramatically alter the size and shape of the body, care must be taken to assure that results with be satisfactory. The results should help bring about a positive outlook, increased self esteem and confidence. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="justify"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tummy tucks are another popular procedure in Beverly Hills. These create a firmer and smoother abdominal profile. This surgery will remove excess fat, tighten abdominal walls and can eliminate stretch marks. Clients that choose this procedure have usually tried methods of diet and exercise to firm the abdomen but have not had success. The &lt;a title="tummy tuck Los Angeles" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tummy tuck Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can also help tone the abdomen after pregnancy.

Beverly Hills is the perfect place to show off a new improved body. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-7809235500916154324?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/7809235500916154324/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/04/beverly-hills-cosmetic-surgery.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/7809235500916154324'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/7809235500916154324'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/04/beverly-hills-cosmetic-surgery.html' title='Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgery – Liposuction, Breast Augmentation and Tummy Tucks'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S8AeHko-jnI/AAAAAAAAAM0/0Sg8WqUBiaw/s72-c/drkapoormd1.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-5495772278897944607</id><published>2010-04-02T04:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-04-02T04:28:16.806-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast augmentation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tummy Tuck Los Angeles'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Liposuction Beverly Hills'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills liposuction'/><title type='text'>Plastic surgeons doing there job well</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a title="tummy Tuck Los Angeles  " href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 423px; height: 152px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S7XTnkzBFTI/AAAAAAAAAMU/764UWutD-gw/s400/drkapoormd1.jpg" alt="tummy Tuck Los Angeles  " id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5455499200475239730" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Recently in the news women are throwing around accusations about plastic surgeries. They are calling plastic surgery fake and disappointing. The problem is that women are going into the plastic surgeons office expecting him or her to be a magician. Unreal expectations make for disappointing results. Some say it’s about time plastic surgeons hang disclaimers on their doors that read Plastic surgery will not solve all of your insecurities and a plastic surgeon is not a psychiatrist with a scalpel, Although a &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="tummy Tuck Los Angeles"&gt;tummy Tuck Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; surgeons say will solve stretched abdomen muscles and skin it will not make your self esteem issues go away it might just help. Plastic surgery will improve the way you look or feel about yourself to a certain extent; however for some people nothing is ever good enough and after everyone is done noticing the satisfaction begins to fade in which case that is not the plastic surgeons fault. Most are blaming plastic surgeons for all popularity in plastic surgery and calling them frauds but people are forgetting that ones own body is their own responsibility.   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;For most women in &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills breast Augmentation"&gt;Beverly Hills breast Augmentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is enough plastic surgery and although there have been people who have been disappointed and wronged in there breast augmentation for the most part most women are very happy with the augmentation of their choice and addiction to plastic surgery never crossed the mind. For women who like to undergo multiple plastic surgery procedures at a time a breast augmentation just isn’t enough and usually if they have had a breast augmentation they are looking to extend in size multiple times. Not only are these women hurting themselves long term wise but they are abusing plastic surgery. Unless going forward with the surgery breaks a law or medical regulation, and/or poses too many health risk the plastic surgeon is there to do what he is paid to do.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;In &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills Liposuction"&gt;Beverly Hills Liposuction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is commonly used by young people to eliminate that extra fat on the stomach, inner and outer thighs. Liposuction is not a method of weight loss like most think. Some have the idea that after liposuction it’s possible to look and feel 20 pounds lighter (its not). Liposuction can make a huge difference the tummy will be flatter, and the thighs might not touch anymore but the fat can return. It is a bit harder for the fat to return after lipo but for those who do not eat healthy or exercise more than likely they will be coming back for more. Plastic surgeons have dealt with women who undergo this procedure multiple times. &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Liposuction Beverly hills"&gt;Liposuction Beverly hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; surgeons perform very often because of the little risk and the less invasive procedures that keep patients coming back for more. In the news articles that are accusing plastic surgeons as frauds the question is why don’t plastic surgeons say no? The question should be Is it really a plastic surgeons job to tell someone how to live their life? A plastic surgeons job is to give you the look and features you’d like. They are only to turn away patients who have too much silicone in their bodies or previous health problems. Unless they are breaking a regulation or law of some sort they need to do their jobs well. Self control is ones own issues and a surgeon is not a therapist they are trained to do their jobs well and most do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-5495772278897944607?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/5495772278897944607/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/04/plastic-surgeons-doing-there-job-well.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/5495772278897944607'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/5495772278897944607'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/04/plastic-surgeons-doing-there-job-well.html' title='Plastic surgeons doing there job well'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S7XTnkzBFTI/AAAAAAAAAMU/764UWutD-gw/s72-c/drkapoormd1.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-1984563480321813431</id><published>2010-03-23T02:46:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-03-23T02:53:11.509-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly hills plastic surgeon'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tummy tuck'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills liposuction'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills'/><title type='text'>Going abroad for plastic surgery</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills plastic surgeon" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/tummy-tuck.htm"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 426px; height: 154px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S6iO8KaHJlI/AAAAAAAAAMI/sxgGOSYV5N0/s400/drkapoormd+march+3.jpg" alt="Beverly Hills plastic surgeon" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5451764513169155666" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Around the world plastic surgery is a growing fad.

In &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; plastic surgery is so popular individuals who can not afford the procedures go abroad to have surgery this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the individual and what the case may be.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;For example in &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; from 2005-2007 plastic surgeons were being kidnapped during the insurgency. During the insurgency a lot of &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;’s plastic surgeons went into hiding or strictly performed on war victims, although the fear of kidnapping has gone down only about a dozen surgeons in &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; perform plastic surgery and although it is a bit expensive for the people living in their country there prices are a lot lower than in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;America&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;. Only a few of the dozen will perform elected cosmetic procedures. In &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; plastic surgery poses religious divides for almost everyone in their country because of the country being predominantly Muslim; however the women and men electing to have these plastic surgeries are not requesting for same sex surgeons causing for the increase in popularity and all the talk to spread over. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In &lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm" title="Beverly Hills Liposuction"&gt;Beverly Hills Liposuction&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular procedures and following close in popularity is the &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/tummy-tuck.htm" title="tummy tuck Beverly Hills"&gt;tummy tuck, Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; leading surgeons say both are very safe and pose little risk of infection due to the fact that no object in being put inside the body. In &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; liposuction and tummy tuck procedures are among the safest surgeries to have. Tummy tuck and liposuction are safer than other plastic surgeries in &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; because in &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; when going for plastic surgery which requires implantation you must buy your silicone implants Botox shots, or saline implants abroad on your own. Buying anything to place inside ones body is dangerous when you are unknowledgeable of what the product is and what it is you might be buying. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Placing an unsafe product inside the body can cause infection, rejection and major organ failure. Many people go abroad for plastic surgery because of the cost, the rules the government has put on the amount of silicone that can be in the body at once and because of the good standing health background a patient must have before undergoing any kind of surgery. There have been many cases where patients have gone abroad to have plastic surgery because their &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills plastic surgeon"&gt;Beverly Hills plastic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; denied the procedure due to medical health risk or the vast amount of silicone requested and the patient did not make it back. Not only are these patients at risk of dying but when back in &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; if a medical problem arises very few doctors will be able to adhere to the patients need because of fear of fear of the unknown. It is also very possible that insurance companies will no longer cover you because of the risks of the abroad surgery. If something does go wrong you more than likely will elect for revision surgery and in most places including &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon"&gt;Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s will perform revision. This means your elected procedure in which you went out of the country for will have cost you almost double This is why it is important to verify your surgeon is board certified and do the research on his past skills and past procedures.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-1984563480321813431?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/1984563480321813431/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/03/going-abroad-for-plastic-surgery.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/1984563480321813431'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/1984563480321813431'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/03/going-abroad-for-plastic-surgery.html' title='Going abroad for plastic surgery'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S6iO8KaHJlI/AAAAAAAAAMI/sxgGOSYV5N0/s72-c/drkapoormd+march+3.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-3733816955474107903</id><published>2010-03-23T02:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-03-23T02:42:12.662-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast augmentation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='example Beverly Hills tummy tuck'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills neck lift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='facelift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills'/><title type='text'>Why plastic surgery is so popular</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills breast augmentation" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/photo-gallery-facial-rejuvenaion.htm"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 368px; height: 228px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S6iMPzT_LrI/AAAAAAAAAMA/HqkhqwczcH8/s400/drkapoormd+march+2+copy.jpg" alt="Beverly Hills breast augmentation" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5451761552031952562" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Plastic surgeries have become main stream.

From time immemorial, men loves woken with curves - now a lot of women will give anything to have a flat belly and a skinny little body with a hint of some curves. In &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills Plastic surgeon"&gt;Beverly Hills Plastic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;s are facilitating women in their journey to gaining that perfect body. While a svelte figure is ageless, today's ultrathin models have emphasized this transition significantly. As a woman I can honest say though, that if it helps you develop self esteem by shedding a few pounds, then that is good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Weight has always been an issue for women. Ask perennially thin women - they are gorging on protein drinks to gain weight! Unluckily for the majority of us, its the shedding of weight that is the issue. Usually the last few pounds of some part of our body that we find extremely difficult to lose! The inner thighs are always such a problematic place to try and tone or lose pounds from we’ve decided that instead of killing ourselves and never getting the results we’d like we’re going to do something guaranteed to work - like lapband or &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm" title="Liposuction Beverly Hills"&gt;Liposuction Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; cognoscenti have identified and used liposuction, now the mainstream is catching up too. In fact, there is a trend to have liposuction in conjunction to a &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/tummy-tuck.htm" title="Beverly Hills tummy tuck"&gt;Beverly Hills tummy tuck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. We want to look and feel self confident about what we have underneath our clothing, and if we happen to get a random compliment some where that’s just another plus. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm" title="Beverly Hills breast implants"&gt;Beverly Hills breast implants &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;have been the most popular plastic surgery since it’s been documented for 13 years. A number of &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/st1:place&gt; stars have been rumored for having breast augmentation procedures done, but its tough to separate reality from hearsay. Anyways, suffice it to say that Plastic Surgery has arrived in the mainstream.

is also one of the most prime cities to have it performed. Every surgical procedure has some amount of risk, but patients can reduce the amount of risk by educating themselves about the liposuction procedure itself and by choosing an expert and experienced plastic surgeon.   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm" title="Liposuction Beverly Hills"&gt;Liposuction Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; plastic surgeons will say, is a relatively safe procedure that can have transforming results for many people if a properly trained and experienced plastic surgeon is chosen. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Liposuction is a type of body sculpting, body contouring or "spot-reduction" designed to remove excess and unsightly fat from specific areas of the body. &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm" title="Beverly Hills liposuction"&gt;Beverly Hills liposuction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be done on the abdomen, hips, buttocks, thighs, knees, calves, upper arms, cheeks and the neck. These localized fat deposits may be inherited and typically do not respond to dieting or exercising. Liposuction is often the only way to improve these areas and liposuction can be done alone or combined with other cosmetic procedures such as breast reduction and a tummy tuck to create a full transformation. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;In addition to liposuction, plastic surgeons from &lt;b style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm" title="Beverly Hills breast implants"&gt;Beverly Hills breast implants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can also be performed to complete the transformation. Breast implant surgery is designed to enhance the size and shape of your breasts. Because of the improvements in surgical methods and breast-implant technology, the procedure has become more refined and now provides better surgical results. Breast implant procedure can be combined with a breast lift to provide the full satisfaction possible. The breast implants come in many sizes and shapes to better help you get the ideal breast implant that fits you best. Choose the right size for surgery should be based on your factors that include positioning, shape, personal anatomy and personal considerations. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mylot.com/drkapoormd/-1"&gt;myLot User Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5194605397958083171-9208114226997015900?l=drkapoormd.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/feeds/9208114226997015900/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/01/beverly-hills-cosmetic-procedures.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/9208114226997015900'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5194605397958083171/posts/default/9208114226997015900'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://drkapoormd.blogspot.com/2010/01/beverly-hills-cosmetic-procedures.html' title='Beverly Hills Cosmetic Procedures'/><author><name>Dr. Kapoor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13304579415775347300</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/Se433QYOL1I/AAAAAAAAAAM/gW0ccFgG9s8/S220/kapoor_head.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S1g2yfq7rlI/AAAAAAAAAK8/rOyzJ6WxeKs/s72-c/drkapoormd+2.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5194605397958083171.post-1281354431215454147</id><published>2010-01-06T23:21:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2010-01-06T23:27:37.341-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly hills tummy tuck'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills liposuction'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Beverly Hills breast implants'/><title type='text'>The Mommy Make Over for the Modern Woman</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills breast implants" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 171px; height: 313px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VvtBeLrlVoE/S0WMFqM75TI/AAAAAAAAAK0/OHvfiqY2AZc/s400/drkapoormd+jan.jpg" alt="Beverly Hills breast implants" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5423895355093411122" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The modern mother is no longer preoccupied with just simply keeping her household up to speed and taking her children to school but also with living healthy, longer and keeping her body in shape.

These surgeries have now become easily accessible and affordable to ordinary masses. A lot of people feel the need for restoring, reshaping, changing, altering, enhancing and modifying one or the other body parts. Ever since the inception of plastic and cosmetic surgery techniques, people have lots of success stories to tell. The resultant satisfaction they achieve is unbelievable as they feel a lot more confident and satisfied after regaining the original form, shape or size of their body part.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Tummy Tuck or abdominoplasty is a major surgical procedure that has gained popularity in the recent past. The reason behind this is an accurate and effective removal of fat through a trusted and reliable process. This process involves the removal of excessive, hanging or sagging skin or fat that develops around the muscles. The procedure tightens the muscles around the abdominal areas and makes them firm and stable. Bulging bellies and loose skin caused by pregnancy or sudden weight loss are the most common candidates for tummy tuck. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This surgery is also an ideal option for older people who have sagging skin that they develop through aging and loss of elasticity. However, people should refrain from going for the surgery that has heart problems, vascular, digestive problems, or any other unfavourable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Like any other surgery, both plastic and cosmetic surgeries have certain risks and complications. A detailed discussion with your medical doctor before the surgery is required as the surgeon needs to be updated on the medications that you are taking. The reason behind this is to prevent the effect of medications that can hinder your surgical procedure. Conditions like diabetes, blood disorder, or heart failure will straightway disqualify you for the surgery. For undergoing a &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="cosmetic surgery, Beverly Hills"&gt;cosmetic surgery, Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the right place to check for a good cosmetic surgeon. &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/" title="Beverly Hills plastic surgeon"&gt;Beverly Hills plastic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are world class and expert in their field of practice.

Loose skin, wrinkles, hanging features, decreased muscle tones are some of the unwanted features of ageing, yet they are inevitable. There are other reasons for appalling facial features and dull skin, like a serious tragedy or a mishap. To look better, a lot of people are getting result oriented and safe procedures. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"&gt;Beverly Hills is one such place that is popular for cosmetic surgery. &lt;span style=""&gt;If you want a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b style=""&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/face-neck-rejuvenation.htm" title="facelift, Beverly Hills"&gt;facelift, Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is the best known place in the &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;United   States&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; to get the procedure done.

The amount of upgrading and perfection with Face Lift and Tummy Tuck surgery depends upon the bone structure of the face, the extent of drooping, and wrinkling of the skin.

Now, in this age of downsizing and saving, success must feel out of reach, a world away from the fat-cat executive style savored by the fathers of today's corporate men and women. Executives are taking their salaries and applying them in a way that executive-placement firms are endorsing: measures to look younger, with smooth skin, a full head of hair, a taut stomach, and for female execs, a firm, youthful bust-line with a set of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills breast implants" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/breast-augmentation.htm"&gt;Beverly Hills breast implants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Unlike Calvin Klein and Fredericks of Hollywood underwear models with washboard stomachs and classic hourglass figures, executives looking for jobs (or trying to hold onto them) don't have three hours a day to devote to the gym. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align="justify"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What they do have is more responsibility and the physiques that go with that stress, according to a top local &lt;a title="Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/"&gt;Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon&lt;/a&gt;. They complain about bags under their eyes, wrinkles, graying and thinning hair, rolls in the midsection.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align="justify"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align="justify"&gt;And as if to prove true the proverb "Where one door closes, another opens," downsizing seems to have helped spur a boom in another area: businesses that offer effective ways for making women and men look young, healthy and fit. For men, plastic surgery offers pectoral implants to make the chest appear more muscular, and calf muscle implants to give the leg a bodybuilder shape. There is &lt;b&gt;&lt;a title="Beverly Hills liposuction" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/liposuction.htm"&gt;Beverly Hills liposuction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to counter thickening middles and accumulating breast and fatty tissue in the chest, and as for &lt;b&gt;&lt;a title="tummy tuck Beverly Hills" href="http://www.drkapoormd.com/tummy-tuck.htm"&gt;tummy tuck Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;plastic surgeons report that this in-demand procedure is sought after by both men and women. There are a half-dozen surgical methods for tightening skin and temporarily delaying the inevitable aged face.
