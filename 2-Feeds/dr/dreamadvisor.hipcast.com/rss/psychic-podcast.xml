      <title>Empathy and Our Relationships</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Here are 5 easy steps to begin using empathy to enhance your relationships.  Empathic relationships must be nurtured and understood in order to achieve the most from them.

Empathy and our Relationships
By Psychic Charlise

Empathy allows us to form deeper more fulfilling emotional bonds with our loved ones. Empathy is the ability to feel and experience another’s emotions, moods or attitude within our own body, as though it were our own feelings and sensations. It’s much like compassion for another, only empathy takes understanding and compassion to a whole new level, giving you an actual physical experience in your own body. This is the ultimate act of love, mindfulness and complete surrender and can be very rewarding emotionally when you learn how to apply your innate empathic gifts to embrace the most important aspect of our lives, our personal connections with the ones you love. 

Here are 5 easy steps to begin using empathy to enhance your relationships.  Empathic relationships must be nurtured and understood in order to achieve the most from them.

1. Slow down and still your mind. 
Your empathic sense is always available to you, but if you are distracted, you may not be receptive to its messages. Take a few moments each day to reflect on your relationships. Still your mind and focus on the positive things you are grateful for in your relationships. Concentrate on your loved ones special qualities and characteristics that bring you happiness. See your future relationship as having limitless potential, and opportunities for growth and understanding, making a solid connection impenetrable by any negative circumstance, event or obstacle. 

2. Listen and Pay Attention
Empathy relies on the intelligence of the heart, teaches us mindfulness, and an understanding of the intricate connection we have to all living beings. Each time you respond to your intuitive empathic sense, you are reaching out to your loved ones and sending a message that you care. Listen carefully to what they are saying, even if you don’t agree, this will create a strong foundation allowing your loved ones to feel safe in coming to you with their concerns, ideas or thoughts without fear or judgments. Listen with an open understanding heart, show interest in what is being said to you, and immerse yourself in the special moment of your loved one sharing of their thoughts and feelings with you. 

3. Feel and Let go
Allow yourself to feel the emotions that come to you. Honor your feelings; even if you are feeling vulnerable, this will lead to strength and a deeper understanding of your experience. When you learn to understand and respect your own emotions, you will then be able to decipher your feelings from your loved ones. At times an empath will confuse others feelings for their own, and will quickly become overwhelmed. When you learn to separate these from one another, it will become clearer in how to find solutions for yourself and those around you. Once you have honored your feelings, release them and let them go. Feel proud that you have faced your feelings and have overcome difficulty and allow yourself to move on. This exercise will help you to learn to forgive and be forgiven. Don’t dwell on past issues, deal with them as they come, feel them and let them go. 

4. Express yourself
The most important thing you can do as empath is to give love where it is needed, either to yourself or another person. When you begin to share your emotions, thoughts and ideas with others you clear the channels, sending a loving frequency, to those around you. Your relationships will begin to heal, creating deeper commitments and the focus will turn to healing in an environment conducive for a healthier relationship. Tell your partner, children, family and friends how much you love and appreciate them. They will respond to your loving energy, bringing you closer than ever. 

5. Accept unconditionally
Accept yourself and your loved ones unconditionally. Learn to realize that our faults are part of who we are, but not necessarily the essence of our being. Acceptance is a form of expressing love, as we all need a place we can exist and be our true selves. Share this special gift, with your self and those you love. 

Delve deeper into your own emotions, make it a point to personally take responsibility for your self and watch the relationships around you respond to your transformation, and your relationships will begin to grow and prosper and reach their true divine potential.
