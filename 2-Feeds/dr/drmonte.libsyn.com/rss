			<title>3 Reasons You Should Consider A Facebook Page for Your Podcast </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/3-reasons-you-should-consider-a-facebook-page-for-your-podcast-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>One way to connect to your podcast is a facebook page. &nbsp;Facebook has a separate way for businesses, organizations, shows and brands to promote their content on facebook. &nbsp;Profiles are for people, pages are for everyone else.</p>
<p>3 reasons why you should have a Facebook page for your show:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>People are already there</strong>. &nbsp;Everyone is on Facebook - okay maybe not everyone - but lots of people check facebook many times a day, they might not come look at your website everyday - but if they are already on Facebook - then you should meet them there.</li>
<li><strong>The personal endorsement</strong>. &nbsp;Advertising is okay, but anyone who has ever spent a dollar on advertising will tell you that a personal reccomendation from a friend is always more valuable than an advertisement. &nbsp;When some one "likes" your show on Facebook - that "like" then shows up in their friends stream. &nbsp;When you "like" Libsyn (if you are on Facebook - we hope you will like out page) - that shows up in stream. &nbsp;"Your_name liked Libsyn"</li>
<li><strong>Sharing is easy.</strong> &nbsp;When you add something to your show's Facebook page - your fans are just a click away from sharing that information with their friends. &nbsp;No links to copy and paste. &nbsp;1 click sharing makes it easy for your fans to tell your friends about the latest episode or news about your show. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How to set up a Facebook Page:</strong></p>
<p>Don't have a Facebook Page yet? &nbsp;No problem - Facebook pages are free an easy to set up. &nbsp;Mashable has put together a great tutorial on setting up a Facebook page <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/22/how-to-facebook-page/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<title>Mommy Podcasts: Providing What Money Can't Buy For Mother's Day</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/mommy-podcasts-providing-what-money-can-t-buy-for-mother-s-day]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.elsiesyogakula.com/elsieescobar/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Happy-Mothers-Day-.jpg" alt="" width="" height="" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Community, Communication and Support</h2>
<p>Even though there are times that as a Mother I want <em>stuff</em> ie. clothes, jewelry, gadgets, etc. what I long for and desire the most as a mother you can't really buy anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Mothers desire connection</strong></p>
<p>Primarily connection with other Mamas. There are times when I feel like I'm the only mother in the world that is going through whatever I'm going through at the time, toddler tantrums, explosive messes that refuse to get cleaned up, child ailments, sleepless nights...I could go on and on ;)</p>
<p><strong>Mothers long for communication</strong></p>
<p>I often times simply want to share with someone, someone that <em>gets</em> how hard being a Mama truly is, or how incredible the world is as seen through your child's eyes, or simply talking about something that is not at all child related with another woman!</p>
<p><strong>Mothers need support</strong></p>
<p>At first I thought I could do it all- <strong>by myself</strong>. I had up to this point set my mind to anything I desired and simply done it, often times to the chagrin of those that were closest to me. Why would motherhood be different? Well, it seems like this whole mothering thing works sooooo much better with support, help, advice, and encouragement.</p>
<p>What if you don't have a built in community of Mothers that can be available at any time?</p>
<p><strong>Mommy Podcasts to the rescue!</strong></p>

Community, Communication and Support
Even though there are times that as a Mother I want stuff ie. clothes, jewelry, gadgets, etc. what I long for and desire the most as a mother you can't really buy anywhere.
Mothers desire connection
Primarily connection with other Mamas. There are times when I feel like I'm the only mother in the world that is going through whatever I'm going through at the time, toddler tantrums, explosive messes that refuse to get cleaned up, child ailments, sleepless nights...I could go on and on ;)
Mothers long for communication
I often times simply want to share with someone, someone that gets how hard being a Mama truly is, or how incredible the world is as seen through your child's eyes, or simply talking about something that is not at all child related with another woman!
Mothers need support
At first I thought I could do it all- by myself. I had up to this point set my mind to anything I desired and simply done it, often times to the chagrin of those that were closest to me. Why would motherhood be different? Well, it seems like this whole mothering thing works sooooo much better with support, help, advice, and encouragement.
What if you don't have a built in community of Mothers that can be available at any time?
Mommy Podcasts to the rescue!
You need to feel supported and heard? How about feeling that you belong?
Check out these Mommy podcasts that will provide you with at least a little bit of recognition and entertainment, but most of all moments of knowing that you are not alone!

            <description><![CDATA[<h2>What is your podcast about?</h2>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/ThinkingMan_Rodin.jpg/450px-ThinkingMan_Rodin.jpg"><img title="Image Wikipidia from Satyakamk" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/ThinkingMan_Rodin.jpg/450px-ThinkingMan_Rodin.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="350" align="right" /></a>iTunes now has hundreds of thousands podcasts available for easy consumption, and upon looking at some of the top rated and most popular podcasts, other than eye-catching artwork there is something they all share: <em>a clear, concise and informative description.</em></p>
<p>This description is not just about iTunes but is carried over to the podcast website, where it deepens and becomes a little more elaborate without loosing it's simplicity.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at 4 descriptions from iTunes and pull out key factors toward creating the optimal <strong>about description</strong> for your podcast.</p>
<h3>1. The Call To Action</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=318958166">The Winning Investor</a>:</em></strong> Take control of your financial destiny and develop a successful investing strategy with The Winning Investor. Join Andrew Horowitz as he cuts through the sometimes confusing jargon of financial products and services to help you analyze investment opportunities and decide what's best for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/">The QDNow Podcasts</a> have fantastic descriptions which incorporate action. As you read the first sentence of the description above it immediately tells you <em>what action you'll take</em> from consuming this content with strong active statements. The second sentence gives you <em>the how this action will happen</em>: with Andrew Horowitz guiding you to action.</p>
<h3>2. The Leading Question</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/stuff-you-should-know/id278981407">How stuff Works</a></em></strong>: in a world of limitless possibilities, who can listeners count on for up to date info on everything from oil spills to flamethrowers? Just check in with Chuck and Josh, your favority Neo-Renaissance men for more Stuff You Know from HowStuffWorks.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting off with a question that incorporates your optimal audience, including a reason to subscribe, while providing a precise answer is another way to quickly communicate what your podcast is about.</p>
<p>In the description above you see the question stated offers 2 things: <em>audience description</em> (people interested info from oil spills to flamethrowers) and <em>a reason to subscribe</em> (up to date info). The response shares with the potential listeners that the podcast is <em>a conversation</em> (Chuck and Josh) and <em>who they are</em> (Neo-Renaissance men) plus adds <em>where to get more</em> (HowStuffWorks.com).</p>
<p>In those two sentences, you get a fantastic overview of what you can expect when you listen to this show as well as the type of people who may be drawn to listening.</p>
<h3>3. The Power List</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/back-to-work/id415535037">Back To Work</a></em></strong>: Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin on productivity, communication, work, barriers constraints, tools and more. Hosted by Dan Benjamin and Merlin Man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps the simplest way to get everything your podcast is about in one sentence. Have <em>the who</em> (the doer/subject) + <em>on</em> (the verb/action) + a list of <em>your key words</em> (object/the topic). Done.</p>
<h3>4. The Simple Statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sticks-string-podcast/id202783643">Sticks &amp; Strings Podcast</a></em></strong>: A podcast by an Australian bloke who knits. www.sticksandstrings.com.au</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you get that? Short, simple, and done! I know what that podcast is about :)</p>
<p><strong>In your iTunes podcast page you get about 50 words above the fold</strong> (anything that you immediately see without having to click <em>...more</em> and scroll down) If you can make those first 2 sentences powerful you've totally got them to offer the more of your greatness!</p>
<p>Now, don't think that you can only describe your podcast in these 4 ways or that you have to do it with only two sentences. Those examples above are simply the tip of the iceberg. After distilling what your podcast is about so succinctly at the top of your description, you now can elaborate about what makes your podcasts unique, adding all the flash and singularity that makes it you.</p>
<p>If you want to deepen your description a great guideline to keep your description readable and effective is to keep it between 100-200 words. Use the same description both in iTunes as well as in your About Page on your website.</p>
<h2>Uniformity And Consistency Yield Great Power</h2>
<p>When you take the time to distill your description up to two sentences as well as grow your description to a couple of paragraphs, it not only clearly informs your potential audience but gives you the power to communicate what you are about in effective ways. <strong>You can now share what your podcast is about via one twitter message as well as pitching potential partnerships, marketing your podcast and strengthening your brand across many platforms through the distinct uniformity.</strong></p>
<p>Have you thought about what your description or about page says about you? Do you have any tips to share? We would love to hear from you in the comments!</p>

			<title>How To Put An Audio File On A Wordpress Site</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/how-to-put-an-audio-file-on-a-wordpress-site]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've already covered how to <a href="http://imake.libsyn.com/how-to-put-an-audio-file-on-a-wordpress-com-blog">embed your audio files onto a wordpress.com blog</a>, and doing the same on your self-hosted site is just as easy.</p>
<p>Given the fact that you are now self-hosted you have more choices of what audio player to use to embed your audio onto your site.  The first step would be to choose what audio player you would like to use on your site. Since you are hosted at libsyn you have 2 choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Wordpress audio player plug-in.</li>
<li><a href="http://wizzard.tv/player">The Wizzard player</a> <em>Although initially built as a video player, it can absolutely be used for audio files</em></li>
</ol>
<h2>Choosing a wordpress audio player plugin</h2>
<p>Although audio players abound, <em>generally speaking</em> here are the most popular WP audio player plugins:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/audio-player/">audio player</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/powerpress/">Bluburry Powerpress Podcasting plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="http://soukie.net/degradable-html5-audio-and-video-plugin/">Degradable HTML5 audio and video Plugin</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these players offer varying degrees of configuration and personalization. Take your time checking them out, as well as seeing what kind of support they offer, so if you get in any trouble, you'll have help.</p>
<p>After you've chosen, <strong><em>installed, activated and configured</em></strong> your Wordpress audio plug-in, the next steps are pretty simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write your blog post</li>
<li>Head on over to your libsyn account, and assuming that you have already uploaded your file to libsyn, copy the url for that file. </li>
<li>Input the MP3 url where it's called for within your audio player plugin of choice. </li>
<li>Save your post and/or publish.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Using The Wizzard Player</h2>
<p>Assuming that you have already uploaded your file to your libsyn account, here's what you have to do to get the Wizzard Player from <em><strong>within the Previous Post section of your libsyn account</strong></em>:</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[We've already covered how to embed your audio files onto a wordpress.com blog, and doing the same on your self-hosted site is just as easy.
Given the fact that you are now self-hosted you have more choices of what audio player to use to embed your audio onto your site.  The first step would be to choose what audio player you would like to use on your site. Since you are hosted at libsyn you have 2 choices:

A Wordpress audio player plug-in.
The Wizzard player Although initially built as a video player, it can absolutely be used for audio files

Choosing a wordpress audio player plugin
Although audio players abound, generally speaking here are the most popular WP audio player plugins:

audio player
Bluburry Powerpress Podcasting plugin
Degradable HTML5 audio and video Plugin

Each of these players offer varying degrees of configuration and personalization. Take your time checking them out, as well as seeing what kind of support they offer, so if you get in any trouble, you'll have help.
After you've chosen, installed, activated and configured your Wordpress audio plug-in, the next steps are pretty simple:

Write your blog post
Head on over to your libsyn account, and assuming that you have already uploaded your file to libsyn, copy the url for that file. 
Input the MP3 url where it's called for within your audio player plugin of choice. 
Save your post and/or publish.

Using The Wizzard Player
Assuming that you have already uploaded your file to your libsyn account, here's what you have to do to get the Wizzard Player from within the Previous Post section of your libsyn account:


1. Click on edit for the MP3 file that you would like to go into the Wizzard player.




2. Go to Destinations





3. Click on the checkbox next to Wizzard Player.





4. Publish





5. After you publish and get to the confirmation page, simply scroll down the page and find your embed code and copy it.




6. Paste that embed code onto your page/post on your self-hosted Wordpress site!

The libsyn platform isn't solely for podcasting. Yes, that's what we do, but media as we all know can be served in so many different ways, and perhaps you don't want to do just a podcast.

            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/why-host-your-audio-and-video-files-on-libsyn-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Although there are a few hosting providers that advertise unlimited hosting space and unlimited file transfer, that isn't really the case. Most general level hosting companies out there do not want you to upload mp3s on their servers. Please <a href="http://podcastanswerman.com/hosting/">take a look at this conversation</a> regarding this very issue between <a href="http://podcastanswerman.com/products/">Cliff Ravenscraft, Podcast Consultant</a> and a shared hosting provider. It makes it pretty clear. <em>NOTE: Scroll down about 3/4 of the way down the page to find the conversation.</em></p>
<p>Cliff is having a conversation specifically addressing issues that podcasters will come up against if uploading their files to their own host, but what if you don't want a podcast. What if you simply want to upload your audio or video to your host?</p>
<p>In all honesty, if you are doing this to simply to put it up on your site for your own sake and have no aspirations of growing your site in any way, then go for it.</p>
<p>If you do have dream of more people being exposed to what you produce, whether it be through the written word, audio or video, <strong>I would suggest choosing somewhere else to host your media</strong>, especially if you are passionate about what you do. If you are committed to your site be it as a hobby or as your business, if you are consistent, and are putting out great material at some point you will start to get more traction. People will share your work and your audience will grow.</p>
<p><strong>If you have been offering occasional audio or video files that you happen to host on your own hosting company this extra traction may prove to be problematic.</strong></p>
<p>At libsyn this is what we do. We are prepared for you to get famous ;) You upload your files to our system and you get unlimited bandwidth, which is to say that no matter whether one day you get 1 person downloading your media or 100,000 what you pay stays the same.</p>
<p>We are set up in such a way that we grow with you. You can start simply hosting your individual audio or video files, but if you decide to offer your audience more as time goes on, you have the option to publish a podcast, get your own mobile app, have your own Wizzard Player and have amazing stats. We even have plans that are <a href="http://www.libsynpro.com/">designed for businesses and professional producers</a>.</p>
<h2>Our Plans</h2>
<p>Here are some key things you need to know about how we work:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Our plans are based on Monthly Storage</em></strong>: Monthly Storage is the amount you can upload in any 30 day window.  For example A 250 MB account means you get a quota of 250 MB per 30 day period.  So in any 30 day period you can upload up to 250 MB of files.  Once a file is over 30 days old - it automatically moves into "Archive" - which just means it no longer counts against your upload quota. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The "Archived" file continues to download as before and the URL remains the same - nothing changes other than you have back that amount of space to upload new files into.  There is NO change in download speed for the "Archived" files.</p>
<p>With libsyn there is never a need to pull down old files because of storage issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>There are no contracts</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>You can easily change plans at any time</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With so many internet businesses popping up everywhere, and so many people choosing to become solopreneurs, <strong>libsyn is a must to have as part of your professional tool-belt in order to grow, scale and reach the largest audience possible.</strong></p>

<h2>Do People Know How To Subscribe From Your Site?</h2>
<p>I go to my podcast website all the time. I can navigate within it and it all looks pretty clear to me! But then, I put the thing together ;) I'm always surprised at what other people think of my site, or some of the questions that I get regarding content consumption <em>on my site</em>.</p>
<p>At times I get questions that in my mind are SOOOO clear&hellip;but alas, in reality, not so much.</p>
<p>During my work at libsyn, a lot of times I search for podcasts, visit podcast websites, listen to podcasts, find out what podcasts are about and I've found that I've encountered road blocks when it comes to actually <em>consuming</em> and even <em>subscribing</em> to some podcasts.</p>
<p>I find myself having to do a lot of searching to find out what podcasts are about, where the <em>real</em> podcast website is, and even where to click to consume the content, and I'm well versed in the podcast culture, so I know a lot more than the average person! I have to be absolutely honest. <strong>There are times when the podcast looks so cool but the fact that I cannot listen to it with one click or even find out more about the content to see if its what I believe it is, makes me wanna give up.</strong></p>
<p>Here are 2 inquiries for podcast creators to help you from loosing potential subscribers.</p>
<h2>Search for a podcast whose subject you've always been interested in but are not too familiar with.</h2>
<p>One way to check yourself to see if you are providing the very best support for potential listeners is for you to do some podcast browsing yourself, specifically on something that you are totally unfamiliar with.</p>
<p>There has to be some subject that you've been intrigued about, that you've always wanted to know more about. I'm sure there&rsquo;s a podcast about it!</p>
<p><strong>Follow these steps and take notes :)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Search for whatever topic you are interested in, in the iTunes Music Store</em></strong>. Once you get your results pick a couple of podcasts and go to their respective pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Go to the podcast website straight from iTunes</em></strong>. Where does iTunes take you? What are your initial thoughts about what you find? If you find a link that doesn&rsquo;t work or you land on a libsyn blog that is obviously NOT their main site, what does it take for you to <em>get</em> to their main site? Are you willing/interested to do it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Once on the podcast website find out what the podcast is specifically about</em></strong>. Is there an about page, a succinct quick explanation of what to expect when you consume the podcast? How easy is it to find this information?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Listen or view the podcast from the podcast page</em></strong>. Can you do this easily? Are there different and clear ways offered to consume the content (ie: direct download link, player, subscribe button)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Subscribe</em></strong>. How easy is it for you to subscribe in the easiest way for you? Is there a way to do it via iTunes? RSS reader? Newsletter? Go through the process in the name of research and investigation. You can unsubscribe right after (or not.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Evaluate your own podcast website</em></strong>. Use your notes and the insight that you gained from your investigative work to optimize your own page. Can you easily find what your podcast is about? Easily play the content? Easily subscribe?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Find yourself a podcast newbie and have them subscribe from your site.</h2>
<p>This little podcaster inquiry will work best if you get someone who is NOT holistically techsavvy but your average Social Media Facebook/Twitter everyday consumer.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have your subscriber guinea pig go to iTunes and follow steps 1-4 above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they cannot get to your website from iTunes have them google your site (maybe they don&rsquo;t even have or want to use iTunes&hellip;you never know!) Give them the name of your podcast, not the url of your site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have them give you their observations of the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank them profusely for their insight :)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why start these inquiries off in iTunes?</h3>
<p>Well, you see, iTunes is a given at this moment in the podcasting world and as such it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>Of course if someone wanted to subscribe or even preview your content they can do it straight from iTunes. They do not have to go through the whole process. <strong>The process is for you to learn about the efficiency and effectiveness of the information you provide.</strong> Don&rsquo;t assume everyone knows how to subscribe to your podcast or what it even is. Let them know.</p>
<p>So what did you find out? <em>Is what you are doing effective in getting new subscribers/fans?</em></p>
<p>Are there any insights that you learned from going through the process above? Are there any other tips you can share with fellow podcasters that you use to make the process of subscription, or even simply content consumption easy for your audience?</p>
<p>It would be so great to hear some of your insight! Leave a comment below :)</p>

			<title>Android Market Gets a Web Based Makeover!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/android-market-gets-a-web-based-makeover-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Google unveiled a new web based version of the <a title="Android Market" href="http://market.android.com/" target="_self">Android Marketplace</a> with some super cool features. &nbsp;Previously there was no easy way to link to Android applications on the web. &nbsp;You could go to a number of third party Android App directories, but the only way to officially enter the store was on your Android device. &nbsp;Well google has rectified that, and then some. &nbsp;With the new Android Market, users can visit the store with their web browser, click to buy apps and those apps will automatically be delivered to their Android Device. &nbsp;This happens seamlessly and more importantly... wirelessly. &nbsp;There is no syncing involved, and it makes the whole process of getting apps effortless. &nbsp;CNET has some video coverage on it that you might want to <a title="Android Market on CNET" href="http://cnettv.cnet.com/google-android-market/9742-1_53-50099698.html?tag=api" target="_self">check out</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for you producers with Android Apps, be sure and update your links and descriptions around the web with your new Android Market Web URL. &nbsp;Getting it is easy, just visit the <a title="Android Market" href="http://market.android.com/" target="_self">Android Market</a>. &nbsp;Search for your App. &nbsp;Click on it, copy the resulting page <a title="WTF with Marc Maron" href="http://market.android.com/details?id=tv.wizzard.android.wtfpod748" target="_self">URL</a> and put it everywhere. &nbsp;You can even tweet the location of your App right from your Android Market page. &nbsp;QR Codes Too! &nbsp;And of course don't be shy to ask your fans to review your app. &nbsp;</p>

			<title>Podcast Clean-Up Series: The Accessible iTunes Podcast Page</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/podcast-clean-up-series-the-accessible-i-tunes-podcast-page-1]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/ITunes_Logo.png" border="0" alt="150" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>When was the last time that you checked out your own podcast landing page in iTunes?</p>
<p>It may seem a bit basic and even perhaps a waste of time, but in all honesty it's a very important space that podcasters often overlook. I may venture to say that for the majority of your potential raving fans this is the first and only impression that they will get. There will be no second chances.</p>
<p>Why not take a moment right now to make sure you are making the best first impression?</p>
<h2>Here are key points to make sure folks click that subscribe button:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Have a podcast description</strong>: Did I really need to get this basic? YES. Because of my duties here at libsyn I visit a large amount of iTunes podcast pages and there are a surprising amount of podcasters that have no description at all!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make your description clear, succinct and informative</strong>: What exactly is your podcast about? Describe it in two sentences and have these be the first paragraph in the description. Most people don't scroll <em>below the fold</em>, meaning that they usually won't click <em>...more</em> on the page. If you make those first two sentences clear, precise and appealing anything you write <em>below the fold</em> will just be icing on the cake. Write those two sentences for those that are already familiar with you content <em>as well as those that are not.</em> Keep the jargon and inside jokes to the latter half of your podcast description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link back to your main website!</strong>: In your iTunes page, on the left hand side column there is a link to your website. 50% of the time when I've clicked on the link to the podcasters website, I either go to a broken link or to the libsyn.com blog page that is part of your libsyn account. Now, there's nothing wrong with your libsyn blog. In fact a lot of podcasters do use that as their website. What I'm talking about here is for those of you that have spent time creating an awesome website for your podcast, but no one from iTunes goes there because you are not linking to it! Tip for libsyn users- you can edit this information within your <em>edit show settings</em> pane in your account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add easy feedback accessibility to your description</strong>: Somewhere within your iTunes description, usually towards the end, add the easiest way to get in contact with you: email address, voice feedback line, and your url. Although this information will not be clickable it will provide your existing audience as well as potential listeners a seamless way to get in touch with you. There are a ton of podcast listeners that never go to your website and perhaps never will. When they want quick access to you, the first place they will go will be to your page in iTunes. I know this has been true for me and have always been so glad when I find the podcaster email address right in the description to send along that feedback :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although simple podcasting tips, you'd be surprised how much they really do help both existing and potential subscribers.</p>
<p>There are other ways to subscribe to podcasts, but the reality of the situation is that iTunes is the easiest and most accessible way to subscribe to podcasts, especially for those that are not particularly tech savvy.</p>
<p>Why not provide them with the best experience of you and your work?</p>
<p>Do you have any other hints and tips that you can offer to other podcasters regarding the iTunes landing page? Is there other information that you feel is helpful to promote your podcast? Leave it in the comments!</p>

<p>As the new year rolls in, we often take inventory of our lives, perhaps even decide to expand our horizons. Podcasting provides an opportunity to learn and deepen the understanding of the world around us in a really simple and cost effective way. You can immerse yourself in a topic so completely, it feels like you've gone back to the university :) Here are a few podcasts to get you going with your Podcast Art and Science degree ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=73329808">Podictionary</a>- <a href="http://podictionary.com/">the podcast for word lovers</a></strong>- Short and sweet and totally easy to consume. I always love learning the history behind words and adding more to my vocabulary. If you don't want to subscribe you can get the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podictionary-etymology-word/id333261090?mt=8">iphone app</a> and have a ton of words at your disposal. Great reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/brain-science-podcast/id210065679">Brain Science</a></strong>- <em>"Recent discoveries in neuroscience are unraveling the mysteries of how our brain makes us who we are."</em> I already subscribe to so many podcasts, to the outsider it would seem a bit obsessive. I've been trying to stop my <em>subscribe</em> tendencies, but I just couldn't help it when it came to Brain Science. The quality of information offered, the depth on insight and simply the subject matter is the perfect podcast for revving up your brain for optimal functioning ;) You also get the opportunity to see the world and yourself in a whole new way. Give your brain a workout. Dr. Campbell offers very detailed shownotes, so if you don't want to listen or subscribe at first, hop on over <a href="http://www.brainsciencepodcast.com/">to the site</a>, or even subscribe to the blog RSS feed and get your learning that way. If that's not enough Brain Science also has an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/brain-science-podcast-app/id336200391?mt=8">iPhone</a> AND and <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/brain-science-app/tv.wizzard.android.brainsciencepodcast35">Android app</a> with access to the full shownotes as PDFs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=210064273">Books and Ideas</a></strong>- This is another one by my new favorite person Dr. Ginger Campbell. It's sort of the spill over from her Brain Science podcast, "exploring history, philosophy, other areas of science, science fiction, monthly interview with an interesting person." If a podcast all about the science of the brain is not your cup of tea but you wanna delve into the world of science in an accessible way, <a href="http://virginiacampbellmd.squarespace.com/episodes/">check this one out</a>. You won't regret it. The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/books-and-ideas-podcast-app/id336205596?mt=8">iPhone app</a> offers detailed shownotes via PDF! Love it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/microbeworld-video-audio-only/id380497776?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Microbeworld Radio</a></strong>-  "An educational outreach initiative that revolved around a daily, 90-second radio and podcast series designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the vital role microbes play on our planet and to promote the science of microbiology." Yes, this is a podcast all about the teeniest of the tiny. Who knew how magical it could be to delve into the micro? The more you get into the micro the more you see it in the macro. You must first start at the <a href="http://www.microbeworld.org/">Microbeworld website</a>. It's jammed packed with info. You'll see there that Microbeworld Radio is not just one podcast, but a lot of them: BacterioFiles, Meet the Scientist, Mundo de los microbios, This week in Parasitism, This Week in Virology and more. You can subscribe individually to each one of these shows, or you can simply get the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id337731458?mt=8">iPhone app</a> and have them all at once. Nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/photography-101/id183589475">Photography 101</a></strong>- Having an iPhone 4 has made me be a picture taking maniac. This podcast is a great way to learn a little bit more about all aspects of photography. There are <a href="http://photooneoone.blogspot.com/">tons of episodes available</a> that address the simple to the complex. One of the latest podcasts has nothing to do with digital photography but with a really cool technique for polaroid pictures called polaroid SX-70 manipulation. It's very cool. Now if I could just get my hand on a polaroid camera...Photography101 is also available for the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photography-101/id353791437?mt=8">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/photography-101/tv.wizzard.android.photography101577">Android</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/philosophy-bites/id257042117">Philosophy Bites</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/philosophy-the-classics/id254465298">Philosophy The Classics</a></strong>- I put these together, not because they have to be listened to together, nor because they are alike, but because they complement one another. Get into the conversation with <a href="http://www.philosophybites.com/">Philosophy Bites</a>. Listen to discourse and in depth interviews with awesome philosophers. You get an opportunity to become informed about an array of books that perhaps you have never heard of, plus be exposed to aspects of philosophy you may not get a chance to anywhere else! <a href="http://www.virtualphilosopher.com/">Philosophy The Classics</a> is just that, The Classics. It is Nigel Warburton reading off his book of the same name. A really great resource to have. iPhone apps are available for both <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/philosophy-bites-bite-sized/id373797885?mt=8">Philosophy Bites</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id381799108?mt=8">Philosophy The Classics</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-iwoodwork-podcast/id284913696">iWoodwork</a></strong>- When was the last time that you did anything with your hands? I suppose getting started woodworking may be a bit far fetched, especially if you've never done anything like it, (plus you do need all the tools and everything), but I simply could not pass up the opportunity to share this podcast. Mark Sterner is such a great guy, down to earth, humble, knowledgeable and passionate about what he does. He cares deeply about his work and loves his community. <a href="http://www.iwoodwork.net/">His video podcast</a> is very well done and thought out. He's supported by the <a href="http://marcadams.com/">Mark Adams School of Woodworking</a>, having them as a sponsor and also helping them with their online woodworking presence. Check out iWoodwork even if you don't woodwork, it'll get your creativity going. If you <em>do</em> woodwork, this is a must for you! iWoodwork is also available as an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iwoodwork-podcast-app/id390443523?mt=8">iPhone app</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-barefoot-beekeeper/id354105540">The Barefoot Beekeeper</a></strong>- I'm sure at some point you have heard all about the slow disappearance of bees and the huge impact that they have to our ecosystem. <a href="http://biobees.libsyn.com/">This podcast</a> offers so much information about beekeeping, the bee ecosystem, as well as the world ecosystem. You get an opportunity to listen to interviews with an swarm of experts within and without the beekeeping culture, plus <a href="http://www.biobees.com/">learn tips and tricks</a> about building and keeping your own beehives! The passion for beekeeping also stumbles over onto an iPhone app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/biobees-the-barefoot-beekeper/id383955937?mt=8">Biobees</a> :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope learning a bit about some of these podcasts inspires you to learn something new and subscribe, or at minimum pop on over to iTunes and search for a subject you've been interested about for a long time and haven't ever followed through :) Podcasting is the ultimate choice of taking your education and growth into your own hands, offered to you by those that are truly passionate about what they know.</p>
<p>Learn, grow and expand for 2011!</p>
<p>How about sharing some of your favorite podcasts that helped you learn something new? Share them below!</p>

If a podcast all about the science of the brain is not your cup of tea but you wanna delve into the world of science in an accessible way, check this one out. You won't regret it. The iPhone app offers detailed shownotes via PDF! Love it.


Microbeworld Radio-  "An educational outreach initiative that revolved around a daily, 90-second radio and podcast series designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the vital role microbes play on our planet and to promote the science of microbiology." Yes, this is a podcast all about the teeniest of the tiny. Who knew how magical it could be to delve into the micro? The more you get into the micro the more you see it in the macro. You must first start at the Microbeworld website. It's jammed packed with info. You'll see there that Microbeworld Radio is not just one podcast, but a lot of them: BacterioFiles, Meet the Scientist, Mundo de los microbios, This week in Parasitism, This Week in Virology and more. You can subscribe individually to each one of these shows, or you can simply get the iPhone app and have them all at once. Nice.


Photography 101- Having an iPhone 4 has made me be a picture taking maniac. This podcast is a great way to learn a little bit more about all aspects of photography. There are tons of episodes available that address the simple to the complex. One of the latest podcasts has nothing to do with digital photography but with a really cool technique for polaroid pictures called polaroid SX-70 manipulation. It's very cool. Now if I could just get my hand on a polaroid camera...Photography101 is also available for the iPhone and Android.


Philosophy Bites and Philosophy The Classics- I put these together, not because they have to be listened to together, nor because they are alike, but because they complement one another. Get into the conversation with Philosophy Bites. Listen to discourse and in depth interviews with awesome philosophers. You get an opportunity to become informed about an array of books that perhaps you have never heard of, plus be exposed to aspects of philosophy you may not get a chance to anywhere else! Philosophy The Classics is just that, The Classics. It is Nigel Warburton reading off his book of the same name. A really great resource to have. iPhone apps are available for both Philosophy Bites and Philosophy The Classics


iWoodwork- When was the last time that you did anything with your hands? I suppose getting started woodworking may be a bit far fetched, especially if you've never done anything like it, (plus you do need all the tools and everything), but I simply could not pass up the opportunity to share this podcast. Mark Sterner is such a great guy, down to earth, humble, knowledgeable and passionate about what he does. He cares deeply about his work and loves his community. His video podcast is very well done and thought out. He's supported by the Mark Adams School of Woodworking, having them as a sponsor and also helping them with their online woodworking presence. Check out iWoodwork even if you don't woodwork, it'll get your creativity going. If you do woodwork, this is a must for you! iWoodwork is also available as an iPhone app.


The Barefoot Beekeeper- I'm sure at some point you have heard all about the slow disappearance of bees and the huge impact that they have to our ecosystem. This podcast offers so much information about beekeeping, the bee ecosystem, as well as the world ecosystem. You get an opportunity to listen to interviews with an swarm of experts within and without the beekeeping culture, plus learn tips and tricks about building and keeping your own beehives! The passion for beekeeping also stumbles over onto an iPhone app called Biobees :)


I hope learning a bit about some of these podcasts inspires you to learn something new and subscribe, or at minimum pop on over to iTunes and search for a subject you've been interested about for a long time and haven't ever followed through :) Podcasting is the ultimate choice of taking your education and growth into your own hands, offered to you by those that are truly passionate about what they know.
Learn, grow and expand for 2011!
How about sharing some of your favorite podcasts that helped you learn something new? Share them below!

			<title>Review of WPmob Lite: A Mobile Theme For Wordpress </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/mini-review-of-w-pmob-lite-a-mobile-theme-for-wordpress-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpmob-lite/screenshot-1.jpg?r=332102" alt="WPmob Lite screenshot" width="179" height="334" align="right" />Optimizing your website for mobile browsing has become very important in the world of podcasting, especially with all the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/features/tablets-at-ces-2011/">new tablets</a> and <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/2011-the-year-of-the-super-phone-2799210/">Super Phones</a>. If you are using Wordpress, your choices for mobile themes have been pretty scarse. The one most folks are using now days has been <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch/">WPtouch</a>.</p>
<p>There's a new WP mobile plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpmob-lite/">WPmob Lite</a> that has come into my radar. I decided to check it out. Here are some of it's features intermingled with some of my initial thoughts:</p>
<h2>Good stuff- Customization and Readability</h2>
<p>The strength of the plugin comes from it's ability to be customized and the clean and fast loading mobile site that it provides.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can customize it by putting your logo and a banner on the mobile site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems that potentially there may be more mobile themes to choose from. At the moment there is one called Poseidon, which you can also customize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can customize social media icons which are displayed at the bottom of your main blog page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can override your WP landing page to a specific one on the mobile site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom HTML for <em>Welcome message shown on 1st visit, Custom 404 message, Custom footer content.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can choose your first time visitors to land in your full site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have Switch Link and Custom CSS (not elaborating on this 'cause I have no idea what this does.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can customize Prowl push notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My favorite aspect is that <strong>you can choose specific pages where the mobile theme is not used.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I adore the way you can easily play my episodes with my WP audio player of choice the <a href="http://soukie.net/degradable-html5-audio-and-video-plugin/">degradable HTML5 audio and video player.</a></strong> It renders really well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading the site is clear and easy. The text formatting of the posts looks great, at least from my iPhone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The site loads relatively fast. I happen to have tons of pictures in every one of my podcast shownotes, and even then it did a pretty good job.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not so good stuff- Advertising and Lack of Theme Support</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm using Thesis, and it's not compatible with this plugin. All you have to do is uncheck a setting where it says "Include functions.php from the active desktop theme." If you have that checked the mobile site will not work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The navigation dropdown shows pages I do not want shown. This is due to the fact that I'm using Thesis. I've customized my navigation bar on my site, but because it can't use Thesis, then the pages that are shown in the mobile version are not ones that I have even displayed on my site anymore.</p>
<p>I suppose this will require me to go into my WP settings and take care of that manually there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Random AdMob adds on site. Big FAIL.</strong> As far as I could see within the plugin setting, there was no way to turn off these ads. I don't know how they are even getting on there as I have no advertising on my site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some links on the navigation do not go to where they should go. It's like they get stuck on a prior page/link. This may be a bug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's insane to get the proper sizes for the banner and logo. I'm not a web designer, nor graphic designer. I have very limited knowledge of creating graphics. It took me FOREVER to create a banner and logo that would fit and look relatively ok on the mobile site. I had to do a lot of random tweaking. I found no support for this on the developer's website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FYI, these are the sizes I ended up using: logo 300 x 50, banner 320 x 200.</p>
<ul>
<li>Large pictures and videos look gigantic. They are not scaled for the mobile viewing at all. The only pictures that looked great were all my thumbnail images. Perhaps that is something I have control over either within the plugin or on WP, but I had no idea how to do it. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>The potential for <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpmob-lite/">WPmob Lite</a> is great. I do love the customization, but the ease of set-up of this customization for one that is not well versed on web design/graphics is not  the easiest.</p>
<p>Reading and listening to my episodes on the mobile site was great, but I don't like the gigantic pictures and videos it renders which makes browsing less than stellar.</p>
<p>Two points helped me make the decision to <em>not</em> to use this plugin: <em>the random Admob advertising and the lack of Thesis support</em>. I don't want the ads and I want the folks visiting my mobile site to have access to the navigation that I have chosen on my main site.</p>
<p>If you are using WPmob Lite I would love your thoughts about the plugin. Are any of you using a different WP mobile plugin that you want to share! I'm still shopping for the perfect one ;)</p>
<p>Leave your thoughts!</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I was interviewed for podcast. Of course I linked to it in one of my blog posts as well as my own podcast show notes. About a year or so later I received an email from one of my podcast listeners informing me that a link on my site was going to a porn site!</p>
<p><strong>*Gulp*</strong></p>
<p>I quickly went back to the post she mentioned and realized that the podcast had podfaded. He had let go of the url, and the url was now a porn site! I had linked to that url at least 5 times on my site.</p>
<p>That was when I began to make checking my links of great importance.</p>
<p>Websites, blogs, podcasts, media links come and go. As I initially browsed through my blogroll I realized that almost half of what I was linking to was no longer in existence. This made me have to get really clear about cleaning up my all my links.</p>
<h2>Here&rsquo;s a little check list to help you keep your links all nice and clean :)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Your Sidebar/Blogroll</strong>&ndash; Literally go down your sidebar and click onto everything that you have on the entire column. Make sure that you are sending people where you want them to go. Remove or update any dead links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Six Months of Links</strong>&ndash; Go back to your last six months worth of posts and browse through to make sure that links that you used or referred to are actually working and in existence. Update as necessary to keep at minimum your latest post linking efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Videos</strong>&ndash; Videos are removed all the time. Having their code on your site slows down the loading of the post, plus irritates those that want to watch the now defunct video. Save them the hassle by removing the code or take the time to check to see if the video is available from a different video sharing service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Links</strong>&ndash; When I first started blogging and podcasting I often linked back to images and graphics on other people&rsquo;s websites. I had no idea about proper protocol. I'm still finding missing graphics and pictures on my older posts. Take the time to browse through your posts to make sure your images are all properly displaying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links to time sensitive material</strong>&ndash; Think about all the times that you promoted or shared links to events or event sites/pages that were time sensitive ie. podcamp boston 2008 sessions, macworld podcast meet-up 2007, PNME 2007 schedule, etc. Go back and un-link your references if they lead to a dead page. You can always do a quick-update and either link to a larger website with consistent relevant information, such as the main <a href="http://podcamp.pbworks.com/w/page/17344268/FrontPage">Podcamp</a> site or write a one sentence update about the event mentioned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On your site, the areas that have the largest amount of dead links are on your oldest posts. Going back through all your posts, especially if you've been podcasting for a long time is a tedious job. Consider setting aside some time monthly to take care of it yourself, or perhaps invest on a little help from those places like <a href="http://www.fiverr.com/">fiverr</a> :)</p>
<p>I hope you have found these tips helpful!</p>
<p>Do you have any good tips, workflow or even plug-ins/software that could make checking dead links on your site easier? Share them! I'm always up for making my life easier :D I'm sure other folks would love to hear about them!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that has been incredibly helpful not only in promoting my blog and helpful for finding new things to blog about has been Twitter. &nbsp;Do you have a twitter account for your podcast?&nbsp;</p>
<p>New to Twitter? Check out this video from Common Craft <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddO9idmax0o" target="_blank">here</a>. &nbsp;A really nice simple overview of Twitter.</p>
<p>The Craft blog had a great post before Christmas - "<a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/archive/2010/12/crafting_your_online_presence_1.html" target="_blank">Crafting Your Online Presence: Twitter Tools</a>" - while this post is written with a crafty audience in mind, I think the info here is still very useful to podcasters too. &nbsp;Diane Gilleland, who produces <strong><a href="http://www.craftypod.com/" target="_blank">CraftyPod</a></strong> - a blog and podcast about making things, has put together a great list of tools to help you do more with Twitter.</p>
<p>My favorite from her list is <a title="hootsuite" href="http://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">HootSuite </a>and I am excited to check out <a href="http://twitalyzer.com/" target="_blank">Twitalyzer</a>. &nbsp;</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[One of the things that has been incredibly helpful not only in promoting my blog and helpful for finding new things to blog about has been Twitter. &nbsp;Do you have a twitter account for your podcast?&nbsp;
New to Twitter? Check out this video from Common Craft here. &nbsp;A really nice simple overview of Twitter.
The Craft blog had a great post before Christmas - "Crafting Your Online Presence: Twitter Tools" - while this post is written with a crafty audience in mind, I think the info here is still very useful to podcasters too. &nbsp;Diane Gilleland, who produces CraftyPod - a blog and podcast about making things, has put together a great list of tools to help you do more with Twitter.
My favorite from her list is HootSuite and I am excited to check out Twitalyzer. &nbsp;
What are your favorite Twitter tools? And just a reminder - you can follow Libsyn on Twitter too -&nbsp;http://twitter.com/libsyn

			<title>Podcast Podcasting Starter Kit For Absolute Newbies</title>

<p>You've been hearing about it for a while and you're finally up for jumping in. <strong>Where do you begin if you want to podcast?</strong> Especially if you are not too familiar with what exactly podcasting really is.</p>
<p>In order to offer the best advice I decided to put on my newbie hat and start where I would have, had I no knowledge of the subject: googling &ldquo;how to podcast.&rdquo; I believe that I did this exact same thing when I decided I wanted to podcast, although at that time, there weren&rsquo;t so many results!</p>
<p>I got a headache just skimming through all the information that came up. Holy cow!</p>
<p>I gotta say that if I would have found what I found today, I would have given up. It would take so long to sift through all the sites out there that are simply focusing on keywords, making money on adwords and those that <em>actually have</em> helpful easy to digest information that will in fact help you start podcasting.</p>
<p>So, I decided to make it as simple as possible and give you a place to start and avoid the pain of sifting through all the clutter.</p>
<p>If you are serious about podcasting and want to do it either for your own personal self expression or as a business move, your first step is to <strong>listen</strong>.</p>
<p>Part of learning anything is aligning yourself with those that are doing it, and doing it well. Podcasting is about giving voice, personal expression and freedom. All of these are nothing if not fueled by passion- passion for your work, your relationship, your hobby, or whatever has meaning to you. What better way to attune yourself to those that can lead the way than to listen to their voices?</p>
<p><strong>The following are specific episodes from podcasts about podcasting whose subject matter will both provide information and inspiration about podcasting.</strong> I'll provide download links for each episode as well as the specific podcast website and iTunes podcast page.</p>
<p>After listening to these podcasts I hope that you gather optimal information and support to embark on your journey as a podcaster. Consider downloading the files and making yourself a little podcast starter kit playlist to get you all fired up!</p>

			<title>The Season of Giving: Give Back To The Podcasts Your Love!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/the-season-of-giving-give-back-to-the-podcasts-your-love-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Podcasting really changed my life.</p>
<p>Encountering the voices of incredible people sharing passionately about themselves and what they love, gave me the strength <a href="http://elsiesyogakula.com">to do it myself</a> :) Thus, I've made it a priority every year to give a little something back to my favorite podcasters.</p>
<p>Last year a had a teeny bit more time on my hands and I was able to send my favorite podcasters a special recording of an immune system meditation that I felt would be helpful, if anything to help folks fall asleep ;) This year since I'm kinda pressed for time, I've chosen my 10 favorite podcasts and am in the process of gifting them with what they love the most!</p>
<h1>The Best Way To Support Your Favorite Podcasters</h1>
<p>I've decided to do two a day: one in the morning, and one in the evening. My total investment of time, 10 min! If you would like to gift your favorite podcast/podcaster try offering these absolutely free gifts!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leave an iTunes review for their podcast or their podcast app</strong>&ndash; There is some sort of magical algorithm in iTunes that gives podcasts better accessibility when there is action on their podcast page. If you don&rsquo;t have time to review, simply rate it.</li>
<li><strong>Say Thank-You</strong>&ndash; It&rsquo;s amazing how far a little gratitude goes. Tweet it, FB it, comment on their blog or send an private email. The power of thank you does wonders for the soul :D</li>
<li><strong>Share the love</strong>&ndash; Even though those of you reading this may already be in the know of how AWESOME podcasts are, there are still an incredible amount of people that don&rsquo;t. Let them know about it. I send people to specific podcasts almost daily if you can believe that! You can do it any way that floats your boat: tell someone individually, write a blog post about it, or simply do a little share on a social network. Here&rsquo;s post I wrote for one of <a href="http://www.yogeek.me/blog/2009/9/18/extended-follow-friday-for-september-18-2009-victorcajiao-ff.html">my most favorite podcasters in the world</a> :)</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the season of giving. As a listener give back!</p>
<p>Do you have any other sweet ways you've shown the love for your favorite podcaster? Share it!</p>
<p>BONUS Gift: If they do happen to have a podcast app. Buy it! I bought my first podcast app when I didn&rsquo;t even have an iPhone ;)</p>]]></description>

I've decided to do two a day: one in the morning, and one in the evening. My total investment of time, 10 min! If you would like to gift your favorite podcast/podcaster try offering these absolutely free gifts!

Leave an iTunes review for their podcast or their podcast app&ndash; There is some sort of magical algorithm in iTunes that gives podcasts better accessibility when there is action on their podcast page. If you don&rsquo;t have time to review, simply rate it.
Say Thank-You&ndash; It&rsquo;s amazing how far a little gratitude goes. Tweet it, FB it, comment on their blog or send an private email. The power of thank you does wonders for the soul :D
Share the love&ndash; Even though those of you reading this may already be in the know of how AWESOME podcasts are, there are still an incredible amount of people that don&rsquo;t. Let them know about it. I send people to specific podcasts almost daily if you can believe that! You can do it any way that floats your boat: tell someone individually, write a blog post about it, or simply do a little share on a social network. Here&rsquo;s post I wrote for one of my most favorite podcasters in the world :)

So that&rsquo;s it.
It&rsquo;s the season of giving. As a listener give back!
Do you have any other sweet ways you've shown the love for your favorite podcaster? Share it!
BONUS Gift: If they do happen to have a podcast app. Buy it! I bought my first podcast app when I didn&rsquo;t even have an iPhone ;)]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Promote Your App and Take Advantage of the Holiday Rush</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/promote-your-app-and-take-advantage-of-the-holiday-rush]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The rush is coming, it's the most wonderful time for podcasters. &nbsp;Downloads are usually up across the board come January, and I think its safe to say this season app hungry devices will be under a lot of trees. &nbsp;So if you have an app with us, here are some great ways to put a little fuel on that yule log. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;<strong>Promote Your App as an iTunes present</strong> - in the iTunes store you have the ability to "gift" apps. &nbsp;Tell your fans to give the gift that keeps on giving: your app! &nbsp;It's an inexpensive but thoughtful gift for your iOS loving friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;<strong>New On Android? &nbsp;Let the world know!</strong> &nbsp;- If you have recently released an app in the Android marketplace and haven't talked about it on your podcast, you are missing out. &nbsp;The Android platform is growing like crazy, make sure your audience knows that your app isn't limited to Apple's world any more. &nbsp;If you'd like to sign up for an Android App for your show, <a title="Sign Up For an Android" href="http://wizzard.tv/androidapprequest.php" target="_self">click here</a>.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;<strong>Put Shares and Stars on your Wish List</strong> - You've been a good podcaster, remind your audience that if they like your app, the least they can do is leave a good star rating for you, and tell their friends about your app. &nbsp;That's two little things that go a long way to help your sales. &nbsp;And you deserve it!</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;<strong>Clickable Makes it Easy</strong> - Make sure you have put a banner, or at the very least a link in an obvious place on your web pages, blog entries, tweets, etc., so it is very easy for your audience to find your app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <strong>&nbsp;Add Value</strong> - Change your app background to a holiday theme, add a blooper real, or a special holiday podcast message from you in your episode extras. &nbsp;It's a way to reward your app supporters, and entice new customers. &nbsp;Here's a detailed tutorial on <a title="Changing Your App Background" href="http://imake.libsyn.com/tutorial_adding_episode_background" target="_self">changing your app background</a>. &nbsp;For episode extra ideas for your iOS or Android app, <a title="Extra Ideas" href="http://imake.libsyn.com/39-totally-creative-ideas-to-add-instant-value-to-your-podcast-add-i-phone-app-bonus-content" target="_self">click here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope that you find these hints a simple way to take advantage of the rush of opportunities coming your way. &nbsp;Best wishes to you all, have a fantastic New Year! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I decided to put this little post together not entirely from a selfless point of view. Full disclosure: I am a podcaster and I would LOVE to get any of these for Christmas :)</p>
<p>Which is why I'm sharing them with you, not only for my own selfish little reasons (perhaps some of my family members might <em>stumble</em> upon this post), but I assume that these little gifts might make another podcaster out there kinda jolly :D</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR-288W-Microphone-black/dp/B00006HO3R"><strong>Audio-Technica ATR 288W Remote Mic</strong></a>: I've been wanting a wireless mic for quite a long time. I heard about this one from a <a href="http://www.podfeet.com/wordpress/2010/11/28/288-yum-4-blu-ray-burning-audio-technica-remote-mic-apple-certification/">review</a> on <a href="http://podfeet.com">The Nosillacast</a>. It seems like a pretty good wireless mic, plus it&rsquo;s not exorbitantly expensive.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.contentrulesbook.com/"><strong>Content Rules</strong></a> <em>by CC Chapman and Ann Handley</em>: Authentic. Compelling. Remarkable. Interesting. (Gripping, even.) Valuable. That&rsquo;s the kind of content this book inspires you to create. Now, who wouldn&rsquo;t want that?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/plans"><strong>Dropbox Pro 50 Account</strong></a>: I'd be so stoked to get this! With Dropbox&rsquo;s functionality and the incredible amount of services currently supporting Dropbox integration, this service would make any content producer jingle their bells! If you don&rsquo;t know about Dropbox already, you should check it out. They have a pretty awesome free plan.</li>
<li><a href="http://joby.com/gorillamobile"><strong>Gorillamobile</strong></a>: This little tripod can come in handy when you are suddenly inspired to create a video podcast! Your mobile phone will be well supported and you can attach this puppy to almost anything :)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Body-Sport-Fitness-Ball-cm/dp/B000OY4AS0"><strong>Fitness Ball</strong></a>: Leo Laporte uses one of these, so why wouldn&rsquo;t you ;) All kidding aside, this is one of the best ways to keep your back and abs relatively strong throughout your day seated in front of your computer. This ball is not the cure for a flabby belly, but it can provide basic support and engagement for your core muscles so that you can continue to produce to your heart&rsquo;s desire</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that you enjoyed browsing through these!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping Santa brings you all that you desire and much more! May your families and loved ones be healthy and happy, and may you continue to enjoy producing work that keeps you happy and inspires those around you!</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

			<title>Tech Pulse Action Alert - Best Buy</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/tech-pulse-action-alert-best-buy]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I think the layout of a store speaks a great deal about a company's strategy. &nbsp;It's definitely a <a title="Panera Bread Pulse" href="http://imake.libsyn.com/tech_pulse_action_alert_panera_bread" target="_self">barometer</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Haven't been to Best Buy's stores in a good while. &nbsp;I was there the other day to pick up the Michael Jackson Experience and wow have they changed the floor plan. &nbsp;It's obvious, like Apple, they hire the best of the best to analyze and improve upon the layout and people flow of their monster stores. &nbsp;Here are my take aways. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Gone are the cattle herding checkout lanes, once lined with shiny impulse buy items like batteries, candy, water, red bull and discounted video games. &nbsp;Well they are not completely gone, but toned down to a civilized level. &nbsp;I feel less like a cud chewer.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;The new floor plan has that free-flowing rapture of the deep thing popularized in department stores, where you keep losing track of which way is up. &nbsp;This intentional disorientation leads to those <a title="As The World Falls Down" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VppuD1St8Ec&amp;feature=related" target="_self">As the world falls Down</a> feelings... You know what I mean Labyrinth fans. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Motion Control systems like the Xbox Kinect and Playstation Move both have big faux living room demo setups, but they are relegated to one of the far back walls. &nbsp;This seems less than ideal for customer impact. &nbsp;Perhaps Best Buy believes these will sell themselves based on consumer anticipation, &nbsp;but it still seems odd when the Kinect is topping so many of the analyst's Christmas top seller lists. &nbsp;Video Games aren't quite getting the VIP treatment this year it seems. &nbsp;Although Wii pack-in systems were placed in a strange island near the entrance of the store almost acting as a visual barrier to make the reveal of the new store layout more grandiose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Three new islands dramatically angled against the store walls yet parallel to each other are prominently featured in the center of the store. &nbsp;These are the main attractions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- The first island is iPhone 4 dominated along with other Android devices&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The second island is mostly Samsung Galaxy Tabs (all running Angry Birds) and a couple Google TV powered Sony Flatscreens&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Third island is not quite as focused, with some other Android tablets, and e readers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No iPads were found on these islands, however in very close proximity to the Tablet/Google TV island was an iPad kiosk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what's this have to do with you guys, the Podcasters, the New Media Movers and Shakers? &nbsp;Best Buy is betting that a big ol' consumer shift thing is reaching its tipping point this season and they are all in to make the most of it. &nbsp;Best Buy is in the business of entertainment goods and services. &nbsp;To them the new era of entertainment is all about the phones that barely get used as a phones, the tablet as the next big computer form factor, &nbsp;and TVs that stream content from the internet. &nbsp;Best Buy's CEO is conservative in his&nbsp;<a title="iPad statement was exaggerated" href="http://www.themoneytimes.com/featured/20100917/best-buy&rsquo;s-ceo-says-his-ipad-statement-was-exaggerated-id-10128801.html" target="_self">statements publicly</a>, but I think the actions are speaking loudly here. &nbsp;This is a mean product threesome that all get their power of attraction thanks to the wealth of content on the internet. &nbsp;This puts podcasters dead center in the eye of the storm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>...Also, they seem to be leaning on&nbsp;<a title="Angry Birds" href="http://shop.angrybirds.com/" target="_self">Angry Birds</a>&nbsp;to move units and QR Codes on the walls for geek cred...</p>
<p>But it seems like we've got ourselves a sea change a happenin', at least at Best Buy in Pittsburgh. &nbsp;So Surf's Up Podcasters!.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/what-s-the-story-behind-your-podcast-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was flipping through the blogs I like to follow about social media and noticed a bunch of posts about the idea of&nbsp;<strong>story </strong>- your story, the story behind your business or your blog. &nbsp;A few careers ago I worked on political campaigns. &nbsp;I was new to campaigns and was sent off to a campaign training in atlanta. &nbsp;I arrived at a conference center and we spent the entire first day telling and refining our stories of how we got involved in the campaign. &nbsp;A big part of campaigning is connecting with people around a cause or an issue. &nbsp;The best way to connect - storytelling.</p>
<p>Telling your story can be a powerful way to engage your audience - wether it be a campaign, business or podcast. &nbsp;In fact, this blog is way for us to share the Libsyn story - our story, podcasting news and news about our customers too. &nbsp;Last month, Dave Chekan wrote a great post about how Libsyn was founded which you can read <a href="http://imake.libsyn.com/happy-birthday-libsyn" target="_blank">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the story behind your podcast? &nbsp;Do you have an about page for your show? &nbsp;Share your story below or a link to your about page.</p>

What is the story behind your podcast? &nbsp;Do you have an about page for your show? &nbsp;Share your story below or a link to your about page.
Looking for some help in writing your story - check out some of these blogs post:

<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: large;"><strong>HOLIDAY AND SEASONAL EXTRAS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">You can develop   a wealth of bonus content simply by focusing on upcoming holidays or   seasons. Obviously with the end of the year coming up you can offer   so much to entertain, inspire, and inform your audience depending on   the type of podcast that you have. You can create content aimed solely   to entertain such as creating funny holiday videos or silly top ten   lists, or you can prepare your audience for upcoming seasonal transitions,   such as a checklist for preparing your 2011 tax appointment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: large;"><strong>USE YOUR GUESTS TO INSPIRE   EXTRA CONTENT</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">37. Say you   have a guest on your show, why not publish their bio? Or even ask them   one or two extra questions after you&rsquo;re done with the interview and   publish that as your bonus MP3 content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: large;"><strong>COLLABORATE WITH OTHER PRODUCERS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">38. Develop   relationships with other content producers in your field and ask them   to donate a little something as your app bonus content. It could be   as easy as publishing one of their blog posts or videos on the app.   It&rsquo;s a win/win for everybody. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: large;"><strong>NICHE TOP 10 LISTS!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">39. Share   with your audience the things you have spent time learning in lists   that are quick and easy to reference. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: small;">Top ten yoga must haves   for the stay at home Mom.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: small;">Top ten best movies   for the family this holiday season.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: small;">Top ten ways to educate   yourself for the upcoming elections.</span></li>
</ul>

<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: small;">Top ten iphone app for   the iphone newbie.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: small;">Top ten must have gadgets   from CES 2011.</span></li>
</ul>

<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: small;">Top ten religious books   to help connect you back to God.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: small;">Top ten albums to get   your girlfriend for Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: small;">Top ten must listen   episodes of the (insertyourshownamehere) podcast.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: large;"><strong>Don&rsquo;t Forget! Let your   audience know about your bonus content</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">Don't let   your audience miss out on the great work that you do! Make sure that   you tell your audience about it in your podcast, show notes or blog   posts.  A simple "App users check out the coupon in the extras   for this week's episode," will do the trick. If you don't there's   a chance your work will go unnoticed. That would not be cool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">We hope this   was helpful to you! If you are struggling with the time involved in   creating this extra content read our case study by a fellow producer   who not only found the time but also value in producing some extra content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">For more information   on how to add any of the extras above read this blog post that goes   through it in more detail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">If you have   any totally creative ideas, send leave them in the comments! We&rsquo;d   love to hear what you come up with to enhance the value of your app </span><span style="font-family: STXihei; font-size: medium;">☺</span><span style="font-family: Optima-Regular; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;- Elsie</span></p>

			<title>Happy Birthday, Libsyn!</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy Birthday, Libsyn!</p>
<p>Liberated Syndication turned 6 today. &nbsp;It's sometimes immature for it's age- throwing tantrums from time to time, getting in fights, and driving its parents crazy. &nbsp;We've given up a lot of our lives to nurture our baby and watch it grow. Today we tip our glasses and celebrate the company that we have built and thank all those who let us wake up every day and make a living at keeping it going.</p>
<p>We haven't taken a minute to reflect on the events leading up to libsyn in a while. &nbsp;2005 was the last post about it <a href="http://soundoff.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=31160">http://soundoff.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=31160</a>. &nbsp;The story of how it all started has been told time and time again (at least in my head to the faux reporters that have asked me) but since it has been years and many of you who are reading this may not have heard them, I'll spin the yarn one more time.</p>
<p>It was a warm Columbus Day (Thanksgiving to our friends up north) in 2004 when i was driving back to Baltimore, MD that I got a call from an old friend near and dear to me. &nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/tacomancini">Dave Mansueto</a> and I met in college at the University of Pittsburgh. &nbsp;We helped each other out on our mutual vision quests over the years we spent together in Pittsburgh, but I had moved to MD in 2001 and we hadn't spoken for a while. &nbsp;In typical fashion Dave was anxious and excited to tell me about a new thing going on involving radio and the internet and a whole movement we were missing out on. &nbsp;He wanted to do it and needed help figuring out all the technical pieces to get it done.</p>
<p>We had started Emayhem together around 1998 or so. &nbsp;It was an art collective / publishing platform created for Pittsburgh artists and musicians to share their work online. &nbsp;It was myspace w/o the friends -about 5 years before myspace. &nbsp;Emayhem was the thing that got me bad grades and introduced me to some of my lifelong friends and future business partners. &nbsp;At the time it seemed like the thing you just did in college- which now sounds like a cliche. Anyways, experimenting with emayhem.com in 1998 eventually led myself along with my roomate and co-computer engineers Matt Hoopes and Paul Vitiello, to team up with a guy a met through emayhem Marty Mulligan to start a web design firm in 2000. &nbsp;We called it webmayhem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Over summer break that year we leased our first web server, incorporated the company, and purchased a laptop with the proceeds from my collection of Transformers which I sold on Ebay. &nbsp;We were on our way. &nbsp;We failed to notice the bumble or the burst as we were chugging along doing small websites for small businesses while we finished up college. &nbsp; By 2003 the burden of operating as a C-Corporation in the state of PA while Matt, Paul, and I lived in Maryland and Marty in NY became too much. &nbsp;We had all kind of went our own ways with full-time jobs and doing the occasional web design job here and there to keep paying for the web server we were leasing wasn't making enough to keep the webmayhem dream alive. &nbsp;In the late summer of 2004 the 4 friends and founder of webmayhem met in my apartment one last time to dissolve the corporation. &nbsp;I would remain the sole share holder through the rest of the fiscal year and then in 2005 make the decision of what to do next with our remaining customers (who I failed to bill regularly) and our leased web server. &nbsp;I remember using a little bit of the petty cash we had to go the grocery store and buy wine and some steaks. &nbsp;Marty cooked up a dinner which to this day I still recall as one of the top 5 meals I've ever eaten. &nbsp; We all shook hands after dinner and everyone went home.</p>
<p>Emayhem.com was still up and running through all of this and going strong. My old friend Dave was living in Pittsburgh doing all forms of theatre and performance. &nbsp;He had a talk show which we filmed every week live from a bar and aired on public access. &nbsp;He is the kind of guy you can't walk down the street with if you are in a hurry because everyone stops him to say what's up, or ask him to guest MC their event, or hook something up. &nbsp;He is also a self-taught engineer who read everything he could get his hands on regarding computers, audio recording, video editing and encoding. &nbsp;Dave became obsessed with getting his talk show online- in some form or another- and was constantly building onto his collection of antiquated Apple computers to get the job done. &nbsp;I didn't know it at the time, but he was at the time /the/ archetypical podcaster.</p>
<p>Right around the time we were closing the books on webmayhem inc, we started to notice that our server bill was including this line item called bandwidth. &nbsp;For the 4 years leading up to this we had never seen any charges for this and upon further inspection of our contract and digging around the account portal we discovered there was a cap on the amount of information that could be transferred between our web server and the people accessing it on the internet. &nbsp;It was an outrageously high level (we thought at the time) and the fact that we were starting to go over it, now, as we were winding things down seemed outrageous. &nbsp;With some help from our ISP we discovered these things called web logs and started to look at what files were being accessed. &nbsp;Low and behold, the media files which users of emayhem.com had uploaded where kinda large and when they got downloaded it started to cost us money. &nbsp;This sucks. Just as our site and our friends are starting to get popular, we're going to go broke and will have to shut emahyem.com down.</p>
<p>So back to the columbus day drive. &nbsp;Dave was poised to start the Emayhem Radio Podcast and was asking me to help get him up and running. When I got home, I installed the blog engine bloxum and helped create my first ever RSS feed. I told him we could use the webmayhem webserver for a little while, but it was going to be shut down soon and was costing me too much money. &nbsp;Come 2 weeks later we would be on the phone every night talking about what else we could add to the feed, a new website just for the podcast, and that we should renegotiate the server lease for another year and get a better rate on bandwidth. &nbsp;I didn't see it at the time, but I was finally becoming business partners with Dave. &nbsp;Emayhem was never incorporated and we never wrote for those grants we had talked about or became a non-profit. &nbsp;The business model there was never clear, but as the month of October, 2004 came to a close we were rapidly seeing a need for a hosting service catering specifically to this podcasting thing.</p>
<p>I started to think up names for this venture. &nbsp;To me, nothing can start if it doesn't have a name- and a name needs to have a meaning. &nbsp;"Desktop publishing" had been around for a decade and I had been using the Internet since around 1992. &nbsp;Blogging was pretty mainstream by now and Winer had penned Really Simple Syndication years ago. &nbsp;The new twist, though, was this concept that the feed was now "carrying" media and anyone could syndicate a show- not just a written story. &nbsp;A major hurdle, though, was that unless you were part of a university or had access to large servers that you could host relatively large files for free- it was still cost prohibitive to really do it. &nbsp;This is when we first learned about these things call Content Delivery Networks. &nbsp;CDNs, as they were, were networks of servers which distributed the demand for files by keeping multiple copies of the same file across all the servers. &nbsp;This was like putting a bunch of batteries together to make a big spark. &nbsp;Even if you had cheap no name batteries, wire enough together and you can jump start a career. &nbsp; It was Dave's idea (the theatre student who rewired guitar amps for fun and would school my EE and CS friends on how micro-processors worked) to try and lease some cheaper servers and lace them together- instead of 1 larger, more expensive one. &nbsp;Pulling this off would allow us to make the service be really cheap and liberate everyone from the cost prohibitive nature of self publishing. &nbsp;Liberated Syndication was a really cool sounding name to me, and late one night I found libsyn.org and .com hadn't been taken yet, so I registered them.</p>
<p>The spark was there, but the fire didn't' start for a few more weeks. &nbsp;I had been doing the leg work of keeping the Emayhem Radio Podcast's RSS feed up to date while working with Dave on ideas for libsyn here and there, but I had a demanding full-time job and a few other projects spinning around my head. &nbsp;I had just celebrated my 1 year wedding anniversary and was finishing up a guerilla filmmaking feature. &nbsp;Starting a hosting company just didn't seem that important at the time.</p>
<p>I definitely wouldn't say I was really following politics at the time. &nbsp;Living so close to DC it's hard to avoid, but I hadn't seen the 2004 DNC speech Senator Obama had given (a video which later would end up being hosted by libsyn). &nbsp;I vaguely remember John Kerry's campaign and everything leading up to November 2004. &nbsp;But I do remember a lot of my friends being very worked up about everything. &nbsp;Like many of my generation, come election day I didn't vote. &nbsp;That evening, after all the smoke had cleared a sinking feeling set in, and a shameful embarrassment which felt like I had let everyone down over took me. &nbsp;I remember an email thread between Dave and some mutual friends who were involved with the podcast. &nbsp;Everyone was depressed.</p>
<p>The next day didn't feel the same. &nbsp;It felt like a sobering moment of clarity (which was a strange feeling for a straightedge kid) and a sense of regret and resentment started to grow. &nbsp;Over lunch I checked my email and Dave sent me a link to a post on the Guerilla News Network. &nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.apfn.net/messageboard/11-04-04/discussion.cgi.52.html">The Day After &hellip; Tomorrow</a></em> so eloquently summed up everything I was feeling. &nbsp;And most of all it ended with a call to action:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Never before has the security of our world been so reliant on the freedom of independent, investigative voices to unite the people against those who have nakedly seized the mechanism of American democracy. As the world&rsquo;s dominant superpower, we have the enhanced responsibility of &reg;evolutionizing our media system because it is not only framing the debate at home, it is also doing it globally, and for good reason. The economic and political elites in America know that their survival depends on the rapid absorption of the propagandist media by the nations they seek to dominate and exploit. Fortunately, we have a new generation of independent journalists and citizen muckrakers who will use the unharnessed power of communications technology to fight and win this information war.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What are you waiting for?</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn't really anything more that I need to say after that. &nbsp;That night it was clear that liberated syndication needed to be born and for the last 6 years we have put the majority of our efforts and focus into answering the call and doing what we can to level the playing field for a democratized media.</p>
<p>How we got from there to here is another long story, and maybe I'll document all the ups and downs for the future web startups someday. &nbsp;For now, I'm going to drink a beer and smile about the good times (retaining a straightedge lifestyle through a web startup, reverse-triangulated merger, and becoming a public company is futile).</p>
<p>Here's to you, libsyn.</p>
<p>Love,&nbsp;</p>

When I got home, I installed the blog engine bloxum and helped create my first ever RSS feed. I told him we could use the webmayhem webserver for a little while, but it was going to be shut down soon and was costing me too much money. &nbsp;Come 2 weeks later we would be on the phone every night talking about what else we could add to the feed, a new website just for the podcast, and that we should renegotiate the server lease for another year and get a better rate on bandwidth. &nbsp;I didn't see it at the time, but I was finally becoming business partners with Dave. &nbsp;Emayhem was never incorporated and we never wrote for those grants we had talked about or became a non-profit. &nbsp;The business model there was never clear, but as the month of October, 2004 came to a close we were rapidly seeing a need for a hosting service catering specifically to this podcasting thing.
I started to think up names for this venture. &nbsp;To me, nothing can start if it doesn't have a name- and a name needs to have a meaning. &nbsp;"Desktop publishing" had been around for a decade and I had been using the Internet since around 1992. &nbsp;Blogging was pretty mainstream by now and Winer had penned Really Simple Syndication years ago. &nbsp;The new twist, though, was this concept that the feed was now "carrying" media and anyone could syndicate a show- not just a written story. &nbsp;A major hurdle, though, was that unless you were part of a university or had access to large servers that you could host relatively large files for free- it was still cost prohibitive to really do it. &nbsp;This is when we first learned about these things call Content Delivery Networks. &nbsp;CDNs, as they were, were networks of servers which distributed the demand for files by keeping multiple copies of the same file across all the servers. &nbsp;This was like putting a bunch of batteries together to make a big spark. &nbsp;Even if you had cheap no name batteries, wire enough together and you can jump start a career. &nbsp; It was Dave's idea (the theatre student who rewired guitar amps for fun and would school my EE and CS friends on how micro-processors worked) to try and lease some cheaper servers and lace them together- instead of 1 larger, more expensive one. &nbsp;Pulling this off would allow us to make the service be really cheap and liberate everyone from the cost prohibitive nature of self publishing. &nbsp;Liberated Syndication was a really cool sounding name to me, and late one night I found libsyn.org and .com hadn't been taken yet, so I registered them.
The spark was there, but the fire didn't' start for a few more weeks. &nbsp;I had been doing the leg work of keeping the Emayhem Radio Podcast's RSS feed up to date while working with Dave on ideas for libsyn here and there, but I had a demanding full-time job and a few other projects spinning around my head. &nbsp;I had just celebrated my 1 year wedding anniversary and was finishing up a guerilla filmmaking feature. &nbsp;Starting a hosting company just didn't seem that important at the time.
I definitely wouldn't say I was really following politics at the time. &nbsp;Living so close to DC it's hard to avoid, but I hadn't seen the 2004 DNC speech Senator Obama had given (a video which later would end up being hosted by libsyn). &nbsp;I vaguely remember John Kerry's campaign and everything leading up to November 2004. &nbsp;But I do remember a lot of my friends being very worked up about everything. &nbsp;Like many of my generation, come election day I didn't vote. &nbsp;That evening, after all the smoke had cleared a sinking feeling set in, and a shameful embarrassment which felt like I had let everyone down over took me. &nbsp;I remember an email thread between Dave and some mutual friends who were involved with the podcast. &nbsp;Everyone was depressed.
The next day didn't feel the same. &nbsp;It felt like a sobering moment of clarity (which was a strange feeling for a straightedge kid) and a sense of regret and resentment started to grow. &nbsp;Over lunch I checked my email and Dave sent me a link to a post on the Guerilla News Network. &nbsp;The Day After &hellip; Tomorrow so eloquently summed up everything I was feeling. &nbsp;And most of all it ended with a call to action:
Never before has the security of our world been so reliant on the freedom of independent, investigative voices to unite the people against those who have nakedly seized the mechanism of American democracy. As the world&rsquo;s dominant superpower, we have the enhanced responsibility of &reg;evolutionizing our media system because it is not only framing the debate at home, it is also doing it globally, and for good reason. The economic and political elites in America know that their survival depends on the rapid absorption of the propagandist media by the nations they seek to dominate and exploit. Fortunately, we have a new generation of independent journalists and citizen muckrakers who will use the unharnessed power of communications technology to fight and win this information war.
What are you waiting for?&nbsp;&nbsp;
There isn't really anything more that I need to say after that. &nbsp;That night it was clear that liberated syndication needed to be born and for the last 6 years we have put the majority of our efforts and focus into answering the call and doing what we can to level the playing field for a democratized media.
How we got from there to here is another long story, and maybe I'll document all the ups and downs for the future web startups someday. &nbsp;For now, I'm going to drink a beer and smile about the good times (retaining a straightedge lifestyle through a web startup, reverse-triangulated merger, and becoming a public company is futile).
Here's to you, libsyn.
Love,&nbsp;
Dave c.&nbsp;

			<title>How To Add Your Podcast to a Blogger Blog</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/how-to-add-your-podcast-to-a-blogger-blog]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="LessonContent">
<div class="LessonSummary">This little tutorial is assuming that you are hosting your files with libsyn and would like to use your existing Blogger blog instead of the blog that's offered as part of your libsyn account.  Before we begin, let's quickly address <strong>your podcast's RSS feed</strong>. You have 3 choices: 
<ul>
<li>You can use the libsyn generated RSS feed, which is automatically created when you open a libsyn account.</li>
<li>You can use your Blogger RSS feed.</li>
<li>You can burn your own Feedburner RSS feed.</li>
</ul>
For the purpose of this tutorial we are going to assume that <em>you are choosing to use your Blogger RSS feed as your podcast RSS feed</em>.  <strong>Configure Your Settings</strong></div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286255044201.png" alt="media_1286255044201.png" width="540" height="191" /></div>
<div class="StepInstructions">Here is your Blogger dashboard. You begin here, and you will begin here every time that you publish a  new podcast episode.  The first thing that you have to do before you publish any episodes is to configure your Blogger blog to allow for enclosure links. In order to do this you have to go to the Settings tab.</div>
</div>
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286255087902.png" alt="media_1286255087902.png" width="540" height="118" /></div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<div class="StepInstructions">Once you are in the Settings page you need to click the Formatting tab.</div>
</div>
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286255163306.png" alt="media_1286255163306.png" width="540" height="228" /></div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<div class="StepInstructions">Once you are in the Formatting page, scroll down the page, about 2/3 of the way down you will come across Show Link fields. Click on the drop down menu and choose <strong>YES.</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286255197997.png" alt="media_1286255197997.png" width="513" height="161" /></div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<div class="StepInstructions">Keep scrolling down that page and <strong>SAVE your settings</strong>.</div>
</div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<h3 class="StepTitle">Publishing Your First Episode</h3>
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286255266090.png" alt="media_1286255266090.png" width="540" height="232" /></div>
<div class="StepInstructions">Now you are ready to publish your first podcast episode!  Go back to your Blogger Dashboard and title your episode. You will see right below the <em>Link: field </em>there is a link to <em>Add enclosure link</em>. Please click that.</div>
</div>
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286255278807.png" alt="media_1286255278807.png" width="540" height="337" /></div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<div class="StepInstructions">You will then see another box pop up under the heading <em>Enclosures</em>.</div>
</div>
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286255393093.png" alt="media_1286255393093.png" width="531" height="118" /></div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<div class="StepInstructions">It is here that you need to add the url for your mp3 file. Mp3 file links here at libsyn always start with <strong>http://traffic.libsyn.com/<span style="color: #ff0000;">youraccountid</span>/<span style="color: #0000ff;">yourfilename</span></strong>.  Go ahead and finish adding your shownotes, ie. composing your post and Publish Post!</div>
</div>
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286256134131.png" alt="media_1286256134131.png" width="530" height="347" /></div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<div class="StepInstructions">Here is what your podcast episode post will look like. As you can see from this screenshot, <em>the link to the mp3 is nowhere to be seen</em>, but it is in your feed. If you want to add an audio player to your post so that your podcast listeners can listen to your podcast straight from your site, you will have to add that separately.  Please be asured that your podcast episode has in fact been published. If you would like to check to see if it's the case, you can use any RSS reader, get your RSS feed and add it to the reader. Your Blogger RSS feed is <strong>http://<span style="color: #ff0000;">yourblogspotblogname</span>.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default.</strong></div>
</div>
<div class="StepImage"><img src="http://elsiesyogakula.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/media_1286256160983.png" alt="media_1286256160983.png" width="540" height="127" /></div>
<div class="LessonStep top">
<div class="StepInstructions">The picture above is a shot of our first podcast episode as seen in Google Reader.  That's it! Hope that was helpful!  If you publish your podcast on Blogger and are hosted at libsyn, <em>we'd love to hear from you</em>. Why not share your experience with the rest of the community? Do you have anything to add to this tutorial?</div>

<p>Apps are the new mainstream method of media consumption on the go. &nbsp;We wanted to quickly highlight all the benefits of turning your podcast into an app. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your audience is Always One Tap Away from your Latest and Greatest Content</strong></p>
<p>With instantaneous app updates you publish an episode to your podcast and it is available to your fans immediately. &nbsp;No need for your audience to sync to their computer, they just open the app to get the latest episode.</p>

			<title>Podcast Artwork Support and Resources</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/podcast-artwork-support-and-resources-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Everybody loves pictures. I'm sure that you&rsquo;ve had your attention drawn by them at some point during your day. Images are power. Images, design, color and graphics hold within them the power to convey distinct and compelling information. They have the strength to engage the viewer to step closer to the source or to push away from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><em>This is why your podcast artwork is incredibly important.</em></p>
<p>You may already have decided what you want your artwork to look like. You may have no idea what your artwork should look like. Following will be a few guidelines and important information to both facilitate your decision making process as well as refine your choices.</p>
<div><strong>What is cover art and do you really need it?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have cover art, but you are certainly loosing tons of benefits by not having it or not caring about it. Here&rsquo;s what Apple has to say on their <a title="Apple Guidelines" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/creatorfaq.html" target="_self">site</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<div>"Attractive and interesting cover art attracts new subscribers to your podcast. Podcasts must have good cover art to be featured on the Podcast main page or the Store main page. Most good podcast images include an image as well as a title, brand, or source name. A 300x300-pixel JPG is the recommended size and format. Using this relatively large format, the iTunes Store automatically generates the various smaller images you see in the podcast directory. Before you settle on the art for your podcast, you may want to review the Top Podcasts page and note the various elements that contribute to compelling art."</div>
</blockquote>
<p>If you decide that you want to avoid iTunes all together, you may still want to spend time developing your artwork as a way to inform your listeners of what your podcast is about. The top question potential listeners are looking to answer when they &nbsp;bump into your content is what is this about and is this for them? The easier you make it for your potential superfans to decide to subscribe to your content based upon your artwork, about page and Web site in general, the less work you will have to do all around to get your show out there. <strong>Get them to hit the play button and engage!</strong></p>
<p>While in your development process, no matter how tempted you are to include well-known brands or actors and actresses in your artwork it is a good idea to steer clear of this. Monetizing a podcast with copyrighted artwork or selling products with someone else's work on them is not legal. It is so important to adhere to this as it could save you a lot of trouble down the road.</p>
<p>If you have further questions about ethics and design AIGA has published a very informative document which goes into great detail about this matter: &nbsp;<a title="AIGA" href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/design-business-and-ethics" target="_self">AIGA Design Business and Ethics</a>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Artwork Sizes and Resolutions</strong></div>
<p>Not only is the look of your artwork significant, but also the size and resolution. Podcasters in general recognize the importance of their artwork, but often times forget to optimize the size and resolution.</p>
<div>Here are a set of important numbers for you to keep handy:</div>
<ul>
<li>iTunes Podcast- 300x300 at 72 dpi</li>
<li>iPhone Display - 160 dpi</li>
<li>iPhone App Image requirement - 512x512 pixels at 160 dpi&nbsp;</li>
<li>iPad Display - 132 dpi</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see from these numbers, how much they change from device to device. Make sure that the initial artwork that you create is capable of being sized down, which means, considering making your image large (1000x1000 at 300 dpi). It can always be scaled down.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t waste your time having an image that large, in fact it may save you a lot of time in the future, specifically if you decide you would like to offer some shwag for your show: t-shirts, mugs, caps, etc. When it comes to images for print, bigger is definitely better. At minimum to get something printed you would need an image at 200 dpi, optimally 300 dpi (currently the safe bet print standard). Web standard is 72 dpi, although on most devices, especially those with massively powerful screens, that dpi looks fuzzy.&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>What you should ask for when someone else is making the artwork for you.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p>The original editable file. <em>(You may not have the programs to open this file if you don&rsquo;t have Photoshop or illustrator but if you have a graphic designer make changes down the road you will have this to send to them.)</em></p>
<div>A PNG and JPEG version of your cover art at 512x512 at 300 dpi and 300x300 at 72 dpi .&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Podcast Artwork Design Help</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of some web resources to both hire a designer and create your own artwork. As with anything: do your research, ask questions and make informed decisions. <em>We are not particularly endorsing any of these services, we are offering you choices so that you can begin or refine your journey.&nbsp;</em></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[For the past five years the Practical Ecommerce blog has been covering all kind of websites and tools that might be of use to others in ecommerce. &nbsp;They just posed a review of Libsyn and we are honored to be included on their list.&nbsp;
Podcasts are a great way to educate and engage your existing customers in your brand. &nbsp;And podcasts can be a great tool for getting more info about your products and services to potential customers. &nbsp;Sharing knowledge about your products and industry can be a great way to establish your brand as an industry leader.
Check out the entire Practical Ecommerce review here.







We would love to hear more feedback on how we can make the Libsyn platform more useful for other ecommerce users too.
Also check out our App hosting plans - if you have a podcast for your brand you can easily create an iPhone/iPod app for your brand with a Libsyn App hosting plan.

			<title>Hosting media with libsyn but managing your own RSS feed?  Try libsyn Feed Sync.  </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/hosting-media-with-libsyn-but-managing-your-own-rss-feed-try-feed-sync-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We know a lot of our users host their media files with libsyn, but use external publishing tools like Wordpress or hand coding to create their RSS feed. &nbsp;The downside to doing this was that the producer could not take advantage of some key features like our <a title="Podcast App" href="http://libsyn.com/3/podcast-app/" target="_self">Podcast App</a> and Media Players. &nbsp;This was because all the rich meta data lives outside of the libsyn system. &nbsp;To remedy this we have created the Feed Sync. &nbsp;Feed Sync pulls all the meta data from your RSS feed into the libsyn3 system automatically.</p>
<p><strong>How to use Feed Sync</strong></p>
<p>Note: &nbsp;You still use the web or FTP options to upload your media to libsyn, and continue to use your wordpress blog or other publishing tools (anything that generates a valid RSS 2.0 XML feed). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure all the files referenced in your RSS feed are currently on libsyn. &nbsp;If they are not, they will be pulled over the first time the feed sync runs <strong>(this could put you over your storage quota)</strong></li>
<li>Under the show settings, select the feed sync tab.</li>
<li>Enter the url to your externally producer RSS feed. &nbsp;<strong>*DO NOT ENTER YOUR LIBSYN RSS FEED URL HERE*</strong></li>
<li>Select the option to enable the Automated Feed Sync. Do <strong>NOT</strong> select any other feed sync options.</li>
<li>Click Save.</li>
</ol>
<p><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://assets.libsyn.com/images/imake/tutorials-syncfeed1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The initial feed sync will run and update your show information, and fill in the &ldquo;meta data&rdquo; for each episode that it matches against the list of files in your Previous Posts. &nbsp;The meta data pulled from the feed for each episode is:</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Title</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Description</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Category</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Release Date</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Tags</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Permalink</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Subtitle</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Thumbnail (if a media:thumbnail tag is present in the feed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you are ready to publish a new episode. To ensure you release it to your Podcast App or Flash player with proper meta data which you will be publishing via your external publishing workflow, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload new media file(s) to the <strong>/public&nbsp;</strong>folder&nbsp;via <strong>FTP</strong> or if you use the <strong>web interface</strong> to upload, select <strong>&lsquo;file for download only&rsquo;</strong> from the <strong>basic</strong> publishing form.</li>
<li>Post episode to your external blog / CMS / RSS feed linking to the file you uploaded to libsyn <strong>(http://traffic.libsyn.com/showshortname/filename)</strong>.</li>
<li>Allow feed sync to run (usually every 4-6 hours) or hit the <strong>Sync Feed button</strong> in the libsyn dashboard.</li>
<li>The feed sync will match the &lt;item&gt; in your RSS feed with the filename in your libsyn account, update all the meta-data, and publish the episode to your app, and other libsyn destinations</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is nice, clean episodes in your app, player, stats, etc. that have picked up the title, description, permalink and url that you posted with your external tools. &nbsp;The permalink is particularly important, as that link is included in all sharing features of the Podcast App and Flash player.</p>
<p>We hope that you find this useful. &nbsp;Hopefully this is an easy way to sync up your libsyn account to your existing workflow - no matter how or where you create the feed. &nbsp;This tutorial and more will be included in our upcoming index of tutorials which we are hard at work completing.</p>
<p>Feel free to post comments and questions, or take the discussion to our&nbsp;<a href="http://forum.libsyn.com/viewforum.php?f=36">community forum</a></p>]]></description>

Click Save.


The initial feed sync will run and update your show information, and fill in the &ldquo;meta data&rdquo; for each episode that it matches against the list of files in your Previous Posts. &nbsp;The meta data pulled from the feed for each episode is:
 &bull; Title
 &bull; Description
 &bull; Category
 &bull; Release Date
 &bull; Tags
 &bull; Permalink
 &bull; Subtitle
 &bull; Thumbnail (if a media:thumbnail tag is present in the feed)
&nbsp;
Now you are ready to publish a new episode. To ensure you release it to your Podcast App or Flash player with proper meta data which you will be publishing via your external publishing workflow, follow these steps:

Upload new media file(s) to the /public&nbsp;folder&nbsp;via FTP or if you use the web interface to upload, select &lsquo;file for download only&rsquo; from the basic publishing form.
Post episode to your external blog / CMS / RSS feed linking to the file you uploaded to libsyn (http://traffic.libsyn.com/showshortname/filename).
Allow feed sync to run (usually every 4-6 hours) or hit the Sync Feed button in the libsyn dashboard.
The feed sync will match the &lt;item&gt; in your RSS feed with the filename in your libsyn account, update all the meta-data, and publish the episode to your app, and other libsyn destinations

The result is nice, clean episodes in your app, player, stats, etc. that have picked up the title, description, permalink and url that you posted with your external tools. &nbsp;The permalink is particularly important, as that link is included in all sharing features of the Podcast App and Flash player.
We hope that you find this useful. &nbsp;Hopefully this is an easy way to sync up your libsyn account to your existing workflow - no matter how or where you create the feed. &nbsp;This tutorial and more will be included in our upcoming index of tutorials which we are hard at work completing.
Feel free to post comments and questions, or take the discussion to our&nbsp;community forum]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple had a doosey of a media event today, revamping much of its iPod lineup and even reinventing the Apple TV. &nbsp;The <a title="iPod Shuffle" href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/" target="_self">Shuffle</a>, <a title="iPod Nano" href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/" target="_self">Nano</a>, and <a title="iPod Touch" href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/" target="_self">iPod Touch</a> all got major upgrades as expected inline with predictions from our favorite rumor sources <a title="Macrumors" href="http://macrumors.com" target="_self">Macrumors</a>, <a title="Techcrunch" href="http://techcrunch.com" target="_self">Techcrunch</a> and <a title="Daring Fireball" href="http://daringfireball.com" target="_self">Daring Fireball</a>. &nbsp;It was a very solid event <a title="Apple Event" href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1009qpeijrfn/event" target="_self">streamed live</a> for the first time in years, and the general consensus is that the updates were solid improvements across the board of the iPod line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Podcasters, we think the one to watch for audience growth may be the <a title="Apple TV" href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/" target="_self">Apple TV</a>. &nbsp;Long referred to as Apple's "Hobby" by Steve Jobs, that label was continued today as Steve's final reveal of the Apple TV was jokingly renamed "One More&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Thing</span>&nbsp;Hobby". &nbsp;The new Apple TV is a fourth of the size of the original and is aggressively priced at $99 dollars. &nbsp;That is impulse territory. &nbsp;Integration between iOS devices and the Apple TV has grown even tighter via what is now called "Airplay" allowing for content to be beamed from the iPad and iPhone to the Apple TV over wifi. &nbsp;That may just be the sleeper hit for the device, bridging the divide between the personal and communal screens in a seamless manner. &nbsp;$.99 TV episode rentals and Netflix integration are aimed at attracting a bigger user base for the device and we are happy to see podcasts get top billing along with Youtube and Flickr as seen in the Internet section of the interface below. &nbsp;</p>

			<title>Surefire Ways To Kill Your Ability To Monetize Your Podcast </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/surefire_ways_to_kill_your_ability_to_monetize_your_podcast_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Not all podcasters want to monetize their podcast. In fact a lot of indie podcasters start a podcast because they love podcasting, have an overwhelming passion for something and simply want to share it with the world. As time goes on (if they don't podfade!) their passion grows and they begin to mull over the podcaster golden question:</p>
<p><em><strong>How can I make money doing this?</strong></em></p>
<p>This post is not about monetizing your podcast. There are a gazillion ways and<a href="http://podcastanswerman.com/"> tons of folks</a> that are willing to <a href="http://jasonvanorden.com/">walk you through </a>a <a href="http://podcastsecrets.com/">myriad of models</a>. The aim of this post is to provide you with a little simple checklist in order to save you some heartache IF you decide you do want to monetize your content from the beginning, even if that's not your initial intention.</p>
<h2>4 Ways To Impede Monetization Of Your Podcast</h2>
<ul>
<li>1. Use trademark images for your podcast artwork</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. Use trademarked words in the title or subtitle of your podcast</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3. Use copyrighted music as your theme music, intro or outro music within your podcast.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4. Read, sing or perform full or parts of copyrighted works.</li>
</ul>
<p>(NOTE) Generally speaking if you have been given specific permission by owners of copyrighted material for your podcast you will be unable make money off of those podcast episodes. You would have to strip that material from all the media that contains this content if you want to monetize your work.</p>
<h2>Podcast Content That Hinders Monetization:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Images or graphics of realistic violence</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sexual content or nudity, particularly in podcast artwork</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>High levels of profanity</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol, tobacco, or drug use, particularly in podcast artwork</li>
</ul>
<p>The beauty and power of podcasting is that you can say, do and create any kind of content that you desire. If you want to create an awesome podcast replete with sexual content, with lots of profanity and tons of illegal substance use, then go for it! Just know that your ability to find ways to monetize your podcast will be more limited, although not impossible. You just have to work a little harder to find the best match in terms of sponsors and joint ventures.</p>
<p>The whole copyright/trademark world, particularly for new media content is a bit complicated. The information seems to continually deepen and shift. It's up to content creators to choose to educate themselves and stay up to date on all this information.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div>You may have noticed that Google, Bing and AOL change up their home page images from time to time. Snowflakes for winter, shamrocks for St. Patrick's day, flowers for spring. You can do the same thing for your app.&nbsp;&nbsp;Little changes like this go a long way to keep your audience entertained, engaged and invested in your content.&nbsp; Check out these tips for creating a great background image for your app.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Keep in mind that the background image appears in multiple places in the app and is the default background. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Background Image Design Tips</span></div>
<ul>
<li>The design should be simple so that the white text of the app can be clearly read.</li>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[You may have noticed that Google, Bing and AOL change up their home page images from time to time. Snowflakes for winter, shamrocks for St. Patrick's day, flowers for spring. You can do the same thing for your app.&nbsp;&nbsp;Little changes like this go a long way to keep your audience entertained, engaged and invested in your content.&nbsp; Check out these tips for creating a great background image for your app.
&nbsp;
Keep in mind that the background image appears in multiple places in the app and is the default background. Background Image Design Tips

The design should be simple so that the white text of the app can be clearly read.
When designing your background be conscious that the play button will obscure the center of your image.

            <link><![CDATA[http://imake.libsyn.com/tutorial_adding_episode_background]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Another tip for Podcast App producers. &nbsp;Providing special background images for specific episodes is a simple thing to do, but it goes a long way to make your audience feel excited about your App. &nbsp;Not unlike the artwork in DVD menus; its about enhancing the experience of your show. &nbsp;It's in the little things. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the default background of your app which is set in the Destinations section, the Episode background is set right when you publish a new episode. &nbsp;This image will appear only when your audience is looking at the detail page for that specific episode. &nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://media.libsyn.com/media/emayhem/124.jpg?nvb=20100813224759&amp;nva=20100814225759&amp;t=0c1774895e584854323e9" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what's nice is your when you go from the episode list to that specific episode, you get a nice background fade in transition. &nbsp;In this case it's beachy.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[​June 29th 2010 will mark the 5 Year anniversary of iTunes v4.9 and as a Podcaster you may know that was when podcasting support was added to iTunes.&nbsp; That is also when the iTunes Podcasting page was launched.&nbsp; What you may not know is that over the past 5 years the iTunes podcast pages have only been available in 23 countries and those 23 countries represent less than 15 percent of the worlds population. &nbsp;

Now almost 5 years since the launch of iTunes v4.9, Apple has just added iTunes Podcast pages for 67 more countries.&nbsp; Including all 4 of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). These 67 countries represent over 4.3 Billion people - that is 64.2% of the worlds population - and when added to the pervious 23 countries a total of 78.9% (5.4 Billion) of the worlds population now is covered by iTunes Podcast Pages. (Population %'s according to stats from CIA Factbook). &nbsp;



At Libsyn /&nbsp;Wizzard Media we think podcasters should be very excited about this increase in coverage.&nbsp; As the worlds largest host of podcasts we are in a unique position to look at stats.&nbsp; When we looked at May's download numbers we saw that 90.6% of all of our networks downloads came from the 23 countries that had an iTunes Podcast page, while only 8.3% of downloads came from the 67 new countries that had not yet had the iTunes pages just turned on.&nbsp; And the Rest of the World (ROW) had just 1.1% of the downloads. &nbsp;






Even though the new 67 countries have over 4 times the population as the original 23 countries, the new 67 had less then 1/10th of the downloads prior to getting an iTunes Podcasting page.&nbsp; This shows the importance of having an iTunes podcasting page in a country for getting downloads from that country.&nbsp; With 67 new Podcast Pages in iTunes stores around the world this is a great opportunity for you - as a podcaster - to increase your audience.&nbsp; Getting featured in iTunes is a key way to do this.&nbsp; As a podcaster it is important to know you will never get featured in iTunes if you have ugly artwork or worse yet no artwork at all.&nbsp; It is highly recommend by Apple to have at least a 600 x 600 Pixel image referenced in your RSS feed.&nbsp; This image can be larger but should remain a square.&nbsp; If you are not someone that can create good looking artwork - then put out a call to your audience and see if one of them is willing to create artwork for your show. This is also a good time to look at your show in iTunes and make sure you have an accurate description for your show and it is in the right category.&nbsp;

We at &nbsp;Libsyn/Wizzard Media &nbsp;are very excited about the new opportunities that have just been opened up with the addition of over 4 Billion new people being covered by iTunes Podcast pages.&nbsp; We will post again shortly showing an update on how the new countries are doing for downloads pre and post the launch of iTunes pages in those countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;
