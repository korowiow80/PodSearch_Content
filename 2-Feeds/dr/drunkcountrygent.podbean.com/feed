<p>On Easter Sunday, 12th April 2009, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/looseclub" target="_blank"><strong>Liz Hunt</strong></a>&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.loosecardiff.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Loose  Music Club</strong></a> held an all-day festival at the <em>Buffalo Bar</em> in Cardiff.  Topping an excellently curated bill that day were the superb <a href="www.myspace.com/thewavepictures" target="_blank"><strong>The Wave Pictures</strong></a> — a band <strong>½DC</strong> has liked for quite some time.  An interview, then, had had to be got,  &amp; got, by God, it was.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>David Tattersall</strong> &amp; <strong>Franic Rozycki </strong>(lifelong friends &amp; bandmates), guitar/vox/songwriter-in-chief &amp; bass guitar respectively, certainly give good interview.  Jesus H. Biscuit do they give good interview.</p>
<p><strong>½DC</strong> could have chatted for <em>hours</em> with <strong>David</strong>, feeding him leading questions &amp; letting him run off on many branches of an altogether thoroughly satisfying answer every time, but the fact they started at midnight &amp; eventually wrapped it up just after 1am would have perhaps been a little anti-social.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very rare you have an interview where the interviewee fills in so much information not only articulately, but with great humour, honesty &amp; humility — <strong>David Tattersall</strong> did just that.  Fantastically insightful nuggets about his songwriting process, singing voice, Marmite, the recording process, music in general &amp; his lifelong friendship with <strong>Franic</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to know how bands should present themselves to a volley of half-pissed questions, in a cemetary, at midnight, then listen to this interview; &#8217;tis very good indeed.

<p>Back on 13th April 2009 <strong>½DC</strong> dragged <strong>TWoTH</strong> &amp; a handful of friends along to the Buffalo Bar (in Cardiff) to see the audience dividing <a href="www.myspace.com/tremblingbells" target="_blank"><strong>Trembling Bells</strong></a>.  Part of their ill-timed first tour proper (their debut album was being released the week <em>after</em> they came off the road), their gig in Cardiff was quite something — a lot harder than on record, more experimental &amp; sounding strangely more together.  Even <strong>TWoTH </strong>was won over by their excellent energy &amp; set.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not a TWR interview without a <strong>TWR</strong> moment taking place somewhere in the middle of an important bit; this one is no exception.  Just after <strong>Alex Neilson </strong>(erstwhile impressario &amp; band leader) started to brilliantly dissect a comment comparing him to a lo-fi Brian Wilson the damn recording device decided to stop working.  <strong>½DC</strong> only noticed this after the lengthy tennis Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>However, but &amp; still&#8230; the remaining audio capture was intensely interesting — <strong>Alex</strong> &amp; <strong>Lavinia</strong> &amp; the others all explaining in detail just how they harness the chaos of <strong>Alex</strong>&#8217;s cross-country phonetic songwriting &amp; turn it into the wondrous psych-opera folk bombast we hear on record.</p>
<p>Remarkable stuff indeed.

<p>During the last day (19th April 2009) of the <strong><a href="../drunk-country-gent/www.fencerecords.com/" target="_blank">Fence (Records) Collective</a></strong> <strong>Homegame 6</strong> Alt.Folk Music festival in Anstruther, Fife, Scotland, <strong>½DC</strong> + <strong>TWoTH</strong> met up with the deliciously lovely <strong>Diana de Cabarrus </strong>otherwise known as <a href="www.myspace.com/candythief" target="_blank"><strong>Candythief</strong></a>.  &amp; what a joy she was too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More a flirt-a-thon than an interview, on <strong>½DC</strong>&#8217;s part at least, the giggles came thick &amp; fast as Diana talked <em>19 to the dozen</em> about this, that &amp; everything in between.  Diana&#8217;s beautifully quirky sense of humour had <strong>½DC</strong> all tongue-tied &amp; flapping.  At least that&#8217;s what he told <strong>TWoTH</strong>.</p>
<p>The more astute amongst you might consider the possibility <strong>½DC</strong> fell head over tit for the delightfully cheeky imp &amp; couldn&#8217;t quite believe he was huddled (away from the end of pier wind) in the doorway of the <em>Anstruther Lighthouse</em> with her.  Pretty much nose to nose.  Kissing distance.</p>
<p>Anyway, there was supposed to be a session to accompany the interview, but Diana hadn&#8217;t sufficiently learnt a cover version she wanted to play &amp; so suggested she email some one-take bedroom recordings for use instead.  The use of the word bedroom has been, perhaps, dwelt upon a little too long for comfort&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>Aaanyway, again, the fun they had is most certainly evident throughout the interview you are about to listen to after you&#8217;ve stopped reading this bit &amp; mouse-clicked the embedded player function below.

<p>Between 17th &amp; 19th April 2009 the <strong><a href="www.fencerecords.com/" target="_blank">Fence (Records) Collective</a></strong> hosted the <strong>Homegame 6</strong> Alt.Folk Music festival in Anstruther, Fife, Scotland.  <strong>½DC</strong> + <strong>TWoTH</strong>, leaving at stupid o&#8217;clock from Cardiff Int. Airport, zipped up to Edinburgh to meet up with <strong>Mr. Toad</strong> &amp; Co. from off of that musi-blag <a href="http://www.songbytoad.com" target="_blank"><strong>Song, by Toad</strong></a>, before hopping across to Anstruther, on a rickety bus no less, in readiness for a long weekend of alt.folk loveliness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Playing at the festival, in the rather spacious Town Hall, was wobbly Kraut Rock-esque sonic merchants <strong><a href="www.myspace.com/thephantombandpage" target="_blank">The Phantom Band</a> </strong>— somewhat of a favourite on this here <strong>TWR</strong>.  <strong>Gerry</strong> &amp; <strong>Andy</strong>, bass guitarist &amp; synths respectively, took some time out after their barnstorming set to chat nonsensically with <strong>½DC</strong>, whilst surrounded by a pulsing throng of folkies &amp; drunked up musi-obsessives.</p>
<p>It has to be said, terrible sound/board mix in the hall putting them off their stroke aside, <strong>Gerry</strong> &amp;<strong> Andy</strong> were ridiculously upbeat &amp; well up for a laugh.  The interview sprawled all over the place &amp; was, eventually, cut for size/placement on the original broadcast.  It was also interrupted on a number of occasions by their Manager, Stephen McCann, friends of the band, general drink-addled randoms, traffic inconveniently wanting to pass by on the very road we were stood in the middle of, &amp; non-sequitur asides that had absolutely nothing to do with the interview at all.  In a word: brilliant.</p>
<p>Frankly, it&#8217;s somewhat pointless to try &amp; expain the quality of the interview with mere words, especially when you have the thing here to listen to &amp; enjoy at your own pace.</p>
<p>All we hope is that you can understand what it is they&#8217;re saying through the thick fug of their Scottish accent.</p>
<p>Good luck.

Airport, zipped up to Edinburgh to meet up with Mr. Toad &#x38; Co. from off of that musi-blag Song, by Toad, before hopping across to Anstruther, on a rickety bus no less, in readiness for a long weekend of alt.folk loveliness.



Playing at the festival, in the rather spacious Town Hall, was wobbly Kraut Rock-esque sonic merchants The Phantom Band — somewhat of a favourite on this here TWR.  Gerry &#x38; Andy, bass guitarist &#x38; synths respectively, took some time out after their barnstorming set to chat nonsensically with ½DC, whilst surrounded by a pulsing throng of folkies &#x38; drunked up musi-obsessives.

It has to be said, terrible sound/board mix in the hall putting them off their stroke aside, Gerry &#x38; Andy were ridiculously upbeat &#x38; well up for a laugh.  The interview sprawled all over the place &#x38; was, eventually, cut for size/placement on the original broadcast.  It was also interrupted on a number of occasions by their Manager, Stephen McCann, friends of the band, general drink-addled randoms, traffic inconveniently wanting to pass by on the very road we were stood in the middle of, &#x38; non-sequitur asides that had absolutely nothing to do with the interview at all.  In a word: brilliant.

Frankly, it's somewhat pointless to try &#x38; expain the quality of the interview with mere words, especially when you have the thing here to listen to &#x38; enjoy at your own pace.

All we hope is that you can understand what it is they're saying through the thick fug of their Scottish accent.

Good luck</itunes:summary>

<p>As part of the <strong><a href="www.fencerecords.com/" target="_blank">Fence (Records) Collective</a></strong> <strong>Homegame 6</strong> Alt.Folk Music festival in Anstruther, Fife, Scotland, between 17th &amp; 19th April 2009, <strong>½DC</strong> + <strong>TWoTH</strong> met up with the phenomenal Sheffield, England 2-piece <a href="www.myspace.com/slowclub" target="_blank"><strong>Slow Club</strong></a>.</p>
<p>They were there, apart from playing a handful of shows (including a superb secret gig at the Hew Scott Hall Tea Room), conducting an interview for <a href="http://www.songbytoad.com" target="_blank"><strong>Song by, Toad</strong></a>, &amp; recording an end of the pier session for the excellent Edinburgh-based Music/Video-blog project <a href="http://offthebeatentracks.tv/2009/episode-4-slow-club/" target="_blank"><strong>Off The Beaten Tracks</strong></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being the chancers they are, <strong>TWR</strong> jumped the coat tails &amp; simul-recorded the session (one track of which was played on the show as part of the interview) before whisking our end of pier morning air frozen protagonists off to a pub in order to warm up, tek a drink &amp; grab an interview.  &amp; what a bloody jollygood interview it was too.</p>
<p><strong>Charles</strong> &amp; <strong>Rebecca</strong>, for it is they, warmed up after a snifter &amp; the wood burning fire of <em>The Masonic Arms</em>, gave very good interview: bubbly, enthusiastic, self-depricating, inciteful, ambitious, sarcastic, &amp; very, very excited about making music exactly the way they want you, the listening throng, to hear it like they do in their heads.</p>
<p>A delightful conversation ensued, with <strong>Charles</strong> &amp; <strong>½DC</strong> bantering away about recording techniques &amp; old tyme music, &amp; <strong>Rebecca</strong> waxing lyrical on looking like <em>Phil Collins</em> &amp; just how much she loves singing. <em>Lots &amp; lots</em>, is the answer.</p>
<p>After the interview <strong>Charles </strong>congratulated<strong> ½DC</strong> on his questions &amp; general knowledge said host had of all things <strong><a href="www.myspace.com/slowclub" target="_blank"><strong>Slow Club</strong></a></strong> &amp; music overall.  Best interview in ages, so he said. Which made <strong>½DC</strong> quiite chuffed indeed.  Especially as, before that morning, <strong>½DC</strong> couldn&#8217;t for the life of him remember why he knew the name <strong><strong><a href="www.myspace.com/slowclub" target="_blank"><strong>Slow Club</strong></a> — Mr. Toad </strong></strong>had mentioned them constantly because of the interview he&#8217;d arranged, &amp; <strong>½DC</strong> &amp; <strong>TWoTH</strong> had seen them live at the <em>Anstruther Town Hall</em> the evening before &amp; <strong><strong><a href="www.myspace.com/slowclub" target="_blank"><strong>Slow Club</strong></a></strong></strong> had blown them away with a fantastic set, but <strong>½DC</strong> <em>still</em> couldn&#8217;t remember where he&#8217;d heard of them.</p>
<p>So, before the session &amp; interview, <strong>½DC </strong>sought out &amp; found the seemingly only place (in this tiny little fishing town) that had wi-fi access &amp; did a bit of on-line research.  Eventually, trawling very old <strong>TWR</strong> playlists, <strong>½DC </strong>realised he had in fact played <strong><strong><a href="www.myspace.com/slowclub" target="_blank"><strong>Slow Club</strong></a></strong></strong> way back in 2007 — their first single, no doubt.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge &amp; springing it upon <strong>Charles</strong> &amp; <strong>Rebecca </strong>during the interview, as well as having a working knowledge of <strong><strong><a href="www.myspace.com/slowclub" target="_blank"><strong>Slow Club</strong></a></strong></strong> heroes (&amp; <strong>TWR</strong>&#8217;s) <strong>Dr. Dog</strong>, won substantial Brownie points for <strong>½DC</strong> &amp; interview came off like a peach.  No idea what that means, but take it as read that the interview is a bloody cracker.

<p>On the 28th February 2009, <strong>½DC</strong> &amp; <strong>TWoTH</strong> bussed up to the O2 Academy in Birmingham, England to interview &amp; see live (for the very first time) the remarkably talented <a href="http://www.myspace.com/anebrun" target="_blank"><strong>Ane Brun</strong></a>.  <strong>TWR</strong> heard about the gig through our contact with Swedish sweetheart <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennieabrahamson" target="_blank"><strong>Jennie Abrahamson</strong></a>, whose interview with <strong>TWR</strong> can be found <a href="http://drunkcountrygent.podbean.com/2009/05/24/jennie-abrahamson-interview/" target="_blank">here</a>, who was touring as supporting artist &amp; backing singer to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/anebrun" target="_blank"><strong>Ane</strong></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As with <strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennieabrahamson" target="_blank"><strong>Jennie Abrahamson</strong></a></strong>, the interview location was a little, um, overwhelmed by the sound check cacophony permeating the ceiling from the concert hall above — that &amp; a ridiculously loud air conditioning unit that left the venue staff somewhat perplexed as to how they shut it off. All said &amp; done, &amp; with randoms running up &amp; down the wooden stairs next to us &amp; slamming in &amp; out of the main door, the interview itself is quite, quite lovely.  <strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/anebrun" target="_blank"><strong></strong></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/anebrun" target="_blank"><strong>Ane</strong></a></strong> was the perfect interviewee — charming, patient (with a few factual screw-ups voiced by your host, <strong>½DC</strong>), giggly, funny, insightful &amp; down right interesting.  She touches on her early life as a student/busker/life in Europe, becoming an independent recording artist &amp; record label owner/mogul/mentor, the early albums, touring, new ambitions, her Grammi awards, living in Sweden, the Swedish music scene &amp; pretty much everything else in between. Marvellous stuff.</p>
<p><strong>TWR</strong> thoroughly recommends you go &amp; watch <strong><strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/anebrun" target="_blank"><strong>Ane</strong></a></strong></strong>’s stunning b&amp;w video for <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=43001436" target="_blank"><strong>Don’t Leave</strong></a> — something <strong>Ane</strong> &amp; <strong>DC</strong> discussed in detail during the interview (but didn’t make the final edit). Look out for the recurring motif &amp; symmetry. Quite astonishing.</p>
<p>In all, for someone who picked up the guitar so late (during her mid-20s), <strong></strong><strong><strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/anebrun" target="_blank"><strong>Ane Brun</strong></a></strong></strong> is quite a remarkable, natural talent &amp; this interview only scratches the surface of just how brilliant she truly is.  Enjoy.

<p>On the 28th February 2009, <strong>½DC</strong> &amp; <strong>TWoTH</strong> bussed up to the O2 Academy in Birmingham, England to catch up with the delightful <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennieabrahamson" target="_blank"><strong>Jennie Abrahamson</strong></a>, who was touring as supporting artist &amp; backing singer to the brilliant <a href="http://www.myspace.com/anebrun" target="_blank"><strong>Ane Brun</strong></a>.  As usual, when outside of our comfort zone i.e. Cardiff, getting to the gig proved a tad difficult — the hotel &amp; the subsequently hailed taxi driver had never even heard of the venue&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>They eventually arrived, mid way through the sound check, &amp; met up with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennieabrahamson" target="_blank"><strong>Jennie</strong></a> who chatted away at 100mph like an old friend, which in many ways she is — <strong>½DC</strong> &amp; <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennieabrahamson" target="_blank"><strong>Jennie</strong></a> have known each other for the better part of 4 years, conversing via the net &amp; telephone, with <strong>½DC </strong>badgering <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennieabrahamson" target="_blank"><strong>Jennie</strong></a> for songs &amp; interviews &amp; plans for UK tours.  This was their first meeting face to face &amp;, given how relaxed the interview is, you wouldn&#8217;t ever know.</p>
<p><strong>½DC</strong>&#8217;s choice of interview location wasn&#8217;t the best — i.e. the downstairs bar of the O2 Academy — as the sound check upstairs bled rather profusely into the recording. During said sound check, a <strong>Phil Collins</strong> number + a spate of very heavy rock choons were played through the PA to test out the drum &amp; bass mix; most of which can be heard &amp;, indeed, are commented upon during the interview.</p>
<p>They also had to battle with a rather persistent low moaning hum from the air conditioning unit that automatically switched itself on the moment the record button was pressed.  Following an extensive search, not even the venue owners knew how to turn the damn thing off.</p>
<p>Still, they pressed on regardless to bring you a giggly, charming &amp; damn near swoonful interview full of news of a new album in the works, the Swedish music scene, general silliness &amp; an unmatched insight into what makes <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennieabrahamson" target="_blank"><strong>Jennie Abrahamson</strong></a> such an addictive personality &amp; songwriter.</p>
<p>Was there flirting?  Damn straight.

<p>On the 14th November 2008, tucked away in the Adamsdown corner of Cardiff, taking the stage at 11pm to close out the first day of the <strong>Sŵn Festival</strong>, was the astonishingly tight <strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/peteandthepirates" target="_blank"><strong>Pete &amp; The Pirates</strong></a></strong>. Following what was arguably the best gig of the festival,<strong> ½DC </strong>had the distinct pleasure of being in the mischievous company of<strong> Peter Cattermoul</strong> (bass + vocals) &amp; <strong>Jonny Sanders</strong> (drums).</p>
<p></p>
<p>With heads, focus &amp; muscular guitar pop talent screwed the right way on, <strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/peteandthepirates" target="_blank"><strong>Pete &amp; The Pirates</strong></a><strong> </strong></strong>are the genuine article.  Both <strong>Peter</strong> &amp; <strong>Jonny</strong>, despite their likely lad banter, are as professional as they come — mixing the right amount of business with pleasure in everything from the fantastic music down to chatting with a fanboy in the carpark of an Art college past midnight on a freezing, wet winter&#8217;s eve.</p>
<p>Talk of a new album, playing the <strong>SxS</strong><strong>W </strong>festival, <strong>Tap Tap</strong>, musical perfectionism, &amp; friendly compositional rivalry is tinged with their cheekiness &amp; genuine delight at what they find themselves doing as a &#8216;job&#8217;.</p>
<p>Marvelous, marvelous stuff indeed.

Following what was arguably the best gig of the festival, ½DC had the distinct pleasure of being in the mischievous company of Peter Cattermoul (bass + vocals) &#x38; Jonny Sanders (drums).



With heads, focus &#x38; muscular guitar pop talent screwed the right way on, Pete &#x38; The Pirates are the genuine article.  Both Peter &#x38; Jonny, despite their likely lad banter, are as professional as they come — mixing the right amount of business with pleasure in everything from the fantastic music down to chatting with a fanboy in the carpark of an Art college past midnight on a freezing, wet winter's eve.

Talk of a new album, playing the SxSW festival, Tap Tap, musical perfectionism, &#x38; friendly compositional rivalry is tinged with their cheekiness &#x38; genuine delight at what they find themselves doing as a 'job'.

Marvelous, marvelous stuff indeed</itunes:summary>

<p>Driving all the way from Edinburgh to Cardiff for their first ever Welsh gig, at Cardiff&#8217;s <strong>Barfly</strong>, as part of the <strong>Sŵn Festival, </strong>on November 15th 2008, were the magnificent <a href="http://www.myspace.com/brokenrecordsedinburgh" target="_blank"><strong>Broken Records</strong></a>. Prior to the roof-raising set, <strong>½DC</strong> met up with lead vocalist + guitarist + mandolin slayer <strong>Jamie Sutherland</strong> to talk long distance touring with 6 other men in hired transit vans, songwriting, pending fame &amp; the Scottish music scene.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite the interview taking place in a carpark, in the bitter winter cold, <strong>Jamie </strong>was the perfect interviewee: bouyant, witty, self-effacing, positive for the band&#8217;s immediate &amp; distant future, &amp; approriately cynical about the state of the music industry.</p>
<p>Of course, the ever astute <strong>½DC</strong> managed to make a grand tit of himself by referring to <strong>Jamie</strong> as <em><strong>Ian</strong></em> (<strong><a href="http://www.myspace.com/brokenrecordsedinburgh" target="_blank"><strong>Broken Records</strong></a></strong>&#8216; guitarist &amp; <strong>½DC</strong>&#8217;s initial contact) throughout the whole interview (skillfully removed post-prodution to spare any blushes).  Ever the gentleman, <strong>Jamie</strong> didn&#8217;t once point out the embarrassing mistake.</p>
<p>A wonderful band, now signed to <strong>4AD</strong>, with big things ahead of them.

<p>Back on November 12th 2008 <strong>½DC</strong>, <strong>Mr. Fisk</strong> + <strong>TWoTH </strong>waddled down to Cardiff&#8217;s <strong>The Point</strong> venue &amp; witnessed an absolutely shit-kicking set by the Norwegian/Swedish-transplant firebrand <a href="http://www.myspace.com/idamaria" target="_blank"><strong>Ida Maria</strong></a>. Shortly before the gig <strong>Ida</strong> holed up with <strong>Mr. Fisk</strong> to have a chat about what it means to be her, a female musician, in the male dominated music industry today.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Fisk</strong>&#8217;s choice of interview space wasn&#8217;t the greatest, we have to say (a glass fronted viewing booth above the stage), especially as the soundcheck was in full swing. Some of the sound is fairly dodgy to say the least, but we did our best to remove the worst of it in post-production.</p>
<p>Frankly, however, given the subject of the interview &amp; the sheer quality of the conversation (childhood on a remote Norwegian island, family life &amp; music, Norwegian religious tradition &amp; religion/God in general, sexism in the music industry, Art &amp; painting, &amp; a whole host of other subjects) we find it difficult to believe you&#8217;ll even notice.</p>
<p>On top of that, Ida had to set up the recording equipment for a very nerous &amp; fumbly <strong>Mr. Fisk</strong>, for he fell head over heels for <strong>Ms Maria</strong> the moment he laid eyes on her. Hell, who wouldn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen of The Listening Few, we give you the powerfully infectious <a href="http://www.myspace.com/idamaria" target="_blank"><strong>Ida Maria</strong></a> (aka the <em>Queen of The World</em>).

<p>The interview, which felt more like a conversation, touches on <strong>Pelle</strong>&#8217;s music &amp; lyric writing process, family life, musical influences, fame (&amp; the lack of) in Sweden Vs. the world, touring the Far East, &amp; his that one comparison that will not go away: <strong>Belle &amp; Sebastian</strong>.</p>
<p>Truth be told, <strong>½DC</strong> could have easily chatted for hours with such an erudite, interesting &amp; intelligent fellow.  We seriously can&#8217;t wait for <strong>Pelle</strong> to come back so we can do it all again.

<p></p>
<p>The resultant chaos (i.e. <strong>½DC</strong>&#8217;s continuing battle with modern day technology), &amp; clarity/beauty (<strong>Red Hunter</strong>&#8217;s admirable ignorance of the lack of any real point in some of the more rambling *ahem* questions +<strong> </strong>his astonishingly lovely 30minute+ set) is very much here for your absolute listening pleasure.</p>
<p>Running Order:</p>
<p><strong><em>Interview Start </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>1) The Owl (TWR Session 03.04.08) </strong></p>
<p><strong>2) The Ivori Palms </strong><strong>(TWR Session 03.04.08)</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Interview End </em></strong></p>
<p>*<em>The Fall</em> is the number <strong>Red</strong> opened with, but <strong>½DC</strong> was pissing about with the recording equipment thinking he was simply tuning up.  Of course, he wasn’t &amp; <strong>½DC</strong> missed the opener as a result. Twat.
