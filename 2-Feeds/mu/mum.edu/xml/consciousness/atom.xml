<title>Why is a Quantum Physicist Studying Consciousness?</title>
<itunes:author>Maharishi University of Management</itunes:author>
<link>http://www.mum.edu/multimedia/consciousness/physicist_consciousness.mp3</link>
<guid>http://www.mum.edu/multimedia/consciousness/physicist_consciousness.mp3</guid>
<description>Quantum physics has mathematically described our universe as being structured in layers.  Underlying all physical reality is the unmanifest Unified Field.  The human mind has the remarkable ability to fathom the finest levels of conscious thought and experience the silent level of the Unified Field. Speaker: Dr. John Hagelin is Professor of Physics and Director of the Institute of Science, Technology, and Public Policy at Maharishi University of Management. He has conducted pioneering research in fine-particle physics, and developed a highly successful grand unified field theory based on the Superstring. You may remember him from the movie What the Bleep Do We Know!?</description>
