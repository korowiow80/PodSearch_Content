			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Dreams_20081119124347.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-22059" title="Gabor Szabo - Dreams" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Dreams_20081119124347-300x300.jpg" alt="Gabor Szabo - Dreams" width="300" height="300" /></a><strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> may not have been as much of a household name as his jazz guitar counterparts (<strong>Grant Green</strong> &amp; <strong>Wes Montgomery</strong>), but the Hungarian guitarist was a highly skilled player that posessed unmatched versatility. Indeed, after starting his career as a member of the ever evolving <strong>Chico Hamilton Quintet</strong> in the early 60s, Szabo turned to Indian,Latin and psychedelic rock fusion to craft his jazz recordings as band leader on the adventurous Impulse label. However, Szabo craved more artistic freedom and along with latin vibraphonist<strong> Cal Tjader</strong> and labelmate <strong>Gary MacFarland</strong>, he co-founded <strong>Skye Records</strong> in 1969. Propelled by MacFarland&#8217;s vibrant arrangements, Gabor was able to release the album he always envisionned the aptly titled <em>Dreams</em>.</p>
<p><a id='wpaudio-4fcf0488df31b' class='wpaudio' href='http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/HeadsUp/Gabor_szabo-the_lady_in_the_moon.mp3'>Gabor Szabo &#8211; Dreams (1969)</a></p>
<p>This is the Szabo album that resonates the most with me because of the mellow and moody ambiance maintained throughout, as well as the choice to tackle a classical repertoire. Spanish composer<strong> Manuel DeFalla</strong>&#8216;s work features twice and the playing of cellist George Ricci adds depth to the songs and smoothes out the records experimentation. Much like Szabo, Ricci was used to being in the background since his brother Ruggiero (who recorded a lot of Falla&#8217;s oeuvre) was a world-class virtuoso and child prodigy. However, a quick look at George&#8217;s <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-ricci-mn0000691659/credits" target="_blank">body of work</a> shows he has rubbed elbows with the top jazz players of his era.</p>
<p>Both Ricci and Szabo push boundaries on my favorite cut <strong><em>Lady in the Moon</em></strong>. I have spent many hazy nights gazing at the stars to the mournful sounds of this etheral Szabo composition. The classical training for both musicians is evident in the long introduction, but then the jazz swing takes over and while the song remains soft and lingering, the fiery drumming and Ricci&#8217;s jazz picking keep the flame burning. Szabo&#8217;s brings his razor sharp improvisation and lays down a great solo. The freedom Szabo felt is evident in his playing, but every note is at its place and this song captures the eery magic contained in this solid record; whose artwork alone is worth the price of admission. Although Skye Records closed shop only three years after its creation, it allowed resident artists to truly express their personal vision and produced musical gems that may have otherwise remained scattered across loose composition sheets.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/333.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-22052" title="333" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/333.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="333" /></a>This is it! My first post on <strong>MIMS</strong> and I must say I&#8217;m quite honored to be part of this community of music connoisseurs. Listening to it all and appreciating sound in all its glory and its genres. Now where do I come in? Well about 3 years ago, I got into making music and in the past year began taking on the craft of being a DJ as well. I quickly realized that I was stepping into a whole new world. A world of sound I had never heard before. In no time at all, I became like that kid in a candy store. Running from isle to isle and freaking out that they had all these flavors I had never heard of! The music just spoke to me immediately in a way it never had previously in my life. Almost like I was reborn. So here I am!</p>
<p>Now along the way, I&#8217;ve researched a lot of different producers and absorbed a lot of varied sounds, old and new. One producer that stood out from day one was this guy. <strong>Cosmin TRG</strong>. Real name Cosmin Nicolae is a Romanian born, Berlin based artist who is truly an electronic music innovator. One of those artists that&#8217;s constantly redefining his sound and threw it all, always manages to maintain a clear sonic imprint unique to himself. This song off his new 4 track EP, recently released on <strong>Rush Hour</strong> called <strong>&#8220;A Universal Crush&#8221;</strong> is a EP on repeat for me right now. The vibe is impeccable and just so groovy. The tones sit just right and give you this feeling like you&#8217;re floating threw space. Real talk son. Although it maintains its dance-ability, its much deeper than that. Its truly inspiring house music!</p>
<p>Cosmin is the guy to look out for as I’m sure he has in mind to surprise us yet again with some more gems in the near future.</p>

<p>We are launching a new guest mix series that we&#8217;re pretty damn excited about! The concept is: artists, producers, DJ&#8217;s we love going back to their roots and doing a mix based on their influences rather than focusing on the strictly the new new stuff. We felt that there were already enough of those types of mix series by other mags and music websites&#8230; So, we are kicking it off in style. Our first mix is from a true legend of all UK-isms.</p>
<p><strong>Zed Bias</strong> also known as <strong>Maddslinky</strong> was very excited to get started with the challenge and as he said: &#8220;I could do about 10 of these!&#8221; So here it is, a look into into his foundations and influences as a music lover first and foremost!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://fieldwerk.com/"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-22014" title="jellp_large" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jellp_large-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>These days, way too many hip-hop acts try to make their production sound as “big” as possible often opting for a more polished over-produced sound. So in that sense, Lo-Fi instrumental hiphop albums only available on vinyl form is a bit on an oddball.</p>
<p>One guy that certainly is synonymous with the lofi sound is  <strong>Jel</strong>. He was part of the indie rap renaissance of the beginning of the century, being a part of the <strong>Anticon</strong> crew and being a close collaborator of <strong>Dose One</strong>. Incidentally, the vibe of this release reminds me of fellow Anticonien <strong>Odd Nosdam</strong> but less experimental and more focused.</p>
<p>But here is the man himself talking about his most recent project.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4L3kA6N1i88" frameborder="0" width="600" height="450"></iframe></p>
<p>The &#8220;vinyl only&#8221; part can be explained by the release on the excellent <a href="http://fieldwerk.com/"><strong>Fieldwork</strong></a> label. It isn&#8217;t a very old label but they already have released some of the nicest instrumental hiphop records (because they really are records!) of the last years. For example, the <strong>Zavala</strong> produced <em>The Dark Time Sunshine Vessel Instrumentals</em> last year was as strong as the &#8220;real&#8221; <strong>Darktime Sunshine</strong> joint. The split record by <strong>Edison</strong> and <strong>Lazerbeak</strong> (from <strong>Doomtree</strong>) is quite something and clearly points to another direction than the west coast post-dilla sound.</p>
<p>To give you a rockish idea of the sound of this release:</p>

Just in time for our documentary on the Montreal Beat Scene called &#8220;Piu Piu&#8221; another one of our homegrown heavyweights, <strong>VLooper &amp; Modlee</strong> are dropping a wonderful project and this time it&#8217;s a release through the good people of <strong><a href="http://soulection.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Soulection</a></strong> from Cali. V&amp;M are pretty much Quebec&#8217;s equivalent to G&amp;D (Georgia Ann Muldrow &amp; Declaime). Real recognizing real! We like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although their chemistry in sound is undeniable, their connection is much deeper. These two are a supreme duo that are sonically connected personally through love and the music that they create together.</p>
<p><strong>VLOOPER</strong> is part of the Alaclair Ensemble who have a deep progressive momentum that is spreading worldwide. His solo work and collaboration release ‘Analog Love’ with <strong>Modlee</strong> was a great success in 2010.</p>
<p>This track is a special cover of <strong>Bilal</strong>&#8216;s &#8216;All Matter&#8217;. The whole vibe of this EP has a future-soul and forward thinking sound direction that compliments Modlee’s vocals. Modlee compliments the depth and style of Vlooper’s productions. Look out for this to drop on <a href="http://soulection.bandcamp.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">soulection.bandcamp.com</a>&#8220;</p>

Perfect for those sweaty summer nights, whether you are dancing bare feet on the grass, or half naked in a dirty after-hours where clothes have become a hinderance, S.E.X. is highly likely to occur. </p>
<p>The 12” is solid around the block, with collaborative remixes by<strong> Omar-S</strong> and<strong> Aaron “Fix” Siegel</strong> .The track that clearly shines, however, is the <strong>C.G.P</strong>. mix, in which simplicity accents the steamy vocals with a sense of finesse and respect for Omar-Sian soundwaves. It cleary echoes previous productions by the man himself, so much so that it make one wonder if Constant Gardens Posse is an alias, seeing that there is virtually no info on the name. </p>
<p>With a seductively bouncy bass line, tickling taps of the hats, and the smoothest vocal I’ve heard in a bit (courtesy of the beautiful L’Renne), a minimalist orgasm of the ear is induced every time needle taps dat wax. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BBNG11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19366" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="Loni Schick Photography, Toronto Photographer" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BBNG11.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="284" /></a></p>
<p>It all started with a YouTube video. Three young men flipped <strong>Odd Future</strong> songs into a jazz medley in an abandoned apartment. The drummer wore a pig mask. They were christened the Odd Trio via cardboard sign.</p>
<p><strong>Toronto</strong> residents Matthew A. Tavares, Chester Hansen and Alex Sowinski first met in <strong>Humber College</strong>’s Music Performance program, bonding over a common love for Odd Future, Gucci Mane and Lil B. They began jamming casually and the Odd Trio was assembled. <strong>Matthew A. Tavares</strong> on piano and synths, and bassist <strong>Chester Hansen</strong> and <strong>Alex Sowinski</strong> on skins. Tavares and Sowinski also do double duty on sampler for instrumental beat freakouts in their live shows.</p>
<div class="toggle-box-wrapper">

<h4 class="toggle">Bio</h4>
<div class="toggle-content" style="width:Width of toggle boxpx;">The first Odd Trio video became a viral sensation and they began to cultivate a devoted fanbase through YouTube, Twitter, and Tumblr. The trio dropped the new videos on the regular and millions of hits later, the newly recristened Badbadnotgood released their self-titled EP in June. The Badbadnotgood EP mixed up the two Odd Future medleys, the original “Salmonella” and an inspired cover of Waka Flocka Flame’s “Hard In The Paint”; Tavares subs keys for Lex Luger’s menacing synths while Sowinski becomes a human drum machine. Hansen shines whether supplying the pumping bass of “Orange Juice” or effortless in-pocket swing of “Electric Relaxation”.</p>
<p>Inspired equally by <strong>Lil B, Waka Flocka Flame, John Coltrane</strong> and <strong>Robert Glasper</strong>, Badbadnotgood find the post-bop in Big Apple classics (Nas’ “The World Is Yours”, Gang Starr’s “Mass Appeal”, Tribe’s “Electric Relaxation”), Zelda themes and the off-kilter electronic of Flying Lotus (“Camel”).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/badbadnotgoodSMALLER.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-19367" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="badbadnotgoodSMALLER" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/badbadnotgoodSMALLER.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="151" /></a></p>
<p>These are hip hop standards but they aren’t sacred.” “Mass Appeal” bleeds into a throbbing run through Joy Division’s “Transmission”. On “Electric Relaxation”, Sowinski swaps drums for a half-empty 40 oz, the Olde English falling perfectly in pitch. They were strictly a studio creation until mid September, where BBNG sold out their debut show at Toronto’s Red Light Club; that same day, the band dropped their debut full length BBNG on Bandcamp, mixing more rap covers (including a warm, swaying take on Slum Village’s “Fall In Love”) with Zelda covers and a host of originals, including Sowinski’s ominous sampler workout “Freedom/Billium Evans”. The Needle Drop’s Anthony Fantano was effusive in his praise for the album: “I’m excited about what this LP means for jazz, what it means for hip hop, and what it means for music fans”.</p>
<p>Coming off a high profile spot opening for jazz legend Roy Ayers in November, the band are prepping for a big 2012: next January, BBNG played Gilles Peterson’s Worldwide Awards show in London, alongside Thundercat and SBTRK. Besides their next mixtape, the trio are also working with Toronto producer Frank Dukes (50 Cent, Danny Brown, Ghostface Killah) and set to record more tracks with Odd Future in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>This isn’t jazz rap. This isn’t a cover band. It’s Badbadnotgood, based jazz for your soul and your mind.</strong></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/joe-bataan-singn-some-soul-front.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21967" title="joe-bataan-singn-some-soul-front" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/joe-bataan-singn-some-soul-front-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><strong>Joe Bataan</strong>, the Afro-filipino vocalist and self-proclaimed King of Latin Soul has released many classic records during an illustrious career that includes 15 albums covering a variety of musical stylings from <strong>Boogaloo</strong> (Subway Joe) to <strong>Disco-Rap</strong> (Rap-O-Clapo). However even if Bataan is famous for uptempo dancefloor hits (Latin Strut), I first discovered his work through the single <strong>My Cloud</strong> off his incredible soul album Singing Some Soul (Fania-375, 1972).</p>
<p>It was the lush intro filled with a full string and brass ensemble that immediately caught my attention when i needle-dropped the 45. Then Joe&#8217;s unique voice brought palpable emotion to this sweet soul ballad and I knew I had found a slow jam keeper. However, I was surprised that this soulful track was released on <strong>Fania</strong> a Nuyorican label known for it&#8217;s salsa dura and bad boy boogaloo. It turns out that after taking on the latin competition (labels Tico and Allegre), Fania label head Jerry Mascucci ambitiously decided to go after Motown and release an Rythm &amp; Blues record. They approached Bataan, one of their top vocalists, because of his powerful voice and ability to cover soul tracks (he had already done so with Smokey Robinson’s Riot! and The Impressions’ Gypsy Woman). After picking the songs, Fania assembled an all-star team of musicians such as Nina Simone collaborator Harold Wheeler, guitarist Cornell Dupree and soul drummer extraordinaire Bernard Purdie for the session.</p>
<p><a id='wpaudio-4fcf0488eed22' class='wpaudio' href='http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/HeadsUp/Joe Bataan - My cloud.mp3'>Joe Bataan &#8211; My Cloud (1972)</a></p>
<p>The resulting record ranks highly with soul collectors but was not popular with the barrio crowd so its sales were not impressive, leading to its current scarcity on the vinyl market. I was lucky enough to be hooked up by Good Records NYC’s owner with a 5$ mono copy! It quickly became one of my favorite LPs because of its consistency, the collection of stellar soul tracks and the doo-wop lowrider feel that transcends the album, in sharp contrast with the majority of Bataan’s recordings. Some of the record’s most powerful tracks are Bataan’s own compositions (Unwed Mother, Young Gifted &amp; Brown) which carry a deeper social message, however my go-to song in the syrupy O’Jays ballad (I’ll Be Sweeter Tommorow) which happens to be the song chosen for my wedding’s first dance.</p>
<p>Although Joe Bataan can never be forgotten (if you witnessed his Afro-Latin Soul performance last september you know he’s still got it) and his career is still going strong (Pick up his King of Latin Soul compilation for an overview) Singing Some Soul never got a chance to truly shine. Up to recently it was his only album to never be reissued, but the good folks at Fania (going through a renaissance of their own at the moment) have included two bonus tracks and stellar liner notes so that, finally, this treasured recording can be shared with latin-soul fans all over the globe.</p>

<p><strong>Wax Poetics 51 is an all-hip-hop issue with two different covers. Cover 1: Microphone icon Nas b/w Detroit rapper Danny Brown. Limited-Edition Cover 2: No Limit Records (cover feature on production team Beats by the Pound) b/w Ishmael Butler’s new project, Shabazz Palaces. Features on Kurtis Blow, El-P, the Roots, Killer Mike, Robert Glasper, and Coke La Rock. Also in this issue: Oddisee, G-Side, THEESatisfaction, Cities Aviv, and Gangrene (Alchemist &amp; Oh No).</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.waxpoetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Nas-51.jpg" rel="lightbox[28060]"><img class="alignleft" title="Nas-51" src="http://www.waxpoetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Nas-51.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" /></a><strong>The Illest. </strong>Nasir Jones dropped his 1994 debut <em>Illmatic</em> as a living legend. And his use of several superstar producers on the same album set a hip-hop precendent that forever changed the game. Ever the visionary, Nas found stratospheric success with his follow-up albums by defining mafioso rap and embracing a burgeoning NYC production style that some saw as commercial but was really the mark of a new era. Almost two decades later, Nas remains at the top of the list when the conversation turns to MCs, lyricists, and simply who’s the illest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.waxpoetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BBTP-51.jpg" rel="lightbox[28060]"><img class="alignleft" title="BBTP-51" src="http://www.waxpoetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BBTP-51.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" /></a><strong>Fire on the Bayou. </strong>With one foot in the Bay Area and another in his native New Orleans, Master P masterminded a multimillion-dollar independent record label that moved gold and platinum hits by the trunkload. Signing a wealth of homegrown talent, No Limit Records came to define a distinctive Southern rap aesthetic thanks to unique album covers and hot tracks from the production mob Beats by the Pound. This is their story.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.waxpoetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Danny-Brown-51.jpg" rel="lightbox[28060]"><img class="alignleft" title="Danny-Brown-51" src="http://www.waxpoetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Danny-Brown-51.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" /></a><strong>Last Call.</strong> Detroiter Danny Brown grew up with hip-hop. He rapped while still in kindergarten, got hipped to the Wu-Tang Clan by his house DJ father, and came up trying to sound like Nas. After absorbing all forms of hip-hop nationwide, Brown developed multiple rap styles, not abiding by any predisposed ideas of the art form. He didn’t drop his first record until he was in his late twenties, but now after releasing joints with Tony Yayo and hometown producer Black Milk—as well as his own breakout album, 2010’s <em>The Hybrid</em>, and last year’s <em>XXX</em>—he has found his own voice and individuality. Danny Brown enters his thirties with newfound success and a fresh perspective.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.waxpoetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Shabazz-511.jpg" rel="lightbox[28060]"><img class="alignleft" title="Shabazz-51" src="http://www.waxpoetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Shabazz-511.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="140" /></a>Spectral Presence.</strong> Ishmael Butler effortlessly made his mark on hip-hop in 1993 with his unique voice and delivery, and the overall musical aesthetic of his group, Digable Planets. After two stellar albums, the Planets disbanded and Butler left Brooklyn, disappearing to his native Seattle, emerging briefly in 2003 with Cherrywine—his short-lived band that was ten years ahead of its time—only to fade into the shadows again. Recently, that familiar voice crept back into our consciousness as a mysterious project popped up called Shabazz Palaces. After two EPs and now an LP on Sub Pop, Butler is finally surfacing and making his true presence known, even if it will take another ten years for it to be fully felt.</p>

<p>Following on from <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/jessefuterman" target="_blank">Jesse Futerman</a></strong>&#8216;s debut EP, <a href="http://soundcloud.com/juslikemusic/jesse-futerman-super-basement" target="_blank">Super Basement</a>, last year, he&#8217;s now back with <strong>Fuse The Witches</strong> - a 7-track EP that builds further upon his distinctive jazz-breaks sound.</p>
<p>Having already received high praise from the likes of Gilles Peterson, OkayPlayer, 3hive, Potholes In My Blog, Pinboard Blog, and a slew of other high profile DJs, publications and blogs, Jesse Futerman shows no signs of slowing down!</p>
<p>In his own words; &#8221;With Fuse The Witches I am attempting to keep the sound of Super Basement while creating a more varied listening experience; I&#8217;ve sampled from a wider array of sources such as records from my father&#8217;s collection as well as numerous film soundtracks. Despite this, I think I&#8217;ve managed to retain a strong jazzy sound while perhaps creating a more cohesive release overall. I&#8217;d like to thank my family, friends, and collaborators, without whom my music would not exist, as well my label manager Gavin for always believing in me and giving me a platform from which to reach you. I hope you enjoy listening to this EP as much as I enjoyed making it. Let&#8217;s not forget the Stine Supreme&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>DOIN&#8217; IT IN THE PARK: PICK-UP BASKETBALL, NYC</strong> explores the definition, history, culture and social impact of New York&#8217;s summer b-ball scene, widely recognized as the worldwide &#8220;Mecca&#8221; of the sport.</p>
<p>In New York City, pick-up basketball is not just a sport. It is a way of life. There are 700+ outdoor courts, and an estimated 500,000 players, the most loyal of which approach the game as a religion, and the playground as their church.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can play high school or college for four years. You can play Pro for a decade. You can play pick-up &#8230; for life.&#8221;</p>
<p>DOIN&#8217; IT IN THE PARK: PICK-UP BASKETBALL, NYC lovingly uncovers this movement through the voices of playground legends, NBA athletes, and most importantly the common ballplayer who all day looks forward to calling &#8220;next&#8221; game at their local schoolyard.</p>
<p>Co-directors Bobbito Garcia and Kevin Couliau visited 180 courts throughout NYC&#8217;s five boroughs to create their debut documentary. They traveled to a majority of the locations by bicycle, carrying camera equipment and a ball in their backpacks. The film&#8217;s title refers as much to the subject matter as it does to the method of filmmaking, providing an unprecedented perspective on urban America&#8217;s most popular, and accessible, free recreation.</p>
<p>Main film characters: Julius &#8220;Dr. J&#8221; Erving, Kenny Smith, &#8220;Pee Wee&#8221; Kirkland, &#8220;Fly&#8221; Williams, God Shammgod, Tim &#8220;Headache&#8221; Gittens, Corey &#8220;Homicide&#8221; Williams, Kenny Anderson, Jack Ryan, Richard &#8220;Crazy Legs&#8221; Colon, Niki Avery, Milani Malik, and the Park Pick-Up Players of NYC.</p>
<p>Cameras : Canon 5D Mark II, 1D Mark IV<br />
Lenses : Canon 24-70mm f/2.8, Canon 70-200mm f/2.8, Canon 15mm Fisheye f/2.8, Canon TS-E 45mm f/2.8<br />
Slider : Glidetrack HD Shooter</p>
<p>Directed &#038; Produced by Bobbito Garcia &#038; Kevin Couliau<br />
Trailer Music: &#8220;R’Thentic&#8221; by C-Rayz Walz<br />
Proudly Supported by The New York Knicks</p>
<p>&#8220;DOIN&#8217; IT IN THE PARK: PICK-UP BASKETBALL, NYC&#8221;<br />
A film by Bobbito Garcia &#038; Kevin Couliau<br />
Coming Summer 2012</p>

Very odd yet beautiful slice of synthesized experimental soul music from a group called <strong>Spontaneous Overthrow</strong>. </p>
<p>Nathaniel Woolridge and Anthony Freeman, two friends from Newark, New Jersey decided to press this LP on their start up label called <strong>New Ark</strong> (clever). Only a few hundred copies were pressed and given its experimental nature, it’s not a surprise that it wasn’t a commercial hit. After all, other singers like <strong>Shuggie Otis</strong> had done the cosmic soul thing and it was just always a bit too out there for the masses. </p>
<p>But we’re all music lovers here so let tell you about this. If you love guys like <strong>Sa-Ra Creative Partners</strong> then you need to hear this one. Very abstract and cosmic approach to soul with great experimentation of early synths and drum machines. Honestly, don’t even try to find the original LP (but hey you can still dream about it) but instead you can grab a copy of this on a recent compilation called <a href="http://www.discogs.com/buy/Vinyl/Various-Personal-Space-Electronic-Soul-1974-1984/61221895?ev=bp_titl" target="_blank">Personal Space : Electronic Soul from 1974 to 1984</a></p>

A brand new one from Bristol producer <strong><a href="http://soundcloud.com/kahn" target="_blank">KAHN</a></strong> (of the Young Echo Collective), not to be confused with the also dope KUHN. Kahn has also previously released stellar stuff on <strong>Punch Drunk</strong> and <strong>Box Clever</strong>.</p>
<p>Got the promo of this one from <strong>Idle Hands</strong> a little while ago but I finally got around to listening to it and was totally knocked over. It stood out of the 200 tracks I listened to.</p>
<p>As a pretty hardcore fan and DJ from the original UK Garage / 2 step movement I sometimes take offense to more recent productions that completly rip off the styles of UKG pioneers like Jeremy Sylvester, Tuff Jam, El-B and so on. But this one is different.</p>
<p>Yes, it does conjure memories of <strong>Steve Gurley</strong> productions but what is great about it is that it doesn&#8217;t sound like ripoff, it doesn&#8217;t just do the nostalgia thing. The vocal layering à la James Blake, Mount Kimbie is not something you used to find back then too much. So in that sense, you get a bit of old and new&#8230; And all kinds of awesome. No laptop speakers for this one!</p>
<p>This is going to end up on our top 50 tracks list of the year that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/monkeysandsynthesizers-640x294.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-21877" title="monkeysandsynthesizers-640x294" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/monkeysandsynthesizers-640x294.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="235" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdigitalmusic.com" target="_blank">via CreateDigitalMusic.com</a>: &#8220;Composer and Swedish dance music maestro <strong>Håkan Libdo</strong> has been a constant source of experimentation. But his latest project yields zoo-like new adventurousness. Six species of monkeys are equipped with synthesizers to test the question of whether playing a synth is really playing music – or if it’s so simple, a monkey can do it.</p>
<p>Describing the project, there’s a bit of a defense of the complexity of the instrument:</p>
<p>“You just press a button and out comes music, right?” Well… you do press buttons, twist knobs and faders, but there are endless ways of doing this. That is why the synthesizer is one of the greatest example of human ingenuity and engineering — something that makes us different from the monkeys.</p>
<p>You obviously can’t just break into the monkey cage with some finds from eBay and try this yourself. Lest you think there was some animal cruelty involved, Skansen Aquarium in Stockholm was a collaborator in the film. Here’s a look at what happens – the Bliptronic is to me the clear winner as a monkey-playable instrument, and in the end, some keyboards just … lose.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PRbWW-HZd0Q?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>It’s all a teaser – and a clever one – for Sweden’s <a href="http://voltfestivalen.se/" target="_blank">Voltfestivalen</a>, coming up June 9. Edited by Simon Carlgren, concept by Håkan Lidbo.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t answer whether monkeys can be DJs… or Paris Hilton, for that matter. (She announced her debut <a href="http://www.factmag.com/2012/05/28/paris-hiltons-first-dance-single-is-here/" target="_blank">DJ set date today</a> and was, perhaps, met with more skepticism than these adorable zoo animals.)</p>

<p>It all started with a YouTube video. Three young men flipped <strong>Odd Future</strong> songs into a jazz medley in an abandoned apartment. The drummer wore a pig mask. They were christened the Odd Trio via cardboard sign.</p>
<p><strong>Toronto</strong> residents Matthew A. Tavares, Chester Hansen and Alex Sowinski first met in <strong>Humber College</strong>’s Music Performance program, bonding over a common love for Odd Future, Gucci Mane and Lil B. They began jamming casually and the Odd Trio was assembled. <strong>Matthew A. Tavares</strong> on piano and synths, and bassist <strong>Chester Hansen</strong> and <strong>Alex Sowinski</strong> on skins. Tavares and Sowinski also do double duty on sampler for instrumental beat freakouts in their live shows.</p>
<div class="toggle-box-wrapper">
<div class="toggle-box">
<h4 class="toggle">Bio</h4>
<div class="toggle-content" style="width:Width of toggle boxpx;">The first Odd Trio video became a viral sensation and they began to cultivate a devoted fanbase through YouTube, Twitter, and Tumblr. The trio dropped the new videos on the regular and millions of hits later, the newly recristened Badbadnotgood released their self-titled EP in June. The Badbadnotgood EP mixed up the two Odd Future medleys, the original “Salmonella” and an inspired cover of Waka Flocka Flame’s “Hard In The Paint”; Tavares subs keys for Lex Luger’s menacing synths while Sowinski becomes a human drum machine. Hansen shines whether supplying the pumping bass of “Orange Juice” or effortless in-pocket swing of “Electric Relaxation”.</p>
<p>Inspired equally by <strong>Lil B, Waka Flocka Flame, John Coltrane</strong> and <strong>Robert Glasper</strong>, Badbadnotgood find the post-bop in Big Apple classics (Nas’ “The World Is Yours”, Gang Starr’s “Mass Appeal”, Tribe’s “Electric Relaxation”), Zelda themes and the off-kilter electronic of Flying Lotus (“Camel”).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/badbadnotgoodSMALLER.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-19367" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="badbadnotgoodSMALLER" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/badbadnotgoodSMALLER.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="151" /></a></p>
<p>These are hip hop standards but they aren’t sacred.” “Mass Appeal” bleeds into a throbbing run through Joy Division’s “Transmission”. On “Electric Relaxation”, Sowinski swaps drums for a half-empty 40 oz, the Olde English falling perfectly in pitch. They were strictly a studio creation until mid September, where BBNG sold out their debut show at Toronto’s Red Light Club; that same day, the band dropped their debut full length BBNG on Bandcamp, mixing more rap covers (including a warm, swaying take on Slum Village’s “Fall In Love”) with Zelda covers and a host of originals, including Sowinski’s ominous sampler workout “Freedom/Billium Evans”. The Needle Drop’s Anthony Fantano was effusive in his praise for the album: “I’m excited about what this LP means for jazz, what it means for hip hop, and what it means for music fans”.</p>
<p>Coming off a high profile spot opening for jazz legend Roy Ayers in November, the band are prepping for a big 2012: next January, BBNG played Gilles Peterson’s Worldwide Awards show in London, alongside Thundercat and SBTRK. Besides their next mixtape, the trio are also working with Toronto producer Frank Dukes (50 Cent, Danny Brown, Ghostface Killah) and set to record more tracks with Odd Future in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>This isn’t jazz rap. This isn’t a cover band. It’s Badbadnotgood, based jazz for your soul and your mind.</strong></div>

When you&#8217;re a kid in Montreal, summer is official once they open public pools. But I guess for adults the equivalent would be <strong>Piknic Electronik</strong> and Mutek.</p>
<p>The <strong>13th edition</strong> of Mutek promises to be a good one! There are some legends and some newcomers. A few very interesting venues around Montreal, some inside some outside. Some events will challenge your ears, others your eyes and if you go to the pannel discussions you might even learn a thing or two.</p>
<p>So here are our picks as far as what to check out. Keeping in mind that we don&#8217;t pretend to know all the acts, we will surely discover a lot of great artists we had never heard of before. The good news is that there are tons of great<strong> free events</strong>, in fact 4 of our 7 picks are free shows!</p>
<h3>Wednesday May 30th</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-21849" title="225416_223352254357145_154677634557941_902369_4000582_n" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/225416_223352254357145_154677634557941_902369_4000582_n1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p><strong>The Gulf Stream</strong><br />
17:00 &#8220;Metro Art 1&#8243;<br />
Berri-UQAM Metro / FREE</p>
<p>Been a big fan of the Gulf Stream boys ever since they opened for a Mary Anne Hobbs show we organized. They are also playing an indoor gig but to me this is the highlight of the first day.</p>
<div class="divider">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Thursday, May 31st</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Coloring.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-21855" title="Coloring" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Coloring-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Simon Called Peter &#8211; Leboeuf et Laviolette &#8211; Bernardino Femminielli</strong><br />
17:00 &#8220;Expérience 2&#8243;<br />
Place de la Paix / FREE</p>
<p>I was really impressed the very first time I saw Leboeuf &amp; Laviolette do their live remix on the fly project. Also looking to catch Simon Called Peter because I keep hearing good things about him and I’ve never caught him live.</p>
<p><strong>Shackleton &#8211; Monolake &#8211; Jeff Mills</strong><br />
<strong>RBMA Stage: Sibian &amp; Faun &#8211; Shlohmo &#8211; Salva &#8211; Nouveau Palais &#8211; Paul White</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.mutek.org/en/festival/2012/events/672-nocturne-2" target="_blank"> 10:00 pm &#8220;NOCTURNE 2&#8243;</a><br />
Métropolis / $40</p>
<p>Usually I’m against high door prices for electronic music shows but in this case it’s really worth it. You get a whopping 8 artists that are either established legends like Shackleton &amp; Jeff Mills or upcoming cats like Salva and Shlohmo. Personnally, the guy I’m really looking forward to hearing is Paul White. There isn’t a lot of hip-hop oriented “beats” stuff this year but this is really a solid booking.</p>

<div class="divider">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Friday June 1st</h3>
<p><strong>Kenlo Craqnuques</strong><br />
17:00 &#8220;Metro Art 3&#8243;<br />
Berri-UQAM Metro / FREE</p>
<p>I’m not sure that most people in the Quebec music scene understand how much of a genius Kenlo is. Well, thankfully Mutek gets it.</p>
<p><strong>Nicolas Jaar &#8211; Jimmy Edgar &#8211; more&#8230;<br />
RBMA Stage: Nautiluss &#8211; BNJMN &#8211; Kode9</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.mutek.org/en/festival/2012/events/676-nocturne-3" target="_blank"> 10:00 pm &#8220;NOCTURNE 3&#8243;</a><br />
Métropolis / $40</p>
<p>Another absolutely packed lineup. Again, the RBMA stage is pure magic from start to finish. I’m a big fan of BNJMN especially. Matching Jimmy Edgar and Nicolas Jaar’s live show is also a great idea, both dudes being unbelievably talented young producers.</p>
<p><object style="height: 390px; width: 640px;" width="640" height="360" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yvVWE8kf3SQ?version=3&amp;feature=player_detailpage" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed style="height: 390px; width: 640px;" width="640" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yvVWE8kf3SQ?version=3&amp;feature=player_detailpage" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" /></object></p>
<div class="divider">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Saturday June 2nd</h3>
<p><strong>Basic Soul Unit, Danuel Tate, KINK</strong><br />
2: 00 pm &#8220;Expérience 4&#8243;<br />
Place de la Paix / FREE</p>
<p>Big big fan of Toronto’s Basic Soul Unit, huge fan of Danuel Tate who is also a member of Cobblestone Jazz. Add to that Bulgaria’s KINK who we’ve been talking about a lot here and the fact that it’s free.</p>
<div class="divider">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Sunday June 3rd</h3>
<p><strong>Wolf+Lamb</strong><br />
Second Stage<br />
<strong>Mathew Jonson &amp; The Mole</strong><br />
2:00 pm &#8220;Mutek Piknic&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.mutek.org/en/festival/2012/events/681-mutek-piknic" target="_blank"> Jean-Drapeau Park / 12$</a></p>
<p>I like Wolf &amp; Lamb as much as the next guy, but you can catch us at the second stage all day for The Mole &amp; Mathew Jonson</p>

Before being introduced to this one track I had absolutely no idea about the existence of this group, yet I am a fairly knowledgable hip-hop head. But now, thanks to the homie <strong>Dj Cosmo</strong>, we have three albums from <strong>Mountain Brothers</strong> to dig into!</p>
<p>The were a group (until 2003) that formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Named after the legend of 108 mountain bandits depicted in the Chinese novel Water Margin. So beyond the whole asian crew thing, they were a group that was mostly known for not relying on samples, instead creating their own instrumentation like the one you hear on &#8220;Paperchase&#8221;. Your first instinct is to say, wow what&#8217;s this sample?? Roy Ayers? Mizell Brothers? Nah it&#8217;s actually original music. Sadly, still to this day, this doesn&#8217;t happen often enough in hip-hop.</p>
<p>I did know about one important member from the group though, <strong>CHOPS</strong>, who I did have a bunch of records from and is still active in the rap game.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about the M.O.N.E.Y why must everything revolve around the penny.&#8221;</em></p>

Each DJ from the 4th edition introduced us to some gems that we probably would have missed and will now beat on regular rotation for years to come. Each 24HOV event is usually an intensive crash course in forgotten treasures. </p>
<p>So let’s start with one track from the nighttime set from none other than <strong>Christian Pronovost</strong>. As we expected, CP killed us with so many different angles, so many dancefloor weapons. From forgotten 80’s B-sides to dancefloor jazz but this is one of those that had us running to the booth to ask what the hell this was.</p>
<p>So let us introduce you (well if you didn’t know it yet) to <strong>David Benoit</strong>’s “<strong>Life is like a Samba</strong>” a 1979 track which came out on AVI and is an absolute rare groove classic in the London Jazz Dance scene. We will always remember than we discovered this track at 2am in a dark record store but it felt like a sunny day on the beach for about 5 minutes.</p>

Another edition of our beloved <strong><a href="http://www.24hoursofvinyl.com" target="_blank">24 Hours of Vinyl</a></strong> events has passed. The <strong>4th edition</strong> was broadcasted in a new venue and mostly with DJ&#8217;s who hadn&#8217;t played the event yet but the feeling I think we all have looking back on it after a good nights sleep is the same as the first three: A truly deep experience of musical sharing between music junkies.</p>
<p>Yes, the fact that it&#8217;s a vinyl only thing is a big part of it: it brings the DJ back to his roots, reconnects them to their collection. But it&#8217;s not the primary point of this event. Beyond the whole Vinyl is better than any other format argument the <strong>24HOV</strong> events are about life changing music discoveries. It might sound cheesy but every time I finish one these I am floating on a cloud for a little while&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>THANK YOUs</strong>: All of the DJ&#8217;s, to Dan @ Death of Vinyl, Philippe Sawicki, Scion Sessions, the guys @ Tonton, 10Kilos&#8230; and of course to all the listeners! (and to the wonderful MF Gold for the great little video recap below)</p>
<p><strong>SORRY</strong>: We had a few problems with our broadcasting options and doing it through UStream was really the very last option we had. We absolutely hate those ads as much as you did and promise never to do it on that platform again.</p>
<p>Mucho Love<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.neferiu.com/destar-reconstructedmemories"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-21800" style="margin: 5px; border: 0pt none;" title="542425_10151693544880431_317061015430_23778376_2021687189_n" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/542425_10151693544880431_317061015430_23778376_2021687189_n-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>These days in Quebec, it seems like a perfect time to reminisce about the past.  You could think that the second album from <strong>DSTR</strong>, called <em>Reconstructed Memories</em> which is made from sampling of Quebec recordings spanning from the 50&#8242;s throught the 80&#8242;s is a little gimmicky. But that would be without considering that the ambitious project was started some years ago, well before any social troubles indicate timely relevance.</p>
<p>Listening to the album, I thought about <strong>Onra</strong> sampling his cultural roots to make his two <em>Chinoiseries</em> albums. The eastern europe sampling <em>Dr. No’s Oxperiment</em> from <strong>Oh No</strong> is also another exemple of a targeted cultural audio experiment. More in the concept then in the sound though because the sound of <strong>Destar</strong>&#8216;s first album, <em>Chopped Suite</em>, is closer to those albums then this one. What makes this album interesting, and beyond a simple remix compilation is that all the original sources of the sounds are unrecognizable and the tracks sound like original music. There is definitely the same Destar feel that was one the first album. The same attention to details. In that respect, he is the best beatmaker for this kind of project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty honored to be his label mate on British Colombia&#8217;s <a href="www.neferiu.com/">Neferiu Records</a>. I made this mix of some of the tracks of the album.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F47341145&amp;show_artwork=true" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="166"></iframe></p>
<p>You can get the album in digital form on Neferiu&#8217;s website for a measly 5$. I would love an LP version of this (and Destar probably is also because of the perfect lenght for a double LP of the album at 75 minutes).</p>
<p>There is a video in the work and knowing that he&#8217;s also a graphic designer, it should be nice. That being said, you can watch the little teaser annoucing the album in loop to wait! (and don&#8217;t forget to listen to the album after!)</p>

<p>What started last December out as a pretty wacky idea to beat the winter blues has turned into one of the most rewarding and fun projects we’ve done in the 5 years since the creation Music Is My Sanctuary.</p>
<p>The concept is pretty simple, invite some of our friends to share some of their favorite music in an intimate setting. Oh yeah, and broadcast the whole audio / video for 24 hours straight! Yes, it is a vinyl only event and although there is a certain magic about the one format that just won’t die the event is about more than that. It’s just about a deep appreciation of music, and the joy of sharing it with others.</p>
<p>So far, the response has been nothing short of amazing. People from all over the world are tuning in (over 4,000 for every edition so far) and some of them stay on pretty much the whole 24 hours. Also, pretty much every single DJ has taken the challenge very seriously and left feeling very inspired after rekindling with their first love; vinyl.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/UK_HH_82-93_Mixtape.230512.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21794" title="UK_HH_82-93_Mixtape.230512" src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/UK_HH_82-93_Mixtape.230512-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a></strong><a href="http://www.factmag.com" target="_blank">via FACTMAG.com</a>: <strong>Vintage homegrown hip-hop doesn’t often get the attention – or, indeed, the kudos – it frequently deserves.</strong></p>
<p>In order to redress the balance, XL boss Richard Russell (most recently heard behind the boards on Bobby Womack’s <em>The Bravest Man In The Universe</em>) has teamed up with associate Trevor Jackson to curate a wide-ranging mix of the stuff. The set covers a range of hip-hop released between 1982 and 1993. The<em> UK Hip Hop 82/93 Mixtape</em> is a salutary reminder what a diverse (not to mention downright <em>odd</em>) scene this was: Malcolm Mclaren/Buffalo Gals and Art Of Noise nudge up against Blade and Demon Boyz. Massive Attack, Blade and Derek B all feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russell gave us the lowdown on the project: “I met an aspiring DJ and Graphic Designer called Trevor Jackson when we worked in Loppylugs Record Shop in Edgware together as teenagers. We bonded over a love of rap music, particularly anything British we could get our hands on. To celebrate that moment, a few months ago Trevor and I chose the records to go on an Eighties UK Rap mixtape. We did this live on uStream.We went into the early 90′s also as that period was especially good for British rap, leading into hardcore and rave. Since then I mixed everything, Trevor did the cassette inlay artwork, and we made a handful of tapes”.</p>
<p>You can watch said Ustream recording <strong><a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/18376446" target="_blank">here</a></strong>. Only fifty copies of the tape are in existence, some of which went on sale at last weekend’s wonderful <strong><a href="http://www.factmag.com/2012/04/11/independent-label-market-returns-to-london-in-may/" target="_blank">Independent Label Market</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>FACT have managed to secure five copies to give away. If you’d like to grab yourself one of the super-limited tapes, send an email through to <a href="mailto:competitions@thevinylfactory.com" target="_blank">competitions@thevinylfactory.com</a><em>, </em>including your name and the words ‘UK Hip Hop 82/93 Mixtape’ in the title field. Best of luck!</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/onra465.jpg"><img src="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/onra465-300x300.jpg" alt="" title="onra465" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-21786" /></a><a href="http://www.foolsgoldrecs.com" target="_blank">via FoolsGold:</a> As you may have seen on Pitchfork today, we’re proud to announce that <strong>Onra</strong>’s new <strong>Deep In The Night EP</strong> drops June 12th on <strong>Fool’s Gold</strong> – right in the middle of the producer’s US tour, which kicks off tomorrow at Beauty Bar in Chicago. See dates and more after the jump, and listen to “L.O.V.E.” off the EP right now.</p>
<p>Globetrotting producer Onra has staked his claim as one of the most exciting beat-makers of the past few years, thanks to releases like his <strong>Chinoseries</strong> collections (made from scratch with samples found while traveling Asia) and the acclaimed <strong>Long Distance</strong> LP. All the while, his electrifying live MPC performances around the world – everywhere from the Red Bull Music Academy in Bucharest and Giles Peterson’s Worldwide Festival, to LA’s down-and-dirty bass sanctuary the Low End Theory – add new dimensions to the cosmic grooves Onra puts on tape.</p>
<p>With his first release for Fool’s Gold, the Deep In The Night EP, Onra continues to chart new musical territory. The EP’s five tracks meld the snap of vintage jheri curl R&#038;B with squggling disco synths and deeply funky, late-night vibes. From the new jack swinging “After Hours” (featuring T3 of Slum Village) to the moody, screwed loops of closer “Hold Tight,” Deep In The Night‘s cut-and-paste danceability proves a must-listen for any occasion. After all, it’s always after hours somewhere… </p>

Davis is a name that has and will continue to surpass time because of the amazing musician he was and the epic life he lived. But hear me out, see recently my mother has put me in charge of clearing out the garage for the summer which is probably one of the worst jobs ever except for days like today when you encounter gems such as an impeccable vinyl of Miles Davis “My Funny Valentine, In Concert”. Ahhh what a breath of fresh air. With all the heavy emotions floating around Montreal these days it’s a nice relief to put on a great record at midnight accompanied by some kanpe iced tea, a light rainfall, and the intoxicating smell of lilacs. </p>
<p>To describe the musical depth of this album I’m gonna allow myself to quote the back cover “The core of Davis’ music, even at it’s most brooding, is strength. There is, for one thing, the relentless probing of the song, of himself and of his horn. There is also the constant drawing of melodic and emotional lines as taunt as possible before the tension is released only to build up again. And there is the unabashed sensuality of tone, together with the acute pleasure of surprising oneself in music.”<br />
Couldn’t of said it better myself. This is a must for music appreciators. </p>
<p>Oh and did I mention that it features the dream team: <strong>Miles Davis, George Coleman, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams</strong>. </p>

The name, which could be suitably affixed to any cheesy synth pop band from the 80’s, actually belongs to a british electronic trio whose productions feed on the 90’s garage movement, soul and a lil bit of that disco. The 90’s were their hayday, and at the peak the group released more than a few singles and a full length for the prestigious Warp Records.</p>
<p><strong>“Jet Cadett”</strong>, a 20 year old record, is easily one of my favorite tracks of their catalogue. The ethereal intro exudes a message of peace and harmony, quite literally, and builds into a nice acidic groove. Coco Steel &amp; Lovebomb’s productions are never forced, or over-thought, leaving them with a finished product that’s simple yet effective. A release easily over-shadowed by the giants of 90’s house music, and completely deserving of a revisit.</p>
<p>This post could also be a musical response to the last line of Lexis’ very imformative piece on the student movement happening in Quebec (<a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/sad-times-in-montreal/" target="_blank">link</a>). “Don’t let them turn us against each other.” Come together in peace and harmony!</p>

Here is a 7&#8243; rundown from one of our favorite producer / DJ&#8217;s mister Kenny &#8220;Dope&#8221; Gonzalez from KayDee Records and part of the legendary Masters At Work.</p>
<p>via <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/" target="_blank">the NY Village Voice Blog</a></p>
<p>5. <strong>Sly &#038; The Family Stone, &#8220;Underdog&#8221; (Epic)</strong><br />
This is a different version [to the one] that&#8217;s on his album; the drums are mixed very loud. It&#8217;s definitely a different pressing. I thought it was promo only until recently when I found out that there is some stock copies of it. You&#8217;ll see Sly Stone stuff all over the place, but this record for some reason I thought was promo only but it was released—although I only have the white promos of it. It&#8217;s an all around great club record.</p>

<div class="divider">&nbsp;</div>
<p>4. <strong>House Guests, &#8220;My Mind Set Me Free&#8221; (House Guest Records) </strong><br />
This is actually Bootsy Collins. It&#8217;s just a real deep-funk, uptempo record. It&#8217;s out of Ohio, after the whole JBs and James Brown thing. I love to DJ this record and still play it today—I&#8217;ll probably play it out tonight. I picked this up on one of my buying trips into Pennsylvania.</p>

<div class="divider">&nbsp;</div>
<p>3. <strong>Bob James, &#8220;Take Me To The Mardi Gras&#8221; (CTI)</strong><br />
Initially this was found on a CTI little EP, which was the main one we knew about, until a friend of mine about five years ago told me there was an Italian pressing of the record with a picture jacket. It&#8217;s also the whole song—the American pressing is only about a minute, but this Italian pressing has the whole song and it&#8217;s stereo, so it meant the bells are on the left side and the drums are on the right side, or vice versa. It&#8217;s pretty obscure. You don&#8217;t see it, but if you do, it&#8217;s a couple of hundred dollars.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gaoCsmFDLcY" frameborder="0" width="550" height="446"></iframe></p>
<div class="divider">&nbsp;</div>
<p>2. <strong>Manzel, &#8220;Midnight Theme&#8221; (Fraternity)</strong><br />
It&#8217;s on a label out of Ohio. It&#8217;s a classic breakbeat record [as sampled by Cypress Hill, De La Soul and Eric B &amp; Rakim]. I actually ended up licensing it for one of my reissue projects and got to meet Manzel and he handed me a copy of the record. It&#8217;s up there in about the $700 range, but just being personalized by the man himself and it being a classic breakbeat that people have sampled and cut it up, that makes it my second favorite 45 in my collection.</p>

<div class="divider">&nbsp;</div>
<p>1. <strong>Salt, &#8220;Hung Up&#8221; (Choctaw)</strong><br />
These days, this one comes in at about three thousand dollars. I had pulled this record out in my travels from a private dealer in the late &#8217;90s, just to find out later it was a very sought out record. At the time it cost me about $400. I would say that&#8217;s got to be one of the rarest singles in my collection. I was first attracted to the label and the way it looked, basically. Then when I played the record it was just this open drum break and really ugly horns. It&#8217;s a crazy track to me; it&#8217;s essentially a hip-hop record.</p>

<p>And then today I was writing about <a href="http://www.musicismysanctuary.com/sad-times-in-montreal/" target="_blank">the sad state of affairs right now in Montreal</a> and I was thinking about a few of those kind of anthems à la &#8220;What&#8217;s Going On&#8221; by Marvin Gaye. Then I remembered that nice little 45&#8242; I bought a few months ago from a London record shop. The record was apparently pressed in 300 copies only so I&#8217;m happy I managed to get one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jebloynichols.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jeb Loy Nichols</a> &#8220;<strong>Hard Times</strong>&#8221; is a cover version of the <strong>Pablo Gad</strong> song. A really beautifully sad soulful folk song.
