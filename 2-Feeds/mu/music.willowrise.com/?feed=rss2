It captured well the stress, and ups and downs of college dating, and provided an exciting suspense story that kept the book moving well from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Like any good romance, I found myself silently shouting at the characters, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it! Red flag!&#8221; and &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see he&#8217;s awesome! Go get him!&#8221; as well as a few, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go around that corner!&#8221;s.</p>
<p>Once I started, I couldn&#8217;t put it down, and finished it within two days. Way to go, Roseanne! You nailed it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to an awesome presentation by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/105916.Christine_Mehring">Christine Mehring</a> at the Write Here in Ephraim writers conference this last week, and this class was amazing! I talked to Christine afterward to see if I could post the audio of it on my blog, and she said it was okay, so here it is!</p>
<p>She talked about the Hero&#8217;s Journey, and about archetypes in story. I found this image that reflects much of what was discussed:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img onError="javascript: wp_broken_images = window.wp_broken_images || function(){}; wp_broken_images(this);"  onError="javascript: wp_404_images_fix = window.wp_404_images_fix || function(){}; wp_404_images_fix(this);"  class="alignnone" title="The Hero's Journey" src="http://randydeutsch.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/aaaaahero.gif" alt="" width="500" height="430" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Amazing stuff!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She also talked about archetypal characters:</p>
<p><strong>The Hero</strong>: Usually the protagonist<br />
<strong>The Mentor:</strong> The mentor also gives the hero some kind of help to take with them to help them in their adventure. They teach and give a gift.<br />
<strong>Threshold guardian:</strong> “This is a bad idea, don’t do it.” Their job is to try to stop the hero<br />
<strong>The Herald:</strong> Someone who comes and says, “You’re normal life is over, and it will never be the same.”<br />
<strong>Shapeshifter</strong>: The one who seems to change sides or positions.<br />
<strong>Shadow</strong>: What the hero could have been if the hero had taken a different path (the evil twin)<br />
<strong>Ally</strong>: The friend, sidekick, or assistant<br />
<strong>Trickster</strong>: Comic relief</p>
<p>In any story, you&#8217;re likely to find most if not all of these roles. It&#8217;s fun to plug in characters from my own books.</p>

I found myself finishing it within two days, because I couldn&#8217;t stop reading. Mandi does a good job balancing character development with motion, and the way Jacey gets her &#8220;alias&#8221; is such an interesting approach to a story.</p>
<p>It was also a very clean read, including clean language, which is refreshing for crime-based suspense. The book also does a good job illustrating what members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints might look like to those not of the faith. I highly recommend this book! I also recommend connecting with Mandi <a href="http://www.mandislack.blogspot.com/">on her blog</a>.</p>
<p>Just because I&#8217;m so excited to share this awesome book, I&#8217;m going to give away a free copy on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ChasHathawayAuthor">my Facebook author page</a>. I&#8217;ll post the details there, but the idea is you have to be the first to comment after I post &#8220;GO!&#8221; on the page this coming Saturday, March 17th. So head on over, and get your fingers ready at exactly 12:00 noon (MST) to win a copy of Mandi Tucker Slack&#8217;s novel, <a href="http://deseretbook.com/Alias-Mandi-Tucker-Slack/i/5067355">The Alias</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.</strong></p>
<p>This is a classic case of the (so-called) realist vs. the man of faith. Being realistic, practical, and prudent is good—in its time. But this wasn&#8217;t a time to be realistic. When the Lord asks something of you, it&#8217;s time to exercise confidence in the Lord, and if you can&#8217;t do that, learn to do it. If you find yourself putting practicality over your trust in the Lord, then you need to change. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>And you can.</p>
<p>Nephi not only had the right attitude, he explained how to get the right attitude. What had Nephi been doing right before his father told him about his new assignment? He&#8217;d been speaking with the Lord.</p>
<blockquote><p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi. . . did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers. (1 Ne. 2:16)</p></blockquote>
<p>“Yeah,” you might say, “but the thing I&#8217;m being asked to do is a really big deal!”</p>
<p>Really? I guess God didn&#8217;t know that, so you better tell him. Tell him that your agenda is more important than His. Go ahead—tell Him. See what He says. Maybe He&#8217;ll change His mind. Just be prepared for when He ends up changing your mind. And don&#8217;t judge your future, faithful self against your present “practical” self—that will just embarrass you later.</p>
<p>God knows what He&#8217;s doing with you. Trust Him.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Do any of you, like me, find the name Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, like, the most burdensome title for a piece ever? I always feel like the biggest dork when someone asks me what I&#8217;m playing and I say, (like I&#8217;m some kind of Bach or something), &#8220;This is an improvisation of Rachmaninoff&#8217;s piece called Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They just give me this glossy look like they&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Never mind. I&#8217;ll just go back to my calculous homework.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But I knew there was no getting around the title, so I played the &#8220;if you can&#8217;t lick &#8216;em, join &#8216;em&#8221; game. This is my variation of Rachmaninoff&#8217;s piece. I also never play it the same way twice, so it&#8217;s an improvisation, and some of you may get tired of my favorite key of C, so I transposed it, making this piece&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ahem&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A Transposition of an Improvisation of a Variation of a Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. Not that it&#8217;s any surprise by now since that&#8217;s the title of the post, but still&#8211;a piece like this deserves a proper introduction, surely.</p>

Do any of you, like me, find the name Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, like, the most burdensome title for a piece ever? I always feel like the biggest dork when someone asks me what I&#039;m playing and I say, (like I&#039;m some kind of Bach or something), &quot;This is an improvisation of Rachmaninoff&#039;s piece called Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.&quot;
They just give me this glossy look like they&#039;re thinking, &quot;Never mind. I&#039;ll just go back to my calculous homework.&quot;
But I knew there was no getting around the title, so I played the &quot;if you can&#039;t lick &#039;em, join &#039;em&quot; game. This is my variation of Rachmaninoff&#039;s piece. I also never play it the same way twice, so it&#039;s an improvisation, and some of you may get tired of my favorite key of C, so I transposed it, making this piece...
ahem...
A Transposition of an Improvisation of a Variation of a Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. Not that it&#039;s any surprise by now since that&#039;s the title of the post, but still--a piece like this deserves a proper introduction, surely.</itunes:summary>
