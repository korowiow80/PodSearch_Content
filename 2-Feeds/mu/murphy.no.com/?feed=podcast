Eve and Cath feel it is their duty to read some extracts, just to check how truly awful the likes of Stephen King and Haruki Murakami are at writing about lerve. Cue lots of squelchy noises and uncontrollable giggling, because that&#8217;s the kind of mature adults we Scribationers are. Also we discuss huge swollen&#8230;advances and enormous thrusting&#8230;book sales. It&#8217;s all good clean fun, naturally.</p>
