			<title>MSRcast 119: Tribute to David Gold/Woods Of Ypres</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://msrcast.libsyn.com/ms-rcast-119-tribute-to-david-gold-woods-of-ypres]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><br /><br />Welcome to a very special lengthy episode of MSRcast as we bring you a special tribute to David Gold. We celebrate his life and music with this episode. He definitely had an intense impact on the people around him, through his music, his lyrics, or just getting a chance to know him. He was extremely generous to his fans, and would take the time out of his day to interact with his fans, more than any other musician I had ever come in contact with. This is our small way to pay tribute to his career, to the man. We have some special guests that say a few words, and Bolthorn and myself will play music from his whole career. If you were a fan, please join us in remembering his astounding body of work, and if you are not a fan, or haven't heard Woods Of Ypres before, let this be a good starting point, for the music and for the man behind the music. This is definitenly a long episode, but well worth the download and listen. As we were piecing it together, it was getting longer and longer, and we dcided that instead of editing it out, we would give everyone the full experience out of respect. <br /><br />Playlist:<br />Interview with Evan Madden - Drummer on Woods IV The Green Album<br />Suicide Cargoload (Drag That Weight) - Woods IV The Green Album<br />Interview with Will Bozarth - Goddamn Zombie<br />Shards of Love - Woods IV The Green Album<br />I Was Buried In Mount Pleasant Cemetary - Woods IV The Green Album<br />The Sea Of Immeasureable Loss&nbsp; - Against the Seasons Cold Winter Songs From the Dead Summer Heat<br />Iron Grudge&nbsp; - Woods III&nbsp; The Deepest Roots And Darkest Blues<br />By The Time You Read This (I Will Already Be Dead)&nbsp; - Woods IV The Green Album <br />Career Suicide (Is Not Real Suicide) - Woods 5 Grey Skies and Electric Light<br />The Ghosts Of Summers Past - Pursuit Of The Sun &amp; Allure Of The Earth<br />Natural Technologies - Woods IV The Green Album<br />Travelling Alone - Woods 5 Grey Skies and Electric Light<br />Everything I Touch Turns To Gold (Then To Coal) - Woods IV The Green Album <br />You were the light - Home EP<br />December In Windsor - Woods III&nbsp; The Deepest Roots And Darkest Blues<br />And I Am Pining (For You) - Woods IV The Green Album<br />Allure Of The Earth&nbsp; - Pursuit Of The Sun &amp; Allure Of The Earth<br />Kiss My Ashes (Goodbye) Part 1 Woods 5 Grey Skies and Electric Light<br />Kiss My Ashes (Goodbye) Part 2 Woods 5 Grey Skies and Electric Light<br /><br />Remember to contact us at msrcast@gmail.com, and follow us over on Twitter.

			<title>MSRCast Metal Podcast: Episode 1</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://msrcast.libsyn.com/msr_cast_metal_podcast_episode_1]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Welcome everyone to the very first episode of MSRCast, which is part of Mainstream Resistance. I started MSR back in 1996 and had to take a break from it a few years back. Now, it is time to return, and we are kicking off with our first official podcast. Our podcasts will be a little bit different. Of course, in every episode, we will always be playing more metal than you can handle, including plenty of new releases, classic tracks, local Texas bands, and a strange cover song. This will really have a zine feeling to it, as this is where we come from. You might have noticed from our playlist that we are very eclectic with the music that we enjoy, and this definitely will reflect our episodes. Although, we will have episodes that are tailored to a certain genre, mostly, our shows will be wildly varied. We will have special guests, interviews, reviews, and plenty of specialty shows.]]></description>
