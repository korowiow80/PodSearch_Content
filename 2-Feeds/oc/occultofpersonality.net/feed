		<itunes:summary>Visionary, author, and lecturer Paul Weston returns to the show in podcast episode 118 to conclude the conversation about his wonderful book, Aleister Crowley and the Aeon of Horus. Paul was our guest previously in podcast episode 106.



Weston begins the interview by discussing LAM, the object of a portrait drawn by Aleister Crowley in 1917 which resembles the descriptions of grey aliens and was included in a version of H. P. Blavatsky&#039;s The Voice of the Silence with extensive commentary by Crowley. Subsequently, it appeared in Kenneth Grant&#039;s The Magical Revival as &quot;... an extra-terrestrial Intelligence with whom Crowley was in astral contact in 1919.&quot; (p. 84)



From there we move to the Babalon working of 1946 and John Whiteside Parsons. Paul notes that Marjorie Cameron may have seen UFOs shortly after the working concluded, but before the acknowledged public debut of the UFO mystery in 1947. Next we transition into a discussion of the colorful and shady personalities of the early days of UFOlogy. The high-strangeness and absurdity that is characteristic of this field is undeniable. We briefly survey the Sirius mystery and Cygnus mystery before talking about ultra-terrestrial intelligence, à la Aiwass. This leads into Liber AL vel Legis (The Book of the Law) and its implications with regard to the cipher code. This cipher is the basis of the English Qaballa and ties directly into consideration of contact with the &#039;other.&#039;



Paul concludes the interview by assessing the current state of affairs with regard to the New Aeon, reiterating the themes of overturning old forms and rapidly accelerating change. This age of transformation, technology, and individuality affects us all and by consciously choosing to engage with it in a creative manner, we each have the potential to realize the Aeon of Horus.



Aleister Crowley and the Aeon of Horus is billed as a “historical and cultural esoteric extravaganza,” and it delivers. If you want a book that spans the subjects of history, Magick, psychedelia, and UFOlogy, Paul Weston has it. Highly recommended!

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Paul Weston provides background on the Grail Legends and Arthurian Tradition based on his excellent book Mysterium Artorius. (Also be sure to check out the free Interview with Vadge Moore as well!)

		<itunes:summary>Healer, media activist, and author Jonathan Talat Phillips returns to the show in podcast episode 117 to discuss his book, The Electric Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic, published by Evolver Editions. He was our guest previously in podcast episode 99. In this interview, Jonathan continues to discuss his path from darkness to light.



Jonathan is the co-founder of the Evolver Social Movement, a network for “conscious collaboration,” and a senior editor at Reality Sandwich, the premier web zine for transformational (counter) culture. In addition, he’s also a Reiki Master, a member of the International Sufi Order, and a promoter of energetic and entheogenic healing. He begins this interview discussing how the Christ consciousness which he integrates into his own life has affected him personally, especially his reaction to the world around him. The Electric Jesus is a personal narrative that is entertaining, informative, and crackles with energy. Jonathan has done an excellent job of relating his own journey in a way that will uplift readers and convey some of the mystery of the universe.



Jonathan talks about how from many perspectives, humanity faces a dire situation at this point in time. Simultaneously, he perceives a great awakening occurring that will hopefully address and even correct the dangerous circumstances which threaten our existence. We move from the subject of political activism and mass media to human evolution and alien life forms. Phillip&#039;s relation of his experiences takes us from deep within our own psyches to the farthest reaches of the universe that we might comprehend. His story is so revelatory and honest that it&#039;s quite refreshing. By sharing it, Jonathan displays courage and a level of commitment that reaches far beyond expectations.


&quot;On its own ... spiritual liberation will never be enough. If the new humans are to survive, Jonathan warns, they will also have to be &quot;spiritual warriors ... capable of standing up to the Western materialism machine, so we can create sustainable societies that care for their citizens, harmonize with the cycles of nature, and receive and honor the vast healing light that quietly connects us all.&quot; What&#039;s great about Jonathan is that he doesn&#039;t just talk the talk. He absolutely walks the walk - whether as an energy healer, as a resolute explorer of non-ordinary realms, or as one of the four founding members of the amazingly successful and controversial online magazine Reality Sandwich and the Evolver Social Movement that grew out of it. Evolver&#039;s local network of &quot;spores&quot; is growing all over America and all over the world - a global community of intelligent, open-minded people actively working for the birth of a new humanity. Jonathan was a part of it from the beginning, and he has a compelling story to tell.&quot;
- Graham Hancock, excerpt from the Introduction
In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Jonathan provided a guided a meditation designed for kundalini activation.

		<itunes:summary>Mystic, artist, and author David Chaim Smith returns to the show in podcast episode 115 to discuss his groundbreaking new book The Sacrificial Universe, just released by Fulgur Limited.


&quot;Triple construct used on the cover of The Sacrificial Universe. It is a biomorphic evocation of BeYeA (Briah, Yetzirah, Assiah), the worlds of conventional cognition. Isolating it gives the opportunity to reassess the triune fluidity called &#039;reality&#039; by the perceptually fixated.&quot;
Smith begins by telling how The Sacrificial Universe has three levels which are investigated simultaneously - intellectually through essays, mathematical equations that pose associative suggestions, and the mysticism of ecstatic devotion. All these levels are designed allow the reader to access his highly esoteric, symbolic, dynamic, and biomorphic art for mystic contemplation. He admits that this book is a compendium of years of private practice that he is now making public. Personally, I find David&#039;s artwork and writing to be inspiring because it&#039;s so original, radical, mystical, and thought-provoking. The Sacrificial Universe provides all of it in one beautiful text.


&quot;Produced as a lavish small folio with generous margins and a classic typographic style, The Sacrificial Universe presents David’s key artworks of the last four years as full-page images, with the triptychs and quadriptych offered as folding plates. The complex and evocative iconographic symbolism is also explored through commentaries. And yet The Sacrificial Universe is more than a homage to those seventeenth century books of hermetic mysticism. Structured according to the classic kabbalistic text Sefer Yetzirah, The Sacrificial Universe may be approached on three levels (world, year, and soul) to offer the reader a view of gnostic surrender within a vision of the self-consuming nature of phenomena.&quot;


David talks about his intention to create a forum to address that which is essentially beyond conceptual thought - using words, numbers, and symbols. He explains that the basic approach his work takes is, &quot;that the universe and all phenomena are always beyond static conception - no thing, or non-thing, has any permanent or independent existence, including the mind and ... God.&quot;
&quot;The ultimate sacrifice is the offering of appearance itself. It gives itself over to oblivion through continual change, banishing one presentation of forms through the evocation of the next. It offers itself to itself, for itself, by itself, and through itself. But what is meant by ‘itself ’? Beyond existence and non-existence, reality and unreality...the truth of the sacrifical gesture cannot be rightly called by any name. It is concealed in the symbolism of the consuming fires of the temple, and is present in the smoke of the incinerated flesh which gives itself over to the open sky as a ‘pleasant offering’. This offering is repeated infinite times throughout infinite moments, in an indivisible continuum that is replete everywhere and in everything. It is a presentation of sheer gnostic delight presented to no one, nowhere, feeding the secret fire of irrational beauty with the ultimate explosive mutability. A fleeting dream dreaming itself which cannot be reached. Death and birth pose as hollow rumors, to cover that which no sane individual can bear.

Yet the sublime invitation is whispered
always by mute lips to deaf ears.&quot;

-from The Sacrificial Universe by David Chaim Smith


Smith also espouses the virtues of the primary inspiration of much of his work - The Fountain of Wisdom, a thirteenth century text from the school of Isaac the Blind. Then he talks about the differences between non-dual gnostic realization and conventional perception, meaning the mind&#039;s constructs - inert reflex habit, as opposed to free-flowing, continually in-drawing gnostic expression.

I highly recommend David Chaim Smith&#039;s The Sacrificial Universe, published by Fulgur Limited. Whether your interest is in mysticism,</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Mystic and philosopher Neil Kramer returns to the show in podcast episode 114 with an incisive analysis of current events and the state of the world. Although we recorded this interview in August 2011, the issues we discuss are just as relevant today, if not more so. To begin the interview Neil examines the concept of normality, noting that a shift in perspective about what is normal sets many on their path.



Kramer dares to ask the question - who is manufacturing and packaging normality? He also notes that normality is essentially a broadcast of governance that is ultimately inauthentic and false.



In addition, economic, political, and social upheaval have the potential to expose fractures in the foundations of the concept of normality. Neil also makes the point that we all share some level of responsibility for the state of our world. From that supposition, he makes the assertion that if the outer world is a reflection of the inner, we must begin to change our world by changing ourselves.



Neil remarks on the way this principle is illustrated by astrology, noting the 2011 England riots occurred as positions of the stars and planets were conducive to this very activity. He goes on to analyze these riots and some of the underlying social and economic causes. One can also draw analogies between the climate in England that Kramer describes and the impetus for uprisings across the Middle East, the Occupy movement in the United States, and other protests and war escalation around the world.



Kramer then confronts the potential apocalyptic vision of economic or social collapse with the observation that the material world is not all there is and we can learn, through inner work, to shift consciousness to higher states. He also observes that radical changes in society and individuals which are now occurring indicate a cyclical change affecting the earth.



Neil ends on a hopeful and positive note by mentioning that there has been no other time in humanity&#039;s history when so many people are connecting and becoming more aware of the world and themselves.

		<itunes:summary>Philip Deslippe joins us in podcast episode 113 to discuss William Walker Atkinson (1862 - 1932), a New Thought luminary who authored many influential texts in the early twentieth century, including The Kybalion. As part of his research on Atkinson, Philip edited and wrote the introduction for The Kybalion: The Definitive Edition, published by Tarcher/Penguin in 2011.



Philip begins our interview describing his great interest in, and extensive research of William Walker Atkinson. We discuss Atkinson&#039;s life and the dire circumstances that led to his becoming passionate about practical philosophies for self-improvement. Philip describes how Atkinson went missing for weeks, only to re-emerge as an ever more prolific writer on metaphysics, eastern philosophy, occultism, and New Thought.



Even before The Kybalion, Walker&#039;s work is notable as he wrote under a number of pseudonyms. For example, as Yogi Ramacharaka, &quot;Atkinson&#039;s writings ... marked some of the first full-length books in English to seriously address the subject of yoga as a practice to engage in, even if they partially filtered that practice through physical culture, Theosophy, and New Thought.&quot; As Magus Incognito he delivered The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians, as Theron Q. Dumont he wrote several books on mental science and healing, and his Arcane Teachings was written anonymously. Philip also convincingly contends that Atkinson was the sole author of The Kybalion, writing as Three Initiates.



Because of Atkinson&#039;s former career as an attorney and his aptitude for the vocation, it seems a natural extension that his most influential works would present philosophies that continuously reiterate the concept of LAW.


&quot;It speaks to the strength, flexibility, and longevity of The Kybalion that it could inspire everyone from modern pagans to Christian positive thinkers, from small secret societies to pop-culture phenomena. The Kybalion had directly or indirectly left its mark on the way millions of people viewed money, spirituality, the mind, success, and the nature of the universe itself. As is the fate of many occult and esoteric works, The Kybalion was never given the respect that it deserved, and the man who wrote it did not receive the acknowledgement that he was due. Perhaps in recognizing his authorship and the legacy of his most influential work, the monument that The Kybalion has deserved is this very edition.&quot; - Philip Deslippe, from the Introduction to The Kybalion: The Definitive Edition
Regardless of your feelings about Philip&#039;s assertion of Atkinson&#039;s authorship of The Kybalion, Deslippe&#039;s work is tremendously valuable both as a historical study and a treatment of the text which affords it the respect it deserves. The twisted tale of The Kybalion is full of enough mystery to preclude tales of ancient origins and hidden masters, as attractive as they might be. Likewise, a serious study of the life and work of William Walker Atkinson shows a man who cultivated a certain mystique, but at his core, he was intensely prolific, passionate, and his work touched the lives of innumerable spiritual aspirants.

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Philip and I discuss the controversy surrounding the theories of The Kybalion&#039;s authorship and the reaction to Deslippe&#039;s revelation of Atkinson as the sole author.

		<itunes:summary>Anthropologist, psychologist, and Palero, Nicholaj de Mattos Frisvold joins us in podcast episode 112 to discuss his wonderful book Palo Mayombe: The Garden of Blood and Bones published by Scarlet Imprint. In addition to studying Palo as an academic, Nicholaj is also an initiate and practitioner. Because of his knowledge and experience, the book is written &quot;from within the cult,&quot; but also conveys a scholarly exposition on the contextual history of Palo&#039;s heritage. This book also continues a tradition of absolutely stunning talismanic texts from Scarlet Imprint. Visually and tangibly their books are exquisite, but most importantly the content is always of a very high caliber, and Frisvold&#039;s Palo Mayombe: The Garden of Blood and Bones and Pomba Gira and the Quimbanda of Mbumba Nzila are no exceptions.


&quot;Palo Mayombe is an initiate&#039;s account of this much maligned cult whose central nigromantic mystery is the prenda, the cauldron containing the human skull or bones, re-animated by living spirit... Nicholaj de Mattos Frisvold traces the roots of Palo Mayombe back to Kongolese sorcery, the warrior and leopard societies, and the impact of the Portugese Mission. The original African faith is carried in chains across the abysmal waters of Kalunga and it flowers in Cuba as a New World Creole religion and cult. Yet Palo Mayombe can only be truly understood in the light of a highly developed African cosmology.

&quot;In drawing parallels with both the ancient Greek practices of Necromancy and Nigromancy, and the grimoire tradition, Nicholaj also illuminates the Western tradition, showing what we have lost in our denial of the dead and the cult of the ancestors...

&quot;The Garden of Blood and Bones gives explicit detail of the workings of Palo Mayombe for good and ill, the method of divination, the herbs, animals, trees and plants, powders, baths and waters, the songs and chants. It presents a complete living system ...

&quot;This is a serious study which confronts the sinister and violent aspects of the cult, but rather than purveying lurid sensationalism expresses the deep dignity and integrity of its nature.

&quot;This is a book written from within the cult ... With access to rare materials, pamphlets, booklets and unpublished field notes, this is the most comprehensive study of Palo Mayombe to date...&quot;
Nicholaj begins our interview by describing his interest and early experience in esotericism. He describes how this interest led to formal studies in anthropology and psychology at university while simultaneously practicing the traditions he was studying. Even though this appears to be a most thorough and balanced approach, addressing both the intellectual and experiential aspects, his &quot;pre-modern&quot; views inevitably caused some difficulties in the academy. Nicholaj&#039;s  interest in witchcraft led directly to Palo Mayombe through the recognition of the difference in the treatment of the cauldron, n&#039;ganga, prenda, or spirit vessel.



Nicholaj discusses the history, theology, and cosmology of Palo Mayombe. He stresses the importance of initiation and ancestry to this living tradition and direct contact with the spirits of the lineage. We also discuss necromancy and opinions about so-called high and low magick. Nicholaj talks about writing Palo Mayombe: The Garden of Blood and Bones and his desire to portray the power and beauty of the cult, or religion, as he experiences it.



I highly recommend both of Nicholaj&#039;s books from Scarlet Imprint. If you listen to the interview, you&#039;ll understand why. Palo Mayombe: The Garden of Blood and Bones is a fascinating study by an insider and scholar that sets a high standard for texts about initiatic traditions. Pomba Gira and Quimbanda of Mbumba Nzila is also amazing as a connection to a strong current of feminine magick.

Nicholaj and I continue this fascinating interview and he goes into even greater depth about his experience as a Palero in the Occult of Personality Membership Section.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Master numerologist Richard Andrew King is our guest in podcast episode 111. Richard describes his quest to understand the mysteries of life, which led him to the study of numerology. After much study and research, he eventually formulated &quot;THE KING&#039;S NUMEROLOGY© - a revolutionary numerology system of defining, describing and interpreting those energies and forces which comprise our lives and destinies.&quot;



Richard then explains the basics of numerology and how it can be practically applied to our lives. His system is devised and proven to allow one to interpret their life within a larger, more coherent context. Richard&#039;s passion and expertise shines through in his clear descriptions. He also explains that there is more to life than what we can see and touch, the world of spirit is vast, we each have a purpose in life, and it is within our grasp to find out what that purpose is. Of course, this raises fundamental questions about the origins of our calendar, language, and the nature of human consciousness.



Richard then shares with us his knowledge about spiritual masters and his understanding of the requirements to gain progress on the spiritual path. He describes the masters as living links between us and the transcendent, and the role of the masters is to guide us home. Richard stresses that dedication, perseverance, and hard work are required to make spiritual progress. He also highlights the importance of balance in all aspects of existence.



Richard then shares his thoughts about the numerological significance of the times we&#039;re living in now, as well as the future. His insightful observations provide a way to interpret our world in a highly systematic way. We conclude the interview by discussing the remarkable numerology involved in 9/11, and how its implications shape our future.

In The King&#039;s Book of Numerology Volume One: Foundations and Fundamentals, Richard Andrew King had done something remarkable. He has provided seekers with comprehensive, but simple ways to interpret their lives and navigate the future. The book is essentially a doorway through which the reader may enter in order to begin seeing and interpreting the world in a way that is logical and magickal, albeit with a bit of work required. I found the information about numbers and their meanings to be entirely complimentary to other teachings in tangential areas such as Qabalah, Tarot, and Astrology.  If you&#039;re looking to learn more about numerology, I highly recommend Richard&#039;s book.

In this free-form interview, Vanese talks about The Great Network and her experience hosting it and why it is important. She discusses The Great Work DVD series, a phenomenal tool for learning, that she created and co-produced. We&#039;ll hear about the car accident in which she broke her neck, and the extraordinary experiences and miraculous healing that followed.



Vanese shares openly about her experience and all the spiritual, mystical, and metaphysical modalities that she&#039;s pursued. This was a fascinating conversation that I hope was worth the wait!

		<itunes:summary>Internationally renowned author, teacher, performer, psychic, and artist Freya Aswynn is our guest in podcast episode 109. Freya has been studying, practicing, and teaching the Nordic mysteries for almost three decades and her work with the Runes is particularly noteworthy.



Freya begins the interview by describing her difficult and challenging childhood. A naturally gifted psychic and self-educated practitioner, she talks about her calling to work in the Norse and Germanic mysteries at a time when few, if any, others were doing so.



Freya talks about her remarkable connection to Odin and the Runes, and the manner in which it occurred. We talk about some of the historical connections with Norse and Germanic pantheon, from Medieval times to more modern negative political associations.



Freya&#039;s creativity is also remarkable. In addition to writing books, she&#039;s also involved in making music, performance, and painting. Self-described as feral and antimonian, her early life was a struggle that can serve as an example. She freely shares her story as an inspiration, especially to those, like her, who are psychically gifted and have experienced a traumatic childhood.



Join Freya Aswynn and I in the Occult of Personality Membership Section to hear more about the Runes, the Northern Mysteries, and much more.

&quot;After years at a desk job CIA Agent Analia Arias is thrilled when her new boss, Assistant Director Banes, sends her on her first field assignment. That is, until she learns that the national emergency involves a disturbance at the International Institute for the Research of Psychic Phenomena. As the case unfolds Agent Arias finds she is investigating parallel universes, inter-dimensional demons, a possessed magician, and time traveling monks who have a tendency to disappear. And to solve the case, she will have to rely on the mysterious Arthur Alexander who uses ancient weapons, occult powers, and intuition to fight the forces of evil--forces that in this instance, Agent Arias is not even sure exist. The Dark Brotherhood is a fast-paced adventure that takes the reader on an electrifying ride between the everyday world of form, and the world of shadows and secret powers.&quot;
The Dark Brotherhood is a novel in the tradition of great occult fiction, although with a modern twist. I found it to be fast-paced, exciting, and engaging - combining espionage, occultism, and the battle between light and darkness. Although it reads like a thriller, the authors have woven profound lessons of ancient wisdom into the story, transmitting these ideas in an unlikely, but appealing manner. Clark and Forbes deserve credit for making the concepts of the Western Mystery tradition accessible to a very wide audience. If you enjoy well-written fiction that treats occultism with respect, you&#039;ll appreciate The Dark Brotherhood. Recommended!

Also, be sure to check out Paul&#039;s previous book of Dr. Arthur Alexander adventures - The Broken Seal and Other Cases.

		<itunes:summary>Visionary, author, and lecturer Paul Weston joins us from Glastonbury, UK in podcast episode 106 to discuss his book, Aleister Crowley and the Aeon of Horus.



Paul begins the interview by describing his experience in writing all three of his books over the course of a decade, the other two being Avalonian Aeon and Mysterium Artorius, from the perspective of an insider, as well as a researcher, in the traditions represented in his works.



We spend considerable time discussing Aleister Crowley, including Paul&#039;s analysis of Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law, and the ensuing turmoil and technology of the twentieth century and beyond.

Next Paul explains the historical connections between German Ariosophists and Nazi occultism tracing a clear lineage of racist philosophy. Weston&#039;s analysis provides a more historically accurate magickal lens through which to view Nazi Germany&#039;s use of archetypes and symbols to inflame violence. British occultists own use of ancient archetypes and symbols to counter this threat is well documented by Weston.



Paul&#039;s writing and analysis is from the perspective of one that has learned the inner meanings of the teachings of the subjects of his study through experience. He shares his personal thoughts, wisdom, and opinions, weaving a magickal tapestry of history and culture. Aleister Crowley and the Aeon of Horus is billed as a &quot;historical and cultural esoteric extravaganza,&quot; and it delivers. If you want a book that spans the subjects of history, Magick, psychedelia, and UFOlogy, Paul Weston has it. Recommended!

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Paul Weston describes the Magical Battle of Britain and Dion Fortune&#039;s role. Also included is a historically-based and powerful meditation guided by Paul Weston entitled &quot;A Glastonbury Qabalah.&quot;

		<itunes:summary>Teacher and prolific author Christopher Penczak returns to the show in podcast episode 105 (he previously appeared in podcast 58). We begin the interview by talking about the books he&#039;s published in the past couple of years.



Christopher describes the process of learning about plants, herbalism, and plant spirits which he wrote about in The Plant Spirit Familiar. In addition to witchcraft, working with plant consciousness has long been an essential component of other esoteric practices, like magic and alchemy. Christopher&#039;s book provides a method for anyone who is so inclined to &quot;open the gateway to the Green World.&quot;



Next, Christopher describes The Witch&#039;s Heart, a compendium of practical love magick designed to aid in the creation of a balanced, happy love life. We also discuss the concept of love as the uniting force in the universe and the profound implications of understanding that fact.



Christopher then describes the The Three Rays of Witchcraft, his most inspired and ambitious work to date. This book strives to unite all the various aspects of his personal practice together, &quot;including such diverse topics as modern Wicca, Traditional Craft, Druidism, Theosophy, Qabalah, Shamanism, and alternative health, the Three Rays provides a powerful framework to artistically synthesize many different theologies into a greater tapestry.&quot;



Then, Christopher describes his book on prosperity and money, The Witch&#039;s Coin. This is another practical book whose teachings provide ample opportunity for practitioners of every level to bring greater prosperity into their lives.

Christopher&#039;s knowledge, experience, honesty, and eloquence distinguish his work. We conclude the interview by discussing The Temple of Witchcraft and the role of religion.

&quot;The original text of The Kabbalistic Mirror of Genesis was written between 1997-2007 during my 10 year hiatus from visual art, when spiritual practice and scholarship was my main concern. The book is a radical analysis of the first 3 chapters of the Book of Genesis. It assumes the form of a line by line commentary of the biblical text, and is supported copiously with quotes from many important and obscure Kabbalistic and alchemical texts. It directly challenges both exoteric as well as esoteric assumptions about the nature and function of Biblical creation symbolism and creativity itself, and brings into question many conventional modes of interpretation that have gone unquestioned for centuries. For better or worse, it is unique in all of western esoteric literature as the only study of its kind.&quot; - David Chaim Smith


As we begin the interview, David describes what makes his commentary on the first three chapters of the Book of Genesis unique. Primarily, he discards several commonly held beliefs about the text, including religious meaning, the idea that it is a literal history of the creation event in linear time, and the morality that is often associated with the story through ideas such as original sin, the fall of man, and messianic redemption. David is not a theist and does not &quot;reify a creator God.&quot; He repeatedly stresses that he is only interested in the symbolic language contained in the text which reveals a masterful exposition on the nature of human consciousness.



David describes the first chapter of Genesis as an exposition on the creative process through the agency of the Ten Sefirot of the Tree of Life, providing a way to examine all phenomena. He defines the second chapter as &quot;... a symbolic account of the primordial gnosis of the human mind in its capacity to open and reveal its potential.&quot; The esoteric equations therein containing the meaning of Adam are profound, according to Smith. He refers to the the third chapter as showing &quot;... the consequences of conventional habituation, which is a turning away from the capacity to the primordial gnosis which is our birthright ... the story of the &#039;so-called&#039; fall ... is another encoded series of equations that describes the function of consciousness engaged in a certain activity.&quot; From there we spiral off into explorations of the implications of  David&#039;s ideas and interpretations, the nature of consciousness, both  illuminated and mundane, challenging not only conventional exoteric  religious dogma, but accepted esoteric doctrines as well.



Not only is David Chaim Smith&#039;s artwork phenomenal as vibrant biomorphic phantasmagoria that beautifully conveys the majesty of creation through symbolism of ancient Kabbalistic texts, but his writing, and the accompanying diagrams and drawings, is of such an exquisite caliber that it often leaves me speechless. The Kabbalistic Mirror of Genesis provides a lens through which to gain entirely new perspectives and vistas on the nature of creation, the world, and ourselves. In so doing, it reveals something far different, and far more elegant and profound, than a mythology of mankind&#039;s origin. This book has the potential to restore the Book of Genesis&#039; inner meaning to any reader ready to receive it. I highly recommend it!



In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, David Chaim Smith talks more about his radical, non-religious mysticism, the joys and hardships of contemplative practice, the nature of consciousness and creativity, and much, much more. Join us!

		<itunes:summary>Miguel Conner, the host of Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio, best-selling science fiction author and author of Voices of Gnosticism, is our guest in podcast episode 103. Miguel&#039;s highly acclaimed internet radio show has been at the vanguard of modern inquiry into ancient Gnosticism and he&#039;s raised the bar with his book which features interviews with several important scholars.


&quot;For several years, Miguel Conner has engaged the most prominent writers and scholars on Gnosticism and early Christianity on Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio. These interviews with 13 leading scholars represent one of the best ways to get to know ancient Gnosticism, the movement that has inspired Dan Brown, Philip Pullman, Philip K. Dick and The Matrix movies. Read what the best minds have to say about the Gnostic sects, the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Judas, Mary Magdalene, heresy, the origins of Gnosticism, and the original teachings of Jesus.&quot;
&quot;... a Gnostic gem, a book that contains the rich wisdom of thirteen world-renowned scholars who study Gnosticism and the classical world.” - April D. DeConick, author of The Thirteenth Apostle


Miguel begins our interview by describing his religious background, interest in new media, and why he finds Gnosticism such a compelling subject. His inquiry is partially inspired by  similarities between the ancient world and modern times, as well as the reaction of Gnostics to these circumstances.



Voices of Gnosticism is a remarkable book. Miguel Conner has condensed the modern scholarship on ancient Gnosticism into a readable and comprehensive format. It&#039;s dialogue style lends to a better understanding of a subject that tends to be obscured by theological, historical, and political interpretations. If you&#039;re looking for a single book that contains the essential scholarship on ancient Gnosticism, this is it. I highly recommend Voices of Gnosticism and commend Miguel for his dedication and thoroughness. His efforts help give voice to the study of ancient Gnostic theology and tradition.



In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, you can hear Miguel talk more about persecution of Gnostics, specifically the Cathars or Albigenses during the Middle Ages, the nature of Gnosis, and his opinions about modern Gnostic churches.

		<itunes:summary>Mark Knight, the author of Trinity of Wisdom: Truth, Philosophy, and Hermetic Alchemical Qabalah, is our guest in podcast episode 102.
&quot;Throughout history secrets have been preserved regarding the human condition, energy, consciousness, history and religion. After his groundbreaking book, Wayki Wayki, Mark Knight&#039;s quest for truth continued. This led to a mystery school in the volcanic regions of Mesoamerica. Here, Mark went through the theory and practice of Hermetic Alchemical Qabalah before entering a 55 day silent fast - where the depths of the unwritten Qabalah came alive and sent him into a &quot;mystical spin.&quot; After this process, he was chosen to meet a Hermetic Scientist where he was taught an ancient 100 day Merkabah process using the Emerald Tablet as a guide.&quot;


Mark is a mystic and has had a remarkable series of journeys and initiations all over the world. He begins the interview by describing his path and inspiration to write the book. During our conversation he talks about various sections including conspiracies and mind control, awareness and awakening, Hermetic Alchemical Qabalah and its practical relevance, the Hebrew alphabet, energy work and vibrational frequency, entheogens and shamanism, and religion and esotericism from a historical perspective. We cover a lot of ground in this wide-ranging and thought-provoking interview!



Trinity of Wisdom: Truth, Philosophy, and Hermetic Alchemical Qabalah by Mark Knight is a very unique book, in my opinion, because it&#039;s an elegant combination of the story of his own spiritual journey along with the theory and structured practice that accompanied him, all presented  in an very readable manner. The breadth of material is astonishing and revealing, yet not overwhelming. The book is filled with spectacular illustrations contributed by over 100 artists. Several of the subjects covered are not likely to be found in other books and I also think it may represent one of the more comprehensive Western esoteric spiritual practices than I&#039;ve encountered in print. Mark has really written a wonderfully updated and modern book on Hermetic Alchemical Qabalah that is also very personal. I recommend it!



In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Mark Knight shares some of his experience with Merkabah mysticism, the unwritten Qabalah, his interpretation of future changes in the world, and much more. Join us for that fascinating interview!

		<itunes:summary>Internationally renowned Tarot reader and teacher Marcus Katz joins us in podcast episode 101 to discuss his brand new book entitled Tarosophy: Tarot to Engage Life, Not Escape It, published by Salamander and Sons.



Marcus&#039; new book Tarosophy has been hailed as precisely detailed, engaging, accessible, practical, profoundly original, and a work of genius. In my opinion the book is simply phenomenal - an outstanding text that teaches the Tarot on multiple levels including divination, symbolism, spirituality, and mysticism. I was very impressed with, and highly recommend Tarosophy: Tarot to Engage Life, Not Escape It.

Marcus begins the interview by recounting his esoteric experience, including an extensive background in witchcraft, Thelema, chaos magic, and Golden Dawn work. He credits his work in these systems, along with completion of the Abramelin working, as the source from which Tarosophy sprang forth. He shares his philosophy of Tarot as living wisdom engaged with the soul. We talk about his intention in formulating the book and some of the aspects that make it the most unique book about Tarot that I&#039;ve ever read. Then Marcus shares anecdotes of readings, the origins of the word Tarosophy, talks about the restoration of spiritual dignity to Tarot, and much, much more.


&quot;The Tarot is a veritable oracle, and replies to all possible questions with precision and infallibility. A prisoner, with no other book than the Tarot, if he knew how to use it, could in a few years acquire a universal science, and would be able to speak on all subjects with unequaled learning and inexhaustible eloquence. The oracles of the Tarot give answers as exact as mathematics, and as measured as the harmonies of Nature. By the aid of these signs and their infinite combination, it is possible to arrive at the natural and mathematical revelation of all secrets of Nature. The practical value of the Tarot is truly and above all marvelous.&quot;
- Eliphas Lévi

Marcus Katz&#039;s book holds keys to unlock our potential and bring us closer to realizing Lévi&#039;s words.

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Marcus Katz discusses impressions of favorite Tarot decks, talks about Tarot education, and shares some fascinating insights about the Abramelin working. Join us!

		<itunes:summary>Josephine McCarthy, author of The Exorcist&#039;s Handbook, joins us for our 100th episode.

Josephine has been teaching and writing about the Western esoteric tradition, as well as working as a consecrator and exorcist, for the past two decades. The Exorcist&#039;s Handbook is a groundbreaking work that approaches the subject in a practical, thorough, and humorous manner.


&quot;Exorcism is a topic that immediately leads into a fog of sensational and paranoid religious expressions, in which any direction or clear vision is quickly lost. Josephine McCarthy slices through this fog with a brilliant sword of a book. While McCarthy is conversant with scholarship on the topic, and knowledgeable regarding many religious, esoteric, and other spiritual traditions, it is her hard-won experience as an exorcist which animates her writing. With good humor and common sense, all sensationalism is brushed aside, so that the student can get down to work. This is very much a &quot;how to&quot; guide, in which decades of experience are shared far more openly than any other treatment of the subject I have encountered.&quot;
- Dr. John Plummer in Forward to The Exorcist&#039;s Handbook

Josephine begins by providing an overview of her esoteric experience. Then she tells us she wrote the book to provide accurate, proven techniques for doing the work of exorcism. She shares her perspective on secrecy and the importance of approaching things with humor.We explore the non-religious nature of the possession phenomena, it&#039;s similarity to mental illness, and some of the incorrect stereotypes that abound in this subject. Josephine also shares some of her amazing experiences doing exorcisms.

Stay tuned after the interview for a special message about the 100th episode.

		<itunes:summary>Jonathan Talat Phillips is our guest in podcast episode 99. Jonathan is the co-founder of the Evolver Social Movement, a network for &quot;conscious collaboration,&quot; and a senior editor at Reality Sandwich, the premier web zine for transformational (counter) culture. In addition, he&#039;s also a Reiki Master, a member of the International Sufi Order, and a promoter of energetic and entheogenic healing.

We begin the interview hearing about Jonathan&#039;s experience with Reality Sandwich and his work with Evolver to facilitate an aware counterculture. He explains his intention and reasons for working within the realm of social networking. He explains that the current condition of humanity and our planet makes this movement necessary.

Jonathan discusses how recognizing the world&#039;s flaws can prompt one to action to help others in various ways. He explains that these things can be viewed in the context of a healing process. His own reactions to 9/11 and subsequent media work serves as a interesting illustration of this principle. Eventually, this experience led to his own personal awakening and conscious evolution. He mentions how following synchronicity allowed him to become unstuck and facilitated a reality shift.

Jonathan discusses how the dark night of the soul can provide the impetus for substantial conscious transformation. He relates this concept to our current conditions and how we&#039;re all involved, whether consciously or not, in this transformation. From there we talk about entheogens and neo-shamanism and the inherent implications for healing. He acknowledges the continued stigma and fear that surround the use of entheogens. Finally, we discuss the Evolver Spores (local themed monthly events), the way they function, and how they aid in &quot;finding the others.&quot;

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Jonathan and I talk in greater detail about kundalini awakening and entheogenic shamanism. Join us for that revealing conversation!

		<itunes:summary>It&#039;s my pleasure to welcome Neil Kramer, A.K.A. &quot;The Cleaver,&quot; to the show in podcast episode 98. Neil is a philosopher, mystic, essayist, and lecturer whose work involves investigations into human consciousness, metaphysics, shamanism, systems of control and liberation, and the nature of reality. He describes it as, &quot;Navigating the ancient pathways of gnosis, esoteric knowledge, consciousness, and the divine.&quot;

In the beginning of the interview, Neil describes his experience and background in exploring consciousness, philosophy, and spiritual practice. His description of the use of technology to acquire and disseminate knowledge is notable as is his opinion that mystical philosophies are confirmed by new physics. We&#039;re attempting to explore the nature of human consciousness through our dialogue. Who are we? What are we? Perhaps more to the point - what aren&#039;t we and what are some of the lies that we tell about ourselves and our world?

By analyzing and deconstructing consensus reality, Neil&#039;s essays and speeches have the potential to alter perception, change consciousness, awaken, and empower the individual. His experience, eloquence, honesty, and humility are indicative of the authenticity of his work. Neil&#039;s reputation as one of the counterculture&#039;s most thought-provoking writers and speakers is well-deserved.

Please join Neil Kramer and I in the Occult of Personality Membership Section for an absolutely fascinating in-depth exploration of the the control system in modern society, and consideration of the meaning and implication for the future of humanity.

		<itunes:summary>Dennis Fetcho, A.K.A. &quot;The Fetch,&quot; joins us in podcast episode 97 to discuss the research and revelations from his work in English gematria documented in his blog, The Illuminatus Observor, and podcast, Inside the Eye.


&quot;The Fetch has spent over 10 years in the study of Western Esotericism. His work focuses on the &quot;mythical Word&quot; and how this &quot;Word&quot; weaves its way into the language [because it is embedded] into the very letters that make up the Alphabet.

&quot;An Occultist, The Fetch writes and speaks extensively on the idea of &quot;English Qabalah,&quot; Gematria, and the Masonic &quot;[Lost] Word,&quot; which he shows to be the mathematical constant &quot;Pi.&quot;

&quot;Dedicated to returning the &quot;sacred Feminine,&quot; the Fetch&#039;s works reveal how the Mystery Schools wove their truths into the language spoken by 690,000,000 people the world over.&quot;

Fetch describes his intention to deconstruct English and demonstrate the true nature of the language using Qabalistic methods. He talks about his research and the &quot;Isisian Codes,&quot; solar worship and religion, the origins of English, and how understanding these concepts in the way he puts forth can raise awareness, alter perception, and reveal the magical nature of reality.

Did you ever consider the origins of language? Fetch&#039;s work is unique and its implications are profound.  You may never think about English in quite the same way again...

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, the Fetch and I continue this fascinating conversation. We discuss Enochian Magic, ultra terrestrial intelligences, conspiracies, good and evil, the Temple of Solomon, literal versus allegorical interpretation of religious mythology, the use of language to shape human consciousness, and the nature of reality. Join us!

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 95, internationally renowned magician, author, and teacher Lon Milo DuQuette returns to the show on the occasion of the publication of his recent book Low Magick: It&#039;s All in Your Head ... You Just Have No Idea How Big Your Head Is.

Lon tell us about his new book about low magick, sometimes referred to as thaumaturgy. In this follow-up to his popular autobiography, My Life with the Spirits, he uses entertaining personal anecdotes to explain the philosophy and basic principles of Solomonic magic.
&quot;That&#039;s why low magic, Solomonic magic, has garnered a bad and dangerous reputation ... it&#039;s serious stuff. Because any kind of change or improvement in your life is going to be a challenge.&quot; - Lon Milo DuQuette

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Lon and I chat about his re-released Tarot of Ceremonial Magick and much more.

		<itunes:summary>Please be sure to read this important note about the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica.

In podcast episode 94, Philippa Faulks, co-author of The Masonic Magician: The Life and Death of Count Cagliostro and His Egyptian Rite, joins us to discuss her fascinating book.

Philippa describes how she came to write the book with Robert L. D. Cooper and from there she tells us about Count Alessandro Cagliostro, his life and his devotion to the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. Our conversation goes into depth regarding the meaning and implications of Cagliostro&#039;s work. Notably, the story of Cagliostro highlights the anti-Masonic sentiments, or Masonophobia, that is still prevalent in some circles.


&quot;Miracle-worker or man of straw? Count Alessandro Cagliostro was a cult figure of European society in the tumultuous years leading to the French Revolution. An alchemist, healer, and Freemason, he inspired both wild devotion and savage ridicule...

&quot;Cagliostro&#039;s sincere belief in the magical powers ... conferred by his Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry won him fame, but made him dangerous enemies, too...

&quot;The Masonic Magician tells Cagliostro&#039;s extraordinary story, complete with the first English translation of the Egyptian Rite ever published. The authors examine the case made against him, that he was an impostor as well as a heretic, and find that the Roman Church, and history itself, have done him a terrible injustice.

&quot;This engaging account, drawing on remarkable new documentary evidence, shows that the man condemned was a genuine visionary and true champion of Freemasonry. His teachings have much to reveal to us today not just of the secrets of Freemasonry, but of the mysterious hostility the movement continues to attract.&quot;

And one note about the potential danger to the world-class Ritman Library:
Scholarly concern about the threatening dissolution of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica
&quot;The renowed Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica (BPH) is in grave  danger due to a financial conflict with its owner, the businessman J.R.  Ritman, and the Friesland Bank. A petition circulated in the academic  circuit was signed by over 2500 people within a few days, and the number  of signatures keeps growing by the hour: see www.ipetitions.com/petition/ritmanlibrary
&quot;If  the Ritman library would go down, this would mean an enormous blow to  international scholarship. The damage would be irreversible, for there  is no comparable collection worldwide. Many researchers from all over  the world visit Amsterdam each year specifically to profit from the  unique facilities offered by the library and its professional  staff. Since the University of Amsterdam offers a unique curriculum in  Hermetic Studies at the Bachelor and Master levels, for the many Dutch  and international students in this program the BPH is an indispensable  resource.&quot;
Please show your support for Hermetic studies and preservation of this unparalleled treasure.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>In podcast episode 93, we&#039;re joined by Peter Grey and Alkistis Dimech of Scarlet Imprint, &quot;a talismanic esoteric and occult publisher.&quot; - Peter and Alkistis describe their magickal paths and how they arrived at the vocation of publishing fine books.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 93, we&#039;re joined by Peter Grey and Alkistis Dimech of Scarlet Imprint, &quot;a talismanic esoteric and occult publisher.&quot;

Peter and Alkistis describe their magickal paths and how they arrived at the vocation of publishing fine books. They describe Scarlet Imprint and its purpose of producing magickal texts that are original, unique, and beautiful talismans. We talk about Scarlet Imprint&#039;s dedication to providing quality texts to other practitioners and the breaking of all sorts of boundaries. Some of the wonderful titles Scarlet Imprint has published include The Red Goddess by Peter Grey, Devoted, Howlings, Voudon Gnosis by David Beth, The Encyclopedia Goetica Vol.1: The True Grimoire by Jake Stratton-Kent, Diabolical, and Datura.

We then explore their recently published XVI, a collection of essays described in the following prose:
&quot;Our civilisation is in crisis.
As we confront ecological collapse, political control, wars of terror, and wars on consciousness, we are seeking emergence from this state of emergency.

&quot;XVI proposes gnostic strategies for liberation.
Some will consider this a dangerous and inflammatory book.
It is.

&quot;These provocative essays from the most radical contemporary occult thinkers reveal a creative and passionate engagement with the world.

&quot;Attacks on our freedoms can lead to freedom, the sudden enlightenment, the lightning path and the initiatory crisis that the tower also represents.

&quot;XVI seeks to raise magickal awareness of the unique times we find ourselves in, whilst being open to the resourcefulness and indomitable nature of the human spirit to find solutions and responses to it.
This is magick attuned to the zeitgeist.&quot;

XVI features an impressive roster of magickal minds and topics. It&#039;s essays convey the message of the Tower by analyzing the world creatively, through a magickal lens, causing one to think, question, and act.

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Peter and Alkistis discuss Babalon, Thelema, and Aleister Crowley. If these topics interest you, be sure to listen to this amazing recording!

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 92, we&#039;re joined by international bestselling author Tim Wallace-Murphy to discuss his most recent book, Hidden Wisdom: Secrets of the Western Esoteric Tradition.

Tim Wallace-Murphy is renowned for his books which delve into the mysteries surrounding the Knights Templar, Rosslyn, sacred geometry, and especially Rex Deus. His latest book encompasses all these and much more, broadening the scope to include the philosophies that were perpetuated and propagated by the guardians of the Western Mystery tradition. Hidden Wisdom begins in prehistory with the dawn of civilization and finishes in modern times, encompassing the intertwined currents of history and esotericism. In our conversation, Tim talks about this secret tradition, as well as its significance to world history and ourselves.
&quot;The influence of the Masonic order has long been a matter of speculation and public concern, but the existence of the Rex Deus families was almost completely unknown until quite recently. However it is now known that they spread their teaching far beyond the limited confines of their bloodline, firstly by founding the Knights Templar, then by the propagation of the Grail sagas, by promoting the tarot, through their influence on early Freemasonry, and by their patronage of great artists of the Renaissance such as Botticelli and Leonardo Da Vinci. Their initiatory teaching is also recognized as having a seminal influence on scientists such as Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton and esotericists such as Robert Fludd and Johann Valentin Andreae; individuals of genius and originality held by historians to be the major forces in the creation and sustaining of the new age of enlightenment we call the Renaissance.&quot;

-Tim Wallace-Murphy, Hidden Wisdom, p. 185
&quot;Tim Wallace-Murphy&#039;s mammoth Hidden Wisdom is an ambitious and determined attempt to wrench the &quot;secret knowledge&quot; of the Western tradition out of the shadows of neglect and into the light of historical consciousness, where its wisdom, which is all too needed today, will no longer be hidden.&quot;
- Gary Lachman, author of Rudolf Steiner: An Introduction to His Life and Work

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 91, we&#039;re joined by author and lecturer Timothy Hogan. His titles include Past Master of East Denver #160 A.F.&amp;A.M., Knight Templar, 32nd degree, Knight Commander of the Court of Honor, Past Sovereign Master of A.M.D. Council 425, member of the Royal Order of Scotland, member of S.R.I.C.F., S.I.I., and District Lecturer for the Grand Lodge of Colorado. He is also a member of several additional quasi-Masonic, chivalric, and / or esoteric orders. He has presented numerous lectures around the world on the subject of Freemasonry. Hogan&#039;s experience and eloquence have distinguished him among Masonic and esoteric scholars, and his passion and wisdom are evident in his writing, which wonderfully conveys the symbolic richness and majesty of the Western Mystery Tradition.

We begin our conversation by discussing his book entitled The Alchemical Keys to Masonic Ritual, which has been described as, &quot;the first book which establishes a direct link between the rituals of Freemasonry and the practice of both chemical and spiritual alchemy.&quot; Hogan tells us about the foundational principles involved in Alchemy. He then provides some key examples of how Alchemical principles are contained within the symbolism of Freemasonry, as well as how these concepts have been ingeniously conveyed and preserved within the Craft.

Next, we explore the research and revelations from his book The 32 Secret Paths of Solomon: A New Examination of the Qabbalah in Freemasonry. Hogan explains how he arrived at an interpretation of the Tree of Life &quot;that can be found within the symbolic degrees of Freemasonry.&quot; We go into great depth discussing both of his books and their implications. Hogan&#039;s work is scholarly, reasoned, and crucial for its insights. For Freemasons interested in esotericism, his books are required reading and I highly recommend all of Hogan&#039;s work.

N.B. Timothy&#039;s Hogan&#039;s The Alchemical Keys to Masonic Ritual and The 32 Secret Paths of Solomon: A New Examination of the Qabbalah in Freemasonry are also available in revised and expanded versions as part of his fine new publication, Novo Clavis Esoterika, published by Brazen Serpent.

The Occult of Personality Membership Section interview with Timothy Hogan about his book The Revelation of the Holy Grail, a fascinating exploration of the Grail tradition, is now available. Also, selected Membership Section recordings are now available for purchase!

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 90, we&#039;re joined by author and lecturer Kevin Townley, the foremost authority on the study of the Cube of Space. Paul Foster Case wrote that, “In the study of the Qabalah, there is no more important glyph than the Cube of Space, with perhaps the exception of the Tree of Life.” No other author has illuminated the study of the Cube of Space like Kevin Townley.

We begin by hearing about Kevin&#039;s interest and early experience with spirituality, religion, and esoteric studies. From there, we begin to delve into the vast subject that is the Cube of Space. Kevin tells us of the origins of the concept described in the Sepher Yetzirah and the symbolism inherent in this model of creation.

Townley explains that understanding sacred symbolism, such as that contained in the concept of the Cube of Space, and meditating upon it can cause profound changes in consciousness. His work has also uncovered the intimate connections between the Tree of Life and the Cube of Space through the astrological and Tarot correspondences associated with the Hebrew alphabet.

Townley deserves a great deal of credit for sharing his revelations with the world and this interview can only serve as a very brief introduction to a subject that deserves attention in esoteric study.

In the Occult of Personality Membership Section, Kevin shares his thoughts and opinions about the importance of the institution of Freemasonry, as well as its current condition.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 89, we&#039;re joined by author and podcaster Douglas Lain for an insightful and honest discussion about a wide-range of subjects from synchromysticism to overturning the symbolic order.


Douglas produces and hosts the Diet Soap Podcast which is &quot;a podcast dedicated to applying imagination and intellect to the multi-dimensional crisis that surrounds us.&quot; He&#039;s also &quot;the author of dozens of short stories and two novels. His work has regularly appeared in nationally distributed literary magazines and journals since 1999, and his first book “Last Week’s Apocalypse” was a collection of these stories published by Night Shade Books. His first novel, entitled “Billy Moon: 1968,” tells the story of Christopher Robin Milne’s fictional involvement with the French general strike in May of 1968, and is due out from Tor Books in 2011. His second novel, entitled “the Brainwash Brand,” is currently under option at Tor.&quot;

We begin this unique interview by discussing the concept of synchromysticism and our interpretations of its meaning. This served as a launching point for two veteran podcasters to explore each others and our own minds, with a strong focus on inner vs. outer work and the value of each.

Douglas also talks about his upcoming writing project, &quot;Pick Your Battle&quot; - what it&#039;s about, why it&#039;s important, and his effort to obtain funding for it through Kickstarter.org. His ideas and unconventional thinking are refreshing and thought-provoking. Although not specifically about esoteric subjects, this conversation was a pleasure and a real gem.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 88, we&#039;re joined by teacher Rubaphilos Salfluěre, author of &quot;The Hermes Paradigm, Book One: First Principles,&quot; published by Salamander and Sons.


&quot;... this first volume in The Hermes Paradigm series offers a detailed consideration of the core concepts that afford a glimpse at the nature of the philosophy, and its first principles, that lie at the heart of Hermetic science - the source and backbone, yet least understood aspect, of the Western mystery tradition. Beginning with an examination of the history of Hermetism over the past two millenia, a clear historical and conceptual distinction is made between the body of pure Hermetic knowledge - the secret tradition - and the popular outer tradition, the latter of which is so often mistaken for the former. The much-neglected and misunderstood heart of Hermetic philosophy and its practical expression - the science of Hermetic initiation - is the subject of a detailed discussion, as is the central role that alchemy plays in the theory and practical dynamic of Hermetism. The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus is dissected in order to provide the reader with an introduction to how natural law provides the blueprint for both the alchemical laboratory tradition and the inner alchemical journey of initiation.&quot;

In this interview, Rubaphilos talks about his personal experience in the Western Mystery Tradition in New Zealand, including his interest and training in laboratory Alchemy, hypnosis, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, B.O.T.A., A.M.O.R.C., and Freemasonry. We then compare and contrast the alchemical laboratory tradition and spiritual Alchemy, discussing the Philosophers&#039; Stone and the Elixir of Life. Rubaphilos endeavors to dispel the confusion surrounding the subject of Alchemy, both laboratory and inner work. He also explains how esoteric spiritual Alchemy is synonymous with Qabalah.

I highly recommend Rubaphilos Salfluěre&#039;s &quot;The Hermes Paradigm, Book One: First Principles.&quot; With this book, he takes a hard and modern look at Hermetism and Alchemy and forces readers to think by questioning assumptions and the popular tradition. If you are a student of Hermetics and Alchemy, Rubaphilos&#039; book is essential reading. Perhaps controversial to some, his insights and experience are invaluable in my opinion.

Rubaphilos and I more deeply explore the division between the popular level of the Western esoteric tradition and the hidden tradition, or underground stream, in the Occult of Personality Membership Section. Join us for that fascinating interview.

Kephra explains that Occult Digital Mobilization,or DigiMob, is a collective of individuals virtually gathered together to compile and facilitate the distribution of occult and esoteric texts. He tells how it works, including the intention and mission of the group, the submission process for the quarterly digests, the volume of content, and the technology which allows decentralized distribution, specifically BitTorrent.

Whether you agree with their methods or not, Occult Digital Mobilization is worth examining in terms of esoteric study in modern times.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 86, we&#039;re joined by Etta D. Jackson. Etta has written several interesting and important works, including the subject of our conversation which is her first book entitled &quot;Understanding Your Choice,&quot; (also available as an eBook PDF download and an audio book).

Etta tells us about her background and mission to assist humanity in becoming liberated. She then delves into the fascinating story of how she was guided in writing &quot;Understanding Your Choice,&quot; which explains the journey of humanity from the descent into matter to the path of return. We explore the synchronistic events surrounding the creation of the book, which she tells us is not simply an esoteric exposition, but a vibrational force and transformational tool.
&quot;Understanding Your Choice&quot; is &quot;... a comprehensive presentation of the Occult and Arcane Mysteries.  In this Age of Aquarius, which is that of the Water Bearer and the Path of Return, chapter zero introduces mankind to himself the architect of the idea to take the journey into matter to experience being clothed in Form.  It acquaints the aspirant on this return journey, of the Divine intent, that took him on his descent into matter.  The relationship of Great Bear, Sirius and the Pleiades to these cosmic influences in humanity’s involution and now evolution, are explained.&quot;
Etta&#039;s work delves deeply into the most profound questions to which ageless wisdom provides answers. Her explanations of Tarot, Astrological, and Qabalistic correspondences are elegant and easy to understand. Her analysis of astrological ages and humanity&#039;s purpose is uplifting and inspiring. She has a gift for conveying the wisdom of the Western Mystery Tradition in clear, concise language. &quot;Understanding Your Choice&quot; is well-written, interesting, accessible, and revealing. I recommend it.

Please join Etta and I in the Occult of Personality Membership Section for the second half of the interview where Etta discusses Freemasonry, the New World Order, the role of the Jewish people throughout history, the Age of Aquarius, the inner teacher, and more.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 85, we&#039;re joined by Jeremy Vaeni. Jeremy is a writer, director, podcaster, and experiencer of high-strangeness. He hosts and produces the successful and popular Culture of Contact and Paratopia podcasts.

Jeremy&#039;s unique perspective on UFOlogy and the paranormal have earned him fans as well as critics, but he speaks his mind with frankness and a sense of humor that&#039;s refreshing. We begin the interview hearing about his early experiences with UFOs and alien abduction. Based on these contacts, he&#039;s led to understand that UFOs and aliens are not necessarily what many may believe, in that they serve to try to rouse humanity from its waking dream.

From there, we delve into what Jeremy calls his I AM experience. I think you&#039;ll agree that his story is quite compelling, rather extreme, absolutely fascinating, brutally honest, and undoubtedly controversial.

Don&#039;t miss the second half of this fascinating interview with Jeremy Vaeni in the Occult of Personality Membership Section.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 83, we&#039;re joined by David Chaim Smith. A Kabbalist, mystic, and extraordinary artist, Smith&#039;s drawings are vibrant, esoteric, beautiful, and inspired diagrams that hearken back to the tradition of alchemical art of the seventeenth century. While invoking memories of such amazing drawings, his work also goes beyond and extends this tradition.

The exhibition entitled &quot;Blood of Space: Drawings by David Chaim Smith&quot; will be at the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York City through May 15, 2010. The opening reception occurs on Thursday, April 1st at 5:30 PM and features a musical performance by John Zorn.


&quot;David Chaim Smith is unstuck in time. David Chaim Smith makes drawings... They are incandescent utterances from the nexus point of unutterable ecstasy. They are inchoate maps of the un-mappable places of Original Creation.  Is it dangerous to document these things? Yes it is. Throughout the history of Man it has been dangerous for the Mediators between Tangible and Intangible to absorb and expose Esoteric Teachings... There is nothing New Age about this mysticism.  It isn’t at all user-friendly. These intricate beautifully rendered chart-like drawings compel you to give up your own time frames and become absorbed and changed.  The images settle into your psyche as well as your aesthetic reference zone.  But for some reason these involved mad dances through words and sacred geometries, biomorphic and astral thought forms, incantations and exhortations are not in the least solipsistic... He is a Keeper of Mysteries but his desire is for you to enter them as well so there is a tremendous amount of generosity in his Vision... The Blood of Space is integral.  It is the Matrix.  It is “the basic space of phenomena.”&quot;

Join us for a fascinating interview that goes from David&#039;s history of esoteric studies to the inspiration for his artwork to the very nature of creation and time and space. He is sometimes contemplative, sometimes controversial, but always interesting.

Please join us in the Occult of Personality Membership Section for the second portion of our conversation.

		<itunes:summary>Our friend Christopher Moors, a writer, artist, musician, and the spirit behind CreativeCosmos.org, returns to the show to discuss some thoughts that arose since his last appearance in Podcast 47 - Exploration of the Inner Realms.

We begin the interview discussing the student/teacher paradigm and how it manifests in terms of one&#039;s conscious unfoldment process. The inherent value in learning from one who is already accomplished is clear. Chris then talks about learning to discern by intuition and awareness. Then we explore distractions on the path and the value of a practice, especially meditation.

Chris talks about practical ways to deal with the stress and how he puts larger issues of politics, history, and economics in perspective. He explains different degrees of awareness, the information age, and the evolution of a collective consciousness. We discuss some thoughts and opinions about other teachers like Jiddu  Krishnamurti and Thich Nhat Han. He describes his books &quot;Rainbow Sky&quot; and &quot;Truth in a Sea of Obfuscation&quot;. Chris also talks about creating space for inspiration and creativity to manifest within one&#039;s life.

Sit back, relax and enjoy another conversational contemplation with Christopher Moors...

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 81, we&#039;re joined by occult author, magician, and esoteric researcher David Rankine. &quot;David lives and works on the Welsh borders with his wife, the author Sorita d’Este. David has been writing and contributing articles to a variety of publications, and has given lectures, workshops and presentations since the early 1980’s. His personal passions include the Qabalah, Medieval and Renaissance Magick (particularly the Grimoires), Heka (Egyptian Magick) and Thelema. Since 2003 he has been working with occult legend Stephen Skinner, co-writing and producing the highly acclaimed Sourceworks of Ceremonial Magic series. These books make available for the first time previously unpublished manuscripts and Grimoires of great significance to the development of modern magick.&quot;

An extremely prolific researcher and writer who is at the forefront of providing authentic magickal source materials, David begins the interview as he describes his early experiences in esoteric studies and notes that discipline in practice can also extend to other endeavors, like writing. Next we explore the Qabalah  and its importance as the foundation of the Western Mystery Tradition from a historic perspective.

David delves into the manner in which Qabalah was incorporated into various Renaissance magical systems in the same way that it has been used to map mystical and metaphysical concepts in a cohesive manner since antiquity. Specifically, he discusses the theory and practice of the inclusion of Qabalistic divine names in grimoires. Then he considers theurgic and practical aspects of Qabalistic practice.

We finish the conversation as David shares his thoughts about his wife and partner, Sorita d&#039;Este. He describes their writing collaboration and the mission of Avalonia Books.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 79, we&#039;re joined by Collen A&#039;Miketh, author of the book &quot;Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot. Over? A Book About Stuff&quot;. Collen is a mage with extensive experience in Magick and esoteric studies. We discuss his esoteric history, training, influences, and then discuss his book which is based primarily on chaos magic theory and practice, focusing on practical aspects.

Collen uses humor effectively throughout the book to present his ideas and knowledge in a very down-to-earth manner. He describes his perspective on bringing magical practice into everyday life and effective ways that this can be done. We spend some time talking about solitary work versus group work and the nature of each. We delve into the nature of perceived reality and subjectivity. Then we tackle the concept of will, manifested will, and how it applies to our practice and life. Collen also stresses the importance of humor and having fun while doing the hard work of self-realization.

Please join us in the Occult of Personality Membership Section where Collen discusses his opinion about esotericism and Freemasonry which is quite interesting considering that he&#039;s the master of his Masonic lodge. He also guides a fascinating meditation called &quot;The Phoenix Box&quot;.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 77, we&#039;re joined by astrologer Lynn Hayes.
&quot;Lynn has been a consulting astrologer since the mid-1980s, working with clients to achieve greater self-understanding and empowerment. She uses the birthchart to identify psychological and evolutionary patterns and systems, and then uses a powerful combination of methods including &quot;vision crafting&quot; to permit breakthroughs in all areas of life and heal old wounds that can prevent moving forward. Clients report rapid progress in breaking through areas where they formerly felt &quot;stuck,&quot; and achieving a level of self-understanding not before known. This is why Lynn calls her practice &quot;Astrodynamics.&quot;&quot;

We begin our conversation with Lynn&#039;s interest in astrology and her unique approach. Through the use of psychological astrology, Lynn is able to assist others transform their lives. She describes this process as an alchemical method. We discuss Western astrology from a historical perspective and Lynn explains how her methods are different and geared more toward personal growth instead of prediction. We examine the astrological correspondences and how these manifest with deep implications about the nature of reality and our psychological conditions.

We explore the concepts of fate and predestination compared to free will. Lynn explains how scientific research indicates that human consciousness is far more influential than we usually assume. The birthchart provides a way to understand ourselves and can be used as a map or guide to help navigate through life with great benefit, allowing one to be proactive rather than reactive. She then explains how current events, including the economy, relate and correspond to locations of stars and planets, providing a variety of examples. We discuss the implication of Pluto&#039;s location in the heavens as well as Saturn and Uranus, whose positions in the coming months and years will highlight the transformation from concern with the physical and material to a focus on more spiritual matters.

We then delve into the realm where esoteric studies and conspiracy research converge. Lynn indicates that these intersection points are valid as guideposts to the way that, since ancient times, knowledge and wisdom has been kept from the majority of people. Lynn also explains how astrological practice and readings can serve as a tool we can use to become more aware of ourselves and our universe.

Lynn&#039;s approach to astrology, her knowledge of psychology and history, combined with her effective practical methods make her successful at what she does. I highly recommend that you check out Lynn&#039;s web site, blog, and internet radio show to explore her work and gain the benefit of her expertise.

The second part of our interview with Lynn is available in the Occult of Personality Membership Section. She explains how to interpret a natal chart using Sir Francis Bacon as the subject.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 76, we&#039;re joined by Nema and Aion, charter members of the Horus / Maat Lodge, a manifestation of the magickal double-current of the Aeon of Horus (93) and the Aeon of Maat (696). Comprised of Thelemic elements and Maat Magick, the Horus / Maat Lodge exists as a free and open magickal community. &quot;There are no degrees, lessons, laws, requirements, or restrictions of any kind in the H.M.L., save Truth.&quot;


We begin the interview by talking about their interest in esoteric studies and alternative spirituality. From there we learn about the origins of the Horus / Maat Lodge. Nema describes a group time-travel ritual in which she and others encountered a being from the future, named N&#039;Aton. N&#039;Aton is perceived as the idealized emerging consciousness of our species and its manifestation is the goal of the central ritual of the lodge. This event was closely followed by the transmission of &quot;Liber Pennae Praenumbra&quot; which announced the beginning of the Aeon of Maat in 1974.


&quot;In this Aeonic system, the Aeon of Horus began in 1904 with the writing of Liber AL vel Legis. The formula is that of the Crowned and Conquering Child, the Prince who ascends the throne upon the death (transformation) of the King, his father. The monument of the Osirian Aeon, the Military-Industrial Complex of East and West, has achieved its apotheosis in the nuclear arsenals that are capable of sterilizing the planet. It&#039;s the mission of Horus to represent this existential ultimatum as the Lord of Force and Fire.

&quot;The necessity at the base of the formula is neither subsistence nor sovereignty: it is survival. The Child is the point of the Aeon: the continuation of the human race. The Law of the Aeon is Love under Will; the application of this Law destroys the poison remnants of Osiris while at the same time it places power and responsibility in the hands of the individual.

&quot;Running concurrently with the Aeon of Horus since 1974 is the Aeon of Maat. She is the Daughter, twin to Horus, and her formula is Truth and Balance. She complements Horus&#039; warrior nature with her measure and justice. She ensures the survival that Horus establishes by initiating a fundamental change in humanity: the awakening of the Racial Unconscious to Racial Consciousness. As Horus signifies the Atomic Age, Maat signifies the Information Age; her Word is IPSOS, &quot;by the same mouth&quot;. In the Double Aeon, food production has at the same time become more automated and more home-grown organic, as business or belief. Recombinant DNA research and cloning promises changes in this area.

&quot;The successful transformation of humanity into a doubly-conscious species brings about the Wordless Aeon, whose particular godform is Harpocrate. Physical speech is unnecessary with a shared Consciousness; therefore is this Aeon Wordless.&quot;
- Nema, &quot;Panaeonic Magick&quot;


Aion then describes the impact of this magickal material and the journey to link up with Nema. From there we begin to discuss the transmission of knowledge from trans-dimensional intelligence, the evolution of humanity, the advance of technology, archetypal energies, the expansion of consciousness, and the future.


Nema explains some of the gematria employed  in her book &quot;Maat Magick: A Guide to Self Initiation&quot; and its implications. Nema and Aion talk about how Horus / Maat Lodge functions as an anti-authoritarian &quot;cyberlodge&quot;. We also discuss the concept and validity of self-initiation, the importance of daily spiritual practice, play and happiness, paying attention, and much, much more.

		<itunes:summary>&quot;Robert M. Place is an internationally known visionary artist and illustrator, whose award winning works, in painting, sculpture, and jewelry, have been displayed in galleries and museums in America, Europe, and Japan and graced the covers and pages of numerous books and publications. He is the designer, illustrator, and co-author, with Rosemary Ellen Guiley, of: The Alchemical Tarot and The Angels Tarot, which are both published by HarperCollins and have received international acclaim particularly for their skillful and illuminating graphics. He is the designer, illustrator, and author of The Tarot of the Saints, and The Buddha Tarot, which are published by Llewellyn. His fifth book, The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination, is published by Tarcher/Penguin. He has also authored Astrology and Divination, Magic and Alchemy, and Shamanism. His latest Tarot deck and book set is The Vampire Tarot, published by St. Martins Press.&quot;

To begin episode 75, Robert describes the prophetic and synchronistic manner that he was introduced to the Tarot. As an artist, he was able to intuitively grasp the symbolism and levels of meaning portrayed in the Tarot images, allowing him to create &quot;The Alchemical Tarot&quot;, a very highly-acclaimed and beautiful deck. Robert then describes his latest creation, &quot;The Vampire Tarot&quot;.

As a Tarot scholar, his research into the history and folklore of vampires and the Dracula legend led him to the realization that this story was like an inverse of the alchemical quest. The Great Work is analogous to the story told by the Major Arcana of the Tarot. In his analysis of the Dracula legend, Robert realized that this story was also a quest for immortality but in a far darker and different way, replacing the spiritual with the material.

Robert tells us how the vampire legends invoke the Jungian concept of facing the shadow or the other. The resurrection of these legends in literature coincided with the scientific revolution and Romanticism. The original vampire stories, like the unrefined unconscious mind were dark and frightening, but when examined in the light, by writers and artists, these same stories can take on an alluring quality. Robert explains this evolution from a historical, psychological, and artistic perspective.

We finish off the conversation as Robert describes how he views the Dracula legend as analogous to the quest for the Holy Grail. Dracula can be seen as the dark knight and those trying to defeat him as the Knights of the Round Table. His perspective on this legend and his beautiful artwork in &quot;The Vampire Tarot&quot; can bring forth yet another version of the archetypal hero&#039;s quest, there all along and just waiting for us to discover it.

Robert and I recorded another interview based on his research of Tarot history in &quot;The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination&quot;. This second interview is available in the Occult of Personality Member Section.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 74, we&#039;re joined by Orryelle Defenestrate-Bascule, &quot;a prolific visual, sonic and textual artist-magickian. The instruments of his arts and magicks include, but are not limited to: Australia’s Metamorphic Ritual Theatre Co. which presents public rituals aiming to transform rather than merely entertain the audiences.&quot; Orryelle explains how the act of creation is Magickal from an artist&#039;s perspective.


Orryelle is responsible for the &quot;ever-expanding digital archives and galleries of Mutation Parlour; a member of The HermAphroditic ChAOrder of the Silver Dusk, a global multicultural and multisubcultural blend of tradition and innovation, artist of &quot;Conjunctio&quot; (a Graphic Grimmoire), creator of the Book of Kaos Tarot, and author of A Brief HIRStory of TimEmiT. Orryelle has been extensively involved in the Horus-Maat Lodge, channeling several double-current Libers such as &#039;Pennae-Ultim-Atum&#039; and &#039;The Book of Going Back by Night&#039;.&quot;


Our conversation touches on the recently published graphic grimiore &quot;Conjunctio&quot; and presentation at the Esoteric Book Conference, the importance of working in the physical plane, aesthetics, art, beauty and transformation, including body modification. Orryelle also discusses the art of ritual performance, world wide travels to sacred sites, and even some thoughts about 2012.


Orryelle is extremely creative in many mediums, including poetry, art, music, theater, Magick, Alchemy, and self-transformation. Our conversation provides a bit of insight into Orryelle&#039;s unique Work.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 72, Christopher Knowles returns to the show for the second part of our fascinating interview (if you haven’t already, please listen to part 1 – Christopher Knowles and The Secret Sun, pt. 1).

Chris is the author of the Eagle Award-winning “Our Gods Wear Spandex: The Secret History of Comic Book Heroes,” published by Red Wheel/Weiser and co-author of “The Complete X-Files: Behind the Series, the Myths, and the Movies,” published by Insight Editions. This time, Chris joins us for a very in-depth discussion about the themes explored in his blog, “The Secret Sun”.

We begin with some thoughts about space travel and then delve into the concept of secrecy and its role throughout history. Chris expresses the view that modern technology and society are evolving with greater openness and availability of information. He also discusses the possibilities of learning about ourselves from the history of humanity through the ages.

Next, we explore the concept of ancient astronaut theory as well as its synchronistic manifestations in popular culture and media. Of course, these ideas are all attempts to provide a narrative for the origins of humanity. We discuss the interpretive methods used when analyzing ancient texts, from literal to esoteric exegesis.

Chris continues to stress the importance of questions instead of answers and that fiction, especially science fiction, is one of the best methods to use for exploring the possibilities of our imagination and the Universe. Don&#039;t miss this second part of the conversation with the amazing Christopher Knowles. His research and inquisitive perspective highlight some of the great mysteries that continue to occupy humanity in our quest to discover who and what we truly are.

We also recorded an extended exploration of Dr. Carl Jung&#039;s influence and teachings on Chris and his work that is available in the Occult of Personality Membership Section.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 71, our good friend Mitch Horowitz returns for the second part of our conversation about his excellent new book, “Occult America: The Secret History of How Mysticism Shaped Our Nation” published by Bantam (if you haven&#039;t already, please listen to the first part of the interview - Mitch Horowitz and &quot;Occult America&quot; pt.1). Mitch is the editor-in-chief of Tarcher / Peguin in New York and has also been our guest previously in podcast 21, Podcast 42 – The Life and Work of Paul Foster Case, and Podcast 48 – The Life and Work of Col. Henry Steel Olcott.

Mitch begins this interview by recounting the story of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. Smith was raised in the Burned-over district in upstate New York and he and his family were steeped in supernatural ideas and practices, including astrology and magic. Knowledge of the occult and folklore traditions of the Burned-over District are integral to understanding Smith and his family. For example, as a young man, Smith earned money using &quot;seer stones&quot; to find buried treasure.

Mitch explains how the background knowledge about Joseph Smith may allow us to understand his later experiences that led to the founding of his church in a different way. Smith was also a Freemason and Masonic philosophy, rites, and symbols influenced his religious practices.

Next, Mitch reviews the origins and continued popularity of the Ouija Board. Although it is marketed as a toy or game, there are many examples of paranormal activity associated with its use.

Last, Mitch delves into the story of Edgar Cayce. An extremely popular medium, Cayce is notable for the tremendous number of accurate predictions and readings that he gave while in a trance state. Mitch also highlights the high moral character of Cayce and its importance in the growth of New Age ideas and philosophies.

Again, I highly recommend “Occult America: The Secret History of How Mysticism Shaped Our Nation” by Mitch Horowitz. It is a well-researched, well-written and a crucial record of the hidden history of the United States.

The chapter about Paul Foster Case from &quot;Occult America&quot; is now available in the Occult of Personality Membership Section.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 70, our good friend Mitch Horowitz joins us again to discuss his excellent new book, &quot;Occult America: The Secret History of How Mysticism Shaped Our Nation&quot; published by Bantam Books. Mitch is the editor-in-chief of Tarcher / Peguin in New York and has been our guest previously in podcast 21, Podcast 42 - The Life and Work of Paul Foster Case, and Podcast 48 - The Life and Work of Col. Henry Steel Olcott.

Mitch begins our conversation by describing his observations of the esoteric history of the United States of America. American occultists evangelized esoteric ideas and planted the seeds for alternative New Age spirituality and self-help concepts, like positive thinking, that have spread around the world today. The intertwining of this occult history and the social development of the country is very often overlooked, glossed-over, or written out of mainstream history. Then Mitch tells us the intriguing story of the Publick Universal Friend, a spirit channeler that was the first public female religious figure in the country.

Next, Mitch talks about the speculation about America&#039;s role as a laboratory for religious exploration. He describes the integral role that Freemasonry and its philosophy played in the formation of the United States of America and its influence towards greater religious tolerance and liberalism cannot be overstated. He discusses the origins of the Craft and the real requirement for secrecy in the past and employment of ancient symbolism.

Mitch tells us about the Hoodoo experience of abolitionist, editor, orator, author, statesman and reformer, Frederick Douglass, at a crucial moment in his life. He talks about writer and spiritual teacher Ernest Holmes and his philosophies of mind power and positive thinking.

Then Mitch discusses Henry A. Wallace, a progressive public servant who served as President Franklin Roosevelt&#039;s secretary of agriculture and the 33rd vice-president. Wallace was an avid esoteric student and is responsible for suggesting the placement of the reverse of The Great Seal of the United States on the one dollar note. The controversy surrounding the public disclosure of Wallace&#039;s letters to mystic Nicholas Roerich was the undoing of his public career.

Finally, we talk about the modern acceptance of the ideas of people, schools, and movements that are considered New Age. Mitch lists these as:
&quot;1. Belief in the therapeutic value of spiritual or religious ideas.
2. Belief in a mind-body connection in health.
3. Belief that human consciousness is evolving to higher stages.
4. Belief that thoughts, in some greater or lesser measure, determine reality.
5. Belief that spiritual understanding is available without allegiance to a specific religion or doctrine.&quot;
I highly recommend &quot;Occult America: The Secret History of How Mysticism Shaped Our Nation&quot; by Mitch Horowitz. It is a comprehensive, well-researched, and masterful history that is an instant classic!

Check out the second part of our interview and...

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 69, we&#039;re joined by William J. Kiesel, the publisher and editor of Ouroboros Press. &quot;His long years in the antiquarian and esoteric book trade gave him access to rare books and manuscripts not generally available to the public. William has cultivated a lifelong care of books and has involved himself in every aspect of bookmaking, from bookbinding and typography to handset letterpress.&quot; William has also organized the Esoteric Book Conference.


We begin the interview with William describing how his interest in books and publishing developed. He talks about how he began collecting esoteric books at an early age and was inspired by a number of well-known esoteric authors and publishers. He highlights the tremendous amount of research and background work that goes into publishing antiquarian esoteric texts.


William describes how learning about aspects of publishing, such as bookbinding, paper selection, typesetting, and familiarity with various translations was crucial to his desire to publish new imprints of ancient esoteric books. We discuss some of the remarkable books that Ouroboros Press has released and some of his upcoming projects. We also talk about the Renaissance as a fruitful time for all knowledge, but especially in terms of esoteric books.


William talks about his interest in Alchemical symbolism, Hermetics, artwork, and the Western Esoteric Tradition. We touch on the current state and future of books, the tradition of book arts, and the concept of a book as a talisman. We finish off our conversation by discussing the Esoteric Book Conference, scheduled for September 19th and 20th, 2009 in Seattle, Washington, USA. William has organized this wonderful event to bring together publishers and readers of esoteric books.

		<itunes:summary>In podcast episode 68, we&#039;re joined again by Christopher Knowles. Chris is the author of the Eagle Award-winning “Our Gods Wear Spandex: The Secret History of Comic Book Heroes,” published by Red Wheel/Weiser and co-author of “The Complete X-Files: Behind the Series, the Myths, and the Movies,” published by Insight Editions. This time, Chris joins us for a very in-depth discussion about the themes explored in his blog, “The Secret Sun”.

Chris describes his research as modern mythology, alt-history and pop-cult symbology. We begin our conversation as he analyzes the Sun from a variety of perspectives, including scientific, symbolic, mythological, and religious. Chris traces some of the beginnings of solar symbolism and how these origins informs his work. By examining current events with a focus on symbolism and synchronicity, his work uncovers many interesting correspondences.

Chris expresses his view that the evolution of humanity will include the development of many concepts that are now considered marginal, but celebrated in popular culture and media, such as psychism, psychedelics, shamanism, and other ways of changing consciousness. Of course, these ideas hearken back to ancient cultures.

Chris talks about his views of ancient Mystery schools, esoteric orders, Freemasonry and the similar symbols that they employ. He shares his thoughts about the Sirius mystery and we talk about the multiple levels of meaning in esoteric symbols and texts. From there, we delve into ancient astronaut theory, space travel, and the living Universe of which everything is an expression.

Chris stresses the importance of asking questions instead of finding answers. He also talks about the utilization of science fiction, and fiction in general, to express ideas that often are not considered seriously outside of that realm.

Don&#039;t miss the second part of this fascinating conversation...

We also recorded an extended exploration of Dr. Carl Jung&#039;s influence and teachings on Chris and his work that is available in the Occult of Personality Membership Section.

Frater W.I.T. returns to the show in episode 67 to discuss his book &quot;Advanced Enochian Magick: A Manual of Theory, Training, and Practice for the Novice and the Adept&quot;.


We open the conversation discussing the concept of using Magick as a tool for the evolution of human consciousness.  Frater W.I.T. talks about the allure and effectiveness of the Enochian system, originally developed by Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley in 1584. He restates his belief that, &quot;... Thelema is a direct expression of the futuristic ideal of Enochian Magick... [the use of which] ...leads to a transcendence of time and space in the material universe. All new pathways of evolution are possible.&quot;


Frater W.I.T. discusses his opinion that well-known criticisms of Enochian Magick are factually incorrect and charges that these are attempts to limit access to empowering methods. He believes that dependence and co-dependence on the path of self-realization is dangerous, and the experience should be liberating and empowering. He talks about Dr. John Dee, Edward Kelley, Aleister Crowley, and the negative perception of occult practitioners in general due to ignorance and medieval thinking. His opinion is that these men suffered not because of Magickal practice, but for a variety of more mundane reasons.


Frater W.I.T.&#039;s intention by writing &quot;Advanced Enochian Magick&quot; is to promote the practice of Magick and ultimately help individuals evolve. He wrote this book to serve as a basic guide to those wanting to become proficient in Magick in an independent manner. His book shows not only why and how to practice, but what one should expect as results. By providing an accessible, interesting, and distinct perspective, he is reaching out to more advanced practitioners with new material and trying to inspire neophytes to persevere.


Frater W.I.T. talks about the need to view Magick in a modern, scientific context and promotes multi-disciplinary study in order that consciousness may be better understood. He talks about the power of elevated consciousness and projecting it into physical reality by the use of Magickal practice. We finish off the conversation by discussing the concepts of invocation and evocation.

		<itunes:summary>Originally published on June 30, 2009

We’re joined again by our friend Dr. Paul Clark, Steward of Fraternitas L.V.X. Occulta. Dr. Clark begins by talking about the F.L.O’s publication of the early lessons of Paul Foster Case, “Occult Fundamentals and Spiritual Unfoldment - Volume 1: The Early Writings” and “Esoteric Secrets of Meditation and Magic - Volume 2: The Early Writings“.


Volume one begins with a short biography of Case followed by “Occult Fundamentals”, a wide introductory survey of topics studied as part of the Western Mystery Tradition. “Spiritual Unfoldment” uses the powerful archetypal images of the Tarot to guide students through the seven stages of development, from the illusion of bondage to cosmic awakening.


In the second volume, the first section provides a combination of Eastern and Western meditation techniques, from concentration, step by step, to the reception of teachings of the Universal Mind. The section about Magic shows how the practical Qabalah affects our everyday lives and the concept of linking aspects of consciousness to symbols, Magical tools, and talismans.


Dr. Clark elaborates on the concept of initiation and the role of initiates in the current age. He talks about how mystical revelations are not integrated until one comes down from the mountain and is able to expound the Truth of those experiences in the marketplace. Next, Dr. Clark discusses the Greater Initiation, linking the self-conscious with super consciousness, Gnosis, Knowledge and Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel, and how an initiate is someone in the process of awakening, equilibrating, self-purifying, and consecrating with the goal of service to others.

Dr. Clark then addresses the great lies perpetrated throughout the ages, including separation, materialism, and mortality. We finish off the interview by talking about the concept of Hieros gamos, the sacred marriage.

In this episode, we&#039;re joined by Aepril Schaile. &quot;Aepril is an astrologer, musician and composer, talented dancer and dance teacher, writer and storyteller, mythologist, animal rights advocate, and Witch.&quot; She has been called “an American priestess of the Dark Goddess” and her performances are quite extraordinary. Our conversation begins as Aepril describes her early life and interest in the esoteric. From there we begin talking about her dancing, belly dance, and the combination of mythology, Magick, Astrology, theater, performance, and the creation of Beauty.


Aepril talks about identifying with darker feminine archetypes and how this influences her Work. She provides her perspective on being a Witch, living in Salem, Massachusetts, and some of her teachers and influences.



The conversation turns to Astrology, correspondences, her experience with the insights it provides, and her connection with Plutonic energies. Aepril explains how all of these esoteric and theatrical disciplines fit together for her and, lastly, hopes for the future of that Work.

In this episode, we&#039;re joined by mage, author, teacher, and healer Andrieh Vitimus. We begin the interview by talking about Andrieh&#039;s history, his family, and how he became interested in Magic. From there, we talk about what Magic is and how it can be defined. Andrieh is connected with a variety of esoteric currents, including Chaos Magic, Voudon, ceremonial, and energy work. His book, entitled &quot;Hands-On Chaos Magic: Reality Manipulation Through the Ovayki Current&quot; is accessible and enjoyable.


The primary objective of Andrieh&#039;s experimental Work is to present practical and useful techniques that empower the practitioner to change themselves and their world. By creatively engaging with the Universe, one may grow and expand in a conscious way. He explains that there are different methods to accomplish this and each practitioner must find those that work best for them. We discuss Andrieh&#039;s experience using Magic to drastically alter his circumstances and how his life story can serve as inspiration to others.


Next we discuss Andrieh&#039;s connection with Voudon and how it aids his Work. Then we talk about the practical importance of meditation, trance states, and the amazing benefits from this simple, yet profound practice. The benefits of meditative practice include improved physical and emotional health, better decision making skills, temporary refuge from the hectic pace of daily life, and greater potency of Magical operations.


I highly recommend Andrieh Vitimus&#039; book &quot;Hands-On Chaos Magic: Reality Manipulation Through the Ovayki Current&quot;. He has presented a robust and excellent volume that is full of conceptual theory along with many meditative and practical exercises.

Jason Augustus Newcomb returns to the show in this episode to discuss his book &quot;Practical Enochian Magick&quot; and other subjects.


We discuss the allure and power of the Enochian system and Jason&#039;s practical approach and he talks about the inherent dangers of all Magickal practices.


Jason talks about solar cycles and astrological currents, the coming of Spring, and the current economic crisis. He notes that these situations can be an opportunity for change and self-actualization is the key to success.


We also talk about Jason&#039;s views on the art of writing, the need for magicians and self-transformation.


He then addresses Thelema and his experience as a Thelemite.


The Equinox Festival will be taking place in London from Friday, June 12th through Sunday, June 14th. Raymond Salvatore Harmon joins us to speak about it after the interview.

David Goddard returns in this episode to discuss a variety of esoteric subjects. David is one of the founders of Rising Phoenix Foundation, a school dedicated to “transmitting Western esoteric wisdom.” Our conversation begins with astrology and the effect of the lunar nodes.

David describes the real world effect of the head and tail of the dragon, including current economic and political turmoil. Next, we delve into the subconscious mind and the tradition of working with symbols and meditations to unlock its awesome power. His book &quot;Tower of Alchemy&quot; is an excellent illustration of this method.

From there, David discusses the concept of initiation followed by an exposition on the similarity of Magic and religion, noting that the way humanity thinks of sacrifice has changed greatly since ancient times.

We then talk about the Magical operations detailed in David&#039;s book, &quot;Sword of Light&quot; and their importance. We finish the conversation by talking about the concepts of energy, intention, and the way they work together.

		<itunes:summary>Originally published on May 22, 2009

In this episode, we&#039;re joined by Jake Stratton-Kent. Jake is one of the leading proponents of English Qaballa and a long-time magician and researcher. As a practitioner of Goetia for over 37 years, his knowledge and insights are extremely valuable. Jake&#039;s new book is entitled, &quot;The Encyclopedia Goetica Volume One: The True Grimoire&quot;, a beautiful edition available from Scarlet Imprint.

Our conversation covers Jake&#039;s esoteric experience and English Qabalah and its significance. He notes that this a true Qabalah that involves the English &quot;language, a holy text, and mathematical laws at work between them.&quot; From there, we turn to Goetia.

Jake explains why the Grimorium Verum, or True Grimoire, inspired him, including the syncretic composition, treatment of entities, and correspondences from many varied traditions. Interestingly, he also addresses the harm that arguments about whether the contacted entities are internal, external or both, might have upon the operations.


[The &quot;True Grimoire&quot;] ... enables the persistent seeker to see, essentially, what many have failed to see, that underlying Goetic magic is a hidden tradition of great depth and significance. It possesses a traditional methodology that confronts and deals directly with the same primal realities faced by our most remote ancestors; in which all later magic and religion had their original impetus, but which in the West is primarily preserved in Goetic magic alone. As the anthropology of pre-history has shown, it was this rejected knowledge that initiated human evolution, giving the capacity for abstract or symbolic thought first activated in magic and ritual, and thus for all subsequent scientific and cultural advances. In these elements, its integrated completeness and primal power, lays the importance, and the Truth, of the True Grimoire.
- Jake Stratton-Kent, excerpt from the &quot;The Encyclopedia Goetica Volume One: The True Grimoire&quot;, p. 10

I highly recommend this beautiful volume to anyone interested in practicing or researching Goetia. The analysis is extremely detailed and insightful allowing the reader to appreciate the majesty of this Work. The book is also another treasure from Scarlet Imprint, adding to their wonderful catalog.

Jake Stratton-Kent and Scarlet Imprint are both appearing as speakers at the May 23rd, 2009 Occulture Festival in London, England.

		<itunes:summary>Originally published on May 11, 2009

It&#039;s my pleasure to bring you this episode featuring a discussion with musician and researcher Ezra Sandzer-Bell. Ezra has done extensive research and writing about the origins and esoteric connections of western music. The focus of our conversation is primarily the correspondence between sound and color, as well as a system to combine the the two, named &quot;Marcotone.&quot;

MARCOTONE from Sanskrit


	 Ma – to measure
	 R – raga (by scaling)
	 Co – color
	 Tone – pitch

Marcotone was developed and documented by Edward Maryon in the early part of the 20th century and has been used by esoteric practitioners to verify their own doctrine and develop practices to attune the mind.



With his extensive musical background and understanding of music theory, Ezra does a phenomenal job of explaining the Marcotone system, how it functions, some mathematical inconsistencies, and his own experience in using it. One of the main points to draw from the discussion is that Marcotone is a spiritual system and does produce results.



Ezra has also been hard at work with Steve Willner to produce a series of videos exploring concepts relating to music, color, and thought. These videos are a real treat and I encourage you to check them out.



I learned quite a bit from Ezra about the way sound and color can be combined and how music can affect us in a variety of ways. The amount of time and effort that Ezra has spent researching these topics is evident from his explanations and insights into what might seem mundane to the uninitiated. I hope you enjoy our conversation as much as we did!

In this episode, we turn to writer Greg Fish for a scientific and skeptical perspective on a variety of interesting subjects. He provides this viewpoint in his blog Weird Things, &quot;researching big things, looking for the amazing, the unexpected and illuminating old facts in a new light,&quot; as well in his essays on science, technology and social issues for BusinessWeek.com. Our conversation begins with a brief analysis of the intersections of extraterrestrial life, ultraterrestrial intelligences, space travel, ancient civilizations, and theology.


Then we delve into the area of UFOs, secret government projects, advanced technology, ancient astronaut theory, and eschatology. Fish&#039;s study of the occult, conspiracy, UFOlogy, and related scientific evidence is useful for his skeptical analysis.


Our next subject is transhumanism, the philosophies involved, and the potential for future conflict.  Lastly, Fish reviews the concept of conspiracy and some of the pitfalls.

Greg Fish has kindly offered the first two chapters of his fiction book &quot;Shadow Nation&quot; to listeners as a free download - &quot;Shadow Nation&quot; sample chapters PDF

Christopher Penczak joins us to talk about witchcraft, Magick, spirituality, religion, teaching, and some of his books, including his latest, &quot;The Living Temple of Witchcraft Volume One: The Descent of the Goddess.&quot;


We talk about the way religion and magic fit together. Our conversation then delves into Christopher&#039;s spiritual path, witchcraft, and the Goddess. He describes the attraction of the Sacred Feminine for him and how it led him back to a more spiritual and magical life.


We discuss the syncretic nature of his teaching and praxis that combines witchcraft, ideas from Hermetics, Qabalah, and even Alchemy. Christopher talks about how witchcraft shares ideas in common with Thelema and how Crowley&#039;s work inspired him when he was younger. We touch on the concept of balance in spirituality and life in general. Penczak&#039;s books and classes are very highly regarded, and in this conversation, you&#039;ll hear why.

		<itunes:summary>Originally published on February 10, 2009

Our guest in this episode is writer, podcaster, philosopher and more - Aeolus Kephas. He is the author of &quot;The Lucid View: Investigations in Occultism, UFOlogy, and Paranoid Awareness.&quot;


Aeolus&#039; blog is called &quot;This Is Not It&quot; and he produced an excellent podcast called Stormy Weather. Billed as &quot;News From the Front Line in the End Times,&quot; his work deals with areas of research that test, or even violate the limits of consensus reality. Our conversation begins as Aeolus describes his work and how he approaches these subjects.


We discuss philosophies of consciousness and how researching these topics affects our understanding of them. The dialogue also delves into conspiranoid awareness, parapolitics, UFO&#039;s, and the trickster aspect present in our perception of these things. We relate the ideas exposed here to classical systems of Qabalah and Tarot. Lastly, he defines the meaning of the name Aeolus Kephas.


Ultimately, the study of these subjects may teach us more about ourselves than anything else. Aeolus is a master of dissecting human perception and reaction to the paranormal. His work elucidates elements of consciousness in a way that is not common. I find what he has to say interesting and his approach to be refreshing. What do you think?

		<itunes:summary>Originally published on January 20, 2009

Tau David Beth is a Gnostic Bishop, a mage, a teacher, a writer, a philosopher, an esoteric explorer and Sovereign Grand Master of Ordo Templi Orientis Antiqua and La Couleuvre Noire, two esoteric orders that practice Voudon Gnostic Magic. His recent book is entitled &quot;Voudon Gnosis&quot; and is available from Scarlet Imprint publishers.


I highly recommend &quot;Voudon Gnosis&quot; by David Beth, as it is a fascinating interpretation of various aspects of this complex syncretic system by an adept and learned practitioner, not to mention that the book is a beautiful publication by Scarlet Imprint. By providing his perspective, David builds upon Voudon Gnostic philosophies and practices that were initially introduced to the greater public by Tau Michael Bertiaux in the &quot;Voudon Gnostic Workbook.&quot; We then discuss the history of, and the type of Work in which the O.T.O.A. and L.C.N. are engaged, as well as Fraternitas Borealis, described as a &quot;Hyperborean&quot; Mystery School focusing on Magical experimentation, and Ecclesia Gnostic Aeterna, a Gnostic community and Church with apostolic succession.


Our conversation covers the concepts of the &quot;merciless path,&quot; esoteric love, and Soror Mystica. David provides advice for those interested in the practice of Voudon Gnosis and describes potential pitfalls. We review the usefulness of archetypes and myths and note that they provide deep esoteric lessons. Next, we talk about the significance of the combination of mage and priest or bishop.


David also explains how occult practices inform one&#039;s worldview. Finally, he discusses the importance of spiritual Work and Philosophy, very practical aspects of esoteric information and hopes for the future.

David Goddard joins us in this episode to discuss some of his work. David is one of the founders of Rising Phoenix Foundation, a school dedicated to &quot;transmitting western esoteric wisdom.&quot; He has also written several texts, including, &quot;The Sacred Magic of the Angels.&quot;

Our conversation begins as David describes the reason why these teachings, only taught to high initiates in the past, are now available openly due to the perilous times in which we live. He reviews the origins of Angelic magic in ancient Egypt and Babylon. Part of the same tradition as the Book of Enoch, this system has been passed down from antiquity. We then discuss the Great Work of Alchemy rather extensively, a subject brilliantly exposed in theory and practice in David&#039;s book, &quot;The Tower of Alchemy: An Advanced Guide to the Great Work.&quot;

David reviews the true meaning of the Royal Art of Alchemy, the relationship of Alchemy and Qabalah, and the meaning of the Emerald Tablet. Then we discuss the relationship between eastern and western religion and esoterica and the concept of a world spiritual tradition. Finally, we talk about the Work of Rising Phoenix Foundation.



&quot;I sustain creation
In the midst of a perpetual ebb and flow.
Therefore do I assume the appearance of a refiner&#039;s fire,
Forever purging out the dross of forms outworn.
This is mine aspect of Severity,
And of this it is written,
&quot;Tetragrammaton Elohim is a devouring fire.&quot;
Thus am I as one who testeth gold in a furnace,
And this aspect of my being
Presenteth to the unrighteous
A face of wrath.
Yet by the purgation of fire
Do I uphold and sustain thee
In every moment of thy life.
For when thou hast been tried as by fire,
The gold of thy Beauty shall be purged of all dross
... and ... shalt thou behold
The Shining One
Who is thine own true Self.&quot;
- excerpted from &quot;The Meditation on Samekh&quot; in &quot;The Book of Tokens&quot;

		<itunes:summary>Originally published on November 18, 2008

Carroll &quot;Poke&quot; Runyon is the Archimage of Ordo Templi Astartes, the longest running, continuously operating magical lodge in the U.S.A. He and his order have published a remarkable series of books and videos detailing their Workings in Solomonic Magick, scrying, and seasonal rites.


Our conversation begins as Poke describes his early life and how he became interested in esoteric ideas and practices, primarily for health reasons. We discuss the various aspects and practices that encourage personal unfoldment, including certain yogic disciplines, universal archetypes and symbolism, and relating scientific concepts to more ancient Hermetic ideas. Poke then gets into discussing using self-hypnosis as part of the scrying process and how he discovered this important ingredient. From there we get into talking about Phoenician Canaanite religion and mythology as well as the seasonal rites that celebrate them.


Phoenician Canaanite religion is directly related to the concept of the Temple of Solomon and builder Chiram Abiff. Next, we discuss the the Lost Word of Freemasonry. Poke explains how the legend relates the concept that, &quot;Only the Kings still understand that the Lost Word is Light within us all.&quot; Poke tells us how, historically, Freemasonry has always provided a common ground for men of different faiths and creeds to come together as equals. He also discusses the more modern transformations that have occurred, specifically with regard to the 28th degree of the Scottish Rite - The Knight of the Sun or Prince Adept.


Then we talk about Poke&#039;s film, &quot;Beyond Lemuria: The Shaver Mystery and the Secret of Mt. Shasta.&quot; He describes the way he was fascinated by Richard Shaver and had his own experience on Mt. Shasta. The film features Lon DuQuette, Paul Clark and Merrick Hamer, as well as a story that employs mystery, myth, magick, and spirituality to take the viewer on a journey.


As Poke explains at the conclusion to our conversation, we need to &quot;know what our obligation to the Light is ... No matter what you believe or what you revere, it is your way to the Light. The same Light is within everybody and the only place you&#039;ll find it is inside yourself.&quot;

Our good friend Lon Milo DuQuette returns to the show in Podcast 52 to discuss his latest book, &quot;Enochian Vision Magick - An Introduction and Practical Guide to the Magick of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley.&quot;


We begin the conversation with an extensive review of Dr. John Dee from a historical perspective including his mathematical skills, astrology, extensive interest in esoteric theory and practices, and his work as a spy.


Dr. John Dee was a true genius and used the accepted technology of the ages to achieve his goals.


Lon then describes Dr. Dee&#039;s meeting medium Edward Kelley. Their subsequent workings form the basis for DuQuette&#039;s book &quot;Enochian Vision Magick.&quot; Lon then helps us understand the extensive attunement process, including the Hyptarchia Mystica and Liber Loagaeth and the Angelic alphabet.


This attunement process resulted finally in the reception of the Enochian system. Lon&#039;s description of the process, in both the book and this recording, make it clear how crucial the entire work was in making the final product so effective.


Lon DuQuette&#039;s &quot;Enochian Vision Magick&quot; is the best book that I have encountered on this subject. I highly recommend it to all those interested in learning more about this amazing system of Angelic magick. The descriptions of the historical process as well as the practical guide for the reader exceeds all expectations.

After a much needed hiatus, we return in espisode 51 with Daniel Tatman and The Bath Mystery&#039;s. I want to take a moment to thank all the listeners for your continued support and patience while awaiting a new episode, especially all those who emailed to inquire and make sure things were alright. In the next few weeks, we&#039;ll have more new episodes featuring Lon Milo Duquette discussing his amazing book, &quot;Enochian Vision Magick,&quot; and a rare interview with Poke Runyon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daniel Tatman has done some very interesting scholarly research on the history and architecture of Bath, Somerset, UK. We begin our conversation by talking about Dan&#039;s family history and connections to the City of Bath. One area of particular interest is his grandfather&#039;s work in Africa and its implications.


Dan describes the eventful history of the City of Bath, beginning with King Bladud and his pigs stumbling upon the healing waters of the springs. From that point, we discuss the various groups that lived in the area, including Celts and Romans and the cultural fusion that resulted, encompassing philosophy, religion, and commerce. We also talk about the way that the underground streams, veins of metals, and ley lines all converge in Bath.


The historic personages in the story of Bath and its architecture include Alfred the Great, John Wood (the Elder), and George Withers. We review how these men shaped the city and the unique architecture and symbolism they employed.


We discuss George Withers&#039; verses accompanying the alchemical engravings of Chrispin van Passe, published as &quot;A Collection of Emblemes, Ancient and Moderne&quot; and the influences of this philosophy on architecture.


Daniel does an excellent job of researching and explaining the subjects of history, architecture, and symbolism in the City of Bath. His own personal connections and family history clearly add to his unique perspective. The upcoming book is sure to be a worthwhile addition to your collection and you can pre-order it by contacting Daniel by email.

First, on this the occasion of the 50th episode, I want to express my thanks to all who have listened to Occult of Personality podcasts as well as all the writers and researchers who have graciously spent some of their time with us. It is my humble wish that you may have learned as much by listening to these podcasts as I have by helping to create them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this 50th episode, we&#039;re joined by historian of Freemasonry, Angel Millar. Angel has an extensive historical knowledge of the Craft and associated fraternal orders and societies. We begin our conversation with the subject of the origins of Freemasonry and the seemingly diverse streams that may have fed it - specifically ancient Mysteries, stone masons, neo-Templarism, Enlightenment philosophies, and Christianity.

The discussion delves into Rosicrucianism, particularly the Golden Rosicrucians that formed the basis for later Masonic Rosicrucian societies, such as Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. This material is fascinating for those that enjoy the mystery of the origin of Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism. Millar does a fantastic job of explaining his perspective based on scholarly research displayed in both his first book, Freemasonry: A History and as yet unpublished book, The Forest of Symbols: Freemasonry and the Western Esoteric Tradition.



We also cover topics like Sacred Geometry, the concept of clandestine or irregular Masonry, the Rite of Strict Templar Observance, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and Aleister Crowley&#039;s Masonic adventures.

As an expert in Masonic symbolism, art, regalia and textiles, and as an accomplished artist, Millar has also created a number of artworks inspired by classical Masonic imagery. His artwork has been exhibited in Britain, the U.S.A. and elsewhere, and several of his Masonic-inspired works are in the permanent collection of the Chancellor Robert R. Livingston museum in New York City.

Our good friend Mitch Horowitz returns in this episode to reveal the amazing life of Colonel Henry Steel Olcott (1832-1907). Our conversation starts with young Olcott&#039;s humble beginnings, early successes in scientific agriculture,  and investigations into military contractor corruption during the U.S. Civil War and the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. It was after this point that Olcott&#039;s life took an even more interesting turn.



Mitch describes how Olcott met Madame Blavatsky. The two helped found the Theosophical Society soon thereafter. Olcott served as the first president of the organization and did a tremendous amount to advance their cause. We talk about their Mahatmas and Olcott&#039;s experiences with the Masters. Mitch describes the fascinating story of young Mohandas Gandhi&#039;s involvement with Theosophy. We also discuss the Herculean work Olcott did to promote Buddhism and Hinduism. It is nothing short of miraculous how a man from such humble beginnings, without a formal education, was able to influence literally billions of people.


&quot;There is a great earnestness in the character of this man and I think that too must have had something to do with the effectiveness of Theosophy as an organization. He brought principles and ideals and sincerity into Theosophy... Part of the reason we&#039;ve heard of Henry Olcott was ... that he was a man of great character... There was something of moral substance to this man. Studying the life of Henry Steel Olcott can challenge all kinds of prejudices, received opinions, and ideas about occultism, about the Western Esoteric Tradition, about how supernaturalism played itself out in the ... nineteenth and twentieth centuries... His warmth, ethics, earnestness, and sincerity made him a great man of his time.&quot; - Mitch Horowitz

Our good friend Christopher Moors of CreativeCosmos.org returns in this episode to discuss the exploration of the inner realms.


Chris begins our conversation by talking about bringing the soul into the body, making space for this process to occur, separating the subtle from the gross, and being open to new feelings and experiences. This leads into talking about the myriad ways that conscious unfoldment might manifest.


Psychic abilities like intuition, telepathy, clairvoyance, clairaudience, and visions have been experienced by those who   align the outer and inner worlds. We also speak about animals and interacting with them.


The concept of the soul journey and walking the path round out our conversation.

Check out Christopher&#039;s book entitled &quot;Ruminations of the Universe&quot;.

Dr. Paul Clark is a renowned writer and lecturer, as well as the Steward of the Fraternity of the Hidden Light, or F.L.O. (Fraternitas L.V.X. Occulta). F.L.O. is a Mystery school in the western esoteric tradition. Dr. Clark joins us to discuss the nature and purpose of the Fraternity of the Hidden Light, and what it offers to its members.


&quot;Dr. Paul Clark began esoteric studies at an early age by corresponding with W.E. Butler. When Paul reached the age of twelve, W.E. Butler suggested Paul contact the Reverend Ann Davies, who was then Prolocutor-General of the Builders of the Adytum and thus began a long and rewarding relationship. Paul spent the next thirteen years studying under Ann Davies and Paul was a member of a select circle of seven “stewards” receiving advanced instruction directly from Ann.

In 1982, Paul and a group of Initiates of high grade, founded the Fraternity of the Hidden Light, an Aquarian Age Mystery School. As Steward of the Fraternity, Paul is known for his ability to inspire others to take their spiritual evolution in hand so that they may achieve their full potential as co-creators.

Paul has written several books including &quot;The Book of the Rose&quot;, &quot;The Secret Cipher of the Golden Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Broken Seal&quot; and has authored two instructional courses taken by numerous students around the world: &quot;The Threshold&quot; and &quot;The Path of Return.&quot;


Our discussion also covers the influence of Paul Foster Case and Ann Davies, the importance and relevance of Qabalah to the study of esoteric science, the symbolism of the Tarot, and the purpose of ceremonial magick. These modalities of study allow us insight and unfoldment that has proven effective for seekers throughout the ages. The importance of balance and aligning the self-conscious and the subconscious is also stressed, along with the concept of service. Lastly, Paul  shares his hopes for the future with us.



&quot;My presence is the cause of every form,
And to those who have eyes to see,
Wherever a man may plant his foot is holy ground.

Not alone in sanctuaries set apart,
But in the street and market-place,
In the abode of sin
As well as in the house of prayer,
Mayest thou say with thy Father Jacob,
&quot;Surely the Lord is in this place;
And I knew it not.&quot;

Verily, thy consciousness of body
Is my self-knowledge of form,
And by that knowledge working in thee
Do I maintain thine existence
In all states and conditions.

Behold, I dwell with thee, O Israel,
And thou dwellest with me.
Take heed
That thou despise not thy Lord in human form.

Paul Tisdell is a surfer, initiate, scribe, and teacher. He joins us to discuss his awakening process and spiritual journey, the compilation of Wisdom, and his work in the field of Hermes.



Our conversation begins with Paul describing how he was made aware of his purpose and the amazing experiences that this journey entailed. He talks about his initiation, trials, and the concept that rose above all others - Love.



Our conversation also covers the Royal Art of Alchemy, the sacred flame, Tarot, Qabalah, the importance of timing, and his impressions of teaching the Wisdom.



I AM the circle of eternal flame,
Self-fed.

From this Fire all things proceed,
In it all things have their being,
And to it all return.

To the unenlightened
It is a devouring flame,
And therefore is it the fang of death;
For by my transforming power
Do I cause the cessation of mine expression
In created forms,
And the unwise see not that cessation in one form
Is but the transition to another.

SHIN, the TOOTH or fang,
Is the perfect circle also,
Without beginning,
Without end.
This the wise perceive,
And know that for no creature
Can there be death.

Triple is my flame in manifestation,
And one in essence.
Three tongues of Fire,
Three manifesting Words,
And One Being whence all come forth.
One Archetypal world,
One creative letter.
And three worlds derived therefrom.
Such is the manifestation of the sacred Fire.
