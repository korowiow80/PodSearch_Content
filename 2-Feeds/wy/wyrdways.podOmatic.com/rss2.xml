Not only will you be hearing some tracks from their excellent new album, The Hunt, you&#8217;ll get my conversation with Fox and now former stixman Seb at the Damnation Festival in Leeds at the end of last year.  As it was the first time I&#8217;d ever interviewed them, you&#8217;ll also get their musical choices later in the show.  What else have I got for you?  How about some new live Gojira, some new Sabaton and Counterhold, and a track from Accept guitarist Herman Frank&#8217;s solo album?

By the way, if you&#8217;re in a band (originals or covers) and you want to be on the show, get in touch with me via the website at http://www.wyrdwaysrs.com, Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/wyrdwaysrockshow) or ReverbNation (http://www.reverbnation.com/wyrdwaysrockshow) and send me some files (or a CD). If I like what I hear, I&#8217;ll play your stuff on the show.  You can also listen at the new time of 10:15pm BST on PlanetMosh every Monday, 8pm EST on RockStarsGlued.com every Thursday and Helldoradio on Saturday at 4pm EST. If you've got a smartphone, you can also find The Wyrd Ways Rock Show on the Tune-In Radio app.

The new Europe album, Bag Of Bones, was embargoed until 30th April, so I decided to delay this week&#8217;s show until the embargo was lifted.  You&#8217;ll be hearing several tracks from the album during the run of the show.  As well as that, you&#8217;ll also be hearing new stuff from Circus Maximus, Anathema and Nightqueen.  This week&#8217;s Shock Of The New features Weapon, The Dead Wretched, Burlak, Inverticrux and Skelectory.

      <itunes:summary>Late again, but I do have a good reason.  The new Europe album, Bag Of Bones, was embargoed until 30th April, so I decided to delay this week&#8217;s show until the embargo was lifted.  You&#8217;ll be hearing several tracks from the album during the run of the show.  As well as that, you&#8217;ll also be hearing new stuff from Circus Maximus, Anathema and Nightqueen.  This week&#8217;s Shock Of The New features Weapon, The Dead Wretched, Burlak, Inverticrux and Skelectory.

By the way, if you&#8217;re in a band (originals or covers) and you want to be on the show, get in touch with me via the website at http://www.wyrdwaysrs.com, Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/wyrdwaysrockshow) or ReverbNation (http://www.reverbnation.com/wyrdwaysrockshow).  If you send me some files (or a CD) and I like what I hear, I&#8217;ll play your stuff on the show.   You can also listen at 8pm EST on RockStarsGlued.com every Thursday or Helldoradio on Saturday at 4pm EST.

Sonisphere cancelled, Sabaton splitting up... not good at all.  There are bright spots, though, and in this week's Wyrd Ways Rock Show, we look at the good and the bad.  That means music from the aforementioned Sabaton, Queen, Alestorm and the second part of Dr Jim Gets Hammered (also known as IronLord's Hammerfest Review... but I prefer the &quot;Hammered&quot; thing, myself!).  Anyway, the website's at http://www.wyrdwaysrs.com... go there, click on the e-mail link or the contact form and say &quot;Hello&quot;.</description>
