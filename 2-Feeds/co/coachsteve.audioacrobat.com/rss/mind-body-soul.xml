    <description>We will attempt to demystify the realms of Mind, Body &amp; Soul to bring you a more holistic and balanced way of living healthier in all realms of the psyche, the spirit and the body.&#13;

A healthy spirit is a healthy mind and a healthy mind is a healthy body. When all parts function in harmony life can exceed all your expectations. Only then, can you become who you always wanted to be.&#13;
&#13;
Have you ever had Extraordinary Human Experience? Have you ever had a near death experience which has profoundly changed your life? Are you intuitively more aware than the average person you know? Do you know that we all have the same potentials?&#13;
&#13;
Did movie “The Secret” leave you wanting more? We will tell you why? We will reveal the truth behind the “Law of Attraction”.&#13;
&#13;
Step on board and fasten your seatbelt for a ride of a lifetime.</description>

On the show we have explored why being grounded is important, how to be
grounded?, being in nature and the importance of our breath.

Amethyst clearly described her 5 pillar coaching process and why coaches have a challenge with giving time for coaching income vs having a value mindset.

From her personal experience of answering the call to a higher purpose and mission along with a lifetime of experience as a serial entrepreneur herself, Amethyst is familiar with both the journey as well as the “energetic shifts” that can be made to get clear, focused, present and grounded in one’s true destiny and how to live out that destiny through entrepreneurial activities.

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Judy Winslow-She is a "Brandologist" and she believes she has been that way all her life.

Judy shares her biggest challenge that she has overcome in her life and now it allows her to be the branding expert she is.

We played the game of "The Art of Listening" on the show and she got me
100%. She is a great listener.

We also discussed her blog about why going along with the crowd in LinkedIn does not serve you.

More about Judy Winslow: She had an awkward adolescence. She felt
misunderstood and didn't fit in very well. It was something she wanted to 'fix' for quite awhile.

But at a point she realized something amazing. Those of us who don't fit in have something to celebrate, because we have the opportunity to create something truly original.

She realized that standing out is good.

Her belief is that Branding is much like biology in that we all have a very distinct cellular structure that directs us from early on in life, based on a combination of traits and forces. It's this compilation that makes us who we are, and when we not only recognize this, but harness it for our own personal and professional growth, things can get very interesting in our lives.

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Schelli Whitehouse-she is a certified money, marketing and soul coach.

Schelli told us her story about her past and how she got to do what she does today which is creating wealth through personal branding.

She said: "When we recognize and trust that grander version of ourselves we are instilled with courage and inspiration to move into action."

Her passion is all about moving people forward and assisting them to find the next higher version of themselves.

She also shared my favorite quote from Marianne Williamson-"Our deepest
fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are
powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most
frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,
talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We are born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us, it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."

She has many fabulous programs but the one that caught my eye and one we most talked about on the show is how she uses "Your Money Archetypes" and how they are "Ruling Your Finances"!

More about Schelli Whitehouse: she is a Certified Money, Marketing and Soul Coach™ who is dedicated to helping you create financial independence and freedom of expression in your unique business. I not only teach you to implement the most powerful marketing tools and methods available today, but also how to identify and stay connected to your own internal guidance system – that higher version of you that always has your best interest and life’s purpose at heart. http://thenexthighestversionofyou.com/]]></description>

fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are
powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most
frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,
talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We are born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us, it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."

She has many fabulous programs but the one that caught my eye and one we most talked about on the show is how she uses "Your Money Archetypes" and how they are "Ruling Your Finances"!

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Amy Whitmyer-is dedicated Yogini, Photographer, Coach and a Metaphysical Teacher.

Amy is a very creative calm, beautiful human being who is capable to place anyone in the state of relaxation by experiencing yoga and going within.

We talked about what bliss and how to find it and what is in the way for most people to find their bliss. Amy loves the visual arts, photography and yoga. She is also a Reiki master.

She believes the practice of Yoga teaches us another way to listen to
ourselves. It is a method that allows us to turn our attention inward; this awareness can guide us to flow with our true nature.

Our best teacher resides within, and the practice of Yoga offers us tools to access this innate wisdom and connect back to our genuine spirit. She has developed her own unique style and method of teaching. She strongly encourage all of her students to find their own style for themselves.

More about Amy Gabrielle Witmyer: she is a dedicated yogini who was
introduced to yoga at age 15. Her first passion however was in the Visual Arts, which she began exploring at an even earlier age. Amy continued to follow her creative path; and in the early-90’s attended the School of Visual Arts and the International Center of Photography, in NYC with merit scholarships. After living and working as an artist & photographer in NYC for a few years, her interests in Yoga and the Healing Arts prevailed. More about Amy at http://www.sacredspaceyogawellness.com and

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Carrie Green-Organization Coach and a Decluttering Expert

In early 2003, one of her clients asked her to become an organizational
coach because she was looking for one. She had no idea what a coach was, but the more she learned about organizational coaching the more she realized that it held the key to helping her clients get to the bottom of their clutter and discover themselves.

We discussed the distinction between cleaning up and getting organized. How clutter stops us from having more time, energy and money.

Carrie said: "There’s a quote attributed to Michelangelo. Michelangelo.
He said that sculpture is about discovering what already exists within the marble. So if you want to make a statue of David, just chip away everything that isn’t David, and –voila! — you have Michelangelo’s’ David. Decluttering is like sculpture – revealing the beauty and power within yourself that’s waiting to be uncovered."

We talked about what we both did on the morning of 9/11 and several of our listeners have shared their experiences as well.

Also, how to determine where we would be best served to spend our efforts so that we can bring exactly what we want into our lives rather then the confusion that is present for most people.

About Carrie Green: She has a Wall Street background and a degree in
economics. She spent 15 yrs working on Wall Street and ten years working at the New York Stock Exchange, more about Carrie here:

      <description><![CDATA[This interview with Dr. Dean Allen-PhD in Psychology, a wellness and stress management expert and the man with the tools and the rules so that the "Force Can Be with YOU" will blow you away!

Dr Allen said: " There is only one human problem in terms of personal
problems and that can be described in one line: "Drag on spirit life force energy flow"-which comes from "trauma memory", which memory tries to repeat itself on automatic pilot.

Unconscious emotional decisions is what runs us human beings which we have created in our childhood during experiencing trauma on a cellular level. Most human beings are in their "Primary Human Confusion" state making decisions in the present from their past memory. If you can't have concepts that fuse and match with reality you are by definition "Confused" if you can't conceptualize reality you can't live in reality.

Dr Allen said: "You can't not have an elegant solution to the purpose of your life anymore then your clarity for the cause which really comes down to the unconscious decision which primarily comes from trauma memory"

Dr Allen has developed a scientific method using infrared technology that mirrors human physical, emotional and mental processing. He scans his client's face with an infrared probe to get a reading on 23 memory organ gland systems in the body. This scan measures the density of electrons which translates to heat and the heat translates to resistance and the resistance translates to fear, fear translates to trauma memory.

This tool helps him to identify his clients "core issues"-trauma memory
much quicker then talk therapy which sometimes can take a year or more
because clients resistance to re-experience the traumas.

Each 23 glands equal to 23 core issues (matrix-network) or trauma memory which is deeply in our subconscious. The cause is unconscious the effect is conscious-it is easy to see the effect-hard to see the cause.

The "elegant solution" is to become conscious of the cause so that you can cause a solution rather then a problem in your relationships, business, finance...etc. Consciousness is where individuals personal power comes from. We are either conscious or we are in defense mode which equals: "I don't have any power and I can't do anything as soon as you buy this the game is over.

You must have clarity which is a very powerful too, you must be clear about who you are and how you function energetically. The game is between the rules and the tools. The rules are basically the "Laws of Energy" and thew tools are your 23 organ gland energy systems. When you are conscious enough to direct those tools so that they align with the rules "The Force is with YOU"-your ability to able to align with what is real and already there.

Watch me interacting with Dr Allen about one of my "core issues"'

"This system is light years ahead of any other form of therapy, and I highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to release old patterns"

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Marlene Pardo-a Certified Master Hypnotist and Life Coach with experience in Behavior Modification and Interpersonal Relationships.

What is hypnosis and why most people confuse it with stage hypnosis?
Marlene uses hypnosis in her practice to help people with relationships, children and life coaching to address the subconscious mind.

She said: "12% of our mind consists of the conscious and 82% consists of our subconscious mind which is what runs us-so to think that we are in charge with our conscious mind is an illusion"

She also helps a lot of her clients to quit smoking and with weight loss, sometimes it only takes one session, she said.

We discussed her Spirit Release Therapy-what are the signs, what are the negative energies and where do they come from? and what is spirit
releasement?

In the final segment she hypnotized me to experience deep relaxation and did I ever. Her Internet connection momentarily quit and cut her off from the studio in the middle of the session and sense my eyes were glued shut by her, I had no idea what was going on-it is a must to watch and see how I came out of it!

About Marlene Pardo: she is a Hypnosis & Behavior Modification Expert, Life Coach. Her career focus: Expert hypnotist, speaker and workshop
coordinator. Her affiliation: American Hypnosis Association, National
Guild of Hypnotists, AFL-CIO Hypnotherapist Union Local 472.

She is a Certified Master Hypnotist and hold degrees in Behavioral Studies and Criminology. She received her hypnotherapy training from Hypnosis Motivation Institute, (a non-profit nationally accredited hypnosis training college and clinic of hypnotherapy that was founded in 1968 by Dr. John Kappas, who established the Kappasinian form of hypnosis).

She said: "12% of our mind consists of the conscious and 82% consists of our subconscious mind which is what runs us-so to think that we are in charge with our conscious mind is an illusion"

She also helps a lot of her clients to quit smoking and with weight loss, sometimes it only takes one session, she said.

We discussed her Spirit Release Therapy-what are the signs, what are the negative energies and where do they come from? and what is spirit
releasement?

In the final segment she hypnotized me to experience deep relaxation and did I ever. Her Internet connection momentarily quit and cut her off from the studio in the middle of the session and sense my eyes were glued shut by her, I had no idea what was going on-it is a must to watch and see how I came out of it!

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Cathryn McIntyre-Literary Historian, Independent Scholar, Natural Psychic and an Author Cathryn shared how she was destined to adore and admire Henry David Thoreau the transcendentalist writer of Concord, Massachusetts and gave her the purpose to write her book the "Honor in Concord-Seeking Spirit in Literary Concord".

We talked about the understanding of spirit and the two word not talked
about much these days: honor and integrity.  Cathryn said: "The message here is that all that we think, say and do has meaning. Our actions and intentions make up the very essence of who we are and help to form the circumstances of the world in which we live."

Her 20 plus years in astrology helped to satisfy her curiosity about such phenomenons as: clairvoyance, medium-ship, the near death experience, past and parallel lives and alien abductions.

In our final segment she described the unusual events occurred that led to her current work the "Thoreau's Wise Silence", a book that brings Thoreau and his message to life again in the 21st century.

More about Cathryn McIntyre: she is an independent scholar of the life and work of transcendentalist writer, Henry David Thoreau and of the literary history of 19th century Concord, Massachusetts. She is also a gifted writer whose book, Honor in Concord: Seeking Spirit in Literary Concord, combines her passion for Concord's literary history with the story of her own spiritual pursuits. more information at:

Master Practitioner of the Energy Leadership Index and Co-author of
"Bouncing Back:Thriving in Changing Times" with Brian Tracy, David Ricklen, Wayne Dyer and John Assaraf.

Donna Marie lost her mother, her man, her money and her health all at the same time. She describes how life was like before these major life changes and what it was like after experiencing all these losses all at once.

She said: "People live their lives on auto-pilot-she was a big defender and most are not aware that there is a way out, could do it nor change how to react to situations."

Forgiveness of self and others was a the pinnacle of our conversation.

We talked about why and how she got involved co-writing her book and how it would serve people going through grief, emotional healing and recovery.

We also discussed her 5 E's to Recovery Coaching Program, is it realistic to be happy most of the time and when people are stuck what does it take to break through the wall of resistance?

I would like to acknowledge Donna Marie Thompson for her resilience when it comes to technology as a baby-boomer, her intelligence and love to serve others to heal from grief through recovery.

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Bambi Corso-Practitioner of Life, A certified Law of
Attraction Coach and a Dreamtender.

We talked about the great marketing of "The Secret" the movie and what were missing to make it a complete experience. How important future visioning is to be able to access being and having what we want in our lives at a vibrational level of alignment.

Listen to what came to Bambi when I have mentioned the following words:
curiosity, passion, patients and authenticity. She said "our life journey is about becoming more authentic with who we really are".

Dreaming is a huge fascinating mystery. We have explored one of my most
important dreams that I can still remember from the time I was only 9 years old. She helped me to understand how that dream played a very important role in who and what I have become. Bambi has an awesome sense of clarity about her.

About Bambi Corso: she is a practitioner of life, not simply a coach. She believes that each of us possesses the power to change. She did it; she can help you do it too.

She is a Certified Law of Attraction Life Coach and a DreamTender. She
believes in possibilities; in the power of change; and know that every
individual has the ability to chart a different path simply by choosing an authentic life based on deliberate choices.

As a Life Coach, she uses her training to help others open their minds to enhanced perspectives that support these changes, working to overcome limiting beliefs that may keep someone from manifesting the life they desire. She uses her expertise in DreamTending to help support that mindset, more about Bambi Corso go here: http://bambicorso.com/about-me/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Pamela Moss-Artist, Workshop Leader and a recognized
Authority on Unschooling.

There is a statement on her website "She helps people remember who they
really are" between that and her beautiful artwork, I was instantly
connected to the gental soul she is and felt very safe in her company.

The thousands of shows I have done in the last 5 years, this is one of my favorite!

Her passion is painting possibility portraits of individuals, couples or families. She can do this over the phone and from pictures so it doesn't have to be in person. The purpose of these beautiful very detailed paintings are to "remember who you really are".

I can't think of a higher calling then what Pam does and in a similar way it is what we do here at Real Coaching Radio Network. We motivate you to do that "one thing" , the reason you came into existence here on this planet, to master the biggest challenge of your life and then teach it to others!

We also discussed her visioning and vision board workshops. 2 gifts for
YOU from Pamela Moss at: http://www.powerofmyvision.com, Gift #1: Seeing Your Light Handbook, Gift #2. Complimentary Power Session with Pamela

About Pamela Moss: Well, basically I’m just someone who’s discovered
that what lights me up is helping others see what lights them up — I live to see and celebrate the divine light in each of us.

I’ve been fortunate to have my Possibility Portraits featured in the #1
Spirituality bestseller, The Vision Board: The Secret to an Extraordinary Life by Joyce Schwarz, and also on national TV.

I’m also grateful to lead vision board workshops around the country, such as Vision-Powered Planning for Entrepreneurs and Treasure Mapping: Creating an Extraordinary Year — participants call these unique workshops “dynamite,” “wonderful,” and “tremendously beneficial.” for more information on Pamela Moss: http://innervisionportraits.com/about]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Medium Mark Anthony the "Psychic Lawyer" takes questions about spirit
contact on the Mind Body and Soul Show.

Marked shared his background and family history and how he was being born into medium-ship. We talked about a recent radio network in Canada
banning psychics and how the owner of the station doesn't get that declaring a war and a crusade to eliminate psychics from public exposure doesn't work.

I have shared a number of psychic episodes from my own life experience to get an explanation and Marks views on; psychic high frequency
connections with others and remote viewing.

Mark has done a spirit contact with my father on the show and for a number of listeners in the Stickam and BlogTV chat rooms-with phenomenal accuracy.

We have also talked about his upcoming book "Spirit to the Rescue-Healing Grief with Help from the Other Side"

About Mark Anthony: he is a practicing medium, descended from a long line of psychics and mediums. For over 100 years, his ancestors have had significant psychic and mediumistic ability. These courageous people of faith had to cope with extraordinary challenges ranging from the deaths of loved ones to kidnapping, the Great Depression, two world wars, and the “stigma” of having psychic and mediumistic abilities in a time, when those gifts were looked upon as a curse, instead of the blessing. More about Mark Anthony here: http://www.healgriefwithbelief.com/About]]></description>

These courageous people of faith had to cope with extraordinary challenges ranging from the deaths of loved ones to kidnapping, the Great Depression, two world wars, and the “stigma” of having psychic and mediumistic abilities in a time, when those gifts were looked upon as a curse, instead of the blessing.

      <media:text type="plain">Medium Mark Anthony the &quot;Psychic Lawyer&quot; takes questions about spirit&#13;
contact on the Mind Body and Soul Show.&#13;
&#13;
Marked shared his background and family history and how he was being born into medium-ship. We talked about a recent radio network in Canada&#13;
banning psychics and how the owner of the station doesn't get that declaring a war and a crusade to eliminate psychics from public exposure doesn't work.&#13;
&#13;
I have shared a number of psychic episodes from my own life experience to get an explanation and Marks views on; psychic high frequency&#13;
connections with others and remote viewing.&#13;
&#13;
Mark has done a spirit contact with my father on the show and for a number of listeners in the Stickam and BlogTV chat rooms-with phenomenal accuracy.&#13;

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Michael Schuessler, we talked about the "G", and his book, The Holy G-rail.

A little about myself: I'm a sexuality life coach and the author of the Top selling book, “The Holy G-rail”. (G-spot, R-relating, A-anatomy, I-into, L-lovemaking)

I believe all women are The Holy Grail and should be treated as such. The Holy G-rail shows the dualities between the fabled "HOLY GRAIL" and the beautiful women that are within our presence daily.

All the chapters in my book .............
Will revitalize our relations and create a more passionate and intimate
love life. This will transcend every aspect of our daily lives. Listen,
communicate and be patient with your lover. Above all, challenge yourself to do this daily, and the chalice will always be within your grasp.

I has been interviewed by many Local, National and International magazines and radio shows including; The Susan Block radio show out of LA as well as Sirius 198 PLAYBOY Radio's "The Afternoon Advice Show" with -Host- Tiffany Granath and "Night Calls" with -Host- Christy Canyon.

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Dr Karen Sherman-Psychologist, Relationship Coach, Author and Seminar Leader.

Dr Karen and I really clicked fast on this show, she had me at her New York accent. We talked about her background and how she ended up doing so much work in helping people to create healthy relationships.

She answered many questions like "Do opposites really attract and is that a good foundation to start a relationship?" I guessed the 3 common reason couples fight and yes I nailed them; money, sex and some form of control over the relationship.

Dr Karen touched my heart when she stated that couples need to embrace each other including their dark side and not be triggered by them. Building each other up not tearing each other down should be the Status Que.

Listen below to the 15 minute snippet of Dr Karen talking about how
important it is to transform the pain we all feel inside and to free us up so that we can all experience the peace and joy of life.

We also discussed two of her books; "Marriage Magic-Find it-Keep It-and
Make It Last" and "Mindfulness and the Art of Choice-Transform Your Life."

What is her "Art of Choice Program" about: Most of us live in a basic state of mindlessness. When we live mindlessly it means we simply function. We exist rather than live - like we’re on “autopilot” and therefore not really conscious of what we are doing. We are not taking responsibility for our actions, reactions, or behaviors. Despite this gray state of existence, we’re surrounded by choices at every moment, each an opportunity for change, each an opportunity to live mindfully.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Vicki Hannah Lein-Award Winning International Singer,
Songwriter, Author, Motivational Speaker and founder of Coach for Life.

In my pursuit of building Real Coaching Radio Network for over four years now, I have come across a lot of coaches, trainers, authors, small business people and professionals. In my "guest technology training", I have noticed that the most challenged people are from the "baby-boomers" era. The only exception to this are people being involved in technology in some way. I do not know why this is, other then maybe it's about their conviction for freedom and listening is not a big part of that, lol.

Anyway, when I first contacted Vicki and found out that she was legally
blind and a baby-boomer, not involved in technology and had no issues with Skypy, our website and our studio-guess what no more excuses for
baby-boomers. If she can do it anybody can. She said "If You're Afraid of Technology, I think You're Playing the Fool: If a Blind Middle-aged Woman Can do it, You Can do It!"

We talked about relationships, parenting and addiction issues. She said
"Many people talk about thinking outside the box. Talk is cheap. I know how to get people to step out of the box, sing, yes sing, move their bodies, laugh at themselves, and feel more energetic, energized and motivated than they have felt in a long time. They are ready to be brave. They are ready to take action. They are ready to be creative and find new solutions to old, sticky problems."

I would like to acknowledge Vicki for being the "Queen of Self-expression", a rare and prestigious quality in a human being.]]></description>

Songwriter, Author, Motivational Speaker and founder of Coach for Life.

In my pursuit of building Real Coaching Radio Network for over four years now, I have come across a lot of coaches, trainers, authors, small business people and professionals. In my "guest technology training", I have noticed that the most challenged people are from the "baby-boomers" era. The only exception to this are people being involved in technology in some way. I do not know why this is, other then maybe it's about their conviction for freedom and listening is not a big part of that, lol.

Anyway, when I first contacted Vicki and found out that she was legally
blind and a baby-boomer, not involved in technology and had no issues with Skypy, our website and our studio-guess what no more excuses for
baby-boomers. If she can do it anybody can. She said "If You're Afraid of Technology, I think You're Playing the Fool: If a Blind Middle-aged Woman Can do it, You Can do It!"

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Kerrace Alexander-Spiritual Teacher, Facilitator, Author and founder of BigFish Strategies.

Kerrace shared her background with the listeners and brought us up to date as to how she has got to where she is to day. Her father was a spiritual teacher and she disliked and resisted him in her early life. It is interesting to learn that when we negate our parents we are actually blocking our own freedom and growth.

The theme for the show was: Personal Responsibility and Accountability.

Kerrace said: "When we take personal responsibility for creating our
reality we open ourselves to the very mysteries of the universe and we then become channels for spiritual information learning a language more
universal then the human tongues."

If our lives are regimented our creativity is limited then we become
threatened by our ability to create. In all honesty creativity releases our inner power. The qualities of Innovation and flexibility are creative forces we need to unlock with in all of us at this particular time in history in our world.

Creativity is the key to unlocking the qualities of innovation and
flexibility and we must honor these qualities within ourselves and within each other. We must honor the means which makes creativity possible and protect ourselves from those phenomena which threaten to shut down this basic life force as our very future depends on it.

Very quickly I have found common ground with Kerrace sense I have been
practicing "Core Issue" work for many years which we have in common. She uses similar work in her "RippleFX Manifestation System" learn more about it here: http://bigfishstrategies.blogspot.com/]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Donna Amrita Davidge-Owner of Sewall House Yoga Retreat in Island Falls, Main.

We talked about yoga, yoga retreats, meditation, healing and Self-growth. Donna is a very gentle human being. I was challenged from being bliss-ed out several times during our conversation.

A little history about The William Sewall House yoga retreat in Island
Falls, Maine; has been entered into the National Register of Historic
Places. Built by Mr. Sewall in 1865, it was the community's first post
office. Mr. Sewall, Island Falls' first citizen, met young Theodore
Roosevelt there in 1872 and for three successive fall expeditions served as Roosevelt's guide and companion After 1878 Mr. Roosevelt never returned to Island Falls, but he and Mr. Sewall corresponded frequently. In 1886, Mr.Sewall built Theodore Roosevelt's ranch in North Dakota and told him in 1887: "If you go into politics and live, your chance to be President is good."...

Mr. Sewall gained much of his native knowledge from the Indians and was an excellent log man. Donna's great grandfather's chosen location in northern Maine is close to Canada and near Mt. Katahdin, where the sun first hits the East Coast as it rises; you can enjoy the nearby forests, lakes (Mattawamkeag Lake and Pleasant Lake), Baxter State Park and wildlife such as moose and loons. It is here you will be able to experience serenity and solitude, away from the trappings of everyday life.

The Yoga retreat offers a warm Bed & Breakfast atmosphere filled with
antique treasures and books as well as a lovely fireplace for gatherings in the living room. Yoga DVD's and books are available for use during your stay.

Kent and Donna are grateful for all the guests who have chosen Sewall House for their Yoga Vacation. They truly enjoy being with those who return, newcomers, mothers & daughters, honeymooners & couples, friends traveling together, singles, families, married folk looking for some solo time, and retirees.

Sewall House has been evolving in times when yoga has been booming all over the world. They believe in evolving with the guests and their needs. Their approach is simple: "Everyone has the right to be Healthy, Happy & Whole".

They also share tools that their guests can bring home, healthy eating,
thinking and being. Donna Amrita Davidge and Kent Bonham continue to fully commit themselves to the historic legacy of the house, it's American Heritage, and their own evolvement within the yoga community and the world.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Phil Fragasso-Investment Adviser, Author and president of iPension Llc about safe investing.

For most of us it is challenging to listen to and trust financial experts these days. When I was in finance the number one reason underwriters would reject loans was financial mismanagement. Our financial industry has gone through that at the highest levels in the last few years so you may say; "what a double standard". I asked Phil about it on the the show why this has happened?-his response was greed!

Phil has a dedication and obligation to educate people about their
financial choices and to show them why the traditional approach to
investing is flawed.

He has your needs at heart not some sales person at a financial institution putting you into a financial product because that will yield him the highest commission for himself at the end of the day.

Phil also teaches several investing topics at the Boston Center for Adult Education and "Leadership and Ethics" at the Boston College. I smiled with joy when we talked about his commitment and the obligation he feels to educate. There is nothing more important right now for all of us to do then to personally make a difference by educating ourselves. Get our economy moving again and make good on our financial mistakes by putting it backinto balance which includes myself.

We talked about his books and motivation for writing them; "Your Nest Egg Game Plan"-How to Get Your Finances Back on Track and Create a Lifetime Income Stream and "Marketing for Rain Makers"-52 Rules of Engagement to Attract and Retain Customers for Life.

What is the single biggest message I got out of speaking with Phil?-you got to have a financial plan even if you have recently lost everything in our financial meltdown regardless of your age.

Our financial industry has gone through that at the highest levels in the last few years so you may say; &quot;what a double standard&quot;. I asked Phil about it on the the show why this has happened?-his response was greed!&#13;
&#13;
Phil has a dedication and obligation to educate people about their&#13;
financial choices and to show them why the traditional approach to&#13;
investing is flawed.&#13;
&#13;
He has your needs at heart not some sales person at a financial institution putting you into a financial product because that will yield him the highest commission for himself at the end of the day.&#13;
&#13;
Phil also teaches several investing topics at the Boston Center for Adult Education and &quot;Leadership and Ethics&quot; at the Boston College. I smiled with joy when we talked about his commitment and the obligation he feels to educate. There is nothing more important right now for all of us to do then to personally make a difference by educating ourselves. Get our economy moving again and make good on our financial mistakes by putting it backinto balance which includes myself.&#13;
&#13;
We talked about his books and motivation for writing them; &quot;Your Nest Egg Game Plan&quot;-How to Get Your Finances Back on Track and Create a Lifetime Income Stream and &quot;Marketing for Rain Makers&quot;-52 Rules of Engagement to Attract and Retain Customers for Life.&#13;
&#13;
What is the single biggest message I got out of speaking with Phil?-you got to have a financial plan even if you have recently lost everything in our financial meltdown regardless of your age.&#13;

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Liz Pagayonan-Intentional Scrapbooking Expert. She
describes what scrapbooking is and how it can be used to create and attract what you really desire in life. How it creates loving chemical reaction in the brain and it can be a great tool for personal transformation.

I introduced a recent coaching client example for Liz to use as a model to demonstrate the power of her transformational tool-scrapbooking or vision board for "man only". " From coaching client: "Your question and comment, the last time we spoke, really caught my attention: "you need to find out who you are." Coach Steve, no one has ever asked me that....what a tough question! At the present time, my self-worth, and who I am, is based on how much money I make, what I accomplish, my title, the importance of my job, and what other
people think of me."

Liz explains the human suffering and pain. Where does it come from and how we distract ourselves not to feel it. We are thought to look for answers outside of ourselves, we look to Google, experts, books, tapes, seminars. We do not go within ourselves to get our own inner
guidance. 

We also talked about how our "core issue" is born and how it is
possible to be in the present moment and feel the flow and joy of life.

Knock..knock..who is there?-my grand-kids interrupt the show and I don't loose it like I would have ten years ago, I incorporate them into the show to have everyone be reminded how free kids are and we need to learn more from them vs. us teaching them how life is supposed to be from our limited perspective.

http://www.creatingintentions.com

About Liz Pagayonan: she lives and works according to her passion-
scrapbooking and awakening to conscious awareness. Every day she spends
time scrapbooking to create and attract all the things she desire in life. She effortlessly experience unconditional love and appreciation from her three precious daughters. Her goal is to inspire the world even if it is one person at a time!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Amanda Harvey-she is a native of Australia, is currently
based in Taiwan. Working as a teacher, trainer, speaker, and writer, sheas spent the last decade living in various countries throughout Europe and Asia.

Through her work and life experiences, Amanda has developed a strong passion for encouraging others to embrace their differences and become
empowered to choose their own paths.

Finding love in an unexpected way, and overcoming the stigma of depression while learning to live a happy, healthy life, provided Amanda with enormous opportunity for personal growth. Making alternative life choices, including living abroad and becoming a mother-of-three through interracial adoption, has shaped Amanda’s sense
of purpose in life.

In all her work, the key message that Amanda endeavors to share is that
there is always a choice, and that the only right way to choose life is
your way.

Amanda is the author of two books. One is a self-help book entitled Freedom from Shame; Overcoming the Stigma of Depression. This book is a personal account of Amanda’s experiences of coming to terms with suffering from depression. She shares the process she developed and used to overcome the stigma and shame she experienced, and how she is now enjoying a happy healthy life, even with depression.

Amanda's other title is Not My Flesh and Blood, But My Heart and Soul. This book is a memoir telling of Amanda’s journey to motherhood through
trans-racial adoption. Amanda shares her deep realization that family love can transcend all conventions and stereotypes, and that there are many ways to create a family. She declares that biology is only one way of being related.

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Rae-Ann Wood Schatz-President of Personal Best Seminars 
Alberta, she has a background in psychology.  

She has a passion for making a difference and supporting people in transforming their lives. She said-"To create lasting change, changing behavior, just doing it differently and creating positive reinforcement is not enough."  Finding out and understanding why we do what we do and what is in our subconscious is a critical part of personal development and creating long term change.

We talked about what does it take to dream and manifest the things we want. She has shared the years of joy and abundance that she has experienced sense doing her personal growth work.

We also talked about the different programs available at Personal Best 
Seminars such as the Ultimate Evolution Program and Personal Freedom Program.

In our last segment we touched on passion, self-expression and 
accountability. http://www.personalbestseminars.com

About Rae-Ann Wood Schatz: My background is in Psychology and at the time I became a participant in Personal Best I was already feeling some sense of disillusionment with my progress and perceived success with my clients. I had received most of my academic and practical training in the 80's, a time when the focus on the human potential was about getting people to just change their behavior with the understanding - just do it differently, create positive reinforcement and your change process is almost certain. 

Well, ever been on a diet? Something was off with that theory!  Working in the battered woman's movement I had come to realize we weren't making much progress and it was through my experience as a client at Personal Best I realized there were many nuggets of information held within the course and I felt compelled to do my part to communicate those to the planet. As I progressed through the process, the opportunity to take over the Edmonton office was available and despite the fact I was hoping for a Hawaii franchise, I practiced what the course had taught me about risk taking, manifestation, intention and dream creation.

I have learned what it means to dream and to manifest and have been 
enjoying years of joy and abundance doing what I do with Personal Best 
Seminars Alberta.]]></description>

I had received most of my academic and practical training in the 80's, a time when the focus on the human potential was about getting people to just change their behavior with the understanding - just do it differently, create positive reinforcement and your change process is almost certain. &#13;
&#13;
Well, ever been on a diet? Something was off with that theory!  Working in the battered woman's movement I had come to realize we weren't making much progress and it was through my experience as a client at Personal Best I realized there were many nuggets of information held within the course and I felt compelled to do my part to communicate those to the planet. As I progressed through the process, the opportunity to take over the Edmonton office was available and despite the fact I was hoping for a Hawaii franchise, I practiced what the course had taught me about risk taking, manifestation, intention and dream creation.&#13;
&#13;
I have learned what it means to dream and to manifest and have been &#13;
enjoying years of joy and abundance doing what I do with Personal Best &#13;

      <description><![CDATA[An interview with Maya McLaghlin-Meditation Teacher-Author and Radio Show Host from Scotland.

We have explored her travels and deep learning curves on the show including her passions; meditation and writing.

About Maya: she was born in Ayrshire and, being of typical Gemini nature,feel privileged thus far to be living a full, if unusual, life made up of much travel and steep learning curves.

Other than that I’d say I’m fairly normal…

I live with my husband, the lovely Twig (who is more spiritual than he
knows) and I have a beautiful daughter, Louise (my pride and joy).

In addition to literature, I am passionate about red squirrels (those cute little guys have to be saved!) and watercolour art – I go on the premise that if I paint enough, one day I might actually get good at it.

I am also part of a Spiritual Development Group and I am an Adult Literacy Volunteer. http://mayamclaughlin.com]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Mark Anthony-Psychic Lawyer and Medium. Mark has conducted
three different readings for callers from the other side.

About Mark Anthony: Mark Anthony is a practicing medium, descended from a
long line of psychics and mediums. For over 100 years, his ancestors have
had significant psychic and mediumistic ability. 

These courageous people of faith had to cope with extraordinary challenges ranging from the deaths of loved ones to kidnapping, the Great Depression, two world wars, and the “stigma” of having psychic and mediumistic abilities in a time, when those gifts were looked upon as a curse, instead of the blessing. http://healgriefwithbelief.com/Home]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When President Obama wanted to meet with enemies, people thought that was odd, but you have to show love to the people you dislike the most to create more peace and harmony in life. To show hatred toward an enemy only compounds the hate, said Jo-Anne Cutler on the “Mind, Body and Soul,” show. Of course most of us aren’t in the position to effect as many people as the president, so the best way we can make a difference in the world is through our children. 

Jo-Anne Cutler, founder of http://theparentingshift.com is a personal
trainer for emotional fitness. She is a speaker and author, too, who helps people connect spiritually, physically and emotionally with their children. She said that children are rich in spirituality, but by the time they become adults they can lose that spiritual connection with themselves, others, including their own children. Being able to connect on that level makes the whole world more loving and easier.

One day Jo-Anne had sent her son to his room and he had slammed his door. She found herself at the bottom of the stairs yelling at the top of her lungs. Something happened as she came to see what she was really doing, making her son feel bad about himself and teaching him how to throw temper tantrums to get attention and what he wanted.

Children know that when they can make us angry they can get their way, she said. It’s time to get rid of the anger and quit projecting it onto our children. To help people accomplish that, Jo-Anne teaches releasing techniques for emotions. Also, Jo-Anne helps people remember how it felt when they were young and how the way others, especially adults, made them feel by yelling and saying negative things.

Awareness is the key to breaking the cycle and to create change on any
level. Then we have to take responsibility to make the change happen. When we are activated by anger we most often take it out on the people closest to us. It’s time to give the right voice to the children by realizing the impact of what we say to kids can be damaging. Don’t say they aren’t good enough or that you are disappointed in them. Comparing them to others cuts them down or builds them up in a competitive way. Children are good enough as they are, each unique. Start at home showing the love and kindness. By the time it reaches President Obama, there won’t be any issues in the world that can’t be handled in a love-based way better than in a fear-based way of society.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[One love that is guaranteed to heal anybody at anytime is unconditional
love, unconditional self-love, according to Nanice Ellis on the “Mind,
Body and Soul” show. Nanice is a Awakening Facilitator, Master Results
Coach, Speaker and Author who helps many people find the balance in their lives. As a coach, when issues surface and things get uncomfortable many people want to run. Nanice feels comfortable in that space where many feel like leaving. She has found that place of comfort through unconditionallove.

Some of us may have difficulties when attempting to find that unconditional self-love. To begin to create it, we can find the polarities that create it, starting with judgment and acceptance. First we must release judgment and quit believing everything we think, all those perceptions are stories we create. We need to accept ourselves the way we are. Start by thinking of someone or something you love that brings you joy. It could be your child or a puppy. Then apply that same love to yourself. Meditate about it and surround yourself with love and positivity. Practice will help create it.

When people want to run they are in a place of fear. Some people operate under the premise that we must completely remove fear to get to the love, but the truth is, that if one of them disappears, then the other wouldn’t be there. Without fear there would be no love. Without light there would be no dark. Without sleep there would be no awake.

Polarities exist. For creation to occur you have to have duality. Just as men and women are opposites, it takes the two to create. Problems occur when polarities don’t know how to dance with each other because something is always created in that dance. One polarity activates the other and manifests what we want. It also guides us to choice, and we have to be awake to make choices.

When facing challenges we have created our stories. We have to remember
that we create our stories and remember that all challenges support us to become the person we were meant to be. Practice that one love, that
unconditional love, and remember that there can be no love without fear or light without dark to create. What are you creating?

      <description><![CDATA[If writing horror movies is your passion, then find a way to express that passion. Life-Coach Chaney Weiner visited the “Mind, Body and Soul” show and inspired everyone listening and watching. He said that everyone has a passion inside them and should be able to live in it. Some people need help finding theirs, and those are the people who might not know who they are.

Children are naturally in tune with their passions, but it can get yanked out of them because very few people encourage them to talk about what’s important to them or allow them to practice their fancy. Also, schools do not commonly nurture the individual dreams of the students. Chaney is working to create a program that goes into the school system to allow children to express their passions.

When you know who you are and you know your passion, you value yourself. When you value yourself, so do others. When you invest in yourself, others do too. Everyone of us sees ourselves in a certain way. People who have trouble expressing themselves do not know who they are. Listen to the words people use. Do they say, “I’ve got to... I have to…” or do they show excitement about what they are doing? You can hear the language of those who know who they are and know their value.

So what about motivation and inspiration? What about self-esteem and
self-worth? Motivation and self-esteem are derived externally.
Inspiration and self-worth are created on the inside. If we are motivated by others, if our self-esteem depends on encouragement and praise, then when the others who provide that stop providing it, we can lose direction and drive. But if we find inspiration and know our true worth, we can create it for ourselves, and the supply is endless.

Some people get negative on the inside and believe they are depressed, but depression doesn’t really exist. It is self-generated. When they
create their depression they are drawn to experiences that reveal their
negative mindsets. Depression comes from people trying to be something
they aren’t.

If you wonder what your passion is, answer some questions. What do you
enjoy doing? What is it that you have to offer? What do you want to make happen in your life? Who are the people closest to you and what are they doing? Everyone has magnificence, but not everyone knows it. Do you feel like writing horror movies? If that’s what’s inside, then share your gift with the world. Achieve your dreams. Express your passion!

Children are naturally in tune with their passions, but it can get yanked out of them because very few people encourage them to talk about what’s important to them or allow them to practice their fancy. Also, schools do not commonly nurture the individual dreams of the students. Chaney is working to create a program that goes into the school system to allow children to express their passions.

When you know who you are and you know your passion, you value yourself. When you value yourself, so do others. When you invest in yourself, others do too. Everyone of us sees ourselves in a certain way. People who have trouble expressing themselves do not know who they are. Listen to the words people use. Do they say, “I’ve got to... I have to…” or do they show excitement about what they are doing? You can hear the language of those who know who they are and know their value.

So what about motivation and inspiration? What about self-esteem and
self-worth? Motivation and self-esteem are derived externally.
Inspiration and self-worth are created on the inside. If we are motivated by others, if our self-esteem depends on encouragement and praise, then when the others who provide that stop providing it, we can lose direction and drive. But if we find inspiration and know our true worth, we can create it for ourselves, and the supply is endless.

Some people get negative on the inside and believe they are depressed, but depression doesn’t really exist. It is self-generated. When they
create their depression they are drawn to experiences that reveal their
negative mindsets. Depression comes from people trying to be something
they aren’t.

If you wonder what your passion is, answer some questions. What do you
enjoy doing? What is it that you have to offer? What do you want to make happen in your life? Who are the people closest to you and what are they doing? Everyone has magnificence, but not everyone knows it. Do you feel like writing horror movies? If that’s what’s inside, then share your gift with the world. Achieve your dreams. Express your passion!

      <description><![CDATA[An interview with Claire Murray-Founder of "Life Coach My Life" and Murray HR Consultancy, Scotland UK. Never let your fear keep you away from your dreams. Energy and passion make your dreams come true. Claire Murray, from Scotland, is making her dreams come true by making a home video diary to share with others who want to express their authentic selves. Most people would be afraid to make a daily video diary and then post it on the internet, every day, and just be
themselves, but not Claire.

Claire started her diary because she had a dream to be in the media. She was approached to be part of a television documentary production, but funding for the show prevented it from moving forward. The producers gave her a video camera as a token of her efforts, so she decided to make a video diary.

Clair wants to motivate others to put their fears aside and live their
dreams. She is learning a lot about her own life in the process. She said that by committing to a daily entry she covers the high points and low points of her life, whatever is going on in any moment. Her positive attitude and her desire to laugh and enjoy life is clear.

She has shown many aspects of her life in more than 300 journal entries. One video showed her bringing in the new year with a party in the background as her boyfriend brought her a glass of Champaign. She does videos all dressed up in high fashion or in her sweats. She has bits from her bedroom as well as tours of the streets of Scotland.

If you would like to see more of Claire’s videos or find out more about
her, go to http://pathwaytoopportunity.com. Claire enjoys her life, and
she shares it with many people in the hopes that she can share some of that pleasure and help people follow their dreams to energize their lives in a new and powerful way. Have you thought of making a home video to post on the web?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[David Wolf is a personal transformation facilitator, a life skills and
relationships coach and writer who says that personal transformation
requires being accountable. How can we be accountable? David said that we need to begin with self-awareness. Ask ourselves questions such as,
“what are my patterns, habits and assumptions? “ When we are aware of
them we can make different choices. Another question we might ask is,
“am I doing what I’m doing today because it’s good for me or is it
because it’s my pattern or habit?”

Look for ways to connect with your spiritual energy. Mediocrity isn’t
good enough. People need to be committed to thriving. Life has so much to offer, and when we look for ways to thrive instead of just getting by, it increases itself dramatically. If you have a string of zeros, no matter how many there are, they equal zero, nothing. But when you put a one in front of them, their value expands. The one is the spiritual connection. It transforms and creates purpose. That’s what our spirit does.

David has studied relationships and offers workshops and training for
people who are looking for transformation. When he speaks of relationships he recognizes all kinds of them with ourselves, money, animals and plants, the planet, and others. Relationships that work is the power of conscious living. For successful relationships we need to have a high level of awareness of our selves and what or whoever else is involved.

A win-win situation includes a win for me and a win for the other person in the relationship. That takes dialog and listening to 100% of what the other person says, means and feels to the point that we feel touched, moved and inspired. Our relationships are a reflection of our own selves and knowing that every relationship is an opportunity to learn something and grow.

When things get tough in relationships, most of us chose to run instead of staying and we lose our chance to grow and learn. Be grateful for the difficult moments because they are the chance to expand our consciousness and fulfillment and find where true joy is guaranteed. Going back to our accountability, we are the source of our experiences, especially the challenging issues in relationships. “How did I create this situation? What is my responsibility?” We are responsible for what we do and who we are and every situation we are in.

Follow your passion. Pay attention. Accept responsibility. Listen. Be
patient, too. Sometimes emotional distance is needed to understand what
someone else is saying or to take the time to let down defenses and see our own reflections.

      <description><![CDATA[What wedding gift do you give the quintessential couple who have
everything? … Why, his and her matching elephants, of course. Jerry
and Donna Goven know how to have fun, and when their friends who “have
everything” got married, they had to think of a unique and outrageous
gift. Even though the elephants were only rentals, the memory and fun will last forever.

Donna and Jerry met during a meeting of the Inner Peace Movement in 1997.From the beginning they began working together. They taught classes about guardian angels back then, and since they have grown, but still spend time helping others find balance while learning how to have fun, such as making lemonade from lemons. Jerry and Donna offer workshops that help people remove roadblocks, and they have written a book, “Take the E out of Ego and Go.”

They live by two mottos: “If you’re not having fun, then change what
you’re doing,” and “Business is having fun while making money.”
Donna and Jerry’s workshops offer tools that show people how to remove
roadblocks that hinder success whether they be on an emotional or physical level by helping them find balance between health and emotions.

The roadblock that hinders people is always the same, but can show in
different ways. It is fear. Fear is a saboteur. Jerry tells a poem
about how we sabotage ourselves by repeating behaviors that aren‘t
working:

I walked down the road and fell in a hole.
I walked down the road and fell in a hole.
I walked down the road and fell in a hole
I walked down the road and went around the hole.

We keep doing the same thing to sabotage ourselves and then we use the
tools that Jerry and Donna teach to make lemonade from our lemons. We are taught and we can learn to step around the hole, which means resolving the problem, and its important to learn how to have fun while we do it.

Most people have to learn how to get past their ego. Responding to the
world from the ego makes life difficult and communication even harder.
Jerry and Donna teach how to give and receive respect through effective
communication. For example, instead of saying, “you did this wrong,”
speak calmly, quietly and say, “I prefer it if you do it this way.”
Ego makes people feel like they have to be perfect, but that’s not
possible. So, just like the title of their book, “Take the E out of Ego
and Go,” learn how to have fun while making lemonade from the lemons.
Or give someone an elephant. Everybody laugh!]]></description>

They taught classes about guardian angels back then, and since they have grown, but still spend time helping others find balance while learning how to have fun, such as making lemonade from lemons. Jerry and Donna offer workshops that help people remove roadblocks, and they have written a book, “Take the E out of Ego and Go.”

They live by two mottos: “If you’re not having fun, then change what
you’re doing,” and “Business is having fun while making money.”
Donna and Jerry’s workshops offer tools that show people how to remove
roadblocks that hinder success whether they be on an emotional or physical level by helping them find balance between health and emotions.

The roadblock that hinders people is always the same, but can show in
different ways. It is fear. Fear is a saboteur. Jerry tells a poem
about how we sabotage ourselves by repeating behaviors that aren‘t
working:

I walked down the road and fell in a hole.
I walked down the road and fell in a hole.
I walked down the road and fell in a hole
I walked down the road and went around the hole.

We keep doing the same thing to sabotage ourselves and then we use the
tools that Jerry and Donna teach to make lemonade from our lemons. We are taught and we can learn to step around the hole, which means resolving the problem, and its important to learn how to have fun while we do it.

Most people have to learn how to get past their ego. Responding to the
world from the ego makes life difficult and communication even harder.
Jerry and Donna teach how to give and receive respect through effective
communication. For example, instead of saying, “you did this wrong,”
speak calmly, quietly and say, “I prefer it if you do it this way.”
Ego makes people feel like they have to be perfect, but that’s not
possible. So, just like the title of their book, “Take the E out of Ego
and Go,” learn how to have fun while making lemonade from the lemons.
Or give someone an elephant. Everybody laugh!]]></itunes:summary>

      <media:text type="plain">What wedding gift do you give the quintessential couple who have&#13;
everything? … Why, his and her matching elephants, of course. Jerry&#13;
and Donna Goven know how to have fun, and when their friends who “have&#13;
everything” got married, they had to think of a unique and outrageous&#13;
gift. Even though the elephants were only rentals, the memory and fun will last forever.&#13;

      <description><![CDATA[Michelle Vasquez was a therapist focusing on families and relationships in Texas then moved to California and became interested in singles matchmaking for people over age 40. She became a coach and now helps people find meaningful and lasting relationships. She refers to herself as a shy woman, but has been able to land two husbands. After becoming a young widow, Michelle waited several years before seeking romantic connections again. She invested in online dating to find her second husband. By following her own counsel Michelle has created meaningful relationships that make her happy.

Michelle did not meet her first husband at an online dating site. She used the method she offers her clients. She had met him and felt an attraction, but her shyness prevented her from taking a direct approach so she made herself available to him by visiting the places she knew he would be. She said her mother had advised her to follow the cliché, “Chase a man until he catches you.” She said she kept showing up. She was charming and creative, but never offered her phone number. She dressed pleasantly and put herself out there in a nice way. He finally noticed her and approached her, and their relationship started.

Some of the things that help people when seeking relationships, besides
just attractions, include looking for someone with some of the same
interests you have and some different interests as well. She said that
creates a balance and time for the pair to be together and separate, but you must have something in common. Without it, relationships die quickly. Also, Michelle said that people tend to have attractions with people who are on a similar mental level.

She spoke about online dating, too and said that you have to be careful, but by practicing caution and being yourself, it can be safe. Her current marriage was discovered at an online dating site. At her website she offers free reports with advice and helpful tips. Go to
http://www.trueloveafter40.com to get them.

When counseling for her singles matchmaking practice, Michelle tells people to be themselves, but to present themselves at their best. Charm is a key factor when finding attractions and making connections in singles matchmaking. She defined a charming person as one who has the power to delight and attract, and that can happen on different levels with different people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Two encouraging, energetic, enthusiastic folks joined forces on the
“Mind, Body and Soul Show.” Host Coach Steve Toth and his guest Sara
Louann Jones chatted about building self-esteem, confidence and freedom,living a joyful life with a purpose. Sara, visiting the internet radio show from the United Kingdom, shared tools and techniques she has uses to amp her life to a higher level… power tools. These tools are Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), the process of setting and reaching goals, coupled with hypnotherapy which is designed to reveal subconscious stumbling blocks.

NLP says that if one person can do something then someone else can do it too. “You just have to figure out how to model behaviors,” Sara said,“and then anyone can achieve anything they want. I write a list and put it on my wall every day, what I want to do, where I want to go, what I want to accomplish. There is real power in being specific, and that is what the list is designed to do. Coach Steve asked Sara to explain the anchor technique as prescribed in NLP.

The anchor technique is a “power tool” and is used to help people
recall a special time in their lives to remind them when they felt most
powerful and self-confident, Sara said. “When you are feeling unhappy or lacking in confidence, remember a time when you were feeling your very best -- a moment that you felt strong and powerful and able to handle anything.Then place your arm back while holding your thumb and middle finger together. Remember that moment in detail. Where were you? What was around you? What did you see and hear? Bring those good and powerful feelings up while holding your thumb and finger together. Then every time you are in a difficult situation you can use that power tool to get those great feelings back when touching your thumb to your middle finger together. It is your anchor. The more you do it, the stronger and stronger it gets.”

Coach Steve said that at the age of 19 he escaped from communist Hungary, and he uses the anchor method when he loses his feeling of being free. He said that when he got to Italy after escaping, he felt incredibly, unbelievably free and happy. He is always able to use that moment, when he kissed the Italian earth, to help him feel his power, joy and freedom.

Hynotherapy is effective, too, because people carry things in their
subconscious, things that have been learned from others along life’s
path. Maybe a teacher said something that caused you to lose confidence, such as, “you do not understand math, you are not good at it. I give up on you.” You take that in and it becomes a belief. You may or may not remember the incident, but your subconscious has latched onto it and it is reflected in how you respond to issues. You come to believe it is you, but really it is something that was said to you, a judgment. Hypnotherapy allows one to go back in time and recall the incident. When it is uncovered the belief is freed and transformation can take place. This creates personal power, freedom and self-confidence, so that a life of joy and confidence is possible.

Sara and Coach Steve both have breakthrough seminars coming soon. Go to
http://www.myrxforliving.com and get the details. Each are experts and offer vital help in their own ways. Coach Steve helps people learn how to have a super show on the radio, how to market that show and to create money and fame. His seminar is called, “Be a Radio Superstar.”

Sara helps people life their best life by offering “power tools” for
dealing with weight issues, both in actions and the cause of the actions, subconscious thinking. Sara loves to see people build their
self-confidence and get to living their best life. Her seminar is called, “Lose Weight -- Feel Great.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Take responsibility and then be fully accountable.  Those are the first of many “words to live by” offered by Zara Green, life coach and author.  On the “Mind, Body and Soul Show” with Coach Steve Toth, Zara said she believes that people should optimize their individuality and “make the most of what they know about themselves.”  Often people live by standards set by others.  “Set your own standard,” she said, “so you can see your own progress.  The ideal way of living is to live your own best (life).” 

Zara, speaking her own kind of word songs, said that no one can do everything well.  “There are some things we do well and some things we cannot do.  I am not strong in science and mathematics,” she said.  “By knowing and accepting this it helps me be clear about who I am.  That’s true authentic living.” Being clear about strengths and weaknesses helps people understand the bigger spectrum and helps equip people to respond and not react when difficulties arise. “Grown people define themselves in times of trouble,” she said. 

Powerful words to live by, according to Zara includes “resilience.”  “It ought to be a household word,” she said.  “it’s that bounce-back ability that’s important…how long does it take you to bounce back” she asked.  After surviving Hurricane Katrina where Zara lost her material possessions and couldn’t find her relatives for several days she said the biggest trauma she faced was losing her life’s work that had been stored on her computer, etc.  “I’ve got to keep on going.  As long as my life is going, I’ve got to enjoy it, and that’s what my work is to me,” she said.   It took her a short time to regroup and she asked, “Come on Life, is that all you got?  When you set your mind to whatever you want, it doesn’t matter what life throws at you.” 

“Make your next decision better than your last,” she said, adding to her word songs.  By taking responsibility and living in truth we get a “LEG Up,” (Learn, Embrace and Grow Up), which is the name of Zara’s blog.   Each person has their good, bad and ugly.  Life has its good, bad and ugly.  “The moment we start resisting we stop the flow of anything good.  You can’t change it, so embrace it.  It’s about how you’re going to treat it when it shows up,” she said.  “I even get on my own nerves.  But you know what?  I know I’m going to do certain things.  I’m ok with that.”
Just love your life the way it is… the good, the bad and the ugly.

Originally from the US, I moved to England in 1999. I am now a British
citizen and I absolutely love it here. I am a very happy 50-plus-year-old with a gorgeous grown-up daughter and a beautiful grandson. My training and belief in coaching:

When I first discovered coaching, people in my life told me that I had
unknowingly been “coaching” for years in both my professional and
personal life. They were probably right because, once I started to learn the actual practice of coaching, I took to it like a duck to water I knew in my heart that it was my natural vocation. I then made the huge decision to leave a successful long-term career as a teacher to start a full-time coaching practice. I did this solely because I love coaching, and because I believe in its power to set people free to express their true selves in a way that nothing else I have seen can.

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Victor Gold who is a holistic health educator specializing in erotic spirituality. He has a private practice offering tantric instruction and sexual healing with his female partner Aimee Lyndon-Adams, in San Rafael, California. 

Victor has studied with Charles and Caroline Muir and Sunyata Saraswati. He has co-facilitated workshops with Maryse Cote, Deborah Anapol, and Johanina Wikoff. Victor has been featured in several instructional videos including Deborah Sundhal's "Tantric Journey to Female Orgasm," and Joseph Kramer's "The Best of Vulva Massage." Victor will teach you how sexual energy can be transformed into spiritual power that brings tremendous creativity, productivity, vigor, and greater purpose to your life. And, most importantly, he does it with warmth, humor, and integrity.

We reviewed the following subjects on the show;

Why did the American bedroom has become a “national disaster area"?

1. What is Tantric sex
2. How to achieve Unity Consciousness (Oneness)
3. What are Victor's Level 1-3 coaching programs
4. How do man can have Multiple Orgasms?
5. Why substitute orgasm(s) for ejaculation?
6. Victor's new book "The Potency Principles"

      <description><![CDATA[Interview with Suzann Rye-bestselling author, speaker, and an
internationally renowned expert on voice and performance training. Her work is rooted in her extensive stage experience—over twenty years as a
performer and vocalist. As a coach, Suzann has helped thousands of people find their voices and transform their lives.

Suzann Rye helps people find and nurture their own voices. She typically works with coaches, teachers, speakers, entrepreneurs, business owners,authors and artists to help them become even more inspiring, authentic and dynamic communicators. She also helps them empower their physical voices in order to avoid voice fatigue and wear.

A large proportion of the people that Suzann works with are female
entrepreneurs and professionals who need empowerment and encouragement in dealing with the ever growing pressure that naturally comes with being in the spotlight performing at your best, while tackling multiple other tasks.

Her new book, Your Voice is Your Calling Card; How to Power-Charge Your
Voice, Boost your Confidence and Speak With Joy, Ease and Conviction is the culmination of my many years of teaching and coaching and performing all over the world. She is current based in Germany but works predominantly in the US.

Your Voice is Your Calling Card offers a virtual coaching course for people needing to tackle the art of authentic, joyful, powerful and inspiring expression, speaking and presentation. Many people suffer terribly from nerves and stage fright. This course can help them conquer these unpleasant feelings for good.

On top, Your Voice is Your Calling Card offers a very substantial insight into the voice, how to uncover its potential and get the absolute best out of it. It is packed with information, tips, exercises and tools – and comes with amazing bonuses.

Suzann’s approach is clearly holistic in nature, working with the whole
person, bringing out the true, unique and powerful voice that resides
within all of us. It is in this voice, she says, that we find the gift of self-expression and fulfillment in the highest sense and in this voice that we are able to offer true value, service and contribution to the lives of others.

Your Voice is Your Calling Card is published by Morgan James, The
Entrepreneurial Publisher. It is a fantastic resource for anyone looking for a holistic approach to becoming a much more confident, authentic, inspiring, compelling and charismatic speaker and presenter. It contains a wealth of knowledge and countless easy to apply tools and is both extremely practical and deeply spiritual.
Simply Mind, Body, Soul—and Voice.

globe.
