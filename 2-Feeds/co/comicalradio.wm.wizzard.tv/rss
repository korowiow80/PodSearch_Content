Mostly how to harass others. Ku and Danny call up a man who insulted/ hit on her then Danny proceeds to yell at him. To get the show back to some semblance of sanity comedian Lance Weiss dropped by tell us about his dream life . He one day hopes to have a day filled with surfing, having a TV show, doing comedy and when he's old and tired of making people happy become a politician. He doesn't own a club with racial slurs on a rock as a welcome sign, but he is working on it. Musician/ comedian Jessica Delfino stops by the show to make everyone feel boring by comparison. A woman who has been a go-go dancer, was stolen by her father as a little girl only to be returned after a frying pan to his head, met her soon to be husband off of craigslist, and maybe most shockingly has not written a book yet. All this and Chris Iacono drops by for a comical cameo fresh off his having his tonsils ripped out. Why? To drop the n bomb silly. I hope Larry King isn't reading this.</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, well, well folks. This is the last episode of TMI. No more Dan Naturman. Instead, it's just Justy and Danny and maybe a new co-host. Who knows.<br /><br />First off, we discuss two awesome topics: Abortion and murder! We go into Justy's family history, as well as her recent history. Spoiler: She has some huge, life-changing news, listeners! <br /> <br />Doug Kleinman is our first guest. He's a former comedian who started out with Lewis Black and Ray Ramono and people who obviously are much worse off than he is. Now, he does real-estate and comedy for kids.<br /><br /> Next up is Richard Kind of "Spin City" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm." We find out this voice actor hates his own voice. He talks about his own aspirations and what he's accomplished in his long career. The hosts and Kind touch upon Ray Ellin, who touches upon everyone. He, he, he. The word cunt is said a lot in this interview. Danny and Kind get into it, as do Justy and Kind. It's kind of hilarious. No, it's fully hilarious. This almost two hour long interview is a fascinating look into showbiz. <br /> <br />And that's a wrap!</p>]]></description>

			<title>EP-832-Larry King in the Studio!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/EP-832-Hey_Larry_King.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to another debatably Musical Monday, our intrepid hosts Danny and Esther are joined in the studio by comedian Peyton Clarkson, Larry King, and the world renown Benjy Susswein, comedian booker extroadinaire. We discuss the highs and lows of the club booking lifestyle and why Yeshiva University is such a hotbed for rising talent in the field. Danny offers Benjy a new stage name that he thinks will appeal to both the black and Jewish comedy communities, so keep a lookout for Abaramowitz Washington, a soon to be legend in his own time. Inexplicably, we have Larry King in the studio to discuss life, love, and the importance of the pre-nup. Larry attempts to compliment Danny, which he swiftly undercuts, corrects the legend, and then recieves wise words of advice from America's greatest interviewer. Larry talks about his several broadcasting horror stories. Rock Hudson's widow comes to mind as one of those "Oh my God. It's only been four minutes and we have an hour to fill" interviews. Esther Ku tries to woo our special guest with her song "Hey, Larry King". Amongst all of the Larry King marriage proposal songs this has to be the almost best. To end the day Larry says what everyone was thinking when he stated "You guys are weird." All said and done a great show and a special thanks again to Mr. King for doing it.</p>]]></description>

<p>Today on the show Danny Lobell is joined by former guests Janine Brito and Peyton Clarkson as special co- hosts. Chris Iacono had his testicle sized tonstacles removed, so he couldn't be present for the show. Illustrator Avery Monsen and Comedian Ian Edwards drop by for a thought provoking show. Danny let's the audience know they are welcome in his house unless they are english,indian, ethiopian, german, brazilian, or any other ethnicity Danny has ever encountered. Avery talks about the verbally abusive woman who actually helped his work out. We put Peyton Clarkson's southern liberalism to the test as he is surrounded by people of different races, religions, and sexual orientations. All this and such questions such as: why can't funeral's be fun?, what happened to the good chicken? , and most importantly who really wrote "Nacho Libre"? Tune into find out . Same "Comical Radio" time and hopefully the same location.</p>

<div id=":6i">Still reeling from their recent eviction, Danny, Chris, and comedian Jamie Lee start the show with a lively discussion of Haunted Houses, wherein we learn the French versions are just hotbeds for molestation, and a&nbsp;veritable&nbsp;round table on Chris' new facial hair and whether he more closely resembles Mario, Luigi, or a Jewish Doctor. &nbsp;Thanks to Danny's tireless preparation, we learn Chris has recently switched to whole wheat pizza, is pining for a red panda, and has taken up listening to Tim [Tony] Robbins, all of which he considers a&nbsp;ridiculous&nbsp;betrayal of the man he used to be. &nbsp;This does, however, lead to a gripping preview of Danny's yet-to-be released inspirational tapes, touted as the "Tae Bo of motivational speaking". &nbsp;The arrival of writer/actor John Lutz turns conversation to the worst show's the group has performed in, including a nerdogram at a retirement party, an Indian "homecoming", a&nbsp;Hurricane&nbsp;Katrina fundraiser in a Chinese restaurant, and a benefit at a trapeze school in Brooklyn. &nbsp;Comedian Mike Lawrence joins the group for a&nbsp;dissection&nbsp;of Hollywood's aging A-list, and the impossibility of Carlos Mencia redeeming himself. &nbsp;Finally, comic Josh Accardo arrives to discuss&nbsp;Genevieve's tits, which can be seen in the much anticipated release of her short film, Retardian Angel, possibly the greatest premise for a film since Mall Cop. &nbsp;Josh attempts to promote his own movie but finds it somewhat overshadowed by the implausible brilliance of a deceased Mongoloid turned&nbsp;guardian&nbsp;angel.</div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Working out of Standup New York, since the last Comical Radio haunt got haunted, Danny Lobell and Esther Ku host this &ldquo;music-heavy&rdquo; edition of Comical Radio. Dubbed &ldquo;Ku and the Jew&rdquo;, Danny starts the show by confronting Esther for her alleged bashing of Comical Radio, and the conversation leads to Esther discussing her missionary past, and the poo she found in her blood (or something like that&hellip;). Danny and Ku talk with Hannah Elka Meyers, &ldquo;banjolele&rdquo; player extraordinaire, and discuss how Danny caused every instructor he has ever had to give up on their dreams. Then Danny and Esther may or may not have spoken to comic book artist Anders Nilsen, but we aren&rsquo;t really sure. The show closes with a jam session between Danny and Ben Simon- a musician who gives Hannah&rsquo;s banjolele a run for its money with his frankstein-esque guitar &ldquo;Guitar2-D2&rdquo;. Tune in to hear some great music and maybe one or two awkward pauses concerning wizards and robots on this episode of Comical Radio!</p>]]></description>

They turned the old studio into a haunted house so at-least it was for a reason..Danny Lobell asks the hard hitting questions like why can dogs pee every where and how can I pee through them? It's a hard hitting episode where Harry and Danny get to know each other better by talking about how strict each others parents are . Who won in this battle of the comedians? Well let's just say the winner is the first ever 12 year old jewish Santa Claus. This and the startling revelation that dogs are fun to own. Also the N word might have came up like 10 times.</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of TMI was brought to you by: JEFF BOSS FOR SENATE/PRESIDENT 2012! Dan &amp; Dan were joined by Jeff Boss, who is running for multiple offices, and claims to know that the NSA caused 9/11. He told us stories about George W. Bush's coke-filled past. The co-host of the day was psychic/medium Betsy Cohen, who helped channel Lobell's great great (x4) grandmother. She basically told him to lose weight. Didn't need a dead person to tell him that groundbreaking advice. Naturman remained skeptical. Wendy Pincus, aka Crazy Daisy the Clown, came into the studio and made us balloon animals. Alas, Naturman was not cheered up. Lobell explained how clowns depressed him as a kid and how he went to great lengths not to go to the circus. Soul Khan graced us at the end of the show with some awesome raps and talked about being a Jewish hip hop musician. Lobell and Soul freestyled about a magical giraffe. Also, it's Jesse the intern's birthday. Happy birthday intern #289!</p>]]></description>

Dave Willis, creator of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Squidbillies, calls in. He discusses his inspiration for Aqua Teen and the fact that it is nightmarishly hot in Atlanta. He does the Meatwad voice for us and Chris asks how much time he spends doing drugs. Nore Davis talks about his YouTube videos in which he reviews movies and tells you whether to see the movie in theatres or buy the bootleg. He says the movie Conan is not even worth the five-dollar bootleg. He and the guys exchange &ldquo;yo momma&rdquo; jokes. Today&rsquo;s musical guest is Mick Lewis &amp; The Fine Print. Mick Lewis has brought in homemade pie for us. His band serenades us with some songs and has everyone in the studio join in for the last one. Tune in to this episode of Comical Radio Classic for the banter and music!</span></p>]]></description>

The impending hurricane proves to be a topic of interest and contention, as Danny alerts us all of plans to evacuate the Lower East Side. Dan is skeptical, to say the least. Actor turned writer turned actor, Jon Glaser calls in to tell us about the illustrious world of television writing, biking in Brooklyn, and his current project, Delocated, where he plays a masked member of the witness protection program. Finally, the band Delano Grove comes in to play some of their new hits, and lead singer Luke Lappin talks about the influence of his crazy rock n' roll family and late president FDR on his music.</span></p>]]></description>

Alex blames his lack of sex life on 18 years of Catholic guilt. Warren tells the tale of his first hand job. Amy Winehouse&rsquo;s toxicology revealed that there were no illegal drugs in her system at the time of her death. Angel thinks there were so many illegal drugs in her system that they somehow cancelled each other out. Exciting news! Turns out that some forms of ecstasy may help cure some types of cancer.

As part of a new segment called Milk the Guests, Danny asks Sam if Danny and Chris can come to CollegeHumor and use their massage chairs. Danny introduces another new segment called Worst Guest Notes, in which he reads the most irrelevant, useless facts the interns have included in the guest notes. Comedian Jay Nog arrives and discusses the show he works on, Paid or Pain, in which bad comedians are punished for not being funny. Chris thanks him for what he&rsquo;s doing for the comedy community. Also joining the crew is the lovely Mistress Diana who resembles Velma from Scooby Doo. She plays an important role in the game they play, in which new interns Grant, Katharine and Jesse answer a series of questions. Whoever is the least funny in answering their questions gets a beating from Mistress Diana. Don't worry, the interns are receiving college credit for this. Because they feel bad about physically abusing their interns, Danny and Chris take some voluntary beatings.</span></p>]]></description>

We learned Americans should be provided more choices of political parties, kind of like cheeseburgers. Imagine a world where there are only two burgers. We want our McDemopublicans With Sleeze for all, please. Actor Gregory Korostishevsky came on the show and dropped Soviet-isms on us such as &ldquo;In math there is no much to talk&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is no work for squeegee in New York.&rdquo; He talked about teaching math in Newark, NJ where he is not allowed to hit his students. Dan Naturman then told Gregory, who fled the Soviet Union in 1990, that Newark &ldquo;must be rough.&rdquo; Finally an appearance was made by comedian Ralphie May and his wife Lahna Turner. Lahna sang genre-bending comedy-erotica folk tunes for us while Ralphie gave a legendary, inspiring motivational speech to Naturman, imploring him to live up to his potential and take over the French and Israeli comedy scenes.</span></p>]]></description>

Listen up, fellas! Brian is single and ready to mingle. Corey Feldman came forward this week to say that pedophilia is Hollywood&rsquo;s biggest problem. Chris could&rsquo;ve sworn it was cocaine. The guys try to guess which Hollywood mogul is the pedophile who molested Feldman when he was a kid. The woman whose face was ripped off by a chimp got a face transplant. Chris thinks they should have just left her faceless because now she looks like what the Grimace would be if McDonald&rsquo;s cast a movie. The guys wonder, if you&rsquo;re homeless, why choose to be homeless in New York City when you can walk to New Jersey and become a man of the land? Chris urges the homeless to leave the city and go be mountain men. Tune in to see what other topics are discussed on this episode of Live from Grandma&rsquo;s Basement!</p>

He discusses his previous job at Dylan&rsquo;s Candy Bar where he worked as a fudge cutter. He&rsquo;s not very fond of candy and says the place is full of rats. Chris wonders why homeless people don&rsquo;t eat rats, then has the brilliant idea to sell cooked rats to the homeless. He&rsquo;ll call his business the Organic Ratisserie.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ray Devito joins the gang for the remainder of the show. After Danny wonders aloud how many people in the comedy scene hate him, Ray tells the story of why Jack Russel (lead singer of the band Great White) hates him.

The second guest of the day was magician Steve Rodman. Steve says he&rsquo;ll do different magic tricks trying to fool the pair. Naturman has met a magician before that has shown him their secrets, he was beyond perplexed by how difficult it is to reciprocate a trick.

Warren is at that creepy stage where he&rsquo;s been sleeping with the same woman for so long that he wants to live vicariously through other people&rsquo;s sexual escapades. A 20-year-old babysitter in Connecticut sexually assaulted a 14-year-old boy. Chris doesn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with this. Governor Rick Perry spews a bunch of religious crap. 45, 000 Verizon workers are on strike all screaming "CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?&rdquo; Kelly thinks the didgeridoo is a terrible instrument. Chris makes the genius statement, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big fan of genetics&rdquo;. In an effort to find a cure for Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Koreans have engineered glow-in-the-dark beagles. PETA is going to be pissed! All this and more on today&rsquo;s episode of Live From Grandma&rsquo;s Basement.</span></p>]]></description>

He just graduated college, having majored in statistics. Chris says all statistics are made up. Trey Galyon enters wearing a T-shirt that says &ldquo;I drank with Doug Stanhope&rdquo;. Chris and Trey are both hardcore fans of Gonzo Journalism and Ralph Steadman. The guys discuss today&rsquo;s stock market crash and predict the entire system will soon collapse altogether. It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that thousands of people were waiting in line for bread, Chris points out. Danny says that&rsquo;s why he has his own federal reserves of food on his body. He also thinks the government wants to keep America fat. He&rsquo;s okay with this because the fatter everyone else gets, the skinnier he looks in comparison. Chris thinks we need a new holocaust in America where we systematically kill everyone on Wall Street.</span></p>]]></description>

Danny and Calise have been friends for years and he used to have the hots for her; they clear up their awkward tension right from the start. The first guest is Jeff Caldwell. They talk about everything from Port Authority to the good ol&rsquo; days. Jeff recommends that Chris opens his heart and writes from there. The second guest was Julie Goldman. Even though she called in, the crew google imaged her and let her know how attractive they thought she was. Chris truly believes there are just way too many nail salons. Bobby Slayton joined the show as the third guest. He wastes no time telling Danny not to speak and he goes on a rant about his dislike of hasidic jews. Chris and Danny surprise Bobby Slayton as he&rsquo;s on air with his neighbor Christopher Titus. Christopher Titus tells a story about how he met Bruce Springsteen. The last guest of the day was Louie Katz. The crew played a game with Louie where they took the bad notes from the interns and asked Louie bizarre questions.</span></p>]]></description>

Naturman invented a quiz game after Michael Jackson died, however it&rsquo;s making its debut now since the death of Amy Winehouse. The game is simple: Naturman will begin with a list of celebrities who are the answers, then he will read quotes said by the given celebrities about the topic at hand, the contestants will then guess which celebrity said the quote. Dan Naturman acted as the game show host, Danny Lobell was contestant one and the intern Carla was contestant two. After ten different quotes, Carla the intern beat Danny by a long shot. After the game, Dan and Danny talk to Carla briefly about the internship overall seeing as it&rsquo;s her last day. Today is Barack Obama&rsquo;s 50th birthday.</span></p>]]></description>

A new story about a rejected proposal to name a bridge after Kurt Cobain gets the guys thinking about the cleanest forms of suicide. The crew gets to the bottom of the whereabouts of the child actress from Aliens. A kid has a pulmonary embolism from playing X box for too long, and Warren says he died from being a loser.

He has been tirelessly searching for a new hat after learning that his ex girlfriend gave away his fedora. Not only is Danny unable to wear his hat while sitting next to Chris now, he&rsquo;s been very depressed for the past week. He threatened to quit the show this past weekend and updated his Facebook with a series of whiney statuses. Intern Andy comes in bearing bad news: for the first time in Comical Radio history, two guests walked off the show before even going on the air. Esther enters in a lovely sun hat, bringing McDonald&rsquo;s for the second time in a row. She insists on eating her fries during the show. She talks about the song parodies she has been working on. Chris thinks her videos are a sexual turn off and a comedic turn on. She has space issues and doesn&rsquo;t like to be touched. She doesn&rsquo;t even like shaking hands, especially with men, because they jerk off so frequently. She doesn&rsquo;t hate penises, she explains, she hates what&rsquo;s attached to them.</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><meta charset="utf-8" /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">On this episode of Comical Radio Classic, Danny Lobell and Chris Iacono are joined by Genevieve Joy on the third mic. The show starts off explaining the history of Chris and Gen&rsquo;s complicated relationship. The first guest of the show is Avery Monsen who has written a few books including &ldquo;All My Friends Are Dead&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Feel Relatively Neutral About NY.&rdquo; If any listener was wondering, Avery cannot physically defend himself and does not wish to participate in a fight just to prove this. Danny shares a story of how when he was a teenager he was beat up by 30 eight year olds. The second guest was Mike Lawrence. Mike is a friend of Danny&rsquo;s and Danny goes far enough to compare him to being the next Carlin. In high school he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to attend prom, yet instead of going to his high school reunion next month he posted on a Facebook forum to let his classmates be aware of his success. Harrison Greenbaum was the third guest of the day. Harrison has been on an episode of TMI before, however the entirety of his visit was dedicated to Naturman proclaiming that Harrison must be gay--today there was none of that. Being a Harvard alum and a comedian aren&rsquo;t the only things on his resume; he also doubles as a magician and magic camp counselor. Chris has been skeptical of magicians and magic tricks since the wee age of eleven. Oh and don&rsquo;t forget, we have merchandise now...BUY OUR STICKERS!</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 13px; color: #222222; line-height: 19px;">In this episode of Too Much Information Danny Lobell, Dan Naturman and Justy Dodge begin talking about Danny&rsquo;s current ankle injury. The conversation quickly skips to how Naturman enjoys eating his meals out as often as possible and that his studio apartment is a total mess. The first guest is Pat Carlin. He started doing stand up at the young age of 78 and spoke about some of the previous professions he&rsquo;s had throughout his life. He was a car salesman for a long time and tried to teach Naturman the tricks of the trade so he could pick up a side gig. Pat is constantly optimistic and enthusiastic; Danny was hoping some of his attitude would rub off on Naturman which didn&rsquo;t happen. The next guest of the show Joseph Zdanowski, a chiropractor as well as the inventor of the Evol process. Joseph enlightened the crew with different ways in which they can make themselves healthier. After giving these tips that will not only make you healthier but help you to lose weight he performed some of his chiropractor skills on Danny. Through these different maneuvers Joseph was able to figure out that Danny&rsquo;s left side of his body is the more dominant one and helped toxins move their way to his colon. Danny is taking this as the first step in his battle to get healthy.</span></p>]]></description>

The three men agree that they are all somewhat watered down versions of their respective fathers, but Chris has a hard time believing Warren is any less annoying than his father. Chris and Warren accuse each other of not being well informed on recent debt-ceiling talks. The crew debates whether a video of a UFO sighting in San Paolo, Brazil was doctored. If aliens are out there, Chris hopes they&rsquo;re all like Alf and eat cats. Warren delights in being able to crush Chris&rsquo;s dreams of time traveling with a new Chinese study that says travelling faster than the speed of light is impossible. Warren wants the old Dominos advertising campaigns back. Jordon recalls a fateful encounter with a beehive at summer camp. Chris wants vaginas texted to his phone instead of the steady slew of dick photos he has received after his girlfriend played a cruel trick on him. All this and much more live from Grandma&rsquo;s basement.</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #222222; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; font-family: helvetica;">This is a very special episode of Comical Radio. Danny Lobell and Chris Iacono are joined by Dave Kasten. The ridiculously high temperatures of New York have not put a damper on the crews moods however. The three start off by discussing a fight Kasten and Chris had a ways back. Kasten talks about how he is moving to Israel for six months and hopes that his job is not being a beekeeper. SURPRISE! Myka Fox walks into the studio and joins the crew. The first guest of the day is Mitch Fatel. His fianc&eacute;, Jessica, joins him on the mic. They have a radio show called &ldquo;Sex and Swinging&rdquo; on Howard Stern where they talk about erotic topics. Jessica is a swinger and Mitch is contemplating the idea; the couple is into threesomes and explains how it works for their relationship. The second guest of the day is Zak Orth. He talks about how he began working at TGI Friday&rsquo;s right in Manhattan to his success today. Chris and Danny both share stories of earlier in their lives when they worked in the food industry and the different food they stole and ate while on the job. Then when the original crew is all together, they focus in on Myka&rsquo;s life in Texas and what she&rsquo;s been up to from working on a reality TV show to hooking up with a guy from her apartment complex. Danny drops a bomb on Myka when he tells her that Chris is seeing an old flame again. Danny gets all emotional about the fact that Myka is no longer on the show and wishes Dave the best in Israel.</span></p>]]></description>

The first guest is Mansbach, who is the author of &ldquo;Go the F*** to Sleep.&rdquo; The crew expected him to be a nerdy white professor yet they were surprised when he turned out to be a black guy stuck in a Jew&rsquo;s body. Our favorite, &ldquo;Jackie Mason,&rdquo; stopped by to read from the book. The second guest is the legendary Henry Winkler. Even though most know the legend for his part in the sitcom &ldquo;Happy Days,&rdquo; he has written a book titled &ldquo;I Never Met an Idiot on the River.&rdquo; Danny knew Winkler was a big Obama fan and asked about his feelings on the Israeli policies. The crew was also intrigued to know who he can and cannot call up. They name drop and the conversation goes on. The third guest was Rider Strong, known for his character Shawn Hunter on the 90&rsquo;s sitcom "Boy Meets World." Strong has donated money to help reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone in the past, which leads to a conversation on werewolves. Danny tells a story of how when he was a child he would have nightmares of werewolves chasing him and a friend. Whether or not Rider has hooked up with co-star Danielle Fishell, Topanga on "Boys Meets World," is a hot topic of conversation. And surprisingly, Dan Naturman is NOT in a horrid mood!</span></p>]]></description>

Danny Lobell and Chris Iacono were joined by judges Gawy, Chester the life coach and Cece the black tranny. DJ Rabi was helping the crew out with some beats. Comical Radio searched high and low to find some of NYC&rsquo;s finest rapping street talent. First up was C-Bash who was performing for his second time. Second, Robyn briefly performed where she had an &lsquo;oopsie&rsquo; and had to restart. One of the judges was quite infatuated with her. Third up was Kon. Kon blew the judges away with his rap skills. And lastly was Marvelous. Danny found him on the street and he continually told us about how much he enjoys marijuana. There was a special performance by Sewer John aka the intern Andy. Right before the freestyle round Robyn and Marvelous both left. Then it all came down to just Kon and C-Bash. There were three rounds of freestyle battling; it was close but in the end Kon prevailed becoming the overall winner. The show finished up by discussing political figures the black tranny would and wouldn&rsquo;t sleep with.</span></p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/Ep_800_-_Grandmas_Basement_--_Moon_for_sale.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>With Warren out of town and Danny absent from the studio, Chris hosts today&rsquo;s episode of Live From Grandma&rsquo;s Basement with guest James Goff. James is a huge video game nerd. He&rsquo;s obsessed with Call of Duty. The guys discuss the fact that Netflix has increased their membership prices. Chris cancelled his Netflix account a long time ago, now he just steals movies online like a normal person. He feels personally responsible for the downfall of Blockbuster because he was a manager at a Blockbuster when he was twenty and never charged people for late fees. James complains that Netflix thinks they know him. He rents one black movie, and they start suggesting exclusively black movies to him. James plugs his favorite porn site, Xandexcess.com. Chris is disappointed that Danny isn&rsquo;t in the studio today because he likes to get his input on food-related news topics. For instance, studies have found that eating with a big fork can help you eat less. James thinks the best way to lose weight is to get dumped. Chris disagrees. Instead of losing weight, he sits around crying and eating ice cream. Alcohol was banned for three days in Ecuador because 21 people died after drinking some bootleg liquor. James doesn&rsquo;t do drugs or drink. On one occasion, he drank half a forty-ounce of malt liquor and swore he would never drink again. A couple from South Carolina thinks they saw an image of Jesus in their Wal Mart receipt. Chris thinks this is a brilliant marketing ploy. He then says there is a company selling real estate on the moon and making millions of dollars. Also, he doesn&rsquo;t believe we actually killed Bin Laden. Either he&rsquo;s been dead for years or we didn&rsquo;t kill him.</p>]]></description>

He blames bad luck for his lack of sex life. Danny suggests he move to Brooklyn. Chris advises him to bite the bullet and have sex with a girl who needs it really, really badly. Danny was in love with a girl in high school and was heartbroken when she asked him to loan her money for an abortion. Chris dated the biggest slut in his high school. When he took her to a Bloodhound Gang concert, she ended up having sex with one (of more) of the band members. Ray points out that it could&rsquo;ve been worse; she could&rsquo;ve banged Chumbawamba. The guys discuss Disney shows they watched as kids. Danny admits he did, and still does, think Babs Bunny is hot. Chris calls him a pedophile because Babs is a child rabbit, not to mention the fact that she is basically Bugs Bunny in drag. Danny proclaims Tony to be 1939&rsquo;s &ldquo;producer of the year&rdquo;. Ray says Tony looks like a guy who would&rsquo;ve ratted on Al Capone. Ray tells a tragic story about his monster of an ex-girlfriend from high school. Chris and Danny agree that she may be the reason for his virginity.</span></p>]]></description>

The three begin by talking about an upcoming bit that involves a black tranny. Danny and Chris were expecting an ugly tranny to respond to the ad and the one they got is actually rather good looking. Danny resents boobs whereas Chris is a boobs guy. Gina shares a few anecdotes of her trials and tribulations dealing with older people. Danny recalls a childhood memory of not being picked for a flag football team. The first guest of the episode was John Gemberling of the UCB&rsquo;s Death by Roo Roo Improv Team. Danny has seen him perform before and truly thinks John will go places. Because of this prediction, John says when he makes it big he will give Danny $100. The second guest is Ryan Conner. He recently went on tour in China and shared a few stories with the crew about the scams he fell for while there. Danny relates his pizza addiction to a heroin addiction. Reese Waters joined the group for the end of the show. Reese has been on &ldquo;Letterman&rdquo; recently and this sparks a conversation about how the comics feel as though they&rsquo;re judged by their peers during a set. At the end of the show, Reese proclaims his distaste for Baltimore and Kylie jumps on the mic to defend it, her old stomping grounds.</span></p>]]></description>

Naturman is a dark cloud of gloom as per usual and he hates on Justy for being a ray of sunshine. Naturman gives advice to a new comic, Harry Terjanian, on knowledge that he has gained in show biz over the years. Justy leaves the show for a brief moment, yet when she returns Naturman is already enriching Harry&rsquo;s mind. The crew has Harry do a small bit which leads into Danny pretending to be a big-wig comic and Naturman pretending to be Harry. In this short exchange, they explain to Harry how he should befriend more famous comics. Some of the advice Naturman gives is make more famous friends, be yourself, be more blue collar, be less nice, be more aggressive and don&rsquo;t go below 14th street. Danny does his Jay Leno and Lisa Lampanelli impressions. At the end of the show, Justy talks briefly about the bad audition she had at the Comic Strip.<br /></span></span></span></span></div>

He and Chris are joined by Kevin Bartini. Danny hopes the show goes more smoothly than he co-hosted with Warren a couple of weeks ago. Chris brings up a UK study that reveals babies should be exercising to prevent obesity later in life. This reminds Danny of the fact that he never crawled as a baby. Worried that he was developmentally challenged, his parents took him to several doctors. He was diagnosed as being fat and lazy. He is so lazy he takes the subway elevators instead of the stairs. Like most people, Kevin refuses to use subway elevators because they smell like piss. The gang discusses an Arizona senator who is under scrutiny for having pointed a (pink) gun at a reporter during an interview. She defends herself saying she didn&rsquo;t have her finger on the trigger. Chris wants a gun with the Comical Radio logo on it. House GOP leaders are ginning up excitement for Tuesday's vote to roll back lightbulb efficiency standards, calling it the "Save the Lightbulb" bill. Danny brags about his knowledge of light bulbs from his days as a light bulb salesman. He then criticizes Comedy Central for roasting easy targets such as Charlie Sheen, Donald Trump and Flavor Flav. He&rsquo;d rather see Paul McCartney roasted. Or maybe Arnold Schwarzenegger as long as there were no impressions allowed. Kevin wonders, who give still cares about Charlie Sheen? Think outside the box, Comedy Central.</span></p>]]></description>

Danny describes wearing a wife beater that was too small and fit him like a sports bra. Chris tries to encourage Danny to lose ten pounds by the end of the summer but Danny refuses.&nbsp;<br /><br />Comedian and producer Steve Hoffstetter comes on the show, and describes how school lunches impacted his formative years. Danny loved school lunch when he was a kid. Steve likens his father to Homer Simpson and recalls a time he passed out flyers in the middle of a bitter cold December-and then lashed out at a fellow comedian who complained about July weather. Danny once joined the cross-country team to be near a girl he liked, and according to Chris he's still running the mile. The gang agrees that the movie "Eat Pray Love" feels like rape-even though none of them have actually seen it. Then Steve has to leave to pick up his dog from day care.<br /><br />Danny&rsquo;s neighbor Peyton Clarkson and comedian joins the show and says that, although he is terrified of Danny, there are times he wishes he had a little more Lobell in his personality. Six months ago, Chris and Payton went to Danny&rsquo;s barbeque and harassed and traumatized Danny&rsquo;s pet chicken. Peyton says, in all seriousness, he has never met a bigger cunt than Chris&rsquo;s ex and is glad she dumped him.&nbsp;<br /><br />How them boys gonna get outta this one?</span></p>]]></description>

Naturman is at a new level of miserable, even for him! Frank Liotti briefly tells his life story of how he lost his mother, father and best friend all in less than one year. He got through his difficult time in his life because of his comedy. Naturman is unimpressed with his loss and feels as though it&rsquo;s not enough to get sympathy. Frank speaks about how he is a gay man and is in a relationship that has been sexless for 6 years. This sparks the beginning of a conversation between all sharing their sexual relationships lately. At the end of the show Justy and Naturman have a blowout.</span></span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<div id="b9e24e5f7d00403b8dfe557a3e049ee7" class="content">In this episode, Danny accuses Chris of being patriotic and owning American flag boxers. They describe in detail what producer Tony is wearing and make fun of the fact that he is reading a book about television and radio that was published in the 1960s. Enter Paul Provenza and Billy Connolly. An interviewer once asked Billy if he&rsquo;d ever been to a psychologist and if so, what he told him. She criticized him saying that the &ldquo;Scottish way&rdquo; of dealing with your problems is to go to the pub and vent to your friends, not to see a psychiatrist. Danny once put up signs around his neighborhood advertising a tag sale at the house of someone he was angry at. A former intern that Chris slept with posted his phone number on the &ldquo;casual encounters&rdquo; section on Craigslist.com telling people to text pictures of their penises to his phone. They were much bigger than his. Danny and Billy agree that when you first get a new idea for a joke, it&rsquo;s way funnier to you than to anyone else. Billy offers Danny a piece of advice: don&rsquo;t go to comedy shows, go see rock and roll shows instead. When Billy asks why comedians don&rsquo;t dress up anymore, Chris angrily responds that clubs don&rsquo;t pay them enough to dress up. That, and Chris doesn&rsquo;t own any nice clothes.</div>]]></description>

Danny spoke briefly about the quarrel he had earlier in the week with Warren. It was proposed that if Warren is up to it they will reconcile and talk through their differences during a show. The 1st guest of the day was Nick Vatterott. He spoke briefly about his one-man show, &ldquo;No Outlet&rdquo; yet the conversation moved quickly to racist rapists. In walks Yamaneika Saunders the female co-host of this episode....on black people time. We learn very quickly that she&rsquo;s extremely spiritual which will be repetitively brought up throughout the show. Faryn Einhorn is our 2nd guest who is a member of the Harvard Sailing Team. Faryn makes quite clear that their sketch group is not from Harvard nor do they sail. Faryn and Yamaneika hit it off well; Danny suggests that they shoot a comedy buddy film about the two of them going to a burger place. Next Adam Newman joins the show where the talk immediately jumps to his puns and clear tweets to celebrities...that go unanswered. Yamaneika loves to suck on onions and thinks Adam is &lsquo;delicious.&rsquo; The last guest of the day is Andy de la Tour. His English accent practically swoons Yamaneika because of her love of the movie Mary Poppins. He tells a story of how Robin Williams stole his thunder at a comedy club in the UK many moons ago.</span></span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><meta charset="utf-8" /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #222222; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; font-family: helvetica;">With Chris Iacono still off in the hills of upstate New York, Danny Lobell hosts the show with Justy Dodge and James F. Harris. Justy and James are in a happy and committed relationship; they tell Danny of their plans to marry one day. Danny is slightly skeptical. With love in the air, relationships become the topic of conversation. Danny admits to crying to his girlfriend Kylie about being a bad older brother. Justy is defiantly against males crying. Danny shares a story of him and his girlfriend getting into a fight after she yelled at him. The conversation then turns into a strange card trick performing Transylvanian that Danny hungout with on the streets of NYC late one night. Danny met Alec Baldwin and realized they have something in common--they&rsquo;re both friends with Gawy.</span></p>]]></description>

In Chris&rsquo;s absence, the crew pays tribute to the inbred Iacono cult. Danny milks his Tracy Morgan impression for all it&rsquo;s worth while Jesse P-S&rsquo;s Tracy Morgan consistently comes out sounding like John Travolta. The crew delights over the discovery of an anti-Semitic super hero. Jordan shamelessly plugs his stand-up benefit show. And has anyone ever met an old midget? Absurdity, misogyny, and jokes about babies drowning are peppered throughout this hilarious two-hours.</span><br /></span></span></p>]]></description>

The three of them jumped right into talking about Jessimae&rsquo;s love for tranny porn. Then their dear old friend Brian McGuiness joined the show where he shared an old memory where he and Danny went shopping at Footlocker and Danny&rsquo;s credit card was declined. This spiraled the conversation into how Danny tries to barter everywhere he goes and Chris complains about the prices of everything. Chris spoke about the pizzeria his family used to own and how he can tell the ingredients and how old a piece of pizza is. The show&rsquo;s producer, Tony Miller, jumped on a 4th mic and Danny explained how Tony became part of the crew many years ago. Legendary Bill Bailey then was in the studio speaking of his career of a lifetime from performing at small clubs to arenas. Tony Woods then joined the show to discuss his speech impediment and how he was almost attacked by a &ldquo;flamingo&rdquo; in Australia. Lastly two members from Murderfist, Henry Zebrowski and Ed Larson, joined the crew to explain a few of their hilarious sketches as well as explain how Murderfist came to be.</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><meta charset="utf-8" /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #222222; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; font-family: helvetica;">On today&rsquo;s episode Danny Lobell was joined by Justy Dodge, Dan Naturman and Harrison Greenbaum. Harrison spoke of the struggles he&rsquo;s had throughout his life of defending his sexuality. Many have thought he was gay because he is a bit feminine. This leads the group into a discussion of how they believe Naturman is in fact gay and has not come out of the closet. Naturman repeatedly denies these claims, yet a vote is taken in the room through secret ballots. The votes show that 7 out of 9 voters thought Dan was gay. Towards the end of the show the crew just wanted to acknowledge that there is nothing wrong with being gay and that they are in no way being condescending towards the LGTB community.</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep: 783 CR Grandma's Basement- Kyle Finchem</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/Comical_Radio_Grandmas_Basement_EP_783_6-14-11.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div id="298439fd457c454a9a6842977e5ca41a" class="content">In this week&rsquo;s Grandma&rsquo;s basement, Chris&rsquo;s main point of contention with Puerto Rico achieving statehood is the extra star that will need to be placed on the flag. Warren designates comedian Kyle Finchem as the token Puerto Rican for the debate-just because his skin is the tannest. Chris plays devils advocate during a debate on MMA and is called out by Warren for stealing George Carlin bits. Chris and Warren bicker over whether a new laser powered by jellyfish uses proteins or bacteria. Kyle thinks suicide would be more popular if Obama came out in support of it-and the crew weigh the pros and cons of shooting yourself in the face. Ultimately they all reach the conclusion that members of the Tea Party should just kill themselves. Grandma&rsquo;s Basement, fair and balanced.</div>]]></description>

Los Angeles comedian Jacob Shirof says he is &ldquo;mainstream and hacky&rdquo;, and proud of it. He talks about his terrific sex life, which only fuels his desire to masturbate. A Zamboni-driving Danny manifests himself in Chris&rsquo;s dreams. A stoned Shang Hueng cannot recall a time when he had a problem with anyone. Danny gets crap for watching Indiana Jones IV but not the first three. Make sure to tune into this more-perverted-than-usual edition of the Monday Show.</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The gang mourns the loss of the world&rsquo;s oldest and bushiest sheep. They agree that Tracy Morgan is a jackass after his latest outburst and Danny tries out his impression of the &ldquo;30 Rock&rdquo; star. Guest co-host Gina Brillon does not let her religiousness interfere with sexual promiscuity- although she does feel bad about it afterwards. Dave Waite would only consider having consensual sex with his &ldquo;clever&rdquo; students during his years spent as a substitute teacher. Adam Mamawalla ruminates on his physical absence of a definitive ethnicity. Chris discusses a porno he watched involving savory fruit. Comic legend Pat Cooper discusses everything he can remember at his advanced age from his new book, and spits in the face of Howard Stern, Frank Sinatra, Lisa Lampanelli and more. Don&rsquo;t miss the jam-packed two and a half-hour breath of fresh comedy!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Danny and Chris are joined on the Monday show by comedian Phoebe Robinson.<br />Danny creates a fake Facebook page for Miracle on the Hudson pilot Sully and feels<br />pangs of regret when people fall for the hoax. The crew argues over the blurry line<br />between what constitutes an act of heroism and what hinges on sadism.<br />Comedian Hari Kondabolu expresses his aversion to comic legend Jackie Mason<br />and reveals he is against telling rape jokes, a major part of Chris&rsquo;s repertoire.<br />Matt McCarthy, the red-bearded Verizon guy, admits he is completely apathetic<br />towards scones, and defends the honor of America against Danny, who questions<br />the logic behind the Boston Tea Party-which he describes as a &ldquo;waste of tea&rdquo;-and the<br />American Revolution as we know it. All this and much more on The Friday Show!</p>]]></description>

Warren is back live and ready to take on the new organic craze of brewing breast cheese which can create jobs and possibly boost our economy. The very first marathon in the Gaza is going to raise money for youth summer camps. It sounds eerie to us too. An important message for all the hustlers with stacks of cash and advancements in detection technology. Silver and copper will be the new currency for those markets. Going old school is what they call it. Also, would you take a pill from some random doctor who is at your door as if he were making an unannounced house visit? Why are the citizens of Turkey so gullible? . Tune in and enjoy.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep 768 - CR Classic  - Robots and Radiation - Calise Hawkins, Abbi Crutchfield, Eric Bergrstrom</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/CR_Classic_Ep_768.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>The show opens with Calise Hawkins exhibiting her refined taste in men: thugs with minds.. or something. Girls are complicated. Chris Iacono reminisces about college, specifically 'hippie-flipping' and other fun times with certian unmentionables.&nbsp; Ah, the simpler times. They also bond over astral-projecting experiences. If you don't know what that is, you are not among the chosen.</p>
<p>Abbi Crutchfield talks about performing at Showtime at the Apollo, and she and Calise realize they could develop a doppelganger comedy scheme, booking for each other and splitting the cut (they look alike. Google it!)</p>
<p>Japan might sink and destroy California, which naturally leads to a discussion of the nuances of Asian robot porn. Calise reveals she would design her ideal robot mate to have a tripod penis for variety control. And no balls. Chris just doesn't want his robot to be able to develop an opinion/personality.</p>
<p>Eric Bergrstrom is exhausted after trying to go home last night from Comic Strip Live, but was delayed by a man throwing himself in front of the subway train. Chris requests that you please exercise courtesy and commit all suicides away from public transportation. They discuss how cell phones are destroying socializing, and also most likely our brains. But Chris is optimistic: the radiation will probably just turn us all into superheroes. And finally, no discussion of serious issues in today's society is complete without a reference to the Twilight series.</p>

Justy is put on the spot by Chris and Danny because they still plan to hold auditions for Myka's replacement next week.<br />As the crew has learned, hosting in a new location for the first time always has its roadblocks. Chris and Danny bet how long they can go without eating. The prize is a big steak dinner. Fasting for food. A few guest MIA, or stuck in traffic so they claim. But Brian McGuiness was a return on the show today and only returned because Dave Kasten wasn't present.<br />Because it had been such a long time since he had last been a guest they had a lot to catch up on. Like what would happen if his fiance or anyone's significant other were to loose a limb.<br />Some how that stayed in their subconscious as Danny thought it would be a good idea to find an American colony of lepers. After several attempts of calling for a tour they unsuccessfully gave up and proceeded to badger someone else.<br />Kevin Bartini who holds the record for the most show appearances was unable to make it in because of traffic. So without warning he turned around and went home. That didn't stop Danny from calling and making sure he knew there would be repercussions for his actions.</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep 763 - Live From Grandma's Basement - It Taint Big Enough</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/LFGB_Ep_763.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chris and Warren speculate about why Charlie Sheen&rsquo;s tour is bombing. Beginning with customers who are trying to sell back their tickets to the scalpers they bought them off of. Warren would go if it were free and would pay about as much as a handful of dung.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reviving the Sex segment of Sex, drugs and Rock and Roll Chris asks his male listeners to get a tape measure out and handy to measure the other half of their privates. Because it is the size of you &ldquo;taint&rdquo; not the size of your balls that determines how fertile a man is. Be carful of course though because one out of one hundred men are allergic to their own juice.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Warren and Chris delve head first into an intensely heated argument about science VS. &ldquo;Warren&rsquo;s existentialist bull crap.&rdquo; All started by a mouse, a gay mouse, engineered by scientists.&nbsp;</div>
<div>To wrap up the show with some more medical and scientific mysteries, scientists are baffled by the 132 lbs Japanese toddler.&nbsp;</div>]]></description>

Maybe cause she carries around three phones as technology trophies from her past conquests and the &ldquo;new guy.&rdquo;<br /> To make money or to wait for stardom, that is the question. Tom Shillue prefers the alt scene where he is more likely to get noticed rather than get paid in recognizable comedy clubs.<br /> Moving TVs won&rsquo;t cut it as a career but it is some nice pocket cash. Creator of odd jobs and animated the first character on &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; Jeremy Redleaf is single handedly putting muppets out of business.<br /> Back from the other side of the world Alan Paul and his band Woddie Alan are widely recognized in China; and we must know, how much better is their Chinese food?</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well we&rsquo;re moving on up, the itunes charts, we finally got a piece of the pie! Chris Iacono and Warren Holstein are celebrating Comical Radio&rsquo;s rise to #47 on the itunes podcast chart with another stoner session. <br /><br />Chris Iacono and Warren Holstein discuss the ongoing tragedy in Japan, Apple suing Amazon over their new app store, weird Japanese porn and of course Charlie Sheen and whether or not he's really the one writing those tweets.&nbsp; <br /><br />Chris tells Warren of a recent dream where Chris wins a $51 billion dollar scratch off which just leads to incoherent stoner talk combining quantum physics, telekinesis, monozygotic twins, dream transference, and the never ending Israeli Palestinian conflict. Sounds confusing?...well it did to us too. Maybe this is best decided over a game of Chess Boxing! You heard it right, Brain meets Pain where two competitors go head to head between rounds of boxing and playing chess.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep 758 - Comical Radio - Psychic Grinders - Kevin Allison, Derek Calibre &amp; Pamela Murphy</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/CR_Classic_3_18_11.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>This week, Warren, Justy, and Chris discuss some sensitive topics. Most notably, they discuss the legalization of prostitution, for which Chris is a suspiciously enthusiastic advocate. But Warren brings up a valid issue: is it possible to regulate AIDS-infested hookers? Other questions the debate evokes: would legalized prostitution lower the rape rate, or does Chris just not understand the raping mind as well as Warren does? How is Warren so in touch with rapist psychology? Don't hang out in any dark alleys if you don't want to find out.</p>
<p>The gang talks to Kevin Allison, host of the popular podcast RISK! You may also have seen his ads on Match.com: &ldquo;Creepy 40 yr old lemonade-fasting male seeking young asian males.&rdquo; But according to Chris, it's still &ldquo;better to be single and fat than single and hallucinating.&rdquo; We're still not sure about that.</p>
<p>Pamela Murphy mentions her excitement about going to UCB in LA, which Chris manages to dampen with a caveat about Japanese radiation wafting over to the west coast. Did we mention Pamela is a cancer survivor?</p>
<p>Derek Calibre followed the typical path to psychic-dom: having a midlife crisis while running an ice cream store. He tries to determine Justy's relationship future, and predicts she will meet someone from a colder state, around December. The hints of cold and deadness in his vision present a promising romance. Warren remains skeptical as to whether Derek is a real psychic, or just a PC-owner.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>STOP! Do not read any further if you listen to Glenn Beck, unless of course you only listen to him to hear what ridiculous antics he&rsquo;s up to. Chris expressed with much distain his vile hatred towards the man that believes what has happened to Japan was an act of God. While what happened to Japan is a tragedy and we can only extend our deepest sympathy to them, Chris and Warren go back and forth about fueling on nuclear power&hellip;you know, that thing Homer does for a living in &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo;?<br /> But Glenn Beck isn&rsquo;t the only one getting grief over his opinions on Japan. Gilbert Gottfried the infamous voice of Aflac's duck mascot was fired over his tasteless tweets. Good news for twitter though, they reached their billionth tweet. I wonder if it was over Madonna&rsquo;s stalker breaking, entering and nutting all over her bed sheets.<br /> Maybe that&rsquo;s why there are so many depressed dads out there, and they feel it&rsquo;s okay to take it out on their infant children.<br /> Please dad&rsquo;s what ever you do, for the sake of your child&rsquo;s future, don&rsquo;t try and live your rock star dream life through your child. Just because you have 20K to throw around doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to sink it into making your daughter perform a D class music video. A music video that is being arguably called the worst music video in the history of music videos. To give you an idea of what it takes to make the worst music video in history just list the days of the week while figuring out which seat of the car you want to sit in. Rebecca Black, you have redefined bad music.</p>]]></description>

<p>I'll leave it to the comedians. On today's show, Jesse Powell Stroud, talks about his up and coming realistic comic book, where the characters actually get hurt and maybe die. Warren expresses his hatred for Superman and Chris had an imaginary friend.</p>
<p>The dreamy, Ben Gleib, calls in to discuss Libya, conspiracy theories and touring with Dane Cook and Julie Klausner discusses her sexual attraction for Frankenstein and vampires.</p>

With that TMI is back after a four week hiatus with guest Mayim Bialik famous for her American sitcom Blossom, JC Davies to ratify our suspicions about different races in the sack and Tom Arnold, who is done talking about Roseanne. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-indent: .5in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Turns out Mayim Bialik didn't live up to the child star cliche which is make tons of money at a young age and later blow it on drugs and booze like Charlie Sheen. Instead Mayim, is active in the Jewish community, has two young children, a new role on the popular show The Big Bang Theory and got her degree in neuroscience. Which is the only reason <span style="color: #1a1a1a;">Naturman is a huge fan. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-indent: .5in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; color: #1a1a1a;">The sex columnist, JC Davies, who spent over a year interviewing interracial daters for I Got The Fever and has more than 20 years of experience dating men of different cultures including Latino, Asian, Jewish, Black and Middle Eastern men. And who's the best in bed? The winners are Latinos! Hear that one ladies! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-indent: .5in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; color: #1a1a1a;">Tom Arnold who's famous for more than just dating the brazen Roseanne Barr, is going back to his roots in stand up comedy. Tom opened his doors to Danny and Justy to celebrate the Shabbos in Los Angeles. Danny is bringing the Kedem wine. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; color: #1a1a1a;">Naturman looked into his magic eight ball for the future of our TMI Crew. Outlook does not look good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Establishing himself and Danny as the black sheep of the comedy industry and the only way the two of them are ever going to make it is murder or moving to another country. But there&rsquo;s still hope for Justy.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In celebration of the 25th Anniversary of Zelda, Chris Iacono and Warren Holstien are joined by friend Jordan Ferber to disscuss the finner points of traditional video games. Those finner points included the music composition behind Zelda as well as masturbating to animated figures and Warrens abdonment issues.</p>
<p>Last episode Warren explained why he denounces his mother, this week his daddy issues come out as Chris attempts to gang up on him with Jordan. Warren tells the sad but comical story of how his dad left him on his 8th birthday. All the while the stoners had only one goal in mind. Chinese food for munchies.</p>
<p>Trying and failing not to get sidetracked there was mention of competing companies racing robots, monkeys riding pigs and Donald Trump running for president. I wonder who he'll fire. In other brief news Vancouver has been titled "The World's Most Liveable City." And lastly but most certainly not least...Mississippi, home of the flamable cross is asking for official KKK license plates...wish we could get into that further but the Chinese food is here!</p>]]></description>

Uncle Sam supports Myka's dream, so should you! Free food for everyone until they abolish the slavery that is being alive.<br /><br />Al Jackson came into the studio concerned over Oprah's fate. How will the country handle such an epic loss? By smoking weed in a movie theater? By downing a bottle of champagne? No, champagne downage is for celebratory events like getting your own Comedy Central half hour special Which he has, it premieres tonight, 11pm est on Comedy Central. Watch it, the crowd is roaring.<br /><br />Odd Todd Rosenburg came in with an impressive list of goals: Beat a few more levels in plants and zombies, think about exercising, try not to get pressured by nearby hoverers at the airport California Pizza Kitchen. Oh, hes also collaborating on a film with that guy who made Donnie Darko, working on a TV show, and revolutionizing the educational system.&nbsp;<br /><br />Father/daughter improv duo "Grandma Hates Technology" are 50 yr old Mike Weiss and his 14 yr old daughter Jessica came in and explained how their group formed: Mike had a mid-life crisis after not being able to pursue comedy after having a daughter. Then he used his daughter to kick start a comedy career. Chris and Myka convinced them to do some improv live on the air that featured, if you can believe it, a grandma that hates technology.<br /><br />Two ninths of the award winning sketch group&nbsp; "Harvard Sailing Team" came in and set the record straight about the Golden Girls. They were the best. Also the best, winning a Nightlife Award and performing at Town Hall.&nbsp; Also the best, cats on Prozac.</span></p>]]></description>

Warren degrades Chris&rsquo; orgy to a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois.<br /> Chipoltle, every American&rsquo;s favorite Mexican food turns out to be more authentic than you think. And you know that pyramid they want to build in Colorado for the aliens?<br /> They might not need slaves to build it this time.<br /> Chris wants to start a new collection of his favorite dictators and communist leaders with trading cards. And in other weird news Warren worries about how much a woman&rsquo;s vagina gets stretched without a C-section after giving birth to a 13lb baby that was 22inches long</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">It&rsquo;s a bittersweet episode of Danny Lobell and the Crew as Danny prepares to leave for his UK tour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Chris gives his opinions on the guests coming to fill in for Danny while he&rsquo;s away. (Let&rsquo;s hope they don&rsquo;t listen to this episode!) The guys also talk about the super bowl and sports in general. At least Danny does. Chris has no clue whatsoever. Then, Chris talks about the Iacono &ldquo;cabin&rdquo; upstate. And if you thought the show couldn&rsquo;t get any meatier, Danny recites his favorite rat story. With all this talk about rats, cabins and football, it&rsquo;s an all American episode of Danny Lobell and the Crew.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>What does it take to make it in New York? To make it in the city of bright lights while selling fair trade coffee and finding rent that doesn't cost you a kidney, is truly an art. Danny and the crew talked to owner of the PIT Ali Farahnakian&nbsp;(people's improv theater) about how he built and runs the venue, successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You think you've heard of all the up and coming high brow work-out programs? Try this one on for size, having sex on a stair master. Kevin Bartini defends his pride and shape, although hard, being married to a personal trainer. Chris Iacono suggests Danny gives it a try, exercise in general, that is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Danny, Chris, and Myka have been on David Kasten's case for weeks about quitting heroine, but today Ray Wagner proves you don't need to spiral down a drug path to be a genuine bum. Broke over $160 he plans out his work schedule in order to make ends meet.</p>
<p>All this talk about one day making it big and Louis Ramey of Last Comic Standing has tasted stardom. What does it taste like you ask? Lovely little old ladies and gay men.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 12px;">The question arises that has pondered man&rsquo;s mind since the beginning of time&hellip;Do dogs prefer to sniff ass or cocaine? Chris Iacono argues Warren Holstein that they would rather sniff cocaine. In the end it was Warren that won&hellip;by a big Jewish nose. That wasn&rsquo;t the only thing they were shoving up their noses though. The newest homemade drug found in your everyday bathroom, and it&rsquo;s not Nyquil. It&rsquo;s bath-salts and they&rsquo;re stronger than meth. I wonder if that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re rioting about in Egypt.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/CRC_1_21_11.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>Yo, Hammer! Jim Breuer called in with some depressing news about fame: once you get on Saturday Night Live, it only gets worse. You start off feeling like you've made it in show business, you star in a cult classic with Dave Chappelle, then the improvisers don't want to talk to you and you end up at home podcasting from your basement while your dad dies a slow death upstairs and your mom patiently waits four days for a haircut.</p>
<p>Over 1 Million copies sold! Comical Radio dared Jesse Joyce to go platinum with his new album "Pro Joyce." Check out the streets of Times Square for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see Jesse harassing tourists to "Check it out check it out! Buy my CD!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joyce recalls Comical Radio's interview with Greg Giraldo, and cites it as evidence that Kasten does not understand addiction at all, and that Kasten is probably already an addict. Chris Iacono threatens to go seventh grade on him and tell his parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>France's most famous comedian Samy Ameziane came into the studio and brought French TV with him. They were there to capture every relived moment of Danny hitting on and then dismissing a French prostitute due to lack of sufficient funds. We walk away from that story with one universal truth: To get women, you either have to be rich, famous, or Michael Moore's son.</p>
<p>Kieran&nbsp; McCann from Lunatic Radio came in and revealed that his co-host once developed a crush on Myka, having never met her, based on one picture. Shallow dreams do come true. Sadly, said co-host now has a live-in girlfriend and Myka is told she needs to further lower her standards. Kasten, for example, will take a hand job from a puppet. "Disgusting!" cries Chris Iacono. Not because Kasten was jerked off by a puppet, but because the puppeteer was a bad ventriloquist.</p>

<p>Everybody sing it now! "When days go by, there's room for you, room for me, for gentle hearts an opportunity. As days go by, it's the bigger love of the family!" And with that, the TMI family is back! And with a very special guest! Jaleel White, aka Steve Urkel! Why all the exclamation points!</p>
<p>Turns out Jaleel is a family man himself these days. America's Favorite Nerd of the 90's now has a daughter and still waiting to do that "Family Matters" reunion. Justy prodded Jaleel to say his catchphrase, but no, he wouldn't "do that."</p>
<p>The self taught "sawist" Natalia Paruz showed us how to work a saw and somehow make it sound like an opera singer.

Where's that Ghost Adventures guy when we need him?</p>
<p>Justy finally had sex with a man that may or may not have rheumatoid arthritis. Now, Naturman and Justy aren't friends because of the fear of falling sexually in love. Once again, Naturman tried to rap, at the expense of everyone with ears. Oh, Natty, you'll never be Notorious B.I.G. Not even Notorious J.E.W. Hey, that's a catchy name!</p>
<p>Tune in next week for more creepiness.</p>

<p>Things get tense this episode of Danny Lobell and the Crew when pent-up frustrations are released: Danny doesn't want Chris to reproduce (yet), Chris wants more off-time to advance his comedy career, Myka wants everyone to shut the fuck up, and Dave probably still just wants some heroin.</p>
<p>Danny gives buddy T.J. Del Reno a ring to inquire about the egregious pit of college debt he has dug for himself. *Spoiler: it's more money than he has. The gang get some perspective on their financial woes, but like all comedians, they'll keep complaining.</p>
<p>At the end of the day though, all everyone wants to do is produce the best darned radio show possible. Also, everyone agrees that outsourcing work to foreign laborers is the best idea ever.</p>
<p>Tune in next time for Danny Lobell and the Crew, now broadcasting out of sunny New Delhi.</p>

			<title> Ep 737 Part B: CR Classic- Here He Comes to Save the Day: The Mighty Male Stripper is On The Way</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/CR_1_14_11_Part_2_Slayton_Nero_Zemuda.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>Starting off part two of Comical Radio Classic was Bobby Slayton, who unexpectedly showed up, guns blazing, ready to insult everybody. Business as usual for the least adorable 'pit bull' there ever was. If you don't understand the reference, just Bing it! Just kidding. Who uses that, anyway???</p>
<p>Following Bobby's tirade was a calm, cool, and collected call-in from Bob Zmuda, Andy Kaufman's co-conspirator and creator of Comic Relief. Zmuda "Revealed!" (another reference, sorry, I'll stop) that he wanted Nicolas Cage to play his best friend in "Man on the Moon." Mr. Ghost Rider himself! Jim Carrey snatched the role, however, after a genius audition tape. Zmuda also talked with the crew about Mr. X, a screenwriter mentioned in the Kaufman book who would make people do crazy things for money. The revelation was slightly underwhelming, considering that it was actually divulged 11 years ago. Man, where have we been? On the moon?</p>
<p>The multitalented Dante Nero stopped by, and the gang chatted with him about his numerous pastimes and occupations. They include: Being a comedian, male stripping, riding a unicycle, doing mixed martial arts, fencing, splitting cables, and on and on and on. Chris mentioned to Dante "Jack of All Trades" Nero that he had snake eye tattoos "down there." Would that increase Chris' chances of becoming a male stripper himself? No, and that probably means that Chris won't get work because he's wearing a scarf either.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, good for you! Milk and cookies for everyone! (Google that reference, too.)</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/CR_1_14_11_George_Kawi_Fishback.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Adding fuel to the fire of the last episode, Danny brings in close friend and recovering heroin addict George in an attempt to get Kasten to lay off the smack. George tells tales of being incarcerated, stealing bikes to avoid $2 fares and finally recovering after a long uphill battle. The Battle for Kasten&rsquo;s sobriety will continue until the hosts finally win.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Late bloomer stand-up comedian John Kawie is alive and kicking after suffering a stroke that couldn&rsquo;t keep him down. He sufficiently scared hypochondriacs Myka and Danny after talking about how sudden his stroke came on. To make the conversation even lighter, the hosts reminisced about a dead comedy club booker with Kawie. Let's just say this interview was a little on the morbid side.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Dan Fishback, a gay and Jewish musician/motivational speaker/life coach attempts to set the crew straight and make their lives all a bit easier. He was the first person in Comical Radio history to agree that living in your grandmother&rsquo;s basement is a-okay. Chris was finally vindicated after years of mockery from the crew. Crew: 2,370. Chris: 1!<br /> &nbsp;<br /> And that was it for part one folks! Make sure to download part two next week where we talk to Andy Kaufman&rsquo;s co-conspirator Bob Zmuda, former male stripper/fencer/unicyclist/mixed martial artist AND comedian Dante Nero with a random drop in from Bobby Slayton.</p>]]></description>

Joe's anxiety about flying, being on a cruise ship, and going to comedian Christmas parties is off the charts this week. Mama Matarese calls in to talk about rushing Joe to the pediatrician after his first pot-induced anxiety attack at a wee young age. She suggested a little Rocky 2 therapy for Joe on cruise ship gigs (cue that corny theme, picture Joe running up the Philadelphia Museum's stairs and conquering his anxieties, oh forget it). Comedian Jesse Joyce joined Joe in the studio for this episode. Can advice from his fellow comedian and a little motherly love fix Joe's latest fears?

<p>Danny starts the show off on a macabre note with the tale of his diabetes scare. He's turning a new leaf and has a brand new lease on life. Hopefully he won't be cashing in his Jewish get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>
<p>Our first guess was hypnotherapist Melissa Tiers. Don't worry, if you fall asleep during the broadcast, it's not because you're in treatment; practicing hypnosis over the radio is illegal. Mrs. Tiers provided valuable advice to the crew (and lord knows they need it) and explained the difference between a hypnotherapist and a stage hypnotist. One of them can't make admit you're gay.</p>
<p>Calling into the show was author and professor of linguistics, Dr. Allan Metcalf. Dr. Metcalf discussed his book "OK: The Improbable Story of America's Greatest Word" and tells us how this most common word came to be. He couldn't really provide insight into "Butterface" and "Milf", though. Danny expresses his theory that the word OK has sparked complacency in America and somehow ties in the Holocaust to the whole discussion.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty OK show.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; color: #333333;">This week, Joe is still struggling. It's a constant struggle with this guy! But at least Joe isn't so much of a Debbie Downer today. Or a Negative Nancy for that matter. The big questions for this episode are:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; color: #333333;">How much money is too much money to invest in his career? Should Joe hire a personal assistant? Is there a place Joe can hire a nerd squad to </span><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; color: #333333;">take his career to that next level? Would this make family life more enjoyable? Is this blog Socratic or what?</span></p>
<div><span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; color: #333333;"><br /></span></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Comedy Legend (or "Main Man" to make him feel less old), Dom Irrera floated into the studio on a cloud of xanax, popped some fresh scrips with Chris Iacono and Myka Fox, and waxed philosophical about his love for The Beatles, his hatred of Michael Jordan, and the extreme insecurity of fellow comedian Bobby "the pitbull" Slayton. As soon as Irrera explained what a great friend Charles Barkley is, David Kasten announced he was a jerk. <br /><br />And the winner for best weed goes to.... CHEM DOG! High Times co-founder Rick Cusick spent the last fourteen months sobering up to share tales about his ultimate pot-jam bus ride with Willie Nelson.&nbsp; Cusick also sends this message: "Hey potheads, Obama's our friend, join NORML, and daddy doesn't smoke weed anymore, honey."<br /><br />Kenny Kramer lit up the room LED style and gave everyone the reality tour behind the real Kramer from Seinfeld. When he's not selling merch for Curb, hes maxing oceanside in Los Cabos. Fascinating dude and less racist than Michael Richards, its a good thing Danny Lobell found his number after losing it in a hoarder's pile for ten years.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 730: TMI- Laughy with Raffi and Bounce with Jounce</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/Comical_Radio_TMI_731_Dec_9.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Down by the bay,<br />On the TMI show,<br />With Dan and Dan (and Justy),<br />Ok here we go...<br /><br />Greetings Bananaphone Heads and Jouncers. Do we have a show that will bring back vivid images of your childhood (if you were born after 1981.)<br /><br />Raffi (yes, THE Raffi) came into the show. He discussed his aging fanbase of "Beluga Grads" for which there is a facebook group and his recent ventures to end child exploitation. He's collaborated with the Dalai Lama and other world figures embrace his foundation devoted to the cause with his Child Honouring (Yes spelled with the "U" for the silly Americans) Foundation. Raffi's preeminence as a children's song laureate was put on display as Danny's friend Steve called into the show to seek advice as an aspiring children's singer/songwriter.<br /><br />Speaking of songwriting, Jounce also made an appearance, though their material is of the more grown up variety. Jounce, as you may or may not know, is fronted by former-Pete Danny Tamberelli of "Pete and Pete" and "All That" fame. Guitarist Matt DeStano and their manager joined him in the studio. Justy's long lived crush on Mr. Tamberelli was reveal by Danny Lobell to all of the NYC metropolitan area and beyond. Awkward is an appropriate word here. What wasn't awkward were the songs performed by the young men of Jounce, who pretty much rocked the house as well as you could with 2 acoustic guitars. One of which Raffi touched, sell that ish on eBay Danny!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Another one of Comical Radio's hosts is single again, and this time it isn't Iacono. That's right folks, our very own Myka Fox is available and playing the field. Keep your eye out for her all alone at the end of seedy bar during happy hour drinking white wine by herself and making up illnesses.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a weirder note Gawy called in and Chris abruptly questioned his poetry publishing credentials. <br /><br />The show wrapped up with a special guest visit from the one and only Charlie Murphy. He filled the crew in on some lesser known facts about his act and life, and the best ways to handle a rowdy college crowd.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Career and family, a balancing act as old as civilization. Where does one start and the other begin? Does the traveling comedian have time for both? Could a 2nd child hold&nbsp; union together or tear it apart? <br /><br />And WHERE THE FUCK is Marc Maron?<br /><br />It's all good, we got a last minute replacement plus a few lbs as a kicker. Ralphie May was nice enough to donate his morning to the show, complete with his own screaming child background music. May is a father of 2 himself and talks about how it affects his and wife's respective careers. Let's just say that making some dough through said career helps the family life thus presenting a comedic catch 22. <br /><br />Seriously life, what the fuck?</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Amber Alert! Amber Alert! Robert Kelly is near the Comical Radio Studio. No real danger it is just his new iPhone alerting us where his comedy is taking place. Now if only there was an app to protect us from Pedophile Santa. Besides stopping by to discuss his app, Kelly also talked about his show on FX Louie and ghosts of a white race only, which turned Chris a little spiritual. Along with his confession of his belief in ghosts, Chris also confided his aspirations to become a corporate comedian. Yes, folks Chris is about to put down the flannel and put on a suit and tie.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Our next guest, Annoyance Theater founder and a Second City director, Mick Napier, prefers at times to not wear any clothes at all during his comedy. An exhibitionist, Napier &nbsp;talked about the typical Naked Comedy scene. With crowds consisting of bachelorette parties, gays and reluctant boyfriends.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In true Comical Radio fashion, Kasten found the opportunity to make fun of natural disaster, when New Orleans born comedian Neal Stasney came into the studio. After moving off the topic of Hurricane Katrina, Kasten questioned whether Anne Rice was dead or alive or just pissed off about Twilight? &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The last interview was deemed the &ldquo;easiest interview ever&rdquo; by our guest Kid Rock, as Danny fondly recounted how they met without letting Rock put a word in. Kid Rock called in to talk about his new album Born Free, how his sound has developed into country. Rock revealed his old Vegas concert demands which included goldfish in bathtub and old people scooters. Oh, to live the life of a Kid Rock n Rolla.</p>]]></description>

Perhaps his love of rhyme can get him through his recent break up. Rhythm heals all wounds soulja!</p>

			<title>Ep. 723: Comical Radio: Comicism- A Cult of Snobby Interns and Comedians Desperate For Pedicures </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/Comical_Radio_Ep_727.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">The show kicked off with remembering the legendary comic actor Leslie Nielson. Which led to Kasten going in depth about OJ Simpson&rsquo;s acting career, which then led to Danny continuing to quote way too many Nielson films.<br />After reminiscencing about a restaurant in Queens built in honor of cult leader, Shri Shimrol (or was it Tri Trimrow?). The gang thought it&rsquo;d be a brilliant idea to start a religion of their own. Calling on all Comical Radio cult listeners, you too can be a member of Comicism. Just abide by the following rules:<br />-Celibacy is not encouraged, but mindless sex is.<br />-Donate $1 a day to Comical Radio.<br />-You must give a 5 star rating for Comical Radio on iTunes.<br />-Join the forums and post.</p>

But its okay as long as he is smoking a cigar and drinking a whiskey.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">It was Monday, so the interns weren&rsquo;t in to hear some good trash talking. Thankfully it was only about the ones in the way past. Kasten let out his frustration about a rich old intern who couldn&rsquo;t keep his secrets while picking at Danny&rsquo;s zits. Hiring procedures have become more strict as Chris's corporate comedy career begins.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Special Guest Judy Carter calls into the Comical Radio studio. While Chris and Kasten finish up the episode from last week, Judy schooled the boys on a few things they can do to help their respective careers, Number one: don't do comedy on Long Island. Walking away from Governor's Comedy Club is the first step in any comedians career. Second: visit www.judycarter.com or www.standup411.com and check out one of her courses. Chris seemed to get excited at the prospect of working for more than cold chicken marsala and boxed wine&nbsp; Danny called in from Pittsburg at the end of the show to let everyone know how cool Ralphie May is and to find out why he received an angry babbling message from last weeks guest, Steve Hoftsetter.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Uh oh, someone left the kids unchaperoned. That&rsquo;s right Chris and Dave were left alone to fend for themselves as Danny and Myka were off on their ventures around the US. The two forces battle the great debate of who was hotter Kelly Kapowski or Jessie Spano? The show seemed like it would go well until the end of the intro when Dave decided to start talking smack about the first guest, Danny McDermott.<br /> Danny got on the air and the match was already set between him and Kasten. Eventually the air cleared out when everyone could bond over placenta cream and Dave&rsquo;s vaginal malformation. Our next guest, Aaron Karo, had a few problems with his last name. Does it identify him as Irish, Italian or a syrup? None of these, he&rsquo;s just a Jew from Long Island with a Comedy Central special airing tonight or is it tomorrow- Damn, those bad guest notes!</p>]]></description>

<div class="field-item">
<p>Get out the nuts and bolts because we  have another installment of Fixing Joe, with Joe Matarese and Chris  Iacono sitting in for Danny Lobell.</p>
<p>The burning issue this week; Should Joe continue with therapy?</p>
<p>Moreover, is the Fixing Joe show providing more therapeutic benefit  than his actual therapy? After taking the invaluable advice of funnyman  and heckler-hunter, Bill Burr, Joe has learned to love performing again.  He's gained confidence and, most importantly, hasn't been so darn  angry. Has this radio gig rendered a psychiatric professional obsolete?  Or are his sessions truly worth the horrendous commute?</p>
<p>The guests weighing in on the subject are MadTV mistress Arden Myrin  and comedian and surviving Jim Norton cohabitant, Jim Florentine.</p>
<p>Lie back on your favorite couch (preferably not in your therapists office) and listen to find out Joe's decision!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>Welcome to another edition of Too Much Information with Dan and Dan! Danny Lobell couldn't make it today so Chris Iacono took the pilots yoke.</p>
<p>First of all, there's been complaints about co-host Dan Naturman on the forums. Some contend he's a whiney, self deprecating, dismissive human being. Let's just say this is only true on Thursdays. Otherwise he's quite pleasant. I'm telling you ladies, you'll warm up to him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the guys ain't warming up to Justy, at least not the ones who aren't comedians. Sometime tells me she'll get some favorable prospects on the forums.</p>
<p>If Justy is going to win over the lads, it won't be her TV Show/foreign language skills. Chris and Justy went toe-to-toe in Dan Naturman's "Dubbed TV Show. Let's just say Chris has an ear for badly dubbed television. How important can the dialogue be in the Sopranos anyway?</p>
<p>Finally, Dan's manager Emily Maddor (Known as Emi-Bear to the hardcore TMI fans) called into the show. She weighs in on the non-existent sexual tension between Dan and Justy and asks the question; Is there such a thing a truly platonic relationship between men and women? Dan thinks so, but it would engage in relations purely as a favor to the sexually frustrated. See forum-goers, I told you Dan is a great guy!</p>

Chris denies boyfriend points are real. Danny talks about going to Woodstock and hanging with Carlin's older brother in a cabin. Kasten talks about shitting his pants at Gun Point. Danny's manager calls into the show to call Iacono out on something. This blog is being written in short sentences that don't connect because the author is still hung over. If you find e on the street lying on my face we will have lots to talk about on Friday. Enjoy the show.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 13px; color: #222222; line-height: 19px;">Commuting into New York City, doesn&rsquo;t make Joe&rsquo;s depression any better, neither does getting fired from his job. Which brings us to Joe&rsquo;s real issue of the week, getting cut from his gig at City Steam in Hartford, CT.<br />After a few nights of fighting off a drunk bachelorette party, guidos and a few hecklers, Joe thought he was on top of his game, screaming at the audience making some great material until his mic got shut off. Thats when things got serious and now Joe needs your help. Joe doesn&rsquo;t know why he is being punished for having evil hecklers, that he could successfully fend off.<br />Calling in to lend some advice were Gary Goldman and Bill Burr. It turns out they have a lot of heckler experience. Some lessons learned were that it can be best to spit in the face of evil, bachelorette parties will play victim, some audience members are helpful and some are just always going to be miserable.<br />The question still stands though who was wrong Joe or the club?</span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the part where we usually start a show summary an onomatopoeia such as "Bam!" "Zing!" or "Pow!"</p>
<p>Well screw that. This show is handcrafted to lower your heart rate.</p>
<p>Our first guest was supposed to be comedian/30-year old virgin, Ray Gutierrez, but the crack security team was just too much for him. Maybe he got laid just so he didn't have to go on the show. Maybe he'll come on again as a bonafide lady killer. Is this the last we hear of Ray Ray? The world may never know.</p>
<p>A guest bailing might take the wind out of the sails for most shows, but no, TMI drudges on. Dan Naturman recounts tales of the third reich and how much UPenn totally owns NYU in every academic category. You might get some better roommates at NYU, though, which could significantly decrease depression.</p>
<p>Speaking of depression, comedy hero and former animated psychiatrist, Jonathan Katz called into the studio. He tells us about his early days in NY and handling life with MS. Although he's not a virgin, he also took the sex quiz originally intended for Gutierrez. Katz then attempts to guide Justy Dodge through long standing issues in her past, which apparently can be linked back to a cabin in the woods. I think psychological thrillers and/or serial killer biopics start out that way. Bang!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One cold November night four individuals in their mid-late twenties got together for an evening chat. These were not any random four people however these were four friends that have known each other for years and at least once a week over those years they would get together to check in with each other, all the while of course pursing a shared dream. So it stands to reason that these four would be sensitive to each others needs and supportive shoulders for each other to lean on. Generally speaking that might be a correct assumption but in this case we are talking about the cast of Comical Radio who have made a career out of lovingly shitting on each other and pulling no punches. Danny is Fat, Chris is a goofy Italian, Kasten is a drug addicted psychotic antisocial basement dweller and Myka is a paranoid neurotic hypochondriac with anxiety problems. We get it! But Maybe it's deeper than that, maybe just maybe these are the four most maladjusted unsupportive unsympathetic people to ever pull off a consistently listened to show with any kind of longevity. Perhaps it's an entire show of Artie Langs and the audience is just tuning in with baited breath each week to see who will break down the fastest or the hardest. It is possible that that question was answered today when Myka left mid-show during the commercial break to goto the hospital because she was uncontrollably shaking. Was it psychosomatic? Is she really dieing? Will the Comical Crew have sympathy if she does or are they all truly assholes? Perhaps the better question is how many boyfriend points will Chris accumulate for wearing the proper suit to the funeral! I guess you will just have to stay tuned to find out more.One cold November night four individuals in their mid-late twenties got together for an evening chat.

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>Time out, young and old listeners! Today in the studio we had a crash course on dumb college kids, dead culture of New York, pulling pranks and loving your daddy.<br /> First up we had Greg Proops, a comedian concerned with his college audiences, who could never quite leave Harry Potter after age twelve. He also talked about the disaster that is technology and thats when it was discovered that Chris is only allowed to attend parties through the internet.<br /> Ben Stein, Eugene Levy- No - Michael Musto stopped by the studio and discussed his many mistaken identities, favorite gays, and Broadway shows. He shared stories from the good old days of a grimier New York City when the Studio 54 made sure the likes of Danny and Chris were not allowed into clubs. The crew wanted to help fulfill gay intern Thomas's fantasy by setting him and Musto up on a date, but sadly Musto wasn't ready to take the chance.<br /> Everyone was on the edge of their seats when professional pranker and founder of Improv Everywhere, Charlie Todd stopped by. He shared prank stories, from pretending to be Ben Folds to making a small band believe they actually had fans and many more. All these stories made Myka theorize that Improv Everywhere has caused mass suicide. Realizing that Todd had taught at UCB, Danny once again tried desperately to continue on from level 3 instead of level 2. After being denied he thought about suicide and then decided to prank his way into the class!<br /> Our last guest, comedian storyteller, Kambri Crews, came by to tell us about her life post Comix. She discussed her love for her very gay husband Christian (which made Chris break out into song and dance). While Crews talked about the Big Brother program, she inspired the Hosts of Comical Radio to volunteer, do their part for the community and start hiring twelve year old interns from the program. Crews also shared what it is like to have a relationship with a father in prison. Its a lovely one!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/Comical_Radio_TMI_11_4.MP3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>TMI is back and knocking on your door. Hello, can we come in? Fantastic. Don't mind us, we'll just crash on the couch. It's like we're not even here, except for the loud banter, sexual innuendos and running up your phone bill prank calling people with the last name Madoff. We understand if this is just too much information to take in.</p>
<p>First Danny Lobell recounts his miserable tale of his craiglist gig going door to door for a local politician. Ah, woe is Danny, his mother dear.</p>
<p>Well things get better as evidenced by an uplifting phone call about the road life of a bombing comic with comedian-turned-character actor, Fred Stoller. Thrillseeker Fred gives us life lessons about keeping the toxic people out of your life. Toxic, toxic people.</p>
<p>Keeping with the telephonic theme, the TMI introduced the 2nd installment of the "Dial-A-Madoff" series. Lets just say this bit is dive-bombing like a peregrine falcon, but we're enjoying the ride. Just know, Madoff surname, you haven't heard the last of TMI!</p>
<p>Our 2nd guest, Alison Arngrim of "Little House On The Prairie" fame, was nice enough to call in. Alison discusses her new book, Confessions of a Prairie Bitch, and life after Nellie Oleson. When she's not fending off Nellie fetish freaks, she's honing her french and contributing to AIDS and sexual abuse causes. Really comedic stuff. But the highlight has to be fulfilling Dan Naturman's childhood dream of being verbally humiliated by Nellie. Boy is it degrading.</p>
<p>The show caps off with Dan clearly (perhaps understandingly) avoiding and/or dismissing Justy's myriad of issues. Oh yeah and a final onslaught of Madoff fishing. If these people only had our telecommunication skills. Oh Madoff, where art thou?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We hate Mondays, but that&rsquo;s ok because it&rsquo;s Thursday and time for another edition of TMI. See, being late can be a good thing. Just ask Danny Lobell who was late for a movie date with co-host Dan Naturman. His punctuality was sacrificed for the welfare of Juanito the rooster who was graciously (a.k.a. hastily) donated (a.k.a. drop and run) to a local farm. Thankfully, Danny no longer has &ldquo;cock&rdquo; issues. Don&rsquo;t worry, the crew wasn&rsquo;t talking cock the whole time, vagina was also a hot topic. Apparently every (poorly imitated) comedian of the past and present finds TMI cohost, Justy Dodge, to have the most abhorrently repulsive comedic cooch this side of Lisa Lampinelli. Except for Gilbert Godfrey who really has no opinion one way or another. Just in time to pull our show out of the gutter, Garfield creator Jim Davis helped bring out what&rsquo;s left of the family-friendly side of TMI. Well, with the exception of a quick holocaust reference, of course. Mr. Davis told us about his Mid-western upbringing and how he straight-up punked Bill Murray. What he couldn&rsquo;t tell us was why Garfield hated Mondays despite being a cat with no job. Following Jim was the first installment of Dial-A-Madoff, which frankly wasn&rsquo;t a success, but hilarity still found a way to ensue. Stick around for round 2. Lastly, joining us in the studio was musician/comic, Henry Phillips. Phillips also starred and co-wrote his new film &ldquo;Punching the Clown.&rdquo; Phillips discusses the shady Hollywood themes exhibited in this semi-autobiographical film about a struggling musician/comedian. Oh yeah, and there were helpful tips about the best free bathrooms around and how to weasel your way into them. Just so you know, threatening to defecate on yourself in public is not a good game plan. It will definitely ruin your Monday.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Shabibiaabooom! Comical Radio in your face. What do you get when you cross an Italian and an ogre? Myka Fox. I know that makes no sense but listen to the show and you can figure it out for yourself. The crew discussed Myka&rsquo;s trip into the Forrest Larping as a sexy rouge elf. Danny came in with Food poisoning and was off on his timing when he told the story of how chickens are modern day Jews in oppression. Then the crew reminisced about their trip up to Gloversville one winter and how they all almost died. Danny&rsquo;s manager Patrick from Cringe Humor called in to promote the Roast of Jim Florentine and get chewed out by a tornado vampire Jew. To wrap things up Chris read from the forums and the iTunes comments and discussed why he thinks Keith and the girl are idiots for attacking Danny on their show. And that was it folks Tune in Thursday when Garfeild creator Jim Davis calls into &ldquo;Too Much Information with Dan and Dan&rdquo;.</p>]]></description>

Matt discussed studying improv under the late, great Del Close and how Steve Martin and Andy Kaufman. Still more was discussed concerning Besser's cut of UCB, reparations for Amy Poehler's success and Danny's futile attempts to pick up UCB classes where he left off... 6 years ago. Oh and parties, my god, the parties. Passing out at one of these shindigs can be neatly improvised as simply falling asleep. In all, it was probably the worst Besser interview of all time. We at comical radio are always striving for the record books.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Next up was a fistful of awkward via telephone with the gentlemen of Magic Hugs (Scott Blair and Tim Wilkerson.) Outside the hilarious video this duo produces let's just say common interests were sorely lacking. But hey, that makes for some good radio.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Completing the UCB double-dip was Chris Hines, the veteran imrpov instructer at UCB theater. Once again Danny tries to bargain his way back into UCB Theater to no avail, but there's no harm in trying. Maybe because he's a dastardly stand-up comic who has no right to ride the coattails of fine improvisational actors. Kasten might have a shot, though, with his best pedophiliscious Santa Claus.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Live in the studio was up and coming music act, Swear and Shake. These serenading sweethearts warmed the studio with their folk-pop prowess, despite Kasten's Simon Cowell-esque disposition.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Lastly was a phone call from Steve Rannazzisi of FX's "The League." Unfortunately, due to time constraints the interview was shorter than his tongue-twisting last name. Steve still had time to assure us the listeners that The League is not as much for football fans as it for those who just really hate their friends. But when your friends are A-Holes, just improvise.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 706: Comical Radio- Sexy Time With Dan and Dan. (...and Justy)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/Sexy_Time_With_Dan_and_Dan.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>Oh what's in a name? Not a whole lot apparently. The debate rages on over the title of our wonderful new radio show featuring Danny Lobell, Dan Naturman and Justy Dodge. Too Much Information with Dan and Dan has been deemed the victor, but has Justy been left in the Dusty? Stay tuned for further updates.</p>
<p>So, penises. No, we're not just trying to get google hits, penis size (and how it correlates to race) was an actual item of discussion.The white man may wiki, but African-American rumor has is Dan is packin'. Yes, it's about time to move on. Next!</p>
<p>Eric the Intern made a brief appearance, weighed in on the naming issue and tipped the scales. Suffice it to say, his internship adviser will not be pleased with the less than professional environment.</p>
<p>The first (real) guest was a call in from D-Nat's very own manager, Emily Meador of Chair 2 Productions. Emily and the crew discuss the finer points of using the feminine mystique (a.k.a. boobs) to reel in the gigs for her clients. Frankly, regardless of the success rate, Dan is pleased with the effort. Whatever brings the money, honey.</p>
<p>As an expert in television of yesteryear, Naturman ran down his list of top 5 all-time of TV theme songs. A riveting list of jingles and jams. What was #1 you ask? Well you'll just have to listen.</p>
<p>Lastly, (web)TV Host and comedian, Ray Ellin gave the show a ring. Family friendly host with the most? Or a down-right Playa McPimpsalot? You could decide, but Danny already has. According to D-Lo, Ellin is quite the ladykiller. But who are we to judge?</p>
<p>Hell, who are we kidding? If you listen, then judge 'til your heart's content.</p>

Myka spent a day in the ER and tried to convince a team of impatient specialists that the sounds coming out of her chest were abnormal. The crack team at the Comical Radio Studio's have determined that Myka has 6 months to live, and 3 months to learn how to dance.</p>]]></description>

<p>Oh my god. Oh my god, what does it mean? Tell me. Too much. I don&rsquo;t know what it means. Oh my god it&rsquo;s so intense. Oh. Oh. Oh my god.</p>
<p>Right in Comical Radio's backyard, Bear Vasquez, the double rainbow guy, called in and revealed mystical truths about his reluctance to sell advertising on his famous youtube video, his connection with the Spirit, and his Mormon harem of BDSM women. If you ask questions like these, you'll never understand.</p>
<p>Prodigal guest Micah Sherman finally makes it in for his first appearance on Comical. Rise of the Radio Show fans may recognize him as Myka's boyfriend on the "Look Who's Not Talking" episode, others may recognize him as Paul Giamatti's voice twin, and David Kasten may not remember him at all.</p>
<p>Star Trek commander Harry Terjanian, requesting permission to come aboard the Star Ship Enterprise! Harry weighs in on basement living, comedy's prejudice against the fat community, and where Armenia is on the map.</p>

			<title>Ep. 703: TMI- Dan Loves The 80's More Than You Do!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/Dan_Loves_The_80s_More_Than_You_Do.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This was the very first episode of Too Much Information with Dan, Dan and Justy. We started off with a &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who in the Cast&rdquo; segment where we got to know the crew &ndash; Dan Lobell, Dan Naturman and Justy Dodge. Dan L.&rsquo;s problem with obesity was discussed, as well as Justy&rsquo;s problems with bipolar disorder and cutting as well as Dan N&rsquo;s feelings of failure and the fact that before a recent tryst in Montreal, he went four years without sex. Dan mentioned that he doesn&rsquo;t find female stand up comics sexy because he feels stand up is a masculine and aggressive art form. Comic Dov Davidoff weighed in by telephone expressing his agreement with Dan in principal on this point, though taking a slightly less severe stand. The gang then did a Top 10 TV Theme Songs of all time countdown. Actually, they only counted down from 10 t o 6, promising to do the top five next week. 10 through 6 were, in descending order, the themes from &ldquo;Making it&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Dukes of Hazzard&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hill Street Blues&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mary Tyler Moore&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Partridge Family.&rdquo; Great songs all, and the top 5 promises to be kick ass. All in all, a good first show.</p>]]></description>

			<title>The Famous Lennon/Lobell Recording Session</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/comicalradio/The_Famous_Lennon_Lobell_Recording_S.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 13px; color: #222222; line-height: 19px;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Today Danny Lobell's wet dreams came true. Sean Lennon graced us with his presence in the studio, and even admitted that we have some nice chairs. Granted, we stole very special chairs for this occasion, but what great success!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Dan Naturman stepped in for Chris Iacono today because Chris is out on a very important drugscapade in the midwest. Dan was an appropriate replacement because he and Chris have a lot in common. They both wear brown, they both act Jewish, they are both male as far as the eye can see, and they both didn't get any action until their mid-twenties.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">As soon as Chris left, Fabulous Genius Myka deemed it time to return to us. Welcome back!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Kevin Bartini breached a very controversial subject by saying he loves his wife so much that he wants her to cheat on him. Kevin is definitely an ugly son of a bitch, but he has a heart of gold. Intern Allison then tediously explained why girls love gay guys, a longtime source of confusion for straight men everywhere.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">A very brief but sincere friendship blossomed today between Lennon and Lobell. Lennon opened up about falling in love with a pencil in the 7th grade, and even beatboxed while Danny gave renditions of Lennon classics.<br />A few Lennon facts:<br />- He once wrote a song in French in a dream<br />- He is upset over the recall of Pluto's planet status<br />- He recommends taking a long walk in the park<br />- He loves his mom<br />- He can levitate</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">And, as usual, at least three people at Comical Radio were wearing the exact same hat. A very successful day indeed, although we forgot to ask Sean Lennon for $50,000 so Danny could get off food stamps. Hey Sean, is it too late?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>THIS JUST IN:<br /> Illegal baby bartering at Walmart proves that white trash babies are more valuable than any other babies. Except for slave babies, who will give you a lifetime of benefits. If you want a useless meth baby, however, just go to Walmart and look for the drugged out mullet champ holding a $25 dollar baby. Can you say rollback?</p>
<p>Katy Olson's babies are soon to be famous for inventing the breast bong. Milk in shot form is the best kind of milk. Other than tittie milk. An unbeatable combination!</p>
<p>Today Danny Lobell continued to amaze the universe with his idiocy. "Commence" does not mean "to end". I might be getting ahead of myself here, but I THINK it means the opposite...can we get confirmation?</p>
<p>Then Chris Iacono's hateful existence reached new heights. He hates hard tacos. Michael Ian Black, our call-in guest, was so offended by this that he hung up. A dial tone is truly the best reaction to this blasphemy.</p>
<p>Michael Ian Black hides his career from his children. Because if they find out what he does, they'll probably also find out about his other, far superior, secret family.</p>
<p>Why on earth did Jordon Ferber get a B.A. in liberal arts? It doesn't matter because his girlfriend is a solid ten. Black models and short pocket Jews can have true love, somehow. Lucky bastard.</p>
<p>As usual, Chris tried to prove to someone (is anyone listening?) that he can get hot chicks too. Intern Allison was forced to go into the studio to crush his daydreams. Also known as lies.</p>

<div class="field-item">
<p>Danny Lobell's backyard chicken, who never used to make a peep, now screams at all hours because Chris Iacono couldn't keep his drunken hands off her. The underlying logic: better to betray fowl than lose your cred at the Coney Island Nathan's Hot Dogs.</p>
<p>Pablo Francisco came in from a world tour fueled by you tube exposure, Danny bestows his highest (paraphrased) compliment: "I don't really care for Robin Williams' stand up, but you are the best person to watch live because you are the closest a person can get to watching Robin Williams."</p>
<p>Mad TV's Anjelah Johnson also came into the studio creating a double header of Latin Sound Machines. She narrowly escaped Danny's advances and nearly convinced Pablo that they had met before.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item">
<p>One day you are smoking Snoop Dog's weed, the next day you need an Israeli guy to protect you in the recording studio. Welcome back, Comical Radio!</p>
<p>Double dose of the Carlin Call-in today. First up, Pat, George Carlin's older brother. Danny and the crew forced him to speak in a Popeye voice (to be fair, Pat thought he was just being dogger, then he reminisced about the old days when the brother's stole wallets from a department store and discovered the ultimate theft of the magi, nothing to put in the wallet unless you sell it, then no where to put the money once it is sold.</p>
<p>Kelly, George Carlin's daughter, called in next and extended her services as a life-coach the Comical Crew. Once it was all sorted out, the results were damning: anyone who needs a life coach actually just needs rehab. The problem is, once everyone is off drugs and alcohol, what are they to do with their lives? I smell a need for a life coach yet!</p>
<p>Tom Leopold, writer for Seinfeld, Cheers, and some bigger shows came in to the studio with a tasty travel tip: The best chicken salad can be found at the snack bar at the Holocaust Museum. Don't doubt Leopold's opinions for a second, he learned to masturbate by humping Playboys on the ground and is convinced that Chevy Chase is not a jerk.</p>
<p>Ian Bagg came in fresh off a glamorous subway ride where he attempted to keep his opinions about Bruce Springsteen to himself. It wouldn't be proper coming from a member of the Canadian Alliance, an outfit that unites Bagg with fellow Maple Leaf Comedians. Here are Ian's paraphrased opinions of fellow Canadians Harland Williams and Jim Carrey.</p>
<p>Jim Carey: "Me, Myself and Irene" was a great movie that highlights the downturn of Rene Zellweger's appeal.</p>
<p>Harland Williams: Is a bucket full of golf balls</p>
<p>Dylan Gadino called in with the Punchline Update, here's the synthesized news: Blue Collar Comedy should be called Hillbilly Comedy.</p>
<p>And that was the show. Stay tuned for future cries for help and acknowledgments of grandeur.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">If all comedians are spazzy degenerates, nerdy cripples, autistic wonderkinds, and homeless, and Chris Iacono is a comedian, why is it that Chris feels he has the right is impose a conduct code on comedy club waitresses?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Because one of them didn't want to sleep with him.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">She did, however, want to lead him on while she simultaneously and secretively lead on Chris's friend who is paralleled in comedian loserdom (Jamie "Mad Dog" Mattern). Sorry, Jesus Freak Comedy Club Waitress (god bless), but if you want to dry-hump identical low-lifes, you are going to have to do it out in the open. I said good day, sir!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hey, Dylan Gadino from Punchline Magazine (.com), what's the update?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">Kat Williams was arrested (again) for burglarizing the home that was serving as the set of the movie he was filming. He was caught with his hands full of $3,000 worth of gold coins. So sad... I know he loves money but I would think Scrooge McDuck would be above renting his house to film studios for side cash.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; font-family: helvetica; border-width: 0px; padding: 0px;">George Carlin! George Carlin is posthumously coming out with a new book, "Last Words." Daughter Kelly Carlin surprised Danny and the crew by calling in with details about the book and life with her dad. As the daughter of a comedy icon, Kelly was allowed to use the seven dirty words around the house, but surprisingly was not introduced to many great comedians because George was an introvert and didn't really hang out. Shit Piss Fuck Cunt Cocksucker Motherfucker Tits.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 13px; color: #222222; line-height: 19px;">Godfrey stuck around for the next guest calling in, Charlie Murphy, who said he had been spending the last few months digging through his crates for audio of jokes he has told and really liked. He said he plans to cut them together to create a comedy album, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Digging Through the Crates.&acirc;&euro; Murphy defended himself as Danny attempted to incite an argument, accusing Eddie Murphy of not helping Charlie the way that Chris Rock helps Tony.<br />Murphy said he preferred to have gotten his break from Chappelle and that it garnered him more respect, respect he apparently could not gain from covering himself in chains and rings at a Gotham Comedy Club show. Lessons were learned, and then Murphy creepily vowed to remain friends with Chappelle whether or not his friendship was welcome, much like Danny and the crew remain friends with the comedians on the show.</span></p>]]></description>
