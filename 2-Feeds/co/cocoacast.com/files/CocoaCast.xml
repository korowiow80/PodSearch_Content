    <itunes:subtitle>Starting Point for Cocoa Developers</itunes:subtitle>
    <itunes:summary>Starting with Episode 33 offered in Apple TV HD format. A Podcast for people who want to learn Cocoa, Objective-C, share their experience and resources. I would like to introduce myself and tell you what this Podcast is all about. Also, I would like to invite you to join me in learning Cocoa and Objective-C. If you have been trying to learn Cocoa and Objective-C look no further. I do not claim to be an expert in neither Cocoa nor Objective-C however I want to master both and I hope many of you do too. This Podcast will be a starting point for learning Cocoa and a central place for tips, tricks, user discussions, and much more. </itunes:summary>

      <title>Episode 46 - Properties in Objective-C 2.0</title>
      <link>http://www.cocoacast.com/?q=node/135</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cocoacast.meshsys.com/?q=node/135"><img ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10" alt="Multithreading" src="http://www.cocoacast.com/images/episode46.jpg" width="120" height="120" class="pic"/></a>In this <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/cocoacast/ccp_episode46.mov" rel="self">Episode</a> we look at Properties in Cocoa. Properties have only appeared in Objective-C recently, with the 2.0 release. They are kind of virtual member variables. If you think about it, there are only two things you can do to a variable: assign a value and extract a value. You can make variable a constant to prevent it from being set, or hide it by making it private or protected, but in no way does setting a member variable’s value affect the behavior of an object. Properties do not have to do that but they can. In Object Oriented Languages, member variables describe the state of an object, while functions (methods, messages) describe its behavior. Properties allow us to morph together the state and the behavior. An overview of the subject can be found in <a href="http://www.cocoacast.com/?q=node/103"><b>Properties in Objective-C 2.0</b></a>.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We finally feel strong enough to deviate from the Textbook and cover more advanced topics. We introduced two advanced topics in this episode -- Advanced Bindings with multiple Array Controllers and Core Data. We showed how to create an application with multiple windows (a window and drawer) and connect multiple NSArrayControllers. Finally, RaiseMan application is replicated with Core Data and zero lines of code.

      <link>http://www.cocoacast.com/?q=node/15</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this podcast we will finish our discussion of Chapter 3 of Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X. The main discussion of this podcast is about memory management. We will briefly review C-style memory management, garbage collection, and reference counting. We also will talk in details about autoreleased objects and memory pools.  In addition, we will talk about NSCalendarDate and Custom Initializers. The discussion will be finished with Demos of NSCalendarDate, Custom Initializers, and the Debugger. I will show how to set up a break point in your code and beefy demo the power of the Fix and Continue feature of Xcode.  In this podcast the first challenge would be discussed the solution would be posted on the next podcast.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[This podcast will cover the Introduction to Objective-C as described in Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X by Aaron Hillegass. This is the first part of the podcast that covers the chapter 3. There a lot of things I needed to say about Objective-C and even while trying to make it as short as possible I was still unable to fit within 30 minutes. I have already recorded most of the 2nd part of this chapter podcast so in a few days expect to see the conclusion. Topics covered today include Foundation tool, Memory management, and some basic Foundation classes.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[This is a first screencast that covers Chapter 2 of Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X (second edition) book. We will talk about Apple Developer Tools including Xcode and Interface Builder. We will cover topics like code editing in Xcode, basic preferences, getting around in Xcode and editing modes. Then we will talk about Interface Builder and give an example of simple application that was build entirely in Interface Builder. The main demo of the day is a Cocoa application given as an example in Chapter 2 of the textbook.]]></description>

      <title>Episode 2 - History of Cocoa and Objective-C</title>
      <link>http://www.cocoacast.com/?q=node/12</link>
      <description><![CDATA[This podcast is all about History of Cocoa and Objective-C. Cocoa was invented long time ago. Even though its the name has changed recently, it is still a revolutionary while still in process of refinement.  Objective-C is the main language which drives the success of Cocoa.  We will talk about NeXT, NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and other historical landmarks in Cocoa evolution.  I will share some thoughts on the subject of why Cocoa and Objective-C are preferred combination for MacOS X programming.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[This Podcast is meant to serve two purposes: introduction and invitation. First, I would like to introduce myself and tell you what this Podcast is all about. Second, I would like to invite you to join me in learning Cocoa and Objective-C. If you have been trying to learn Cocoa and Objective-C look no further. I do not claim to be an expert in neither Cocoa nor Objective-C, however, I want to master both, and I hope many of you do too. This Podcast will be a starting point for learning Cocoa and a central place for tips, tricks, user discussions, and much more. ]]></description>
