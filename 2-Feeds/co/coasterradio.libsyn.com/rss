<p>Heck, they even test the courage of the bravest podcast hosts!</p>
<p>On this week's show, Mike and EB talk about what the listeners say are the most extreme rides on earth.&nbsp; To make things easier, they break up the conversation into three sections - extreme roller coasters, extreme water slides and extreme flat rides.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've spent the past two shows going over every details of our California Trip that included visits to Disneyland and Disney California Adventure.</p>
<p>But even with two whole hours devoted to both parks, there were things we missed.</p>
<p>AND... the CoasterRadio.com audience was quick to remind us of the things we forgot to talk about.</p>
<p>PLUS, there were some things that we said about the Disney's West Coast parks that upset some of our listeners.&nbsp; So, they sent strongly worded e-mails to let us know how they felt.</p>

But even with two whole hours devoted to both parks, there were things we missed.
AND... the CoasterRadio.com audience was quick to remind us of the things we forgot to talk about.
PLUS, there were some things that we said about the Disney's West Coast parks that upset some of our listeners.&nbsp; So, they sent strongly worded e-mails to let us know how they felt.

<p><i>When you first look at it, it does sound a little bit strange... you know, an entire radio show dedicated to roller coasters and theme parks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;But there are shows dedicated to all types of things, like sports.&nbsp; People talk for hours and hours about sports... why not talk for hours and hours about theme parks?"</i></p>
<p>This is what I said on the very first episode of our show to explain what CoasterRadio.com set out to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We wanted to create a fun, accessible show about theme parks and thrill rides that was for the average fan... but could also be enjoyed by even the most hardcore enthusiast.</p>
<p>Back in 2005, I don't think anyone (including us) expected the show to go past 20 episodes.</p>
<p>Now, here we are seven years later celebrating the 200th!</p>
<p>On this week's show, we take a look back at favorite moments from the past 199 episodes and hear from each of the "Joint Chiefs" who were a part of the show back in 2005.&nbsp; Mario, Flava and Greg K. return to talk about their thoughts on this milestone.</p>
<p>Also, since our listeners are the heart and soul of CoasterRadio.com... it's fitting that we celebrate by&nbsp; having our annual "Listener Question Show" this week.</p>
<p>As per tradition, the questions are all over the map!&nbsp; Some are about theme parks and thrill rides, others are about pop culture and some are about Mike, EB and the podcast itself.</p>
<p>We also unveil some big news about the upcoming West Coast trip and count down the days to the entry deadline for the <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2012/01/reel-design-contest-returns.html" target="_blank"><b>"Reel" Design Contest!</b></a></p>
<p>Thanks to each of you for listening and participating in the show. We say it several time this week, because it's the truth - you guys <i><b>are</b></i> the show... and we're thankful that you're here.<b><br /> </b></p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Here at Coaster Radio, we're big fans of the Variety Specials they used to have on TV awhile back.  Before there were hundreds of lame reality shows and other filler, television networks used to produce special programs (especially around the holidays) that featured different kinds of entertainment and segments.  This week, we're going to try to do the same thing with our 2011 Holiday Spectacular!  This week's episode is jam-packed with fun stuff like:  * A live call from Main Street USA at the Magic Kingdom from one of the show's newest correspondants. * Live trip reports from Christmas Town at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, a Holiday Fair at Hyde Park in&nbsp; London and a roller coaster ride at Gulliover's World, Warrington, UK. * A "Holiday Kid Call" from "Hagrid Claus" and "Shapiro the Elf" to two lucky children. * A dramatic (and sound effects filled) reading of "A CoasterBoy Christmas" * Interactive calls from CoasterRadio.com listeners * Music and Mayhem, plus a whole lot more!
We're so thankful that you listen to the show week after week and have made us a part of your lives.&nbsp; We wish you and your families a Happy New Year!  Happy Holidays!]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster-radio-com-609-a-lost-episode-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The guys had planned on producing a regular show this week, but Mike came down with a pretty bad case of the flu.</p>
<p>So, after some thought, they decided to enlist the help of Clint Novak from <a href="http://www.coastercrew.net/" target="_blank"><b>The Coaster Crew</b></a> and dig out an episode of the show that has never been heard on our podcast feed before!</p>
<p>Let me explain....</p>
<p>Back in 2007, after Coaster Radio 1.0 had gone off the air, Mike, Flava and Mario formed a team to compete in the first ever "Single Riders Marathon" at Kennywood Park.</p>
<p>Now, the marathon had nothing to do with being single.&nbsp; Instead, it meant that each marathon rider would fill an empty seat on a coaster and complete as many laps as possible during the day.</p>
<p>People would then pledge a certain amount of money for every coaster lap counted.</p>
<p>As part of this event, Flava , Mario and Mike produced an episode of "The Coaster Crew's Guide to the Midway" on-location at the park.</p>
<p>We thought this show was lost forever, but Will Holder was able to dig it up out of the archives this week!</p>
<p>So, since Mike is sick, we decided to play this show for the first time ever on OUR podcast.</p>
<p>For all of you who have missed Flava and Mario... this one's for you.</p>

<p>That's right! In recent years, it has become home to some of the most outrageous and intensely thrilling attractions in Europe!</p>
<p>Join Mike and EB and they talk about some of the Prater's most iconic attractions - the roller coasters, Ghost Houses, water rides and gravity defying flat rides.&nbsp; There might even be some on-ride audio from one of the oldest attractions in the park!</p>
<p>&nbsp;They'll also talk about how The Prater is run much differently than your average amusement park and howit's full of attractions not seen many other places.</p>
<p>Be sure to come back next week for the premiere of a video podcast showing off all of the rides that the guys discussed on this week's show!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has made this season of CoasterRadio.com the most successful ever! We can't wait for Season Six to begin in October!</p>]]></description>

That's right! In recent years, it has become home to some of the most outrageous and intensely thrilling attractions in Europe!
Join Mike and EB and they talk about some of the Prater's most iconic attractions - the roller coasters, Ghost Houses, water rides and gravity defying flat rides.&nbsp; There might even be some on-ride audio from one of the oldest attractions in the park!
&nbsp;They'll also talk about how The Prater is run much differently than your average amusement park and howit's full of attractions not seen many other places.
Be sure to come back next week for the premiere of a video podcast showing off all of the rides that the guys discussed on this week's show!
Thanks to everyone who has made this season of CoasterRadio.com the most successful ever! We can't wait for Season Six to begin in October!]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster-radio-com-535-our-new-voiceover-artist-nph-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>For each individual season of Coaster Radio, EB and Mike like to have something called a "story arc."</p>
<p>Basically, it's a common theme and storyline that can carry over throughout an entire season of the show.</p>
<p>For season four, we followed Mike as he prepared for and ultimately triumphed at <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2010/06/my-american-idol-experience-review-and.html"><b>The American Idol Experience</b></a> at Disney's Hollywood Studios.</p>
<p>But in Season Five, the guys&nbsp; unveiled their most ambitious "story arch" ever - <a href="http://rradio.com/2011/02/what-is-neil-patrick-harris-project.html"><b>The Neil Patrick Harris Project.</b></a></p>
<p>EB and Mike wanted to have a major celebrity (who happened to love theme parks) agree to become the voiceover artist that introduces each episode of the show.</p>
<p>They locked on film, television and stage star <a href="http://www.twitter.com/actuallynph"><b>Neil Patrick Harris</b></a>, who turned out to be a listener of the show already!</p>
<p>This week, after ten months of <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2011/04/day-at-park-with-neil-contest-winner.html"><b>wacky contests</b></a>, <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2010/12/coasterradiocom-510-tower-of-treats.html"><b>Towers of Treats</b></a> and <a href="http://www.themeparkchange.com/"><b>major charity events</b></a>, Neil is ready to announce whether he will become a part of the <i><b>Original Theme Park Podcast!</b></i></p>
<p>We also welcome back an old friend, <a href="http://themeparks.about.com/"><b>Arthur Levine</b></a> - the theme parks guide at about.com!</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[For each individual season of Coaster Radio, EB and Mike like to have something called a "story arc."
Basically, it's a common theme and storyline that can carry over throughout an entire season of the show.
For season four, we followed Mike as he prepared for and ultimately triumphed at The American Idol Experience at Disney's Hollywood Studios.
But in Season Five, the guys&nbsp; unveiled their most ambitious "story arch" ever - The Neil Patrick Harris Project.
EB and Mike wanted to have a major celebrity (who happened to love theme parks) agree to become the voiceover artist that introduces each episode of the show.
They locked on film, television and stage star Neil Patrick Harris, who turned out to be a listener of the show already!
This week, after ten months of wacky contests, Towers of Treats and major charity events, Neil is ready to announce whether he will become a part of the Original Theme Park Podcast!
We also welcome back an old friend, Arthur Levine - the theme parks guide at about.com!
Arthur recently had a chance to ride Star Tours: The Adventures Continue at Disneyland and The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure at Disney California Adventure.
He'll tell Mike and EB which ride made it to his list of Top Theme Park Attractions and which ride gave him a slight case of anticipointment.
We'll also hear from the CoasterRadio.com audience as they talk about their favorite water rides.&nbsp; Which wet and wild rides are the best in the country?&nbsp; The listeners have the scoop!
We'll also have a Live Trip Report from Dinosaurs Alive! at Kings Island and Mike will tell you about his upcoming trip to Hungary to ride one of the oldest coasters in the world!]]></itunes:subtitle>

<p>Each year, EB risks life and limb so that he can bring our wireless microphones as close as possible to the flames, sparks and explosions.</p>

<p>We also delve into the world of roller coaster enthusiast clubs.&nbsp; What are some of the reasons people join?&nbsp; Are there any drawbacks?&nbsp; What about the recent trend of several clubs "hating" on one another.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, the very best ideas for this crazy show of ours come from the listeners.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we were doing a show about "The Best Money You've Spent at a Park" and we received a call from <a href="http://www.deidrerodman.com/main/"><b>Deidre Rodman</b></a> from <a href="http://www.biddiesmusic.com/"><b>The Lascivious Biddies</b></a>.</p>
<p>She said the best money she spent was when she and her husband bought the "Bride and Groom" Mickey Ears to wear during their recent honeymoon at Walt Disney World.</p>
<p>She said that throughout the trip, they were given free food, free gifts and other special treatment from the cast members at Disney.</p>
<p>When EB and I heard this, we hatched an evil plan.&nbsp; We asked our listening audience for two volunteers who would go to Walt Disney World and pretend to be honeymooners (complete with the Mickey Ears) to test this theory.</p>
<p>Derek and Trisha from Southern California answered the call and what followed was <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>"The Trip of Lies!"</b></span></i></p>
<p>On this week's show, we hear about their trip and find out if the hypothesis was true.&nbsp; Do you get tons of free stuff just for wearing "Bride and Groom" Mickey Ears?</p>
<p>Plus, Derek and Trisha give us the scoop on the rest of their trip, including a review of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal's Islands of Adventure.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's show is so full of Coaster Radio goodness, it's almost enough for three whole shows!</p>
<p>There's so much going on, it's hard to decide where to begin!</p>
<p>How about we start with naming a winner in the <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2011/02/day-at-park-with-neil-contest.html"><strong>"Day at the Park with Neil"</strong></a> Contest!&nbsp; NPH is no stranger to winning awards.&nbsp; So, it's fitting that <em><strong>he calls in</strong></em> to crown a winner in our latest contest.</p>
<p>Mike and EB were absolutely floored by the results.&nbsp; Let's just say, NPH picked a darkhorse entry!</p>
<p>Next, after months in the planning stages, it's finally time to officially kick off our worldwide charity event -&nbsp; <a href="http://www.themeparkchange.com/"><strong>"Theme Park Change!"</strong></a></p>
<p>The goal is to encourage theme park fans across the globe to give up one thing from the upcoming theme park season and donate the cost of that item to a worthy charity.</p>
<p>All of the proceeds from this year's event is going to an amazing organization, <a href="http://www.projectangelfood.com/"><strong>Project Angel Food.</strong></a>&nbsp; To learn more about them, the guys are joined by Margaret Steele, Project Angel Food's CEO.</p>
<p>One you hear her interview, there won't be a question on whether or not you'll want to donate.&nbsp; The good work this group does will make you want to reach for your wallet and join in the "Theme Park Change."</p>
<p>Please, check out the website! Anyone who donates $10 or more is automatically entered into a raffle where they can win one of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/"><strong>dozens of excellent theme park prizes!</strong></a></p>
<p>And of course, we appease the CoasterBoys in our audience with some good, interactive theme park talk!</p>
<p>This week, we talk about specific things missing from your specific home park.</p>
<p>CoasterRadio.com listeners from across the world have chimed in to let us know what rides, attractions and other aspects are missing from their local theme parks.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <em><strong>Tower of Terror</strong></em> at Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios is one of my favorite theme park attractions anywhere.</p>
<p>I love it so much, that I totally don't mind waiting in line for  it.&nbsp; Just being around the spooky ambiance is a thrill almost on par  with the big drop that is to come.</p>
<p>When the ride is though and I've checked out my on-ride photo and  am exiting through the gift shop, I sometimes wish that I could just  hang out there for awhile... almost as if I were a guest.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out you can make this happen.&nbsp; You can even have a romantic dinner just steps away from the ride's entrance.</p>
<p>On this week's show, we're joined by someone who <a href="http://disneytravelbabble.com/disney-weddings/our-wedding/tot-anniversary-party/"><strong>made this dream a reality.</strong></a></p>
<p>Carrie Hayward is the host of <a href="http://www.insidedisneyweddings.com/"><strong>&ldquo;Inside Disney Weddings&rdquo;</strong></a> and the author of PassPorter's <a href="http://passporter.com/weddings.asp"><strong>&ldquo;Disney Weddings &amp; Honeymoons.&rdquo;</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrie  knows everything there is to know about the wonderful world of Disney  party planning.&nbsp; You'll be amazed at some of the things you can do at  Walt Disney World and Disneyland.&nbsp; You'll also be amazed at how  relatively inexpensive it is! (She'll even tell us how much it costs to  have Disneyland all to ourselves!)</p>
<p>Carrie will also tell  us about some of her other Disney adventures... like the time she rode  The Haunted Mansion in Florida and The Haunted Mansion in California in  the <a href="http://disneytravelbabble.com/trip-reports/free-dining/day-8/"><em><strong>SAME DAY!</strong></em></a>&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've been doing this crazy podcast since April of 2005... that's a  long time!&nbsp; So, there aren't many "firsts" on the show these days.</p>
<p>But,  in an effort to continue to be one of the most interactive podcasts out  there, we're adding a new element to our annual Listener Question Show.</p>
<p>This week, for the first time ever, we're taking your live phone calls!</p>
<p>Many members of the Coaster Radio audience joined us during our  "live look-in" webcast where people could watch the show being  produced.&nbsp; Listeners were able to call-in to the show and make this  year's edition of the Listener Question Show one of the best ever!</p>

But,  in an effort to continue to be one of the most interactive podcasts out  there, we're adding a new element to our annual Listener Question Show.
This week, for the first time ever, we're taking your live phone calls!
Many members of the Coaster Radio audience joined us during our  "live look-in" webcast where people could watch the show being  produced.&nbsp; Listeners were able to call-in to the show and make this  year's edition of the Listener Question Show one of the best ever!
In addition to the live questions, we'll be joined by Derek and  Trisha, a couple in Southern California who are making their way to Walt  Disney World in Orlando next week.&nbsp; They have agreed to wear Bride and  Groom Mickey Ears to test our theory that anyone wearing those "Magical  Caps" will get a ton of freebies (even if they aren't exactly  newlyweds!)
Join us to find out what to expect in The Newlywed Game: The Trip of Lies!
Plus, we'll have some news on the NPH Project and an update on the "Day at the Park with Neil" contest.&nbsp; Don't forget, you only have one more week to enter! The contest ends Thursday, March 17th!]]></itunes:subtitle>

<p>It's  really easy to spend time talking about the roller coasters and other  thrill rides.&nbsp; But we think a little more time could be spent talking  about the 2nd best reason to go to the amusement park... <em>the food!</em></p>
<p>This  week, listeners from around the globe call in to tell us about the  iconic food treats that can be found at their local parks.&nbsp; We're gonna  talk about everything from the <em>"Dole Whip"</em> at Disneyland to the <em>"Chip Twister"</em> at Walibi World!</p>
<p>We'll  also talk about that ice cream treat (pictured here) that looks like a  potato.&nbsp; The folks at the Idaho State Fair know how to make a dessert!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll talk about the proposed <a href="http://orlandoparksnews.blogspot.com/2010/12/new-orlando-thrill-park-unveils-more.html"><strong>Orlando Thrill Park</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/the-daily-disney/pictures/orl-disney-world-new-fantasyland-pictures,0,7455298.photogallery"><strong>New Fantasyland</strong></a> and the <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apJ9OkS0Njs">Cinderella Castle Projection Show</a></strong> at the Magic Kingdom.&nbsp; Plus, we'll discuss the <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/tours-and-experiences/wild-africa-trek/"><strong>Wild Africa Trek</strong></a> at Disney's Animal Kindom and Star Wars II.</p>

<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">Imagine that you were a theme park designer with access to an unlimited budget.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">As you began to design rides for your park, you'd probably want to enlist the help of some major celebrities to provide the voices behind your rides.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">On this week's show, we gave our listeners a virtual blank check and asked them to match their favorite celebrity with their favorite theme park ride.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">We received some very hilarious combinations!</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">Also, the guys will discuss&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2010/11/remember-you-saw-it-here-first.html">a new driving simulator from Lexus</a></strong>&nbsp;and how it might be converted into the greatest dark ride system ever! &nbsp;Will we see an attraction like this within the next five years?</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">Plus, there is&nbsp;<strong><em>MAJOR</em></strong>&nbsp;news this week in&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/search/label/Neil%20Patrick%20Harris%20Project">"The Neil Patrick Harris" Project</a></strong>. &nbsp;CoasterRadio.com has had several milestones over the years, but the 6:43 mark in this week's show might be one of the greatest ones of all!</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">If that doesn't make you want to take a listen, I don't know what will.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">We also have a live trip report from a very odd spot in Carowinds and one of our favorite characters makes a surprise appearance to talk sports.</p>
<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

Imagine that you were a theme park designer with access to an unlimited budget.
&nbsp;
As you began to design rides for your park, you'd probably want to enlist the help of some major celebrities to provide the voices behind your rides.
&nbsp;
On this week's show, we gave our listeners a virtual blank check and asked them to match their favorite celebrity with their favorite theme park ride.
&nbsp;
We received some very hilarious combinations!
&nbsp;
Also, the guys will discuss&nbsp;a new driving simulator from Lexus&nbsp;and how it might be converted into the greatest dark ride system ever! &nbsp;Will we see an attraction like this within the next five years?
&nbsp;
Plus, there is&nbsp;MAJOR&nbsp;news this week in&nbsp;"The Neil Patrick Harris" Project. &nbsp;CoasterRadio.com has had several milestones over the years, but the 6:43 mark in this week's show might be one of the greatest ones of all!
&nbsp;
If that doesn't make you want to take a listen, I don't know what will.
&nbsp;
We also have a live trip report from a very odd spot in Carowinds and one of our favorite characters makes a surprise appearance to talk sports.
&nbsp;
It's all this week on CoasterRadio.com!

You'll hear the details behind this innovative home haunt and how it was inspired by Disneyland's Haunted Mansion. &nbsp;You'll also hear how some Disney theme park voice talent came on board to make "The House at Haunted Hill" even more special.


&nbsp;


EB and Mike also will fill you in on some changes to both the podcast and the website for Season 5. &nbsp;There's also big news about&nbsp;"The David Arquette Project"&nbsp;and our&nbsp;"Arquette Arithmetic" contest!


&nbsp;


Plus, EB will fill you in on the behind the scenes story about how his son Mark won&nbsp;Holiday World's "#1 Fan Contest!"

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[On this week's show, we take a break from our usual craziness to pay tribute to Will Koch, the president of Holiday World who passed away on Sunday at the age of 48.

Will has always had a special place on this show because he was one of the first "big" guests that agreed to come on when we were first starting out back in 2005.

Back then, not many people in the amusement industry wanted to deal with "the podcast guys." But Will came on CoasterRadio.com and was funny, candid and extremely interesting.

This week, we're replaying that interview as a tribute to Will.

It's wonderful to hear him talk about the park that was his life and the creation of roller coasters that everyone knows and loves. His enthusiasm is contagious and the interview is one of our all-time favorites.

As a way to say thanks, we're donating all of the website profits for the month of June to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in his name.

Supposedly, there was a merry band of theme park fans that waited patiently outside the gates of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter for Universal to let in guests for the section's soft opening.  Is this something EB and Mike would ever consider doing?  The guys also hear the listener ideas on "theme park weekends" that could be based on movie franchises.  We know "Star Wars Weekends" was a hit, but can the listeners come up with something better?  Plus, there is a live trip report from Holland... and the caller has figured out a way to get multiple rerides on Goliath by cheating the system.  Find out how he did it and much more on this week's episode of the Original Theme Park Podcast!]]></itunes:subtitle>

On this week's episode, our listeners call in to tell us about rides they looked forward to more than anything, but ultimately disappointed them.

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_420_a_brave_new_theme_park_world]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Earlier this week, The Orlando Sentinel's Daily Disney Blog&nbsp;<a href="http://"></a>posted an article about how Disney is working on a major technology
initiative that boosters hope could radically transform the theme-park
experience.<br/><br/>The $1 Billion Dollar project supposedly focuses on
the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). This technology would
allow for a small microchip to be placed in a wristband or even a theme
park ticket. Then, as you navigate the parks, the wireless-communication technology could be used in concepts ranging
from keyless hotel-room doors to rides and shows in which the
experience varies based on an individual guest’s preferences.<br/><br/>On
this week's show, EB and Mike discuss the possible applications for
this type of technology and what we hope to eventually see in the
parks. Will this forever change the way we experience the parks? Or
will it just be another way to easily buy a churro without reaching for
our wallets?<br/><br/>We also pick up on last week's discussion about
turning popular television shows into theme park attractions. We'll
hear your best ideas on what classic shows should be immortalized at
the parks. Some of you had great ideas! (Some of you didn't.)<br/><br/>We'll
go Off Topic to discuss an controversial documentary that EB saw.
We'll also talk about Mike's trip to an ocean resort in the dead of
winter where he got to see a few parks in hibernation.<br/><br/>Plus, we'll hear about how one of EB's dream predictions from last week's show can eerily true!<br/>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Today we're re-launching CoasterRadio.com with some all-new features, including this new blog and the return of the &quot;New Forum Forums&quot;.

To help explain it all, we produced an all new podcast episode.

This is the first of three new episodes we promised our listeners for putting us over the $1000 mark during the 2007 Coaster Crew Single Riders Marathon.

Enjoy!]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>CoasterRadio.com #228 - Series Finale</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Dear Listeners of CoasterRadio.com,
<P>
Thank you so much for being a part of our lives during the past two years. It was a great experience producing the show and we couldn't have done it without the support of the thousands of you who came along for the ride every week.
<P>
Working on this show reminded us of how much fun it is to go to an amusement park with your friends and forget about everyday life for awhile. We hope that listening to this podcast did the same thing for you.
<P>
There were a lot of great moments both on-air and off-air, but here are some of the highlights:
<P>
* We produced 80 original shows (about 48 hours of podcasting!)
* We produced 13 on-location shows at The Walt Disney World Resort, Holiday World, Hersheypark, Six Flags Over Georgia, Kennywood, Busch Gardens Europe, Knoebels, Paramount's Kings Dominion, Six Flags Great Adventure and Dorney Park.
* We were the only non-official podcast invited to the grand opening of Expedition Everest at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom.
* We were Commissioned by the State of Pennsylvania Office of Tourism to produce a "road trip podcast" to four of its amusement parks.
* We interviewed Disney Imagineers Joe Rohde (Expedition Everest), Eric Jacobson (Rock 'n' Roller Coaster) and Mike Lentz (Mission: Space).
* We interviewed Holiday World's Will Koch and several of the designers from The Gravity Group (The Voyage / Hades).
* We were featured on Adam Curry and iTunes' Podfinder podcast.
* We were featured in a July 2006 article about theme park podcasting in the amusement trade publication Funworld.
<P>
All of these things happened because we were able to point to an large, active and loyal group of listeners. Without you guys, the show would have never taken off.
<P>
This week, we present our series finale. It clocks-in around two hours long because we wanted to get in as many of your e-mails, voicemails and questions as possible.
<P>
We also have a few surprises in there for you as well, including an original song written for the end of our show by Deidre Rodman of the Lascivious Biddies.
<P>
Even though this is the end of the weekly version of CoasterRadio.com, we're hoping to keep this site alive to continue the friendships we have made while doing the show. We'll probably even produce new "special" episodes of the show during holidays and other times when it makes sense. So make sure you stay subscribed to our RSS feed! 
<P>
We're also working on a new podcast that will hopefully premiere sometime in 2007. While it won't be strictly about coasters, I'm sure we won't be able to go very long without mentioning them once in awhile.
<P>
Thanks again for listening! We'll see you at the parks!
<P>
Your friends,
Mike, Mario, Flava, EB & Greg]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week, we had originally scheduled our Series Finale.  But so many of you have been sending in messages and other things for our final show, we decided to bump it back one week so we could fit everything in.
<P>
So for this week's Bonus Episode, we're going to talk about our last-second trip to "Hersheypark In The Dark".  It was the first time in over two years that we've been to an amusement park without taking along all of the audio equipment.
<P>
We'll also be joined by Mike and Greg's brother Ryan, who spent the weekend at Busch Gardens Europe's Howl-O-Scream.  He'll tell us what the event was like from a "General Public" perspective.
<P>
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions.
<P>
You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).

            <description><![CDATA[We've all had the experience of standing in line at a park and having to wait an extra cycle while a disabled guest is loaded into the row for which you were waiting.
<P>
Most of us have no problem with this.  But have you ever wondered how the parks decide who gets to jump to the front of the line and who doesn't?  What constitutes a reasonable accommodation?
<P>
This week, we'll talk about the different physical and mental challenges that people face and how it affects their trip to the theme park.  We'll also talk about how some people try to abuse and cheat the system.

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_225_our_2006_tribute_to_cast_members_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We've always said that Cast Members in a theme park can make or break your trip.
<p>
They're the hardest working people at the parks.  So, the least we can do is dedicate one of our last shows to them and their stories.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to our friends at StupidGuestTricks.com, we have some fantastic stories about what Cast Members have to put up with each and every day.
</p>
<p>
This week, we're joined by Mike Collins' wife Molly, who was a Cast Member at the Walt Disney World resort in the mid-90's.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[If you're a fan of theme parks, October is one of the best times of year.
<p>
Halloween is right around the corner, and most parks are open for special &quot;scare-fests&quot; where you can ride all day and scream all night.
</p>
<p>
Most parks have to create artificial ghosts, but it turns out one park doesn't have to.  Six Flags Over Georgia recently played host to the Atlanta-based Ghost Hounds, who spent several hours after the park closed searching for signs from the beyond.
</p>
<p>
Guess what... they found something.
</p>
<p>
This week, Christy Poore from Six Flags Over Georgia joins us to talk about what they found.  She'll also tell us about last week's &quot;Ticket to Terror&quot; promotion where 28 lucky guests volunteered to eat a live Hissing Madagascar Cockroach in order to skip to the front of the line of their new roller coaster, Goliath.
</p>
<p>
We'll also have a series of reports from EB, who spent the weekend at Knoebels Phoenix Phall Phunfest.  It's one of the most anticipated coaster enthusiasts of the year and EB was there!  He'll give us his unqiue spin on what he saw.
</p>
<p>
Plus, we'll  tell you about our upcoming shows, all leading up the the big series finale on October 30th.
</p>
<p>
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions.

			<title>CoasterRadio.com #222 - Mario Faces His Fears On TV (Video)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_222_mario_faces_his_fears_on_tv_video_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Back in December of last year, we did a show about Extreme Rides where we talked about the different attractions that truly frighten us.
<P>
One of the best stories to come out of that show is when we talked about how Mario had to ride Drop Zone on a cold, rainy April day...several times... alone!
<P>
We were all working on a Washington, DC based television show for kids and this particular episode was about new thrill rides.  Drop Zone at Paramount's Kings Dominion had just opened, so they invited the host of our show to give their new ride a try.
<P>
Mario was the host of the show, but is very afraid of heights.  However, he but on a brave face and took the ride on.
<P>
But during television shoots, you often have to videotape the same action several times from different angles to make sure you have enough footage to complete the segment.  So, Mario had to ride Drop Zone four or five times for us to get all the shots we needed.
<P>
Also, since the show was produced daily, we had no choice but to shoot on a rainy Friday afternoon, before the park opened to the public the next day.  That helped to add to the fear.
<P>
This week, we present a video podcast where you finally get to see what that segment looked like!
<P>

            <description><![CDATA[This is the time of year when many of the different theme parks and amusement parks all over the country announce their new attractions and additions for the 2007 season.
<P>
During this week's show, we'll talk about two of the most recent announcements:
<P>
Maverick at Cedar Point - The Point's 17th coaster will be a terrain-hugging ride that features a 105-foot drop at 95-degrees, three inversions and a 70 mph launch through a dark tunnel
<P>
Griffon at Busch Gardens Europe - The 205-foot floorless dive coaster will be the tallest ride of it's kind anywhere in the world.  It will feature a 205-foot, 90-degree drop, two Immelmann loops, a second 130-foot dive and a water splashdown effect.
<P>
These rides sound pretty cool. right?
<P>
Well, there are some members of the coaster enthusiast community who aren't very happy.  They expected more and are disappointed that we're not seeing more height and speed out of this year's crop of announcements.
<P>
This week, we'll talk about the hype surrounding new and future announcements.  Can anything  satisfy us anymore?
<P>
We're also looking for stories from cast members about their time working at a park.  If you have a funny or shocking story from your days on the job at a theme park, e-mail us at feedback [@] coasterradio.com.

<p>
Pennsylvania's largest free admission amusement park is celebrating its 80th anniversary this year.
</p>

<p>
Knoebels features more than 50 rides, including the Phoenix---voted one of the top wooden coasters by Amusement Today; the Twister---go for the sharp vertical drop and the long ride time; and the High Speed Thrill Coaster. Built in 1955, it's believed to be the only operating Overland Coaster in the world. The Haunted Mansion has been named as one of the best dark rides anywhere.
</p>

<p>
The Grand Carousel includes 63 horses, 3 chariots, two antique organs and a brass ring machine.
</p>

<p>
Knoebels is currently building a classic wooden ride called Flying Turns. This rollercoaster-like ride will take riders rolling down wooden tracks, much like a bobsled run.</p>

Knoebels is currently building a classic wooden ride called Flying Turns. This rollercoaster-like ride will take riders rolling down wooden tracks, much like a bobsled run.

            <description><![CDATA[Join us as the Pennsylvania Amusement Park Roadtrip rolls on to Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, PA!
<P>
From high speed world-class roller coasters like Hydra The Revenge, Talon, Steel Force, and ThunderHawk to soaking wet water slides, you're sure to enjoy a day spent at the park.
<P>
The park originally opened in 1884 as “Dorney’s Trout Ponds and Summer Resort." It quickly became more when rides such as the Old Mill, Circle Swing, Cable Ride and Ferris wheel were added. In 1923, the park’s first coaster was built.

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_210_fried_oreos_fireworks_and_jack_sparrow]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On this week's show, we'll celebrate the 4th of July by shooting off some of the lamest legal fireworks that the Commonwealth of Virginia allows.  Our fireworks display isn't gonna be like what you'll see over Cinderella Castle, but it's better than nothing.
<P>
We'll also fire up the deep fryer and pay homage to the greatest theme park food ever made - Fried Oreos!
<P>
Yes, we know this is a theme park podcast and not a cooking show.  But when we were at Holiday World a few months ago, we were blown away by this strange dessert.  So, after a lot of testing in the kitchen, we have come up with what we believe is a very close version of our own.
<P>
We'll also bring back Bryan Temmer to the show.  Long time listeners will remember Bryan from a show we did last November.  Bryan is a normal guy, with a normal job and a normal family.  But he has a dream that is far from normal.
<P>
Bryan has a dream of building his own theme park and he's making progress!  We'll check in with Bryan and find out what's been happening since we spoke with him six months ago.
<P>
We'll also hear a live trip report from Lee in Los Angeles, CA.  He recently had a chance to experience the new story overlay at Pirates of the Caribbean at The Disneyland Resort in Anaheim.  We'll find out if Captain Jack Sparrow fits in with the older pirates who have been in the attraction since the late 60's. 
<P>
We'll also announce the winner of the On-Line Sign Generator Contest and give you another clue in our Soundwave Contest!
Don't forget, next week we begin our 4-week long Pennsylvania Amusement Park Road Trip brought to you by VisitPA.com.
We'll start the road trip by visiting Hersheypark and experiencing their new attraction for 2006, Reese's Xtreme Cup Challenge!
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions.

            <description><![CDATA[As most of you know, CoasterRadio.com is not our full-time job.  Sometimes, the show has to take a back-seat when professional disasters strike!

Throughout the past two months, Mike Collins has been working on a major television project at his job.  Earlier this week, the storage system that held all of his video files crashed.  So, it's taken a lot of extra hours to bring the files back online so that the project stays on schedule.

Unfortunately, this means that we were unable to produce a new show this week.

But, we're going to re-post one of our most talked about shows - the Podcast from Kingda Ka's Grand Opening at Six Flags Great Adventure.

This was one of the most technically demanding shows from Season One.  Not only did we have a live call from Sheikra's Media Day at Busch Gardens Africa in Tampa, FL, we also had an on-ride segment where EB rode Kingda Ka during the show.

For newer listeners, this is a show you might not have heard before.  But for long-time listeners, we want to make downloading the podcast worth your while.

So, we'll also include the clip for our first Soundwave Contest of the year.  If you check out the end of the show, you'll hear an easter egg that contains the clip.  The first clue will be given out during next week's show.
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. 

You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[As most of you know, CoasterRadio.com is not our full-time job.  Sometimes, the show has to take a back-seat when professional disasters strike!

Throughout the past two months, Mike Collins has been working on a major television project at his job.  Earlier this week, the storage system that held all of his video files crashed.  So, it's taken a lot of extra hours to bring the files back online so that the project stays on schedule.

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_203_podcasting_from_holiday_world]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Join us this week as we podcast from Holiday World and Splashin' Safari in Santa Claus, IN.  We're there to check out 2006's most anticipated roller coaster, The Voyage.

The stats on this coaster say it all:
* The world's top air-time wooden coaster
* Air-time of 24.2 seconds
* Track length: 6,442 feet (1.2 miles)
* Maximum speed: 67.4 mph
* Five underground tunnels
* 2 min., 45 sec. ride time
* Eight underground traverses
* Three 90-degree extreme banked turns
* 173 feet tall, with drops of 154, 107 and 100 feet
* First drop's angle of descent a U.S. record: 66 degrees
* Among the world's top three longest and fastest wooden coasters

But The Voyage is only one of many reasons that we're visiting the park this week.

Holiday World and Splashin' Safari is known throughout the country for their cleanliness and world-class service.  The atmosphere at this park is truly unlike any other.

During this week's show, we'll talk with Mrs. Pat Koch about the park and why it has been so successful.  We'll also talk with Holiday World's P.R. Director Paula Werne about the fanaticism surrounding the park.  We'll also be joined by CoasterRadio.com listeners who have come from all over the country to ride Holiday World's three legendary coasters The Raven, The Legend and now, The Voyage.

After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).  Let us know what you think by e-mailing us at feedback@coasterradio.com.

            <description><![CDATA[These days the cost of entertainment is skyrocketing.  Movies, sporting events, theater and yes, even theme parks are more expensive than they used to be.

But, your trip to the theme park doesn't necessarily have to blow out your entertainment budget.

This week, with the help of our listeners, we'll talk about ways you can have a great time at the theme park while saving a buck or two.  You'll be surprised at how many ways you can be thrifty while having fun.

We'll also talk with Erik Yates who is coordinating the Coasting For Kids coaster marathon. 

On Saturday, May 20th, Erik and some friends will be riding Cypress Gardens' wooden coaster Triple Hurricane for one hour per thousand dollars that they raise.  All of the proceeds will be going to the Make A Wish Foundation.

You can find out more about this event and donate to the cause by visiting http://myspace.com/coastingforkids.

Join us next week when we podcast from Holiday World and Splashin' Safari in Santa Claus, IN.  We'll be there to check out 2006's most anticipated roller coaster, The Voyage.

            <description><![CDATA[We think Theme Parks are a blast.  We're pretty sure you agree with us because you probably wouldn't be a listener of this podcast if you didn't.  But there are some really annoying things that always seem to happen whenever you visit a park these days.
<P>
These things aren't awful enough to make you want to cancel your theme park trip, but they are annoying and have the ability to add frustration to your theme park day.
<P>
With the help of our listeners, we have compiled a list of the Top 10 most annoying things that happen when you visit a theme park.  We're calling it "10 Things I Hate About You".  This list isn't specific to one park or one theme park chain, but if you're a regular theme park visitor, odds are one or more of these things have affected you.

			<title>CoasterRadio.com #147 - Rollercoaster (The Movie)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_147_rollercoaster_the_movie_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Back in the late 70's, people were crazy for disaster films.  There were movies about earthquakes, airplane disasters, war and even one about roller coasters.
<P>
In 1977, Universal Studios released a film about a madman (played by Timothy Bottoms) who was crisscrossing the country to set off bombs at amusement parks.  He wanted the theme park chains to give him one million dollars or he would continue to blow up roller coasters and dark rides.  It turns out that the only guy smart enough to stop him was a chain-smoking safety inspector (played by George Segal) who gets on the case after the madman destroys a coaster that he personally inspected.
<P>
The plot is a bit laughable, but most theme park fans watch this movie for the scenes that were shot at Paramount's Kings Dominion, Six Flags Magic Mountain and the now defunct Ocean View Park.  Three of the major on-ride sequences take place on PKD's Rebel Yell, SFMM's Revolution and The Rocket at Ocean View Park.
<P>
On this week's show, we'll be joined by a Washington, DC film commentator who will give us his professional take on the film.  We'll also give you the scoop on the fun things to look for the next time you watch the film.
<P>
If you do happen to own a copy of the 1998 DVD release, you can now download a full-length commentary where we point out interacting facts and trivia about the movie in real-time.  Such as:
<P>
Who shot the film's producer Jennings Lang and why?
What's the deal with the singing mushrooms at PKD?
What is Vitamin F and how does it relate to SFMM?
<P>
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_146_hitting_the_parks_alone]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Theme parks are designed as a place where friends and family can go and have a good time together.  They really aren't set up for people to visit alone.
<P>
For instance, there aren't any one-seater roller coasters out there. Most times if you're by yourself, there's always that huge empty seat next to you.
<P>
So, while most people would never consider visiting a theme park alone, there are a lot of advantages to taking a trip by yourself.
<P>
On this week's show, we'll talk about the pros and cons of hitting the parks alone.
<P>
Next week, join us as we talk about the Universal Studios 1977 classic "RollerCoaster".  We'll be joined by a Washington, DC film commentator and we'll give you the scoop on the fun things to look for the next time you watch the film.
<P>
If you do happen to own a copy of the 1998 DVD release, you'll be able to listen to a full-length commentary where we point out interacting facts and trivia about the movie in real-time.  If anyone actually does this, we'll be amazed.

            <description><![CDATA[We had a topic lined up for this week's show, but a post on the  CoasterRadio.com Forums caught our eye. So, we decided to bump our planned show and talk about the debate.
<P>
One of our listeners was looking into joining ACE, the American Coaster Enthusiasts. While he was reading their code of conduct, he came upon one part of the code that said...
<P>
"When interacting with the media, members are expected to speak enthusiastically about all parks and roller coasters. While members may have strong opinions about parks and roller coasters, they are to avoid negative criticism to the media."
<P>
The listener was upset by this because he feels that he should be able to voice his opinion however he wants, whenever he wants. He brought the topic up on our forum, so now we're bringing it up on the show.

			<title>CoasterRadio.com #143 - Theme Park Weddings</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_143_theme_park_weddings]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[If you're a weekly listener to this podcast, odds are you're passionate about theme parks.  You might be a fan of the roller coasters, the scenery or the general ambiance, but most likely your love of theme parks is a big part of your life.
<P>
Some people are so passionate that they include a theme park experience as part of their wedding.
<P>
We've all seen video of people "taking the plunge" on board a roller coaster; saying their vows in the front seat with a minister and the entire bridal party in tow.  But these days, there are ways to enjoy an elegant wedding while including tasteful theme park aspects.
<P>
On this week's show, we'll interview Colleen and Mike.  They got married at the Walt Disney World Resort in 2004.  They'll tell us about their entire experience from planning the wedding all the way up to the activities on the big day.  They'll even tell us about how they were able to take pictures inside the Magic Kingdom at 4:30 AM!
<P>
Then we'll talk with Deidre Rodman of The Lascivious Biddies, a band the Washington Post calls "Manhattan's Hippest Girl Group".   Deidre is the group's keyboardist and one of their songwriters.  She'll tell us about her theme park and circus-themed wedding as well as stories from when she worked at a small park in Idaho.
<P>
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).

            <description><![CDATA[Theme parks seem to be a popular place to shoot movies.  They're colorful, loud and full of perpetual motion.
<P>
Roller Coasters, in particular, seem to be something that Hollywood likes to use in its films because of the perceived danger and what seems like out of control speed.
<P>
We haven't had a major studio thriller based around a roller coaster since the 1977 classic "Rollercoaster" (which we'll talk about in a few weeks.)
<P>
So this week, we're going to spend the show talking about the new horror/suspense film from New Line Cinema - Final Destination 3.  For those of you who don't know, it begins with a roller coaster disaster.
<P>
We'll explain the plot, talk about how it relates to the previous two films, discuss the technical aspects of shooting a coaster disaster scene and we'll talk about how a film like this might affect the theme park industry.
<P>
This week, we are also unveiling our first video podcast.  In this special video episode, we'll show you some behind the scenes footage of the film, interviews with the actors and director, plus a preview of one of the scenes from FD3.
<P>
On Friday, February 10th, we'll release a 2nd audio podcast that features our review of the film.  We'll let you know whether it's worth heading out to the theaters or if you'll want to wait for this movie to arrive at the video store.  During that show, we'll be giving away Final Destination "Scared 2 Death" DVD packs.  (If you're under 17, you can't be considered for this contest.  Sorry dudes.)
<P>
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).

In the next few weeks, we'll preview and review the new Final Destination 3 movie, we'll talk with couples who have tied the knot theme park-style, we'll unveil a new contest and we'll finally bring you our commentary on the movie "Roller Coaster".
<P>
After that, we'll go through some of your e-mail and voicemail comments about last week's show on ways to beat the lines at the parks.  We'll even hear from one of our listeners who used to manage the FastPass system at Disneyland.
<P>
After that, we'll talk about some of the different things you can do during the off-season if you are in the mood for a theme park experience, but don't live in Florida or California.  You'll be surprised at the many ways you can beat the winter blues.

            <description><![CDATA[Let's face it, one of the worst things about visiting a popular theme park are the long lines.  Unless you're lucky enough to be waiting in a well themed queue like the one for Dueling Dragons at Islands of Adventure, you're probably going to be miserable.
<P>
But one of the newest innovations in the amusement industry has been the how the various theme park chains have introduced ways that guests can reduce the time they wait in lines.
<P>
Some of these programs, like Disney's FastPass are free with your admission.  Others, like Six Flags' Lo-Q can be used for an additional fee.  There are even some programs like Universal Express at Universal Orlando where you can go directly to the front of the line at each attraction if you are a guest at an on-site hotel.

This week, we'll talk about the pros and cons of the different systems and how they have changed the way we experience theme parks.

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_136_what_might_have_been]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[One of the fun things about having an on-line community of theme park fans around the world is that there is an abundance of information about current parks and attractions.  What's even more fun is that there is also a lot of information about proposed parks and attractions that never quite made it to the construction stage.
<P>
On this week's show, we're going to talk about the rides and attractions that allegedly made it to the drawing boards, but never made it to the parks themselves.
<P>
For instance, one interesting rumor says that in the very early planning stages of Walt Disney World's Tower Of Terror, Disney Imagineers gave some thought to turning part of the attraction into an actual, working hotel.
<P>
Who knows if there is any truth to this rumor, but is is definitely fun to talk about What Might Have Been.
<P>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[One of the fun things about having an on-line community of theme park fans around the world is that there is an abundance of information about current parks and attractions.  What's even more fun is that there is also a lot of information about proposed parks and attractions that never quite made it to the construction stage.

On this week's show, we're going to talk about the rides and attractions that allegedly made it to the drawing boards, but never made it to the parks themselves.

For instance, one interesting rumor says that in the very early planning stages of Walt Disney World's Tower Of Terror, Disney Imagineers gave some thought to turning part of the attraction into an actual, working hotel.

Who knows if there is any truth to this rumor, but is is definitely fun to talk about What Might Have Been.

            <description><![CDATA[This week, we bring you a very special podcast as Mike Collins sits by the fire, sipping brandy and smoking a pipe, while he reads passages from the immortal Charles Dickens classic "Great Expectations".
<P>
Actually, as fun as that sounds, it's not what we're really going to do this week.
<P>
Instead, each of the CoasterRadio.com guys will pick one thing that we absolutely expect when we visit a theme park.  We'll also pick one thing that we absolutely do not want to see when we visit a park.  So, that's why we called this week's show "Great Expectations".
<P>
This week, we'll talk about virtual lines, the cleanliness of park restrooms, rude employees, efficient (or non-efficient) operations, and many more topics.

            <description><![CDATA[The year 2005 was pretty good for theme parks across the world.  We saw the premiere of record breaking attractions, new high tech thrill rides and traditional forms of amusement park entertainment.
<P>
We'll take a look back at the highs and lows of 2005 with Arthur Levine from about.com.  We'll talk about the attractions that were big hits and some of the ones that missed the mark.  We'll also preview what could be big in 2006.
<P>
We'll also talk with Ian Clark from ozcoaster.net.  He was one of the very first people to ride Superman Escape, the new Intamin Launch Coaster at Warner Brother's Movie World.  He'll give us a review of this new attraction that opens this week.

<P> 
We'd like to wish each of you Happy Holidays and a successful 2006.
<P>
When we started the show back in April, we had no idea what the reaction would be to a bunch of unknowns talking about theme parks and roller coasters. We figured that a couple hundred people would listen each week at best.  But now, here we are eight months later, and a couple thousand of you are listening to the show each week. That totally exceeded our expectations.
<P>
As cheesy as it sounds, we're really honored that you invite us into your lives (iPods, computers) each week. Like we've said on the show, we're not theme park or coaster experts. Most of you out there know more about this stuff than we do. But the people who truly "get" the show understand that CoasterRadio.com is simply a show celebrating the fun that we all have when we visit the parks. That's all it is and all it ever will be.
<P>
We appreciate the e-mails we get every day and the many posts on the forums. We appreciate the people who have added themselves to the Frappr map and the people who have left messages on our voice mail line. But we also appreciate all of the people who listen each week that we have NEVER heard from personally. Hopefully we'll get to meet some of you this year.
<P>
2006 should be fun and we're glad you're along for the ride.
<P>
Have a wonderful and safe holiday with your family and friends.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[If you've every spent any time watching ESPN, you've probably seen a program called "Pardon The Interruption" (PTI).  It's a daily show where Washington Post columnists Tony Kornhsiser and Michael Wilbon debate the the biggest stories in sports for exactly one minute at a time.
<P>
In these days of short attention spans, it's the perfect format.  So, we decided to follow the homage "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery" and do a direct rip-off of PTI.  So, that's why this week's show is called "Pardon The Ripoff".
<P>
We'll discuss 5 different topics for exactly two minutes each.  Once the buzzer sounds at the end of the two minutes, we have to move on or else EB will throw a fit.  It's the fastest theme park talk out there.
<P>
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).
<P>
Also, don't forget to check out our CoasterRadio.com Holiday Gift Guide.  It's filled with ideas to find the perfect gift for the theme park enthusiast in your life.  We've searched the internet for the most interesting toys, gadgets, DVDs, books, calendars, posters and other gifts that are made specifically for a fan of theme parks.  We'll also found some outrageously expensive stuff that you can buy to bring the theme park experience into your home.

            <description><![CDATA[This year, Hades, the monstrous wooden roller coaster that opened at Mt. Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin won the Amusement Today Golden Ticket Award for Best New Ride in 2005.
<P>
Riders were amazed by it's steep drop (140-feet at a 65-degree angle), two underground tunnels (one of which was the longest underground tunnel on a roller coaster ever), and the extreme 90-degree banked turn.  The ride was designed by The Gravity Group.
<P>
One of the most anticipated rides for 2006 is The Voyage at Holiday World and Splashin' Safari in Santa Claus, Indiana.  This wooden coaster will thrill park-goers with a 154-foot drop at 66-degrees, five underground tunnels, three 90-degree banked turns and a total of 24.2 seconds of airtime.  This ride was also designed by The Gravity Group.
<P>
So, it goes without saying that the designers at this young company are pushing the evolution of wooden roller coasters.  We're happy to welcome GG designers Korey Kiepert and Chad Miller to CoasterRadio.com this week.
<P>
We'll talk to the guys about their design philosophies and how they are trying to take the development and technology of the wooden roller coaster to new heights.  We'll also talk about the pressures of designing a roller coaster in the age of the internet, where hype knows no bounds.  Korey and Chad will also tell us some behind-the-scenes stories about Hades, The Voyage and other projects that they have worked on during their careers.

            <description><![CDATA[It's the week of Thanksgiving here in the United States.  For most people, that means stuffing themselves full of turkey and then passing out while watching NFL football.
<P>
We decided to celebrate the holiday in a different way.  We asked out listeners to let us know what they are thankful for within the theme park industry.  We received a lot of interesting responses and we'll share some of them with you during this week's show.
<P>
Next week, the entire CoasterRadio.com gang will be back with a special show dedicated to theme park and roller coaster related gifts.  We'll talk about the toys, gadgets, DVDs, books, calendars, posters and other gifts that you can buy for the coaster nut in your life.  (Heck, you might even want to buy some of this stuff for yourself!)  We'll also spend some time talking about outrageously expensive stuff that you can buy to bring the theme park experience into your home.

			<title>CoasterRadio.com #127 - Building Your Own Theme Park</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_127_building_your_own_theme_park]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[If you're a theme park enthusiast, you've probably had a dream of building and owning your own theme park.  But odds are, unless you're very well connected or a multi-millionaire, you'll never get to see your dream come true.
<P>
If that isn't discouraging enough, most people would probably tell you that your dream was crazy anyway.  Heck, people even told Walt Disney that his plans for a new type of amusement park were a horrible idea.  They even went so far as to call it "Disney's Folly".
<P>
But that folly eventually became Disneyland and those critics had to eat their words.
<P>
So in that sprit, we welcome Brian Temmer to the show.  Brian is a theme park fan just like all of us.  But he's doing whatever he can to bring his dream of a new type of theme park to life.
<P>
He'll give us a behind the scenes look at what it takes to push an idea like this from a dream to reality.  He'll also give us a few hints as to what this new attraction might be and where it might be located.  It's a chance for us all to watch an amusement industry project from it's conception to it's completion.
<P>

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_126_extreme_rides]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[There really aren't many rides or attractions that theme park fans won't try at least once.
<P>
But there are a few rides out there that even the most hardcore enthusiasts think twice about before riding.
<P>
Some people won't ride certain types of freefall rides while others won't ride attractions that spin you in circles.  Some people won't ride skycoasters and some people could never bring themselves to ride any of the attractions on top of the Stratosphere Tower in Las Vegas.  (That picture over there on the right is X-Scream.  You can read our review to find out what it's all about.)
<P>
We'll spend this week's short "off-season" show talking about the different theme park attractions that freak people out.  We'll talk about the attractions that scare us the most and we'll also hear about some of our listener's picks as well.  You'll be surprised at some of the responses we got.
<P>
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).  You can also let us know what you think by e-mailing us at feedback@coasterradio.com.
<P>
Next week, we'll be talking with a man who has a dream of building his own theme park.  Everyone says he is crazy, but he is actually moving ahead with the idea and has had some early successes already.
<P>
He'll give us a behind the scenes look at what it takes to bring the idea from a dream to reality.  He'll also give us a few hints as to what this new attraction might be and where it might be located.

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_125_halloween_with_imagineer_joe_rohde_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[All month long, we've been on-location at different theme parks celebrating Halloween.  Now that it's finally here, we'll spend this week's show talking about your favorite haunted, spooky or scary themed attractions.
<P> 
We'll talk about attractions like The Haunted Mansion, Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, The Exterminator, Revenge of the Mummy, The Beast, The Freezer, Burg Falkenstein and more.
<P>
We're also are really excited to welcome Joe Rohde to the show.  Joe is Executive Designer for Walt Disney Imagineering and the Lead Designer for Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park. Since this week's show is all about mysterious attractions, it's a perfect time to ask him about Expedition Everest, the new thrill ride coming to Walt Disney World in 2006.
<P>
We'll ask him about the attraction's storyline, the immersive theming and how the legend of the Yeti will come to life.
<P>
We'll also talk with Joe about and how he and his team of Imagineers are embarking on a real-life trip dubbed Expedition Everest: Mission Himalayas in the search for new species and ancient legends. The scientific and cultural journey to China and the eastern Himalayas began in August and continues though October 2005. We'll find out how this trip to the Everest region will help to create an extremely authentic experience for park guests. Don't worry, we'll ask him about the roller coaster too.
<P>
We'll also talk with EB about the annual Halloween Extravaganza that he puts on at his house. We'll talk about the process of Backyard Imagineering and go into detail about the unique setup at EB's house. We'll also provide you with some links to other "home haunts" so you can get a few ideas for your own house.
<P>

            <link><![CDATA[http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/coaster_radio_com_124_live_from_fear_fest_at_paramount_s_kings_dominion]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This week, we're on-location from Fear Fest at Paramount's Kings Dominion. It's the 3rd stop on our month-long CoasterRadio.com Halloween Terror Tour.
<P>
Since Paramount is a movie company, Kings Dominion uses film-like storytelling to create their haunted mazes and attractions.  When the sun goes down, they specialize in delivering intense environments that make you scream as much as they make you laugh.
<P>
We'll talk about the evil carnie folks running amuck in Freakshow in 3D, the insane residents of the Maze of Madness,  the carnage caused by the Headless Horseman in The Curse of Sleepy Hollow and the terrifying drive you can take on R.L. Stein Fearstreet.
<P>
In this week's Great Debate, we'll talk about what horror movies would make excellent theme park rides.  Then, we'll talk about new attractions coming to Paramount Parks in 2006.  Of course, we'll highlight the new "family-thrill" coaster coming to Kings Dominion - Italian Job Stunt Coaster.
<P>
After the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions.  You can also record your thoughts on the CoasterRadio.com Voicemail Line at 206-339-RIDE (206-339-7433).
<P>
Stay tuned, because next week we'll have another Halloween-themed episode of CoasterRadio.com.  We'll interview Joe Rohde, Executive Designer for Walt Disney Imagineering and the Lead Designer for Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park. We'll talk with him about Expedition Everest, the new thrill ride coming to Walt Disney World next spring.
<P>
Why interview Joe on a Halloween-themed show?  Well, the new Expedition Everest attraction brings guests face to face with the mysterious (and terrifying) Yeti!
<P>
We'll ask him about the attraction's storyline, the immersive theming and how his team of Imagineers are visiting the Everest region to create an extremely authentic experience for park guests.  Don't worry, we'll ask him about the roller coaster too.
<P>
We'll also be revealing your picks for the best spooky/haunted/scary themed attractions at theme parks around the world.  If you want to participate, post a message in our special forum topic or leave us a voicemail message at 206-339-RIDE.
