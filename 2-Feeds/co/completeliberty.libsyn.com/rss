        <description><![CDATA[Weekly show that promotes total respect for self-ownership, property rights, and personal choice--amidst the authoritarian/obedience-oriented political and psychological memes in American culture (and elsewhere). Basically, governments and all they entail are the problem, not the solution. Voluntarism (or market anarchism, or anarcho-capitalism) and customary law principles, in accordance with reason and dignity, spell the solution. www.completeliberty.com]]></description>

        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Have you had it with politics-as-usual? Are you curious about why the vague notion of "public interest" is constantly forwarded by those who want to control you and your property?

Do you yearn for a day when you are respected as an individual? Do you want to learn about the implications of self-ownership? Do you desire to live in a brilliantly better future?

A dangerous myth perpetuates our political plight in America - the belief that we are free. In fact, scores of unjust laws violate our individual rights daily. We are taxed, regulated, and forced to fund governmentally monopolized services, and if we attempt to defend ourselves from any of these infringements, we are fined, arrested, punished, or even destroyed. We are no longer subjects to the King, but are we veritable slaves to the State? Most of us are afraid to answer this question, because it's easier to conform and pretend that the myth of our freedom is true. But living in fear and being obedient aren't the essence of the American spirit - embracing liberty is. 

Complete Liberty Podcast explains not only the sundry ills of statism, but also why political freedom is so important - and how we, as Americans, can achieve it.

            <description><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>In this episode I cover the Appendix - Parenting Styles: The Relevance of Culture, Class, and Race in the book Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards And Punishments To Love And Reason by Alfie Kohn<br /><a href="http://www.unconditionalparenting.com/up/">http://www.unconditionalparenting.com/up/</a></p>
<p>Love is both a feeling and a need<br />Collectivistic cultures tend to minimize or even disfavor self-interest and self-actualization, which leads to repressed feelings, e.g., of resentment and depression</p>
<p>When parents spank children, they inflict pain and induce fear in them, i.e., fear of parental "authority," which sends a really confused and contradictory message to them about their own individuality and choice--and it perversely mixes notions of love with violence. Basically, violating the rights of children doesn't help them flourish.</p>
<p>Lenient parenting methods are just as lopsided as punitive parenting methods. They don't teach children respectful ways to express feelings and get needs met, while meeting the needs of others. It's important for parents to express their feelings in relation to their unmet needs, and be advocates for getting their needs met as much as children do.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Alfie Kohn for putting such a book of useful information about parenting into the world. May the memes of unconditional parenting spread far and wide, so that adults learn that there are life-enriching, win/win ways to get needs met in families, and children therefore grow up healthy and happy. :)</p>

<p>Evasion, rationalization, and repression are common defense mechanisms</p>
<p>Government, being a coercive monopoly, fosters immorality and injustice</p>

<p>Any government is inherently unproductive, because it makes no profits; no voluntary trade with others</p>
<p>The activities of government are a giant lead weight around the neck of our economy</p>
<p>The military does not protect individual freedom, because individuals aren't allowed to make their own choices based on property rights (the essence of freedom)</p>

<p>All politics is invariably local</p>
<p>Cops protect and serve their own, not "the public"</p>
<p>The communized road system is the land of the arbitrary and coercive</p>
<p>The San Diego Superior Court--extortion artists par excellence</p>
<p>Governmental employees apparently can't conceive of making money in a voluntary fashion</p>

<p>It's important to explicitly state the nature of the coercive madness to those in government</p>
<p>Public property is a contradiction in terms</p>
<p>All the good things gained in life stem from mutually respectful relationships</p>
<p>Aggression is the utter failure of a reasoning consciousness</p>

<p>Those who advocate a voluntary society favor peace and prosperity, not the coercive tactics of statism</p>
<p>Inner strength comes from dealing with one's fears about challenging "authority"--and speaking the truth</p>
<p>And finding kindred spirits...</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The philosophy of pragmatism in America is killing our economy and culture http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/pragmatism.html
Evasion, rationalization, and repression are common defense mechanisms
Government, being a coercive monopoly, fosters immorality and injustice
The American Spectator : Just Say Snow by Doug Bandow http://spectator.org/archives/2010/02/11/just-say-snow/
Any government is inherently unproductive, because it makes no profits; no voluntary trade with others
The activities of government are a giant lead weight around the neck of our economy
The military does not protect individual freedom, because individuals aren't allowed to make their own choices based on property rights (the essence of freedom)
Free Will - "God Style" PART 2 by NonStampCollector http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv9IvCpiHxA
All politics is invariably local
Cops protect and serve their own, not "the public"
The communized road system is the land of the arbitrary and coercive
The San Diego Superior Court--extortion artists par excellence
Governmental employees apparently can't conceive of making money in a voluntary fashion
Root-striking questions to ask those who want to rule over you...http://www.meetup.com/Complete-Liberty/messages/boards/thread/8208221
It's important to explicitly state the nature of the coercive madness to those in government
Public property is a contradiction in terms
All the good things gained in life stem from mutually respectful relationships
Aggression is the utter failure of a reasoning consciousness
Are We Not Afraid? by James Tuttle http://alliance.rationalreview.com/2010/02/are-we-not-afraid/
Those who advocate a voluntary society favor peace and prosperity, not the coercive tactics of statism
Inner strength comes from dealing with one's fears about challenging "authority"--and speaking the truth
And finding kindred spirits...

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do people have the freedom to travel? Of course they do, regardless of what people in government say and do<br /> Most people believe in the memes of statism and collectivism, having attended governmental schools<br /> The Ugly War on Immigrants: Snatch-and-Jail Justice? By Dave Lindorff<br /> <a href="http://counterpunch.org/lindorff04142009.html">http://counterpunch.org/lindorff04142009.html</a><br /> Lack of empathy for others follows from dehumanization of them and vice versa<br /> <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/racism.html">http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/racism.html</a><br /> La Migra, the official U.S. kidnapper and ruiner of people's lives<br /> The twisted bureaucracy of many names - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service</a><br /> Calling fellow human beings "illegal aliens" leads to violating their rights as human beings--first and foremost, their right to travel and to live and work in particular places<br /> You simply can't be for liberty and for "border security"<br /> "Representatives" don't and can't be valid agents for individuals<br /> Ron Paul's statist ramblings based on economic and historical ignorance that play on unjustifiable fears, which is typical of politicians:<br /> Immigration Reform in 2006? by Ron Paul<br /> <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul343.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul343.html</a><br /> We all should look forward to the day when more people ignore unjust, immoral laws, which have NOTHING to do with legitimate torts and thus have no complaining party (in other words, no individual rights were violated)<br /> Baptist pastor beaten + tazed by Border patrol - 11 stitches<br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUzd7G875Hc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUzd7G875Hc</a><br /> My own recent story about dealing with the border patrol jackboots for about 6hrs; the scene of the crime was about a dozen miles north of the actual "border" - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/d9l4sq">http://tinyurl.com/d9l4sq</a><br /> It's vital to delegitimatize the collectivistic memes of nationalism and "citizenship"<br /> Self-defense is hardly possible when criminal activity (of governmental "officials") is legalized and legitimatized<br /> Playing the 4th Amendment card or using other USC appeals fosters police state dehumanization dynamics<br /> The jackboots are destroying liberty in order to allegedly protect it<br /> Obedience to a job description, regardless of its irrationality, is no excuse for rights-violating behaviors<br /> The Third Reich has arrived, once again<br /> It's important to parse out the language explicitly about having to bend your will to authoritarian sociopaths' immoral and unjust orders--in order to make them aware of their coercion<br /> As more people wake up to the nature of tyranny, the tyrants' way of life will eventually come to an end<br /> The Founding Fathers weren't asked for their "papers"; but present day "authorities" would consider them enemies of the State ("terrorists")<br /> Humans owe no allegiance to any "nations"; that would be a form of slavery<br /> The government is this magical place where crimes become legal (and evil becomes good, and ignorance is strength, and freedom is slavery, and war is peace...)<br /> The Freedom to Move by Oscar W.

C.F.<br /> "We honor our differences with people we respect; they do not ask our approval or we theirs, yet behold, we get along with them. Mutual respect is an affirmation of shared humanity, and it speaks in a universal tongue." C.F.<br /> "Good intentions are no excuse for making prisoners and hostages of people who have less political clout than you do."

Of course they do, regardless of what people in government say and do Most people believe in the memes of statism and collectivism, having attended governmental schools The Ugly War on Immigrants: Snatch-and-Jail Justice? By Dave Lindorff http://counterpunch.org/lindorff04142009.html Lack of empathy for others follows from dehumanization of them and vice versa http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/racism.html La Migra, the official U.S. kidnapper and ruiner of people's lives The twisted bureaucracy of many names - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service Calling fellow human beings "illegal aliens" leads to violating their rights as human beings--first and foremost, their right to travel and to live and work in particular places You simply can't be for liberty and for "border security" "Representatives" don't and can't be valid agents for individuals Ron Paul's statist ramblings based on economic and historical ignorance that play on unjustifiable fears, which is typical of politicians: Immigration Reform in 2006? by Ron Paul http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul343.html We all should look forward to the day when more people ignore unjust, immoral laws, which have NOTHING to do with legitimate torts and thus have no complaining party (in other words, no individual rights were violated) Baptist pastor beaten + tazed by Border patrol - 11 stitches http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUzd7G875Hc My own recent story about dealing with the border patrol jackboots for about 6hrs; the scene of the crime was about a dozen miles north of the actual "border" - http://tinyurl.com/d9l4sq It's vital to delegitimatize the collectivistic memes of nationalism and "citizenship" Self-defense is hardly possible when criminal activity (of governmental "officials") is legalized and legitimatized Playing the 4th Amendment card or using other USC appeals fosters police state dehumanization dynamics The jackboots are destroying liberty in order to allegedly protect it Obedience to a job description, regardless of its irrationality, is no excuse for rights-violating behaviors The Third Reich has arrived, once again It's important to parse out the language explicitly about having to bend your will to authoritarian sociopaths' immoral and unjust orders--in order to make them aware of their coercion As more people wake up to the nature of tyranny, the tyrants' way of life will eventually come to an end The Founding Fathers weren't asked for their "papers"; but present day "authorities" would consider them enemies of the State ("terrorists") Humans owe no allegiance to any "nations"; that would be a form of slavery The government is this magical place where crimes become legal (and evil becomes good, and ignorance is strength, and freedom is slavery, and war is peace...) The Freedom to Move by Oscar W. Cooley and Paul L. Poirot http://www.thefreemanonline.org/columns/the-freedom-to-move/ A communized justice service (government) can never protect you against fraud and coercion Unquestionable familial "authorities" train us to embrace a monopolies of coercion http://freekeene.com, a place for cataloguing smart libertarian activism People in government are not your "servants"; rather, they presume to be your masters &nbsp;http://www.marcstevens.net/content/view/26/33/ Obedience to unjust laws is contrary to living a rational life Conformity to various customs is an individual affair, having nothing to do with law Only one type of person pulls a gun and makes you do "business" with them: a criminal (or mafia with a flag) Christian morality of self-sacrifice is quite problematic Dispelling the various economic fallacies and fears of immigration... Socialism's focus on consumption and "equitable distribution" ignores the nature of production and the ever-expanding marketplace The Goal Is Freedom: Free To Migrate by Sheldon Richman http://www.ilw.com/articles/2009,0402-richman.shtm If you don't want people living off the dole, get rid of the damn dole! Natural rights applies to non-english speakers with foreign traditions too; culture can't be engineered "As long as people people live in peace, what's the problem?" S.R. Thoughts on Freedom: Absorbing Immigrants by Donald J. Boudreaux http://www.thefreemanonline.org/columns/thoughts-on-freedom-absorbing-immigrants/ No individual has the right to infringe on another's rights, to impede another's travel and freedom of contract "Public property" is a contradiction in terms; "private property" is a redundancy Essentially all the area that government controls can be homesteaded by respectful people; "border patrol" or "police" simply have no jurisdiction A free economy invites synergistic relationships; competition also fosters good customer service The Privatization of Roads and Highways by Walter Block  http://www.mises.org/store/Privatization-of-Roads-and-Highways-P581.aspx http://mises.org/books/roads_web.pdf What Anarchism Means To Me by CatFarmer http://www.catfarmer.com/str/whatanarchismmeans.html "Anarchism is my statement of intention to mind my own business, and not to interest myself in yours beyond what is welcome, mannerly, and appropriate to our relationship, because I expect the same courtesy from you." C.F. "We honor our differences with people we respect; they do not ask our approval or we theirs, yet behold, we get along with them. Mutual respect is an affirmation of shared humanity, and it speaks in a universal tongue." C.F. "Good intentions are no excuse for making prisoners and hostages of people who have less political clout than you do." C.F. "Anarchism is sincere belief in diversity put to the test in practice, and a guarantee that diversity will thrive." C.F. Complete liberty is a system in which people are autonomous, making their own choices (as they do in the marketplace) It's important to walk people through the corrupt concept of "legitimate authority" (via defining terms) As a person, as a human being, you have a right to exist for your own sake Further reading about a free society: For A New Liberty by Murray Rothbard http://mises.org/rothbard/foranewlb.pdf The Market For Liberty by Morris and Linda Tannehill http://freekeene.com/2008/02/07/the-market-for-liberty-pdf/ Practical Anarchy by Stefan Molyneux http://freedomainradio.com/free/#PA It's important to turn the moral tables on those who've chosen to be authoritarian sociopaths; never kowtow NH: Cops drag liberty activists from court, arrest five http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AVnwBODuWY Acts of violence beget more violence--and they tend to obscure the gun in the room Asking for accountability from people engaged in an extortion racket is a fool's game bumper music "Born In The U.S.A." by Bruce Springsteen http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/BornInTheUSA.html&nbsp; http://www.myspace.com/brucespringsteen

Well, do freedoms exist? Or how about justice? All these concepts are valid and identify proper behavior http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html As long any person disagrees with the political structure and are forced to comply anyway, that political structure is unjust and immoral Americans have never experienced complete liberty; there was never, ever a "happy marriage"; and, government is never chosen like a spouse is chosen, so the battered spouse analogy is less accurate than the obedient child/domineering parent model Those in the institution of government benefit from creating victimless crimes Intellectuals who are supported by statism don't want to bite the hand that feeds them, which is explained in the following book: How (Not) To Achieve Freedom by Stefan Molyneux http://freedomainradio.com/free/#HNTAF I&rsquo;ve Evolved &hellip; into an Anarchist by George Donnelly http://georgedonnelly.com/asides/evolved-into-anarchist The magnificent PR campaign of government, making victims look like criminals!

Glenn Jacob's (http://libertyradiounderground.com/) answer: http://media.switchpod.com/users/citizenx/SelfOwnership2.m4a George Donnelly's stellar to-do list: "Study the works of authors such as Lysander Spooner, Samuel Edward Konkin III and Murray Rothbard. End my membership in the LP and BTP. Cease all donations to political parties, candidates or organizations that participate in the electoral process. Hand over de facto control of the LP Transparency Caucus and shadow bylaw and platform committees to someone else (if anyone even wants them). I will also be ending the 'My LP' and Libertarian Party Candidates projects. Search for ways to work for greater liberty, without supporting governments. Evaluate all of my activities with the goal of ending any and all support for governments. Actively withdraw my consent from governments."

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Open access router network?<br /> The People&rsquo;s Romance: Why People Love Government (as Much as They Do) by Daniel B.

objectively speaking, they are irrelevant to one's life and well-being<br /> An educational system that demands students' obedience to authority is primes people for accepting the principles of communism--even though Americans are taught, via statist propaganda, to see themselves as enemies of communism<br /> Around the world, it's the theme of statism that presides <br /> Virtually all monopolies are coercive (using the coercive tools of government), not natural monopolies, with government itself on the top of the sordid, unjust heap of protection rackets<br /> It's important to distinguish between what is unethical and what is unjust, as well as what is psychologically respectful (unschooling) and what is not (traditional, controlling, or teacher-directed, methods)<br /> The kinds of socialization that take place in the prison system, i.e., in the governmental schools, aren't good for anyone (Ayn Rand quote referenced in <a href="http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html">http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html</a>)<br /> In order to maintain its power, government must control money and schools (fiat currency and fiat education)<br /> The discipline and self-esteem movements as manifestations of the coercive system<br /> <a href="http://www.logicallearning.net/learnerdrivened.html">http://www.logicallearning.net/learnerdrivened.html</a><br /> To doubt students' capability and initiative to direct their learning processes does NOTHING to foster their growth, and it only perpetuates widespread self-distrust<br /> Students should be seen as consumers of educational services, not obedient servants<br /> It's important to distinguish between self-efficacy and self-esteem, and to define self-esteem properly--as well as to see it as impossible to achieve in a coercive educational system, which is always contrary to development of intrinsic motivation<br /> Governmental school teachers are conduits for implementing a command-and-control pedagogy<br /> The idea of change on a national and individual level is pretty disconnected<br /> Job tickets as main goal of "higher education" (John Holt quote referenced in http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html)<br /> Unfortunately, it's easier (in the short term) to not take responsibility for one's learning process<br /> How Academic Guilds Police Higher Education by Gary North<br /> <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north632.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north632.html</a><br /> Freedom and Beyond (Innovators in Education) by John Holt<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Beyond-Innovators-Education-John/dp/0867093676">http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Beyond-Innovators-Education-John/dp/0867093676</a><br /> Holt's experience of teaching student-directed learning to Harvard grad students revealed the psychology of coerced students: "You don't care about us, otherwise you'd tell us what to do."<br /> Yet, the educational buck has to stop at some point, and it might as well stop at the individual learner, not some conjured "authority" (i.e., just another individual)<br /> Decompressing from a schooling environment to an unschooling environment takes a little time, time to restore the independent decision-making ability and intrinsic motivation of the learner<br /> Unschooling: What is Deschooling?

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The crux of the educational problem: The age-old bad meme of an "authority" presiding over a learner's activities Sometimes, homeschooling mimics traditional pedagogy (i.e., teacher-directed learning), as do supposedly enlightened private schools (e.g., http://www.vandammeacademy.com/) Identifying, integrating, and experiencing what you're interested in--the essence of unschooling The leniency versus authoritarianism educational/parenting paradigm must be dispensed with and replaced by a respectful model Fears of parents about unschooling their kids, such as they're not "teachers"; but you don't need a permission slip, just an intrinsically motivated kid (which fortunately comes naturally:) A variety of useful resources for learner-directed homeschooling (unschooling):  http://www.unschooling.com/  http://www.unschooling.info/ http://www.unschooling.org/  http://sandradodd.com/unschooling http://www.holtgws.com/whatisunschoolin.html http://www.midnightbeach.com/hs/unschool.html http://www.unschoolingamerica.com/ http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/whatis.htm http://www.amazon.com/Unschooling-Handbook-Whole-Childs-Classroom/dp/0761512764 We need to see kids as little people, capable of achieving great things, just like good tutors do And we need to come to terms with the fact that the learner has a teacher within Only in the educational system are grades given supreme importance; objectively speaking, they are irrelevant to one's life and well-being An educational system that demands students' obedience to authority is primes people for accepting the principles of communism--even though Americans are taught, via statist propaganda, to see themselves as enemies of communism Around the world, it's the theme of statism that presides  Virtually all monopolies are coercive (using the coercive tools of government), not natural monopolies, with government itself on the top of the sordid, unjust heap of protection rackets It's important to distinguish between what is unethical and what is unjust, as well as what is psychologically respectful (unschooling) and what is not (traditional, controlling, or teacher-directed, methods) The kinds of socialization that take place in the prison system, i.e., in the governmental schools, aren't good for anyone (Ayn Rand quote referenced in http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html) In order to maintain its power, government must control money and schools (fiat currency and fiat education) The discipline and self-esteem movements as manifestations of the coercive system http://www.logicallearning.net/learnerdrivened.html To doubt students' capability and initiative to direct their learning processes does NOTHING to foster their growth, and it only perpetuates widespread self-distrust Students should be seen as consumers of educational services, not obedient servants It's important to distinguish between self-efficacy and self-esteem, and to define self-esteem properly--as well as to see it as impossible to achieve in a coercive educational system, which is always contrary to development of intrinsic motivation Governmental school teachers are conduits for implementing a command-and-control pedagogy The idea of change on a national and individual level is pretty disconnected Job tickets as main goal of "higher education" (John Holt quote referenced in http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html) Unfortunately, it's easier (in the short term) to not take responsibility for one's learning process How Academic Guilds Police Higher Education by Gary North http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north632.html Freedom and Beyond (Innovators in Education) by John Holt http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Beyond-Innovators-Education-John/dp/0867093676 Holt's experience of teaching student-directed learning to Harvard grad students revealed the psychology of coerced students: "You don't care about us, otherwise you'd tell us what to do." Yet, the educational buck has to stop at some point, and it might as well stop at the individual learner, not some conjured "authority" (i.e., just another individual) Decompressing from a schooling environment to an unschooling environment takes a little time, time to restore the independent decision-making ability and intrinsic motivation of the learner Unschooling: What is Deschooling? (Dayna Martin) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9meP3a64MzY Dayna Martin: Common Unschooling Questions Answered http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-NheCjqDMM Couple more resources: http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/ ; http://www.homeedmag.com/HEM/171.00/jf_art_unsch.html An idle (and busy) school teacher is a Devil's workshop--a teacher-directed learning environment commonly leads to controlling learners and thus stripping them of intrinsic motivation The chicken and the egg problem of statism and statist education; we need to reconfigure the dna to create a new species of thinking and acting--new and respectful memes need to replace domination memes Einstein, the rule breaker!

<a href="http://chinachannel.hk/">http://chinachannel.hk/</a><br /> More and more access to information will eventually destroy the statist memes<br /> Focusing on technological improvements without focusing on getting rid of authoritarian pedagogy is beyond ridiculous<br /> <a href="http://www.grownupdigital.com/index.php/2008/12/teachers-and-technology-should-work-together/">http://www.grownupdigital.com/index.php/2008/12/teachers-and-technology-should-work-together/</a><br /> Teaching is the highest form of manipulation, said one of my college profs<br /> The fine pedagogical art of of trimming leaves on a rotten tree...and singing teachers union songs<br /> Mimicking free market innovations in the governmental school classroom still retains an antiquated pedagogy and statist memes<br /> The entire authoritarian structure of governmental education must be hidden (in plain sight) with propaganda and threats<br /> Check out iTunes University for tons of educational stuff! <br /> <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/mobile-learning/">http://www.apple.com/education/mobile-learning/</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://deimos3.apple.com/indigo/main/main.xml">http://deimos3.apple.com/indigo/main/main.xml</a><br /> Finding ways to approach statist mentalities in a constructive rather than destructive (pugilistic;) fashion<br /> Explaining another's point view, so that he/she feels understood<br /> The main problem with minarchism is that it leads the statist apparatus (coercive monopoly) in place to abuse the populace<br /> Having a negative tone towards government (because those in it act unjustly and immorally) really means having a positive view of individuals (and the respect they deserve)<br /> Resourceful, creative, independent, innovative, and moral individuals are threats to government itself; thus governmental schools <br /> Basically, because people are not practicing enough self-responsibility, we have government<br /> Noble purposes must be ascribed to the unjust and immoral actions of governmental officials, in order to appeal to people's inherent virtues and make things seem not what they are<br /> People defend evil in order to prevent their worldview from dissolving<br /> Our task is to be objective and state the truth, especially when nearly everyone is defending falsehoods (particularly statist intellectuals)<br /> The importance of Wikipedia for fact-checking and information literacy<br /> Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations by Clay Shirky<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/1594201536">http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/1594201536</a><br /> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_comes_everybody">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_comes_everybody</a><br /> Web 2.0 technologies will eventually rid the world of powerful guilds, so-called experts, and sundry "authorities"<br /> Statism is anti-self-esteem and anti-change; complete liberty is pro-self-esteem and pro-change<br /> The agricultural revolution, industrial revolution, information revolution were all exploited by government to enslave and destroy individuals<br /> We still live in the age of pre-logic, where most people pay little attention to contradictions<br /> An attempt at a peaceful world? <a href="http://www.itakethevow.com/">http://www.itakethevow.com/</a><br /> Those in government ultimately depend on violence, theft, and deception in order to exist; since people already know this, why do they make excuses for statism?<br /> One of Stefan Molyneux's brilliant assessments of the subject:<br /> <a href="http://www.mediafly.com/Podcasts/Episodes/FDR1233_Free_Will_Determinism_And_Self_Knowledge">http://www.mediafly.com/Podcasts/Episodes/FDR1233_Free_Will_Determinism_And_Self_Knowledge</a><br /> Governmental schooling is an organization of authoritarian sociopathy the purports to be good for "students"<br /> Paul Dressel's smart quote: "A grade can be regarded only as an inadequate report of an inaccurate judgment by a biased and variable judge of the extent to which a student has attained an undefined level of mastery of an unknown proportion of an indefinite amount of material."<br /> Facts and Fancy in Assigning Grades. Basic College Quarterly, 2 (1957), 6-12 (referenced here: <a href="http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html">http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html</a>)<br /> Grades and tests as essential methods of controlling students<br /> Brett's world history lesson in 10 seconds: A long story, continuously repeating itself, looping century after century, about how an extremely small group of people controls an extremely large group of people by fear or by force--and their best weapon is the ignorance of the people<br /> Though the Bill of Rights looks good on paper (supposedly restraining despotic government), it harbors a false premise--it legitimizes a coercive institution that violate individual rights on a daily basis<br /> To defy property taxes (i.e., extortion) is heroic--it's crucial to stand up for logic, property rights, and especially individual learners<br /> Sudbury model (the "free school" model) compared and contrasted with Montessori, Waldorf, and Progressive schools (and "student government"), as well as homeschooling<br /> <a href="http://www.sudval.org/">http://www.sudval.org/</a><br /> A couple useful resources (basically, parentally unstructured homeschooling): <a href="http://www.unschooling.org/index.htm">http://www.unschooling.org/index.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.unschooling.com/">http://www.unschooling.com/</a><br /> The fastest and best way to help kids become educated, self-esteeming, and mature is to respect their right to make choices as individual learners<br /> Interest (intrinsic motivation) is the only criterion for engaging in any activity, and satisfaction the only evaluation of success (Sudbury model, or any enlightened pedagogy)<br /> My favorite child psychology book: The Secret of Childhood by Maria Montessori <a href="http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=8977399">http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=8977399</a><br /> A learner who doesn't know what to learn (no imposed lesson plan), will then learn how to know what to learn! Learning as manifestation of the entrepreneurial spirit<br /> Boredom as learning experience; people's discomfort with themselves is yet another product of governmental schools <br /> Democratic decision-making denies self-responsibility and objectivity, though it is a good tool for quelling dissent and imposing self-blame (You, it's what's for dinner!)<br /> The two aspects of government that really suck--the one that doesn't work for you (even though it's supposed to) and the one that works for those in charge<br /> Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics And Politics Of Monarchy, Democracy, And Natural Order by Hans-Hermann Hoppe <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lv7xr">http://tinyurl.com/lv7xr</a><br /> Psychologist Carl Rogers' fabulous quotation about the proper educational attitude: "To free curiosity; to permit individuals to go charging off in new directions dictated by their own interests; to unleash the sense of inquiry; to open everything to questioning and exploration; to recognize that everything is in process of change&mdash;here is an experience I can never forget." (referenced here: <a href="http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html">http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html</a>)<br /> Ultimately, the governmental school is a processing plant: The child goes in; the obedient employee/soldier/taxpayer goes out<br /> What's needed: The Practice of Self-Responsibility by Nathaniel Branden<br /> <a href="http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21_23&amp;products_id=36">http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21_23&amp;products_id=36</a><br /> bumper music "Teenagers" by My Chemical Romance<br /> <a href="http://mychemicalromance.com/">http://mychemicalromance.com/</a></p>

Governmental schools are the main anchor around the neck of our society The common person seems to follow all the clueless statist intellectuals Coercively-funded "Public schools" cannot teach anything coherent about economics--because they operate outside the free market The ills of Keynesian (governmental) economics versus the goodness of Austrian (free market) economics What government does (perpetrate crimes) is prohibited to individuals outside of government Of course, government by nature has no interest in defending and upholding individual rights Being a "good student" leads to being a "good citizen," in which obedience and compliance are expected Liberation by Internet by Gennady Stolyarov II http://mises.org/story/3060 Surfing the Net via China? http://chinachannel.hk/ More and more access to information will eventually destroy the statist memes Focusing on technological improvements without focusing on getting rid of authoritarian pedagogy is beyond ridiculous http://www.grownupdigital.com/index.php/2008/12/teachers-and-technology-should-work-together/ Teaching is the highest form of manipulation, said one of my college profs The fine pedagogical art of of trimming leaves on a rotten tree...and singing teachers union songs Mimicking free market innovations in the governmental school classroom still retains an antiquated pedagogy and statist memes The entire authoritarian structure of governmental education must be hidden (in plain sight) with propaganda and threats Check out iTunes University for tons of educational stuff!  http://www.apple.com/education/mobile-learning/&nbsp; http://deimos3.apple.com/indigo/main/main.xml Finding ways to approach statist mentalities in a constructive rather than destructive (pugilistic;) fashion Explaining another's point view, so that he/she feels understood The main problem with minarchism is that it leads the statist apparatus (coercive monopoly) in place to abuse the populace Having a negative tone towards government (because those in it act unjustly and immorally) really means having a positive view of individuals (and the respect they deserve) Resourceful, creative, independent, innovative, and moral individuals are threats to government itself; thus governmental schools  Basically, because people are not practicing enough self-responsibility, we have government Noble purposes must be ascribed to the unjust and immoral actions of governmental officials, in order to appeal to people's inherent virtues and make things seem not what they are People defend evil in order to prevent their worldview from dissolving Our task is to be objective and state the truth, especially when nearly everyone is defending falsehoods (particularly statist intellectuals) The importance of Wikipedia for fact-checking and information literacy Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations by Clay Shirky http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/1594201536 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_comes_everybody Web 2.0 technologies will eventually rid the world of powerful guilds, so-called experts, and sundry "authorities" Statism is anti-self-esteem and anti-change; complete liberty is pro-self-esteem and pro-change The agricultural revolution, industrial revolution, information revolution were all exploited by government to enslave and destroy individuals We still live in the age of pre-logic, where most people pay little attention to contradictions An attempt at a peaceful world? http://www.itakethevow.com/ Those in government ultimately depend on violence, theft, and deception in order to exist; since people already know this, why do they make excuses for statism? One of Stefan Molyneux's brilliant assessments of the subject: http://www.mediafly.com/Podcasts/Episodes/FDR1233_Free_Will_Determinism_And_Self_Knowledge Governmental schooling is an organization of authoritarian sociopathy the purports to be good for "students" Paul Dressel's smart quote: "A grade can be regarded only as an inadequate report of an inaccurate judgment by a biased and variable judge of the extent to which a student has attained an undefined level of mastery of an unknown proportion of an indefinite amount of material." Facts and Fancy in Assigning Grades. Basic College Quarterly, 2 (1957), 6-12 (referenced here: http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html) Grades and tests as essential methods of controlling students Brett's world history lesson in 10 seconds: A long story, continuously repeating itself, looping century after century, about how an extremely small group of people controls an extremely large group of people by fear or by force--and their best weapon is the ignorance of the people Though the Bill of Rights looks good on paper (supposedly restraining despotic government), it harbors a false premise--it legitimizes a coercive institution that violate individual rights on a daily basis To defy property taxes (i.e., extortion) is heroic--it's crucial to stand up for logic, property rights, and especially individual learners Sudbury model (the "free school" model) compared and contrasted with Montessori, Waldorf, and Progressive schools (and "student government"), as well as homeschooling http://www.sudval.org/ A couple useful resources (basically, parentally unstructured homeschooling): http://www.unschooling.org/index.htm and http://www.unschooling.com/ The fastest and best way to help kids become educated, self-esteeming, and mature is to respect their right to make choices as individual learners Interest (intrinsic motivation) is the only criterion for engaging in any activity, and satisfaction the only evaluation of success (Sudbury model, or any enlightened pedagogy) My favorite child psychology book: The Secret of Childhood by Maria Montessori http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=8977399 A learner who doesn't know what to learn (no imposed lesson plan), will then learn how to know what to learn! Learning as manifestation of the entrepreneurial spirit Boredom as learning experience; people's discomfort with themselves is yet another product of governmental schools  Democratic decision-making denies self-responsibility and objectivity, though it is a good tool for quelling dissent and imposing self-blame (You, it's what's for dinner!) The two aspects of government that really suck--the one that doesn't work for you (even though it's supposed to) and the one that works for those in charge Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics And Politics Of Monarchy, Democracy, And Natural Order by Hans-Hermann Hoppe http://tinyurl.com/lv7xr Psychologist Carl Rogers' fabulous quotation about the proper educational attitude: "To free curiosity; to permit individuals to go charging off in new directions dictated by their own interests; to unleash the sense of inquiry; to open everything to questioning and exploration; to recognize that everything is in process of change&mdash;here is an experience I can never forget." (referenced here: http://www.logicallearning.net/libertyeducation.html) Ultimately, the governmental school is a processing plant: The child goes in; the obedient employee/soldier/taxpayer goes out What's needed: The Practice of Self-Responsibility by Nathaniel Branden http://www.nathanielbranden.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21_23&amp;products_id=36 bumper music "Teenagers" by My Chemical Romance http://mychemicalromance.com/

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Salting roads for the common good (and corroding vehicles)  Private property owners have no interest in benefitting from commerce and trade--not! But what about the roads (and fire and police "services)! Nothing like institutionalized legalized monopolies as the best way to solve problems Bureaucratized utilities once again to the rescue; preservation of the status quo is always best, especially regarding the utility monopolies; thinking outside the statist electricity box; the genius of Nikola Tesla: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_energy_transfer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_tower#Theory_of_wireless_transmission But what about the schools! Most realize the massive failure in this area Harry Browne's hypothetical of government running the computer industry http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/FreeTheSchools.htm Imagine if education worked like the computer industry; the sky's the limit So, in the spirit of Thoreau, we must strike at the root of coercive education, not merely hack at the branches http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/h/henrydavid161709.html Future School: Reshaping Learning from the Ground Up: Alvin Toffler tells us what's wrong -- and right -- with public education by James Daly http://www.edutopia.org/future-school It's way past time to abolish governmental schools, which are designed to produce "disciplined" industrial workers but don't even accomplish that; instead, they barely inculcate rudimentary skills while fostering compliance and obedient mentalities Leave it to Marx and Lenin to promote the essentials of authoritarian education And leave it to John Dewey and Horace Mann (and Henry Barnard and Josiah Quincy and Jacob Abbott et al.) to implement their authoritarian scheme Crossing Education's Rubicon With Horace Mann http://sixthcolumn.typepad.com/cubedseducationblog/2007/05/education_is_a_.html Becoming the property of the State via compulsory education Education: Free and Compulsory by Murray N. Rothbard http://www.mises.org/story/2226 And leave it to religion to lay down a framework of blind obedience to "authority," in which "authority" is seen as benevolent Mann is seen as the father of American "public education"; in addition to being a master of phrenology;) he was also a big supporter of the temperance movement (abstinence), which led to the prohibition era championed by big Mann-fan and despot Woodrow Wilson Following the Prussian educationist model, Mann promoted the following: the debilitating "whole-language," or "look-say," reading method; a centralized educational system at the federal level; and, getting private universities to be publicly funded With governmental schools, the bad ideas and bad money (extorted via taxation) drive out the good ideas and good money (voluntarily exchanged); it's hard for the private sector to compete with "free" governmental schools The Spread of Education Before Compulsion: Britain and America in the Nineteenth Century by Edwin G. West http://www.fee.org/publications/the-freeman/article.asp?aid=3872 Families find themselves "...caught in a choice-restricted monopoly system serving the interests not of the demanders but of the rent-seeking suppliers."--as in all things involved in government, follow the money trail... Coercive education, like coercive government, is predicated on the belief that some people know what's best for all people In order to implement his own form of arbitrary power, Horace Mann and those of his ilk gravitated toward the coercive educational models practiced in foreign countries where the cancer of statism had metastasized (i.e., the most consistent adherents to the principle of statism) The people in today's power-centers of coercive control see themselves as a cut above the rest The essence of being an authoritarian sociopath is choosing to deal with others in a disrespectful fashion, using threats and violence instead of persuasion and reason Hiding in and not taking responsibility for the system of authoritarian sociopathy is of course assuming its traits The theme promoted and modeled in the governmental schools is one of obedience The master/slave relationship is the ultimate example of racism "Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism." http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/racism.html The Student as Nigger by Jerry Farber, 1969 http://ry4an.org/readings/short/student/ Essays and Stories by Jerry Farber http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0303critic/030301studentasnigger.html "Authority addicts" defer self-responsibility to others (the "authorities") A little lesson on&nbsp;Farber's reference to the torturous "Procrustean set-up" of education: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes Slavery, like statism, tends to perpetuate itself from the inside Harriet Tubman: "I freed a thousand slaves. I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves." http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/h/harriettub388682.html Dealing with the psychological/social resistance to change; being attacked by fellow slaves who accept the constant theft, violence, and lies of government; such attacks reveal that they know the moral nature of the argument and they concede defeat Curiosity requires a level of emotional intelligence (respect for feelings) that most people still need to achieve It's idiotic to believe that authoritarian sociopaths have any regard whatsoever for you as an individual, or for your freedoms Just as farmers benefit from having free range chickens that produce more for them, authoritarian sociopaths benefit from giving their perceived "livestock" the illusion of being free so that they produce more for them; this is the matrix we live in True News 13: Statism is Dead - Part 3 - The Matrix by Stefan Molyneux http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P772Eb63qIY Who really are the human farmers, i.e., slave masters? Statist intellectuals who feed off others and thus justify institutionalized coercion (government) The drug war as an example of erroneous thinking about&nbsp;morality and law, in which breaking "the law" is equivalent to being immoral (again, following from the master/slave relationship) "The law" or "State" can never be the victim; individuals are the real victims within such a demented system--and governmental officials are the real criminals The Socialism of Public Schooling by Jacob G. Hornberger http://www.fff.org/comment/com0811c.asp Elegantly exposing the contradiction: "Advocates of government schooling claim that parents are not competent to make educational decisions for their children. That raises an obvious question: Why not? Aren&rsquo;t most parents products of public schooling? If public schooling has produced a nation of adults who lack the competence to guide their children&rsquo;s education, why do we want to continue a system that is likely to produce the same result?"

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Barack Obama pledges $700B public works plan to help economy by Peter Wallsten http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-obama-stimulus_5sdec07,0,3049287.story Drunken sailer extraordinaire Best way to make federal buildings "energy efficient" is to close them down Obama sees 2.5 million more governmental jobs in our future, for starters Your Monday Message from the Libertarian Party: The LP Goes to Harvard, posted by Andrew Davis http://www.lp.org/blogs/andrew-davis/the-lp-goes-to-harvard Digging holes and filling them back up...all via extorted wealth The MO of government: distribute the costs and concentrate the benefits In order for government to refrain from intervening in the marketplace, it must disintegrate and disappear Government is nothing other than a coercively funded and arbitrarily imposed organization Government, being a parasite on the economy, doesn't make anything; it acquires money via extortion To "stimulate" an economy through coercion is evil Government isn't fit for a society of rational and respectful people, so it must be abolished No one, including those working in "government" have the right to impose a service at the barrel of a gun World's Shortest Political Quiz&nbsp;&nbsp;by Marc Stevens http://www.adventuresinlegalland.com/index.php?/content/view/88/33/ Win Every Political Argument by Marc Stevens http://www.adventuresinlegalland.com/index.php?/content/view/89/33/ Some people disingenuously assert that governmental employees don't impose their "services" at gunpoint; compliance isn't voluntary, as innocent people thrown in governmental cages can attest As long as slaves remain obedient, their masters treat them well Keynesians (statist economists) believe in the meme of authoritarian sociopathy writ large--that the State is legitimate and all-powerful; mystical God is to the believer as mystical Government is to the statist "Public property" just invites boondoggles, among other sordid things The collectivistic term "national debt" has no validity and must be repudiated Even though persons such as Milton Friedman have tried, one can't rationally perform a "cost/benefit ratio" on the use of coercion, which is forcing people to do things against their wills http://www.logicallearning.net/libcapitalismpol.html (search for choice quote by Friedman) You wouldn't allow people to force you against your will if they didn't call themselves "government," would you? The crimes committed with impunity by those in government are the same ones that those in government prohibit private individuals from perpetrating (assault, battery, kidnapping, theft, extortion, counterfeiting, murder, etc.) Obama has chosen to be the head of a coercive organization, an organization of people who treat others in an involuntary fashion, an organization of people who rely on propaganda, pr, and widespread obedience to maintain the illusion of legitimacy There shouldn't be political parties or a republic form of government; there should just be the free market, filled with enterprising entrepreneurs who ensure people's rights if need be (justice agencies http://www.logicallearning.net/liblegalagencies.html ) We shouldn't aim for "smaller government, lower taxes, and more freedom" We should aim for no government, no taxes, and complete liberty bumper music "Highway To Hell" by ACDC http://www.acdc.com/

Let&rsquo;s Check Marx and Engels&rsquo;s List by Robert Higgs http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=2366 The Timeless Allure Of Communism http://completeliberty.com/chapter1.php#15 Government needs to make slaves out of adults (property tax payers) to indoctrinate future tax payers (kids in schools of government) "Remember the government's motto: you've got money, and we want it." "Therefore, in the present distressing circumstances, we may be warranted in asking: is our politico-economic system finally going smash in a frenzy of monetary inflation, bailouts, and government takeovers? We&rsquo;ll know the answer pretty soon." So, what can we do? Focus on passing moral judgment; point out to others the coercion at the base of society (the gun in the room: http://www.lewrockwell.com/molyneux/molyneux29.html); and, get people out of your life who behave in morally corrupt ways and advocate coercion Ultimately, it's either statism or voluntarism; mutual respect of persons and property is the ideal bumper music "Gimmee_Dada Orwell-REMIX" by Roger Grant and Dada Orwell (aka Dave Ridley) http://www.politicalgraffiti.com/nhfree/music/Gimmee_Dada_Orwell-REMIX.mp3

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we pick up where we ended in chapter two about the US constitution Article 1 Section 8 Clause 7, which is in the chapter's last section titled "The Constitutions Problems: Article I Section 8...Sadly, A Template For  Disaster."<br /> <br /> After finishing the rest of chapter 2, we cover all of chapter 3, which is titled "WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT (AFTER A BIT OF INSPECTION)." It contains the following sections:<br /> Freedom In A Nutshell<br /> Self-Ownership<br /> Property Is An Extension Of Self-Ownership<br /> To Those Who Dislike Property And Profit<br /> <br /> The bumper music used in this episode is from the electronic song "The Wake (Mercy Cage remix)" by Abney Park. This particular remix doesn't seem available for free on their site (I got it from the old mp3.com years ago), but other versions are. Here's their link:<br /> http://www.abneypark.com/<br /> <br /> Visit the book's website at www.completeliberty.com in order to download the ebook for free or purchase the softcover edition, as well as to join the forum (which is dedicated to brainstorming ways to attain complete liberty asap).</p>

			<title>Complete Liberty audiobook Preface and Chapter 1</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/completeliberty/CLpodcast1.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This covers the Preface and the first chapter, which is titled "WHY POLITICS IS SO CONFUSING." It contains the following sections:<br /> Politics In Mid-Stream<br /> The Timeless Allure Of Communism<br /> America, The Land Of Political Opinions Shaped By The State<br /> <br /> The bumper music for this episode comes from an electronic song titled "MATRIX_Trinity_reload_." Unfortunately, I couldn't track down the artist (or mixer) for this one, though I could for the rest of the songs used in all the other episodes. Btw, I downloaded all of them freely from the old mp3.com website many years ago.<br /> <br /> Visit the book's website at www.completeliberty.com in order to download the ebook for free or purchase the softcover edition, as well as to join the forum (which is dedicated to brainstorming ways to attain complete liberty asap).</p>
