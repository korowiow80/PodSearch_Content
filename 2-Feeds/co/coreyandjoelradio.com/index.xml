<title>UPDATE ON NEW SITE - IMPORTANT!!!</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>As of August 2, 2011, new episodes of Joel Radio will not show up on this website. Instead head over to <a href="http://www.joelradio.net/">http://www.joelradio.net/</a> to see the new site and all updated content.</p>

<p>If you are using iTunes or any podcatching program, it is also very important to update the RSS feed for the show so that you can get the new shows automatically. The new feed for the show is: http://www.joelradio.net/feed/podcast/</p>

<p>iTunes is supposed to automatically find the new RSS feed, but it may take up to two weeks, and you may miss a show in the meantime.</p>

<p>While coreyandjoelradio.com will not be updated, the full archive of past shows and all content from this site is also now available at joelradio.net. The <a href="http://www.joelradio.net/">new site</a> features the ability to leave comments  in the blog entry for each show, which is a feature many of you have asked for. I hope to read and respond to your comments and criticisms there.</p>

<p>So update your bookmarks and let's keep the douchey fun going on <a href="http://www.joelradio.net/">joelradio.net</a>!!!</p>]]></description>

<title>Joel Radio #66: Fishing With Jake</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Joel Radio returns with power. Really. Power, meaning the utility company actually managed to keep the lights on long enough to finish the podcast. This follows a long, hot, sticky week in Detroit, where the power went out, a comedy show was ruined and the people were miserable - sounds like every week! Actually not, as Joel saw Paul McCartney perform live this week and gives a full, enthusiastic review. Corey, meanwhile, is stuck at home watching reality TV. Especially his favorite show, Storage Wars. But for God's sake, don't watch the sad, 2nd-tier knock-offs. Also, the guys join Google +, Jake Gyllenhaal goes to the wild, Hillbilly Handfishin', and <a href="http://www.hotcelebshome.com/2011/07/25/katy-perry-the-smurfs-premiere-in-new-york/katy-perry-21-14/">Katy Perry's ass</a> comes out for the Smurfs. Plus, Falling Skies soars, 30 Minutes or Less is the summer's best comedy, and new website is imminent.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #65: Unskimmed</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Joel and Corey are joined on this show by Eric Thomas, a comedian, radio talent and <a href="http://www.thetumbrel.com/eric_thomas_podcast/">podcaster</a>. Eric claims he can talk about anything - and he does! This is a really fun show. The guys memorialize the end Club Bart's Comedy Night and look forward to Joel's new show (<a href="http://www.joelthecomic.com/?page_id=106">info here</a>!). There's also much irreverence about the Casey Anthony not guilty verdict, including Florida's future stripper prospects and Joel's explanation of why "reasonable doubt" isn't what people think it is. Also, the top movies of 2011 so far, Joel revamps <a href="http://www.joelthecomic.com/">the blog</a>, Corey cries for old media, and Corey and Joel play old school hip-hop experts - about as well as you think they would.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #64: Cars 2 Sucks</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Cars sucked. The sequel Cars 2 comes out this week. It sucks too, according to Corey Hall. Joel hasn't seen Cars 2, but will go along will that sentiment anyway. Other things that suck this week: Club Bart closing, the first half of that ESPN book, Ryan Dunn's death, The Green Lantern, David Bowie's saxophone and Pirates of the Caribbean 4 at the drive-in. Things that don't suck this week: X-Men First Class at the drive-in, the second half of that ESPN book, jokes about Ryan Dunn's death, Paul McCartney live, Super 8, this show, and you.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #63: Weiner U</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It's the week of E3 - that's the big videogame convention - so nerds like Joel and Corey Hall are excited. Usually. This year's show was a bit duller than usual, although Nintendo announced it's new console, the Wii U. The guys talk about the innovative new controller, whether they'd actually buy it, and why the original Wii was a failure. Also, congressman Anthony Weiner put his junk on Twitter in one of the dumbest career-killing moves of all-time. But the guys are divided over the humor of the situation whether it's not something "every guy" would do. Plus, X-Men First Class gets reviewed, the guys split on Hangover 2, USA is better than Canada (in soccer!), and rumbling seats = fail.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #62: Too Long to Be Funny</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The title is not indicative of the quality of this show! Oh no, that's a reference to the length of the recent comedy hit Bridesmaids, which at 126 minutes is way too long - funny or not (and it is!). This brings up the point of comedies being too long in general - thanks Mr. Apatow! Joined in this extended faux-radio show is frequent guest, John Tenney, of soon-to-be basic cable fame, and Corey Hall of, well, this show. Plus, The Macho Man is dead, but his insanity lives on, The Office is gone for the season and Corey is gone as a fan, and John lives a dream by working the comic book convention. Also, Corey sees The Hangover Part II. It sucks, apparently, but so does every comedy sequel - we think.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #61: One Hit Wonder</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It's party time! With Osama bin Laden dead, it's time for everyone to get along and love each other. Of course that won't happen and nor will Joel and Corey ever really agree on anything. While Joel thinks you can draw a straight line from waterboarding to the capture, Corey thinks the Bush-era policies are still outdated and give our current Prez all the credit. They both, however, want the "death photos" released, and gleefully look at the leaked pics of the dead Osama associates - drop the squirt gun! Also, Thor is alright, Joel's Oprah insider isn't all that, and gays and blacks have a long way to go. Plus, Joel's secret film nerd crushes revealed - Kubrick, Scorsese, Peckinpah and 80's pro-wrestling.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #60: Steampunk Convention</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It was recently Record Store Day. No, keep reading, I promise it won't be THAT boring. Anyway, Corey recently shopped one of the last remaining indie record shops in Detroit and came away both satisfied and sad about that industry's decline. That leads Joel to ponder the future of technology, get nostalgic about the beginnings of podcasting, and actually be optimistic about where everything is going. For example, Joel recently checked out online music service <a href="http://mog.com/">MOG</a>, and found it, with a few reservations, to be compelling. Listen for a LIVE Android demo! Also, a big TV rundown with Joel taking in AMC's The Killing and HBO's Game of Thrones, while Corey revels his hopes and fears for the end of Steve Carrell's run on The Office. Plus, Corey gives the history of comic books, Joel takes a trip through Portal 2,  and BioWare rules - Bethesda sucks.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #59: Charlie &amp; Arthur</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>More bombing in Detroit, and this time it's not from Joel or Corey,  as Charlie Sheen decided to launch a US "comedy" tour and found the Motor City less than welcoming. Actually, it was so bad Charlie probably wished he was "The Situation" at the Trump Roast. This week, Joel & Corey break down how and why Charlie cooked up a mega-bomb, the lack of planning and preparation, and why the opening act comic is not to blame. Also, the guys break down the state of morning television, Corey defends The Celebrity Apprentice and Joel is thisclose to being in a major comedy film. Plus, A movie round-up as Joel likes Hanna and Source Code, Corey is freaked out by Your Highness, and all people, animals and most houseplants absolutely hate the new Arthur. </p>

<title>Joel Radio #58: An Unfunny Situation</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Comedy ain't easy. This show will be an example of that. That's not a reference to Joel, co-host Corey Hall or the quality of this week's show. Instead, it's a reference to Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino of MTV's Jersey Shore, who appeared at last week's Donald Trump Roast and laid a giant egg. You'll hear the clips, the guys' analysis, and decide for yourself if he's really the unfunny douche on display - or if it was just a joke played on him by the producers of the show. Joel thinks the other comics are complicit in his bombing, but YOU decide! Also, Joel's early favorites for Asshole of the Year 2011, the bully video that proves that white trash are even in Australia, a Celebrity Apprentice debate and more. Plus, it's movie madness as Corey reviews Paul and Limitless, and Joel loves Win Win and great batch of new films on DVD and Blu-ray.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #57: Kirk Hit That</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Eschewing the normal Oscar pre-show predictions, Joel Fragomeni and Corey Hall return with a post-Oscars wrap-up. It was largely a snoozer, with first-time hosts actors James Franco and Anne Hathaway hosting and demonstrating a lack of experience, and an inability to tell a joke - who knew!?! But the night was saved, in the comedic sense, by 94-year-old Kirk Douglas, who hogged the mike, mumbled incoherently, and generally acted like drunken old Grandpa giving a Christmas toast. A highlight of 2011 that won't soon be topped. Other low lights were Melissa Leo's acceptance speech, Jennifer Hudson speaking a foreign language (English!), and Florence badly needing her Machine. Also, Corey goes nuclear - hilariously melting down during a character actor quiz & the best news anyone's ever heard - unless you're Oprah.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #56: Beware of the Green Tilt</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It was only <a href="http://www.coreyandjoelradio.com/archives/2010/12/joel_radio_51_a.html">five shows ago</a> that Joel and Corey Hall discussed friend <a href="http://weirdlectures.com/">John Tenney</a>'s new show, Paranormal State: The New Class. On this show, John returns to the studio, and the show barely gets discussed! In fact, there's more on John's mind, like Robocop getting a statue in Detroit, a computer competing on Jeopardy!, and how he was disappointed in a recent comedy show he attended. He also gets Corey and Joel to fight over integrity, open mike politics, and why Joel - not Corey - is the more qualified to host the show. This is endlessly entertaining to John, and it's all fueled by the guys' consumption of the evil beverage Sparks, and it's twice-as-powerful rival, Tilt, which is sampled in both the green and blue varieties. By the time the cans are tapped, John finally spills the details on the new shows plans, his <a href="http://realmoftheweird.com/">new podcast</a>, and the real truth behind his mysterious, ever-changing phone number.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #55: Hyper-Dimensional Mega Gay</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Just a note, halfway through this week's show, Joel called it "the worst show ever". He doesn't feel that way now that it's over. Maybe it was because Corey was bringing politics into a non-political discussion about Keith Olbermann. Maybe it's because Joel's grumpy after his <a href="http://www.kalahariresorts.com/oh/">fabulous mid-winter vacation</a>. Not even the television departures of Regis Philbin and Larry King helped out Joel's mood much. But, the mood was finally lightened by discussing the sanctimonious self-importance of the TV show Glee, including it's creator calling out one of Joel's favorite rock bands. Does Glee thinks it owns all popular music now? Is everything fodder for a gay, high-school glee club re-make? Joel thinks the show has become the Special Olympics, while Corey think it's just too damn gay! Worst show ever? Listen and decide!</p>

<title>Joel Radio #54: America&apos;s Next Top Critics</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If the guys hadn't given you enough lists with the last two shows, this week's show is dedicated to the best movies of 2010. Well, it's Joel and Corey's <em>favorite</em> movies of 2010, a detail that will be oft repeated throughout the show. Where Corey is largely in lock step with the critical mass, Joel's list is more unusual and documentary heavy - although one film is described as being "middlebrow" by Corey, starting a furious debate. Corey also picks a curious #2 selection, a film that Joel sees as Corey's ultimate fantasy life, and Corey agrees! Will your favorites make the list? Where can I see some of these obscure pics? How many films feature naked boobs? It's a spirited 2+ hours full of fun viewing suggestions that film geeks, and even non-film geeks will enjoy.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #53: Assholes of the Year 2010</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>As the calendar changes to 2011, its a great time to look back on the the biggest, and most accomplished, villains, scumbags, celebutards, and douche bags of 2010. Joel is helped in this by Corey Hall, and between the two of them, they know assholes - sometimes intimately. They've got assholes on speed dial. Anyway, enjoy 2+ hours of ball-busting goodness as the guys the guys rip politicians, self-serving celebs, egotistical athletes and more (including a dead guy!). This is must-listen radio, and without question some of the funniest stuff that only two actual assholes could create.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #52: Marty and the Widgets</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It's a big week for movie lists as Joel and movie critic Corey Hall give you their lists of "Movies That People Like, That Actually Suck". It's quite a couple of lists, too. Oscar winning Best Pictures, legendary directors, Pixar - no one's safe! It's a wild and controversial discussion, so thank God the guys have the legendary director "Marty Scorcese" to weigh in on lists, too! This "Marty" is hilarious! Also, the guys get iced out of a free football game, Corey won't watch The Walking Dead, iPads are are for assholes and one of Joel's most satisfying bits ever - removing an annoying "friend" from his Facebook profile. After too many status updates, someone has to go - find out if it's you!</p>

<title>Joel Radio #51: An Abberation</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It finally happened, after years of one scheme after another, show friend <a href="http://weirdlectures.com/">John Tenney</a>, finally cracked through to the mainstream on his own TV show. While Joel, and guest host Corey Hall, are happy for John, the actual show - as you'll hear in clips - leaves something to be desired. Hear clips of "actual" ghost hunting research, turgid voice overs and scared hillbillies. It's typical basic cable fare, and not extraordinary basic cable fare like Joel's favorite new show <a href="http://www.history.com/shows/irt-deadliest-roads">IRT: Deadliest Roads</a>. That show reinforces a point that must be repeated here: White people - stay out of India! Plus, 127 Hours rocks, Leslie Nielsen croaks, and Corey vs. Joel in Buzz Quiz TV on PS3. It's the ultimate interactive trivia game show, can you guess who wins? </p>

<title>Joel Radio #50: Goodbye Wacky Gene</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Joel is back, as is Conan O'Brien. So is Corey Hall, for that matter, and the guys break down Conan's TBS debut, discuss the realities of basic cable TV, and why pretty much anybody is better than Jimmy Fallon. Joel gives his theory on the first show's unusual guest booking, and breaks down the show's boffo ratings - he beat Jay! Joel also reviews Bill Carter's new late night insider book, which he consumed in one weekend! Plus, The Talk is a lot like The View (they both suck!), Due Date is a bit stale, and Corey's "biggest story in TV" is hardly that.</p>

<title>Joel Radio #49: The Cider Mill Is Ruined</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This week's show is completely wacky. Guest <a href="http://www.theharryartinshow.com/">Harry Artin Berberian</a> returns, and he's got a brand-new rap/parody single called "Change That's Loose". It's a knock on Obama, which, nowadays, may help him get some play in the Midwest. What's Joel's verdict? Listen and find out! Also, Joel's quick TV debut on Detroit 1-8-7, Jackass 3D in all it's glory, and the cider mill has some strange new clientele. Plus, meet Randy, Harry's buddy, who's a descendant of Daniel Boone, and looking for love on the internet in 2010. He's also Harry's personal trainer, which is about as fun as it sounds! A weird, wild, and hilarious good time!</p>
