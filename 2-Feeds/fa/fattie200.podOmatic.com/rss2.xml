      <title>Full-Figured and Sexy and no, that&#8217;s not an oxymoron</title>

It's hard to enjoy sex when society tells people of size, it's shameful or funny. Miss Fattie is going to take a practical approach to sex. She'll give advice about feeling and looking sexy as well as preferred positions for the plus-sized crowd. Also, she'll give a weekly status report on her progress with the battle of the bulge.
