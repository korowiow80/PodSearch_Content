The Use of Native Americans during Late Victorian Times for Commercial Advertising 
 
by Historian/Archaeologist/Curator, Towana Spivey 
 
September 24th, at 2PM,
 
at the Museum of the Great Plains
 
601 NW Ferris Avenue
 
Lawton OK 73507
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towana Spivey has spent his professional career preserving and interpreting the prehistory and history of the Trans-Mississippi West with particular interest in the Oklahoma area.&nbsp; He is a native Oklahoman and the descendant of several generations of Chickasaws who came to the Indian Territory in 1837 from northern Mississippi and western Tennessee.
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His educational background includes undergraduate work in History and Natural Science with graduate emphasis in Anthropology and Museum Studies. He has conducted archaeological and interpretive investigations of several 19th century military posts including Forts Washita, Towson, Ft. Sill, Reno, and Supply as well as other historic and prehistoric sites.&nbsp; This experience has developed his expertise in the restoration and utilization of 19th century buildings.&nbsp; He has researched and is currently supervising major restorations within the Fort Sill National Historic Landmark including the 1870's Cavalry and Infantry Barracks, Guardhouse, Quartermaster Corral, etc.&nbsp; 
 
&nbsp;
 
Some of his more unique experiences involved providing forensic archaeological support to the Federal Aviation Administration on an organized crime murder case in northeast Oklahoma and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation involving a serial murder case in California.&nbsp; Local law enforcement has also utilized his expertise with incidental cases in the discovery of human remains associated with missing persons.
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spivey has served on numerous boards and advisory committees for such organizations as the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey, the Oklahoma Governor&rsquo;s Review Committee for the State Historic Preservation Office, Oklahoma Museums Association, and Southwestern Oklahoma Historical Society.&nbsp; His work experience includes:&nbsp; Historic Archaeologist for the Oklahoma Historical Society, Curator of Anthropology for the Museum of the Great Plains, and Director/Curator of the Fort Sill Museum.&nbsp; He also is a senior curator for the U.S. Army Museum System.&nbsp; He served with the U.S. Army during the "Berlin Crisis" in the early 1960's.
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has also been featured in live interviews promoting the cultural history of SW Oklahoma for several regional radio programs in the U.S. such as the Red Steagal Show, as well as for Australian Radio in Sydney.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1989, during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, he recorded several hours of audio-tape on American frontier history for the &ldquo;Voice of America&rdquo; to be broadcast behind the Iron Curtain.&nbsp; He has been an instructor or guest lecturer for the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Center, Smith &amp; Wesson Firearms Historical Society, American Association for State and Local History, Cameron University, Oklahoma Center for Continuing Education, and other major universities in Montana, Texas, Colorado, and Oklahoma.
 
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout his career he has regularly been involved in preserving the history, language, and material culture of many Oklahoma tribes including the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Comanche, Kiowa, Chiricahua and Warm Springs Apache, Apache Tribe of Oklahoma and others.&nbsp; He has testified as an expert witness in state and federal courts involving criminal issues on Indian lands and also protection of sacred sites on military property.&nbsp; He has advised Congress, the Pentagon, and the White House on topics such as Native American soldiers, Comanche Code Talkers, and other related subjects. He has served as an art consultant for the Oklahoma State Legislature.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
&nbsp;
 
Spivey has recently completed a major exhibit gallery entitled, &ldquo;The Warrior&rsquo;s Journey&rdquo; at the Fort Sill National Historical Landmark Museum featuring cultural materials and detailed histories of many historic figures such as Geronimo, Quanah Parker, I-See-O, Satanta, Satank, and others.&nbsp; 
 
&nbsp;
 
His most recent publication &ldquo;Silent Witness-The Diary of a Historic Tree at Fort Sill&rdquo; is attracting wide attention for its unique perspective of a 250 year old oak tree witnessing the history of this very important historic site.&nbsp; Other research projects he is currently involved with includes:&nbsp; The Stagecoach History of Oklahoma; Native American Soldiers, Scouts, Marshals and Police; and Early Movies in Frontier Oklahoma.
 
&nbsp;
 
Spivey&rsquo;s presentation at the Museum of the Great Plains on September 24th will focus on:&nbsp; The Use of Native Americans during Late Victorian Times for Commercial Advertising. This will examine both the artistic and cultural perspectives of marketing products using romanticism and stereotypical attitudes regarding Native Americans so common at that time.&nbsp; 
 
&nbsp;
 
GSCOAS meetings are held on the fourth Saturday of each month from 2-4 pm at the Museum of the Great Plains, 601 NW Ferris, Lawton, OK, unless otherwise announced.

Dr. Wyckoff's talk will delve into these questions and some of the new findings that bear on the interaction of people spreading across the North American continent.<br/><br/>Biography:&nbsp; Dr. Don Wyckoff's PH.D. is from Washington State University; graduated in 1980 when Mt. St. Helens erupted!&nbsp; He has worked as an archeologist in Oklahoma for 47 years, first for the Oklahoma River Basin Surveys here at the University of Oklahoma, then as Oklahoma's first State Archaeologist.&nbsp; From 1968 to 1996 he was Director of the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey.&nbsp; From 1996 to present: teaching half time for the Department of Anthropology at OU and half time curator of archaeology for the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History at OU.&nbsp; In April of&nbsp; 2008, O.U. President David Boren announced Dr. Wyckoff as the recipient of a David Ross Boyd Presidential professorship.&nbsp; Dr. Wyckoff is involved with research on ice-age environments in Oklahoma, with hunter-gatherer societies here between 10,000 and 2,000 years ago, and with the sources of knappable stone favored by hunting and gathering people throughout prehistory on the Southern Plains.<br/><br/>Other interesting links where you'll find out more about Dr. Wycoff and his work include this interview with the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/308_arrow.html">History Detectives</a>,&nbsp;  and this one at <a href="http://www.ou.edu/anthropology/Faculty_staff/faculty_pages/wyckoff.html">OU faculty pages</a>.<br/><br/>]]></description>
