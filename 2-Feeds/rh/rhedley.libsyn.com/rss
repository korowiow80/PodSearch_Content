            <link><![CDATA[http://rhedley.libsyn.com/leeds_house_music_podcast_episode_24]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, sorry it's been over a year since my last mix but on the positive side here is the next episode of the Leeds House Music Podcast. I had a brilliant night last night playing for Glasshouse on the terrace at the Factory in Leeds so this mix is a celebration of that and all the great summer parties that we'll be having down there. These lovely hot summer nights are providing the best back drop to all night long mischief!</p>
<p>There'll be another mix coming very soon...</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey people, it's that time again when I feast your ears with some lovely funky, vocal, uplifting house music. This time i've decided to introduce you to the Glasshouse Podcast which this episode is mixed by myself. It's another blend of the tunes I know you'll love, still with my own style even though it's for someone else's podcast but in a couple of weeks time i'll be releasing another Leeds House Music Podcast so don't panic it's still around and still going strong. To keep the episodes coming more frequently i'll be releasing new episodes on the Glasshouse Podcast alongside my own, on the same feed so that you should get a new mix every couple of weeks. How good is that!</p>

<p>Right i'll leave you to the music, let me know if you want to know the name of a track or if you have any ideas for future releases.</p>

<p>You can catch me DJing live for Glasshouse at Mezz in Leeds regularly so come down and say hello. It's always nice to meet my listeners.</p>

<p>Bye for now and if I don't speak to you all again beforehand, for those that are celebrating Christmas, I hope you have a lovely time and those that aren't, enjoy your time off work!</p>

<p>All the best for 2009!</p>

<p>Rob x</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Hey, here is the latest episode of Love the Music by the Leeds House Music Podcast. Apologies for the delay in getting this out to you, i've been busy organising a new Saturday daytime clubbing event with a fellow DJ, Liam Tate. It's called SKU-IF and it's going to run on the last Saturday of every month at a club called MyHouse in Leeds city centre (formerly Stinkys). It's the perfect venue for our new event, it has a really big walled outdoor garden area and a Funktion One sound system. It was voted in the top 100 clubs in the world by DJmag in 2008!<br/><br/>It isn't a funky event, the music is kinda wonky, harder, fidgety and really bouncy. It's difficult to put it in one genre because it has bits of everything in it. This month in the main room we have Eddie Zanetti, Dale Castell, Matt Fear and residents myself, Liam Tate and Stuart Robb. We have an alternative room and each month we will host a different style of music. The event is all about bringing the fun back into clubbing and bringing fresh new talent and underground music to the perfect venue! This month we have David Ryan and Smith'N West'N tearing up the alternative room with turbo charged funky house and electro. I'll also be DJing later in the evening in the alternative room.<br/><br/>Come along if you can, it would be great if you came and said hello to me. Not that I don't have any friends, it's just nice to meet new folk!<br/><br/>This months podcast is my old blend of charged funky house and electro. It's something to get you dancing and ready for your summer holidays.<br/><br/>Tracklisting<br/><br/>1. Touch My Body (Seamus Haji &amp; Paul Emanuel Club Remix) - Mariah Carey<br/>2. Getting Ready (Wideboys Miami Mix) - K-Klass<br/>3. Keep This Fire Burning (WaWa Remix) - Beverly Knight<br/>4. ABC (Extended Mix) - Freemason ft. Jackson 5<br/>5. Boost Up Your Life (Fred De F Mix) - Laurent Schark and Frank Savannah feat. Jerri Lee<br/>6. Dance (Carl Ryden Remix) - Chanel<br/>7. Drive Out (Thomas Gold &amp; Francesco Diaz Remix) - Sunfreakz<br/>8. Keep On Rising (N.O.T. Remix) - Ian Carey ft. Michelle Shellars<br/>9. Do It (Ian Carey Remix) - Prom ft. Katherine Ellis<br/>10.

			<title>Leeds House Music Podcast - Sixteenth Edition</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://rhedley.libsyn.com/leeds_house_music_podcast_sixteenth_edition]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Hello everyone and welcome to the sixteenth edition of the Leeds House Music Podcast. I've gone for something a little different this time. The mix starts of funky but leads into some electro towards the end. I'm personally not a big fan of electro but I like the tracks i've included as you can still dance easily to them and they have been popular around Leeds clubs. My mission is to still keep it funky but I thought I would try something different for a change. Please send your feedback, even if you didn't like it i'd love to know so that I can keep improving the format of the show.

            <description><![CDATA[Hello everyone, here is a bonus podcast for you all whilst I get the next proper one ready. I'm using it for a DJ competition i'm entering at Back2Mine at Stinkys Peephouse in Leeds. I've handed my demo CD in so we'll just have to wait and see if they like it. So I thought you would all like to listen to it. It's only 30 minutes but it's jam packed full of great tunes and some cool special effects I have been working on.


Enjoy!

			<title>Leeds House Music Podcast - Seventh Edition</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://rhedley.libsyn.com/leeds_house_music_podcast_seventh_edition]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Hello everyone and thank you again for downloading the latest episode of the Leeds House Music Podcast.<BR><BR>

Before I start with the music i've just got a couple of shout outs. Firstly, i'd like to thank Laurence Jenkins for helping me select a cracking set of tunes. It's no joke when I say that Mr L is a walking musical encyclopedia, he knows the name of virtually any house track just from listening to them! You can thank him yourself by leaving him a message on his myspace page which is <a href="http://www.myspace.com/soul_avenger">http://www.myspace.com/soul_avenger</a><BR><BR>

My final shout out is to my brother Gareth (DJ Hardstyler) who helped me create the voice overs i've introduced into this podcast. Thanks bro!<BR><BR>

Right then, this episode is a bumper edition which i'm sure you're all going to love to bits. The first mix is by yours truly and the second mix is by one of Leeds best house music DJ's, Miss Melodie. Miss Melodie has a residency at SpeedQueen and normally plays funky funky house however just for us she's treating us to a dirtier house mix. If you've been out in Leeds over the last year or so, you will have noticed that the dirtier side of house is taking dominace in the majority of popular clubs. Don't worry though i'll keep the flag waving for funky, disco, vocal house! You can check out Miss Melodie's MySpace page at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/missdjlady">http://www.myspace.com/missdjlady</a><BR><BR>

The mix is about 89.5 minutes long so you should be able to squeeze it onto a 90 minute audio CD, should you wish to do so.<BR><BR>

Enjoy and as always, comments please.<BR><BR>

Well I figure you'll probably appreciate it's arrival more if you've been waiting in anticipation. Hopefully over the coming months I won't be so busy so with luck they will be more regular.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the truly amazing feedback! I'm so happy that you enjoy my music. I admit my beat matching isn't perfect (it's getting much better), but i'm not a professional just an enthusiast with a good ear for music so hopefully that makes it a bit more authentic and of course comes from your own perspective, not from behind the DJ box.</p>
<p>Right lets go....</p>
<p>This edition is jam packed full of goodies. Moving from smooth gospel vocals to upbeat disco and finally onto a few delicious floor fillers and to make up for it's late arrival i've made it longer than usual so it should keep you bopping and build you up ready for your big night out, where ever and when ever that may be...sing along my lovelies!</p>
<p>Oh and thank you again (all 10,325 of you!) I think this might be the best one yet.</p>
<p>Track listing<br/>1. Melba Moore - My Heart Belongs To You<br/>2. Two Half ft. Wendy Lewis - Praise His Name Part 2<br/>3. Jack 'n' Daniels vs. Aretha Franklin - Pride A Deeper Love (Vocal Pride)<br/>4. Britalies &amp; Junior John - 2 Late 4 Goodbyes<br/>5. Teamsters - Feels Like Love (Morjac Club Mix)<br/>6.

It kind of reminds you that you've hit the peak of the night when you hear it, you'll know what I mean. :-)

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome worldwide listeners to the new and hopefully enjoyable, Leeds House Music Podcast.

Monthly we will take a look at what tracks are hot around the Leeds house music club scene and occasionally foray into the past reminiscing with old time classics and tracks that might have passed you by. We will take in popular funky, disco, glam house genres and occasionally move onto something a bit more electro.

I've been around the UK club scene and I can tell you without doubt that Leeds has one of the most vibrant and interesting house music club circuits about. It has a wide variety of nights ranging from well established nights such as the weekly Speed Queen (personal favourite) to relative new comers such as the monthly Kiss da Funk which has won rapturous applause from all patrons and industry types alike!

Hopefully this monthly podcast will give you a taste of what Leeds has on offer and hopefully will entice you into a weekend visit!

If you are thinking of visiting Leeds for a night out and would like recommendations for a cracking night, let me know and I will do my best to help you out.

Likewise if you have any recommendations, feedback or there is anything you would like to see on this podcast then please let me know and I'll see what I can do.

Finally, I would welcome any contributions to this blog / podcast so if you would like to submit a guest mix then please do so and I will consider what you have to offer. Space is limited and costly so if at first you don't get on then do not fret or grumble, you will probably get onto the next broadcast.

Hopefully we can get a little community of Leeds-goers on here enjoying what we love best, house music!

Enjoy and much love,

Robert :-)
