    <title>Rhyme Tyme w/ DJ Peter Parker</title>
    <link>http://rhymetyme.podomatic.com</link>
    <description>&quot;Rhyme Tyme&quot; is the ultimate in hip hop radio.  You can't ask for more.  The combination of live guests performing and hot records being spun is the perfect balance.  And you know the show motto, &quot;More Rappin And Less Flappin&quot;.  So unecessary talk and screaming over records is not happening.

      <title>Episode 11 (1/23/04) - The Killa Sha Hour</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1026239/600x600_2541559.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off let me start by saying &#8220;R.I.P. Killa Sha&#8221;!!!  I&#8217;m damn near speechless.  This shit came out of nowhere.  I was fortunate to work closely with Sha for many years.  He was the epitome of hip hop.  On the mic he was a beast and he more than held his weight on the turntables.  On a personal note, Sha was one of the funniest cats I ever had the pleasure to be around.  His wit and magnetic personality are clearly demonstrated in the 46 episodes of Rhyme Tyme we co-hosted together.  In memory of Killa Sha I'd like to open up The Spider's Web vaults and present Episode #11 &quot;The Killa Sha Hour&quot;.  God bless the dead.

6) No One (Remix) = Killa Sha w/ Maxwell

10) Mic Break #1 / interview = Killa Sha
11) Down And Out In New York City = Killa Sha

Can someone tell me why this show isn't syndicated on Sirius or XM?  Not only have we got the world premier of Diamond D's new joint with Large Professor, we've got hot new exclusives from Show and AG, Common, Jay Dee, Raekwon, Trife Da God, Styles with AZ, and many many more.  As always there's a special guest up in &quot;The Web&quot; too.  Ras Beats is on the wheels of steel for the second half of the show providing turntable treats for your enjoyment.  So now you got two hip hop veterans in the house.  Speaking of which, peep the picture of DJ Peter Parker learning how to scratch from his father pretty much before he could walk.

This is from the historic Roadium Mixtape series which was sold exclusively at the L.A. swap meats.  Entitled &quot;86 In The Mix&quot;, Dr. Dre takes mixtapes to the next level incorporating multitrack recorders and other high end recording equipment.  At times you can hear 3 or 4 records being mixed at the same time all while Dre is scratchin on top of em.  He burns through literally 300 records or more so a tracklist is non existent. If anyone can compile a tracklist I will personally big them up as the &quot;king of hip hop&quot;.  Much props to Dr. Dre for creating such a masterpiece.  If you didn't know now you know.  This could be one of the illest mixtapes ever!!!</description>

Contractual obligations have my hands tied and my time filled.  Then it's back to the normal weekly routine.  And I can't wait.  This slowed down pace is driving me nuts.  Since this is an off week I decided to hit you with one of the illest of all the Rhyme Tyme episodes.  This is the infamous &quot;Wu Years Show&quot; that broadcasted New Year's Eve 2006.  I dug deep in the crates and spun nothing but the illest and rarest Wu-Tang records I could find.  Also this is the historic first appearance where Trife Da God, Kryme Life, and Tommy Whispers air it out for nearly 15 minutes over the &quot;Murdergram&quot; Instrumental.  Did someone say hip hop is dead?  Certainly isn't in The Spider's Web.  It stays poppin over here!  Thanks for listening.

1) Rhyme Tyme Theme Song = P-Dap

3) Pass The Bone = Genius

8) Run = Cappadonna
9) Mic Break #1 / Interview = Trife Da God
10) Put It On The Line = Trife Da God

12) Mic Break #2 / Freestyle = Trife Da God, Kryme Life, &amp; Tommy Whispers
13) Don&#8217;t U Know Pt. 2 = Ol Dirty Bastard
14) Mr. Sandman = Method Man w/ RZA, Inspectah Deck, Street Life, and Carlton Fisk
15) Fear, Love, And War = Killarmy
