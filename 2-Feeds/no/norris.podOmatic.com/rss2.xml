      <itunes:summary>&quot;The Many Roads to Japan&quot; tells the story of the adventures of a conscientious objector who had to follow many twists and turns in his life journey before finding his niche in Japan. Suitable for low intermediate level and above ESL and EFL students. An excellent resource for peace education studies, too.

&quot;The Many Roads to Japan influenced my students a lot, not only in studying English but also in searching for their own identities and thinking about how to live their lives.&quot; -- Kazuyo Yamane, Peace Studies lecturer at Kochi University

      <title>11. Final Episode - Autumn Shadows in August </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/12140/600x600_630489.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modeled roughly on Malcolm Lowry's &quot;Dark as the Grave Wherein My Friend is Laid,&quot; &quot;Autumn Shadows in August&quot; is part homage to Lowry and Hermann Hesse, part mushroom retrospective, and part middle-aged love story. David Thompson is an expatriate American teaching at a Japanese university and suffering from hepatitis C. His wife Kaori is recovering from cancer surgery. Feeling a strong sense of their own mortality, confusion about the significance of what they have done with their lives, and a need to escape the constrictions of their life in Japan, the two set out on a journey to Europe to retrace a path from David's adventurous youth and locate a German benefactor from the past. What lies ahead--a trip througth the Magic Theater, a sudden death, an encounter with Lowry's ghost, and a descent into the Capuchin Crypt in Rome--will change their lives irrevocably.
