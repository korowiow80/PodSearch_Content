			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professional traders understand that it is not the system or strategy for entering and exiting trades that will make a trader wildly profitable. Traders need to learn how to manage their risk and how to preserve capital during times when the system or strategy is not performing very well.</p>
<p>So what are the characteristics of a good trading system or strategy? Well, the main thing is that it must provide the trader with a defined edge. This edge simply means that, over the long run, there is a probability of success. For instance, all games in a gambling house provide an edge to the house.</p>
<p>If you are interested in seeing a proven, profit-making, no BS, automatic Forex trader that DOES product results, then visit <b><a href="http://www.prlog.org/10812105-team-xtreme-pip-poacher-says-we-are-different.html">Xtreme Pip Poacher</a></b> for more information.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the long run, the house is always profitable, because it systematically employs this edge ALL the time. This edge may only be that the house wins 51% of the time. But if the payout is the same, whether the house wins or loses, it will come out on top in the long run.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The No Loss Robot is a relatively new Forex robot (Expert Advisor) that has come to make its presence truly felt in the fast moving and competitive Forex market. It trades automatically on your computer without any input required from you. The program will enter and exit trades for you at all hours of the day and night. All you need to get started is a computer, an Internet connection, and you&#8217;re set. No big investment required, it works with any account size, and trades all currency pairs.</p>
<p>To begin with, this software can be easily purchased and downloaded. Once you have installed it, this robot will be all ready to trade for you. It has the ability to read and understand complex trading numbers, graphs and charts. Many users have commented that here is a robot that is very independent and is able to work on its own, without any help from its owner.</p>
<p>If you are not confident to begin trading using real money, the developers of this program have made it possible for you to play the market with virtual money. You can start with what is called a demo account and once you are comfortable with the The No Loss Robot trading style, you can switch to trading with real cash.</p>
<p>No Loss Robot functions in a MetaTrader 4 platform which most brokers provide their clients with. It is connected to a Forex broker as long as the platform is open on your computer, and remains connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>The trading system that the No Loss Robot uses is derived from its own manual trading system we used for several years to much success.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A good forex trading education should include in its program the basics on margins, types of orders and leveraging as these are essential in the forex market transactions. Currencies are always traded in twos and are traded electronically.<span class="status"> MCGSMJWPK2R3 </span></p>
<p>The Forex market is not in a physical place, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Here we will show you, where to find the best free forex education and some free systems which you can use which have made millions in real time trading. There is no better teacher than experience, they say, and as forex trading is as real as it can get, forex courses should offer avenues where the student can practice trading.</p>
<p>The fundamentals of Foreign Exchange are fairly simple. If you want to learn Forex trading for free and develop your own Forex trading strategy you can and you don&#8217;t need to pay a cent. There are many websites on the internet where you can practice Forex trading by making simulated trades without using real money. It is important that a forex trading course develops the appropriate values needed in money trading, such as discipline, patience and commitment.</p>
<p>If the Forex market has captured your imagination, talk to your financial adviser to ensure that you have a good understanding of currency trading. Always remember, with the proper knowledge about trading Forex, the better your chances will be to profit in this financial market. They are referred to as an OTC market, or &#8220;over-the-counter. A good forex trading course should provide real life experience through apprenticeship.</p>
<p>You will want to minimize your losses when you first get going. As the stakes are upped, a trader may become too emotionally involved. More than the theories and the basics involved, a good forex trading education should teach you proper money management and the development of a proper trading disposition and psychology.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are unique benefits to trading the Forex market, but you need to understand exactly how each trade you enter works. The most important Forex market is the spot market as it has very large volume. Fear and greed are, without a doubt, the foes of the successful Forex trader. In other words, why you are entering a trade, and being able to keep a calm easy mind.</p>
<p>The market is called the spot market because trades are settled immediately, or &#8220;on the spot&#8221;. With Forex trading there are also considerable risk factors. Momentum analysis is a measure of the change in Forex trading trends over a certain period of time. Fundamental analysis involves the use of economic data, critical political decisions or the different social issues that influence prices. It is not necessary to use a large variety of indicators, usually 2-3 are quite sufficient, especially if you are combining indicators with price patterns.</p>
<p>It is seriously important that you completely understand the implications of margin trading and the particular pitfalls and opportunities that foreign exchange trading offers. A good chart is priceless if it helps to identify a great opportunity. What about the left side, or the side of your chart that is telling you what has already happened?</p>
<p>Technical analysis focuses on price action and market behavior. Certain momentum indicators will show if a currency is overbought or oversold, and these are common and very helpful tools for technical analysis. First, technical analysis focuses on price patterns and uses charting to differentiate them. Interest and employment are major economic data that could move the market considerably.</p>
<p>The indicators are available on most trading software, and all calculations are done automatically within the software. The second is fundamental analysis - regards price behavior as a product of economic and political events.</p>
<p>Trading robots that have made a big scene in the Forex industry is the No Loss Robot. So, what makes the No Loss Robot so popular among traders?</p>
<p>No Loss Robot is a continuous working machine. It can work overnight without any human intervention. As long as your computer is turned on, the software will keep on working and trading for your profit. This is a good feature since the trader will not have to worry about missing out on the big trades.</p>
<p>Monitoring, updating, analyzing, computing and comparing; these are all what the No Loss Robot can offer a trader. And with these tasks, profit is very much seen from this popular robot. However, a skeptical mind may also first try the system out to avoid inconveniences in the future. This will determine if the No Loss Robot software will work with the trader&#8217;s style of dealing.</p>
<p>The Forex market offers the trader many opportunities and can be very lucrative to trade and also very exciting.
