<p>In this episode you will learn while the lease option is ultimate investing strategy.  This episode, like many of my shows are taught with real stories and real deals that I have personally made money on.  I share them with you because I know if you take massive action, you can have the same results.

<p>1. Why you MUST learn how to invest without using your own cash or credit</p>
<p>2. Why the lease option is one of the most powerful vehicles to acquire property.</p>
<p>3. How to put together a win-win transaction by listening to a sellers needs</p>
<p>4. How to net $70,000 on one of your first deals without knowing everything (hint: this is huge).  If this scares you, I can teach you how to make less money&#8230;(yes, I am being sarcastic).</p>
<p>5. How you can find a buyer for your property even if you are out of state!</p>
<p>6. How to collect huge chunks of cash at the beginning of your deals</p>
<p>7. How to partner with a seller to create a monster cash cow</p>
