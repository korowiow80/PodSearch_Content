*this episode has some explicit language*

YO!

What a wonderfully busy and eye-opening month August has been for me.  One week I dj'd a women's music festival with the most fierce line-up of artists (myspace.com/serafemme).  The week following, I performed on the mic with some more incredible female artists, and the experience, again, was simply magical (myspace.com/sapphosreturn).  This weekend (it just doesn't stop), I'm modeling and dj'ing a fashion show benifiting aids (www.womynzbrunchbunch.org), going to an opening casting call for America's Next Top Model and also working a gig where I'll  be doing a meet and greet with Country artist, Toby Keith... And, I know it will no longer be August, but to finish my 4 week-long extravaganza, I'll be dj'ing an event that I helped logistically plan in the beginning stages, with Margaret Cho poppin' in to do a lil' somethin'-somethin' herself (Sept 7-9th :: myspace.com/tongue2tonguela)  


It's been a crazy summer all around, I must say!  Photos are always up at myspace.com/djnovajade and also at my private account (myspace.com/terag), but I have to get a message first for the terag account to add you.  


With all that said and done, here's your playlist for today, August 31, 2007.  Stay tuned as in the coming weeks, I'll also be starting dj'ing at local university, USC... :-)

Thank you for listening. Please spread the word! And VOTE for me for DJ MAG'S TOP 100 DJs.  Voting closes on 25th September. Results announced at a glittering party in London on 24th October (details to follow soon), and this list is so meaningful for djs.  Tell all your friends to go to this link:

and remember the name:  DJ NOVA JADE

Thank you!

Stay zen,
