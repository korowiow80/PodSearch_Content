        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Join the incredible masked podcasters as they take you through an amazing journey through time, space, and reality!  Through a process that is so intricate it is almost unintelligible, they weave mindblowing connections between apparently disconnected events, people, and places.  Marvel as they reveal for the first time amazing conspiracies and explain subtle connections which elucidate all of reality.  All this is carefully woven into a shimmering tapestry designed to keep the listener's grasp on reality as tenuous as possible.  If that's not all, the masked podcasters reveal unheard of knowledge of 1970s and 80s tv shows, technology, science fact AND fiction, apple II computers, and pretty much everything else.  They are even accurate on occasion!]]></itunes:summary>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/notinsane/not_insane_006.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In this episode, our completely sane masked podcasters desperately try to avoid discussing the mysterious Z-Machines. They gabble frantically about serotonin, perfectionism, homebrew adventure games, and murderous alien nymphomania.

But can they avoid the horrible torment of the Z-machines? Well, probably not. But I wanted to give you a brief feeling of hope. Enjoy.<br/><br type="_moz"/>]]></description>
