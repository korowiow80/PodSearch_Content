He recorded the song &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; - it was released in 1978. His baby girl, Lalah Hathaway, recorded her own version of the same song in 2011 - 33 years later. Tonight I'll pay special tribute to Donny and I'll talk to Pete Peterkin - the man who wrote &quot;You Were Meant for Me.&quot; I'll also play his mixed version of the old and the new - Donny and Lalah singing &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; - together.</description>

      <title>Teena Marie tribute</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1164764/600x600_3810737.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teena Marie was born Mary Christine Brockert in 1956 in Santa Monica, CA. She grew up in the Oakwood region of Venice, CA &#8211; a region often referred to as Venice Harlem because of the large African American population. Her surroundings played a significant role in her life and her music career. She can be heard paying ho-mage to her hometown in the 1980 release &#8220;Irons in the Fire&#8221;. Teena was affectionately called Lady T.

She is no stranger to stardom. As a child she had an acting role on The Beverly Hillbillies as Tina Marie Brockert. At the age of 10 she was asked to sing at the wedding of one of Jerry Lewis&#8217; sons. Her life path continued to be connected with unlikely pairings until her untimely death last week. Teena Marie paired up with funk rocker Rick James and history was forever changed.

Teena signed a record deal with Motown records in 1976. Her first hit was &#8220;I&#8217;m Just a Sucker for Your Love&#8221; from her debut album &#8220;Wild and Peaceful&#8221;. Rick James co-produced and sang backup on the hit. That album did not include the face of Teena on the album cover &#8211; in the same fashion as African American musicians were marketed in the 50&#8217;s and 60&#8217;s &#8211; because the record label was not sure how the African American community would receive her as a white singer singing soul music. She was even thought to be a light-skinned Black person. Once she was found out to be white she would forever be called the Ivory Queen of Soul. Her relationship with Rick James continued over the years &#8211; both romantically and musically until his untimely death in 2004. Over the next three decades Teena primarily wrote and produced every album after that &#8211; with the exception on one. Her sophomore project &#8211; Lady T &#8211; was produced by Richard Rudolph &#8211; less than a year after the death of his wife Minnie Riperton. The album was dedicated to Riperton. In fact Rudolph and Riperton&#8217;s daughter, actress Maya Rudolph, can be heard at the end of the track &#8220;To Many Colors (Tee&#8217;s Interlude)&#8221;. Teena was Maya&#8217;s godmother.

In 1982, Teena was involved in a heated legal battle with Motown Records. The battle was over her contract and the release of new material. Teena took Motown to court and that lawsuit resulted in the Brockert Initiative making it illegal for record companies to keep an artist under contract without releasing any of that artist&#8217;s new material. That law helped the likes of Luther Vandross who was having similar conflict with his record label.

Teena Marie went on to sign with Epic Record in 1983 with modest success including the 1990 hit &#8220;If I Were a Bell&#8221;. 

During the 90&#8217;s Teena took a break from the music world to raise her daughter Alia Rose who is pursuing her own singing career under the stage name &quot;Rose Le Beau&quot; yet music lovers were no stranger to her sound. Hip hop artists sampled several of her tunes. The Fugees reworked her 1988 hit &#8220;Oh La La La&#8221; to their own &#8220;Fu-Gee&#8217;La&#8221;.

The Fugees weren&#8217;t the only hip hop heads with an eye on Teena Marie. Cash Money Records, known for such acts as Lil Wayne and Juvenile, signed her under their Cash Money Classics label and produced LaDona in 2004 and Sapphire in 2006. LaDona went gold and became her highest charting album of her career.

Teena Marie&#8217;s final album on the Stax label &#8211; Congo Square was star studded to say the least. The personnel included the likes of George Duke, MC Lyte, Faith Evans and Shirley Murdock. Teena&#8217;s daughter Rose Lebeau wrote and sang backup on one of the tracks. Teena felt a special connection with Faith Evans and paralleled their careers &#8211; referring to their relationships and lost love in Rick James and Notorious B.I.G.
Teena Marie admitted to having a prescription drug dependency for a short time following the death of former lover and co-collaborator Rick James. Their project &#8220;Happy&#8221; may sum up their relationship.

On December 26, 2010 Teena&#8217;s daughter was unable to wake her from a mid-afternoon nap. It has been reported that Teena suffered a grand mal seizure about a month ago and after that did not want to be left unattended while she slept. Although autopsy reports are incomplete drugs or foul play have been ruled out as a cause of death. 

Teena Marie&#8217;s death rocked the music world. Twitter and Facebook updates alerted the world of her passing. Mary J. Blige, Lalah Hathaway and Questlove, and Jazmine Sullivan all posted tweets of remembrances and tributes to Lady T. Lenny Kravitz posted a video expressing his appreciation for Teena &#8211; she had taken him in her home when he was just starting out as a struggling musician. It has been said Teena gave Lenny his first guitar. The music world has asked if there will ever be another white female artist to be received in the R&amp;B world after Teena Marie. The answer is simple &#8211; after Teena Marie there will be no other.
