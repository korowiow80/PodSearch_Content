    <title>Brogan Sessions</title>
    <link>http://djchrisbrogan.podomatic.com</link>
    <description>Chirs Brogan has been setting the Electro &amp; Progressive house seen atwitter with a rampant start to his DJ career, seeing him skyrocket at an amazing pace from obscurity to international stardom 

From Fabric where Chris started his journey to play in many of the well known clubs to warehouse parties across London. Moving quickly Chris spread his sound of  progressive house to some of the clubs across the continent of Europe like France, Belgium, Denmark, Greece &amp; Germany and  Sweden and internationally in Brazil and Mexico. 

In addition to DJing, one of Chris&#8217;s passion is to be able to work on his own production of music which give him chance to showcase his creativity on the dance floor in more ways than one on what he is capable of doing in the future.

      <title>OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!!!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1235778/600x600_6498767.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARE YOU READY? ARE YOU READY FOR THIS???

Welcome to my june podcast/promo mix/bit of fun.

It's been a while since my last mix, apologies for the delay. I wanted to make one that was FUN! It's a blend of summer tweaks, disco flicks, dirty beats and trancy chic!

As it's the Jubilee Celebrations weekend I thought I'd use a quote from another &quot;famous&quot; Queen:

OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!!!

All tracks carefully selected for a summer feel so you can enjoy the Jubilee weekend (hopefully in the sun!)

Track listing available on request.

Quick thanks to:

Mark Rader (fab party!) - Michael &amp; Rob - Munty Towers - WOW - Tim @ Tonker and all the Soho Gyms Crew for the Hed Kandi Clapham nights!</description>

We have a few vintage divas on this one. Opening with Lulu... YES LULU!! I've also included my exclusive Madonna bootleg and a great new take on Tina Arena!

All blended with some exclusive edits, great disco, dash of house and a sprinkle of 80s.

Big shout outs to all the crew at WOW Cardiff, Jamie H thank you so much for the opportunity! To the Hubby, Michael Zreika and Rob Molloy (fab power couple!) and to Herr Doktor. He finally found the info bit of my podcasts ;-)

A very happy birthday to Gary! 

Finally... Some news for your all... BabyCakes will be launched as a club night in Cardiff very soon in hopes to bring it to London! I'll be posting some more news on my facebook page very soon!</description>

This is a celebratory podcast after reaching number 1 on Juno download and not far behind on DJDownload with my first release: TEMPER

As you know I've selfishly promoting it with SorryShoes Records and am so pleased it's been recognised by the great producers and DJs out there. I can tell you my next release &quot;Green Means Go&quot; will be up and ready very soon.

If you need the playlist drop me a line but please show your support and purchase Temper which is featured here:

http://www.junodownload.com/artists/Chris+Brogan/tracks/

And here's the shootouts: to all the people who never believed in me or those who thought I wasn't worth it. Your rejection became my motivation&#8230;

To Jed, thank you for continuing to be my muse. To Jo, keep smiling, this one's for both of you!

Oh and to you, yes YOU!!! Thank you for downloading, playing, posting, reposting, following and facebooking me. I'm blessed to be doing something that means a lot to and your support is as always very valued.</description>

Unfortunately I did not spend it by the beaches of the White Isle this year. I plan to next year.

I have not been to Ibiza in nearly 3 years, guess an appearance needs to be made. In the meantime I've selected some of the best Space Terrace inspired tracks out there at the moment.

Lucky podcast number 13?

Well I hope you enjoy this one as much as I do...

      <itunes:summary>Right... Summer is nearly done and dusted. Unfortunately I did not spend it by the beaches of the White Isle this year. I plan to next year.

I have not been to Ibiza in nearly 3 years, guess an appearance needs to be made. In the meantime I've selected some of the best Space Terrace inspired tracks out there at the moment.

Lucky podcast number 13?

Well I hope you enjoy this one as much as I do...
