He is also known for his devotion to create a strong emotional experience for the listener in every mix he creates. 

So get ready and let your mind travel far away on this timeless journey through mind and soul, time and space. Enjoy life!

	<title>The FreshAir Sessions Vol. 1 (2011) - mixed by DJ River (funky house)</title>
	<description>Mix description¬
Premiere for a new genre.. funky house, london style!
-I got inspired to make this mix after a visit to London and the famous night club 'FIRE' back in 2006.
In this first mix I want to take you back in time, and bring back those memorable club nights!
In the coming sessions, I will progress into more of today's funky house, but in the same london style! ;)
Enjoy! /DJ River

REVIEW: I've just finished listening to all the songs from the FreshAir Session Vol. 1 on youtube individually. Before you had mixed them that is. :) I did this to get a real sense of appreciation for all your work you put into your mixes. You transform all these songs into something else entirely, purely in a positive and improved way. While the originals sound good, the way you mix, mingle, and create these mixes makes them completely unique. I have already lost count as to how many times i have listened to the FreshAir mix now haha.

	<description>Remix/Mashup description¬
-My very first mashup remix! You might recognize the lyrics in this one, from the classic tune from the 90's eurodance band Snap! - 'Exterminate'.
In this mashup the tune is based on the newer electronic artist Cristian Paduraru - 'Masterpiece'. Enjoy. /DJ River</description>

	<title>Shapeshifters - Lola's Theme (DJ River ChillHouse Mix)</title>
	<description>REVIEW: Starts with high quality sounds, very nice atmosphere. Melodies are great overall, guitars, bass etc. are nicely balanced with each other. Brass sections work aswell. I didn't remember the original song right away, but now it came my mind, very nice going in this remix.
Drums are mostly basic, but simple is beautiful here. Bass drum is soft enough and fits perfectly to the songs atmosphere. Other sounds fit in nicely also. Overall work very well and the track sounds pro from beginning to end. Very nice remix and atmosphere is just great. Vocals are professional of course. Very very enjoyable and smooth track.

	<title>Liquid Nonsense Vol. 1 - mixed by DJ River (mysterious psychill/ambient)</title>
	<description>REVIEW: Dont expect to jump around the room to this music, dont expect constant, pumping baselines. What you get in DJ Rivers Liquid Nonsense Vol. 1 is a cruisy glide through the spectral realm of Ambient &amp; Psychill. It's relaxing at times, with deep throbs sounding like heartbeats underneath chime-like piano samples; at other places it is like a cold and foreign world.
Liquid Nonsense Vol. 1 wont give you the same old tunes you may expect from DJ River, but it will hopefully excite and intrigue you with the fore-taste of Rivers new adventure into a refreshing genre of electronic music.

	<title>The Mind Expander (Part I) - mixed by DJ River (deepchill/ambient)</title>
	<description>REVIEW: Smooth, mature and impressively thought out. Seamless movement and agile transitions make for a dreamlike experience. DJ River demonstrates his mastery over sound and feeling, captivating the mind and caressing the senses. Fall into a soft, deep armchair and be embraced by the music. Perfection.

	<title>Deep Psychedelic Trip Mix 1 - mixed by DJ River (trippy house/trance)</title>
	<description>REVIEW: Very nice atmospheric start, reminiscent of Banco De Gaia. Slowly builds up into a perfectly blended set. Paced enough for a seasoned follower of Psy and accessible enough for those who have not dabbled in the genre before. I rate this set very highly. :)

	<title>Thrill Trance Experience - mixed by DJ River (euphoric trance)</title>
	<description>-:Thrillseekers Tribute:-

REVIEW: Hey DJ River,
first of all I would like to say "Thank You" for this brilliant mix! I haven't listened to trance music for more than 1 1/2 years. Now, at the beginning of your mix, I really started crying, because "Dreaming Of You" is one of my favourite songs! I really love your mix because I keep thinking at the only person, I deeply love. :)
Best wishes,
