      <title>Live from Ghostship IV: The Afterlife</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1450/600x600_6140892.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each Halloween I am continually impressed with the amazing energy and time that comes together to pull off the annual Ghostship event.  This year was of course no exception.  I was able to show up early with good friends to enjoy all of the artwork and give praise and thanks to everyone who worked so hard to plan the party.  Had a super fun time rocking out to Trav and Murphstars sets before taking the Ghostship stage.  After a few beers I will be honest that I kinda thought that the stage was moving when people starting swinging that giant pirate ship back and forth behind me.  Thanks to everyone that rocked out and made another year at Ghostship a super awesome one.   p.s. Big ups to the other DJ Lance Rocks who came up to take pictures with me and to the fire marshall who was naive enough to think that I was the only DJ at the party.  DJ Space Cowboy strikes again.

      <title>Live from Yuri's Night - April 2011</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1450/600x600_4337820.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a father of 2 young kids, there are lots of places that I associate with being the go-to &#8220;kid friendly&#8221; places to visit in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The Academy of Sciences is definitely one of those spots.  As a result, we often miss out on really getting to enjoy the museum as we are chasing out kids past all of the interesting stuff.  So the Thursday night Nightlife event has been an excellent way us to enjoy the museum.  Combining the event with Yuri&#8217;s Night made for a really fun night with lots of smiling faces.  For my set inside of the museum I stuck to a basic recipe of booty shakin&#8217; funky disco house.  Hope you enjoy!

      <title>Breakfast of Champions 2011 (Live Set) </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1450/600x600_4195503.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakfast of Champions continues to be my favorite event of the year.  Despite all of the wet weather and long lines, a swarm of smiling faces always turns out to enjoy this New Years day tradition.  This year was no exception.  With the biggest turnout and largest covered outdoor stage to date, BOC 2011 has one of the best yet.  Thanks to everyone who came out to enjoy the fun and rock out on the dance floor with me!

For this BOC set, I wanted to combine some newer funky disco house tracks with a few vinyl classics from the Brad Robinson archive.  The set kicks off with a 1993 Bjork remix that I only play on special occasions.  I also mixed in a classic Sagat track from 1994 remixed by none other than Armand Van Helden.    

Enjoy!!!

Track Listing:
Bjork - Big Time Sensuality (Justin Robertson Lionrock Wigout 1993 Mix)
Dr. Kucho - It Must Be Love 
Andy Gramm &amp; Victor Kraay - What
Patrick Wayne - Give it to Me
Crazibiza - My Lips
Jesse Perez - Carol City Susy
Mone - Love Don't Pay the Rent (The Jinks Work Shy Dub)
Phil Fuldner - Miami Pop 2010
Sagat - Luvstuff (Armand Van Helden 1994 Ghetto Mix)
Dr. Kucho - Kung Fu Funk
Serial Thrilla - This Feeling

Thanks for everyone who rocked out with me on the dance floor and I hope that you enjoy this set.  Here's to the beginning of a great new year of dancing.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1450/600x600_619170.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a live set from the annual Spring Smoldering Women festival in Death Valley, CA.  Nothing better that playing house music under the desert stars.  I pulled out a few older classic house tracks and remixes for this set.  Hope you enjoy it!

      <title>Ken's Birthday Bash - Live Set 3-17-07</title>
      <description>This is a fun live set that I recorded at my friend Ken's birthday party, which was hosted last weekend at his amazing flat in San Francisco.  Best part was that all of my closest peeps were there to rock out with me.  Doesn't get any better than that.</description>

      <title>Live from Full Moon Party, Thailand</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1450/600x600_619171.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a set that I recorded in the fall of 2003 at Haad Rin beach on the island of Koh Phagnan, Thailand.  This party that takes place once a month during the full moon, hosts more than 10,000 people with more than 10 sound systems to entertain.  This was an unforgetable experience for me.</description>
