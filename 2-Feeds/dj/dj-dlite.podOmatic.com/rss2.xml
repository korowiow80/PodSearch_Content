      <title>DLite's Essential Prydz</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_6266631.png&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as personal favourites go, Eric Prydz is at the very top of my all time list.  His music has always spoken to me on a level none other has been able to.

All at the same time his music is the essence of progressive house, it is melodic, it is soulful, it is deep, it exudes all kinds of energy, it makes you want to dance, it relaxes you, it takes you to another place and it is the ultimate big room house music sound.  

This episode contains what I consider to be the &#8216;Essential Prydz&#8217; tracks.  I hope I was able to express in this mix what the music has always meant to me&#8230;and I hope you get as much enjoyment and as many good feelings as I do when you listen to it.  He is one of the absolute best and most talented artists electronic music has to offer and this mix will give you a small taste of what is possible.

Enjoy and get your groove on with these Prydz hot tracks:

1.	Pryda  &#8220;Balaton&#8221;
2.	Eric Prydz  &#8220;RYMD&#8221;
3.	Pryda  &#8220;Lift&#8221;
4.	Pryda  &#8220;Rakfunk&#8221;
5.	Pryda  &#8220;With Me&#8221;
6.	Eric Prydz  &#8220;Aftermath (Extended mix)
7.	Switch  &#8220;A Bit Patchy&#8221;  (Eric Prydz remix)
8.	M83  &#8220;Midnight City&#8221;  (Eric Prydz &#8216;Private&#8217; remix)
9.	Pryda  &#8220;Armed&#8221; 
10.	Paolo Mojo  &#8220;1983&#8221;  (Eric Prydz remix)
11.	Eric Prydz  &#8220;Pjanoo&#8221;
12.	Pryda  &#8220;Muranyi&#8221;

      <title>Fresh Air Vol. 1</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_6064727.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to ANOTHER DLite series!  This one is titled &#8220;Fresh Air&#8221;.  The goal here is to find FRESH quality house music and push it around the globe as an antidote of sorts.  

An antidote to what?  Lately it feels like almost anywhere you look there is a Skrillex wannabe just waiting to smash you in the face with some obnoxious electro.  Either that or producers are lining up to try and pass off recycled hooks and drops as &#8220;new and amazing&#8221; tracks.  All sounds the same&#8230;and the masses are devouring it as if it&#8217;s innovative new stuff. 

DLite is here with Volume 1 of FRESH AIR to remind you there is still quality house music out there.  There are still producers and DJs making tracks that you can groove to and that are so good you can&#8217;t resist the pull of the dance floor.  I wanted to mix a set that shows there are old school remixes worth moving to and songs from back in the day worth revisiting.  Prove that there are tracks with the magic disco touch that we still can&#8217;t resist.  Shed some light on progressive that still takes you to another more relaxing place.  

There are tracks with unique combinations of hip hop, electro, soul and funk that offer a FRESH perspective on electronic music.  I&#8217;m trying to give you something unique to help you through the overwhelming mass of SAME.  Want different?  You&#8217;ll love this.

Avoid the sheep and go your own way.  ROCK these hot tracks:

1.	House Repulic  &#8220;Nuggetz&#8221;
2.	Cevin Fisher/Seamus Haji  &#8220;I Love The Music&#8221;  (Manuel De La Mare &amp; Alex Kenji remix)
3.	Richard Grey  &#8220;Lady&#8221;  (Federico Scavo remix)
4.	Gramophonedzie  &#8220;Number One&#8221;  
5.	Soul Central  &#8220;Strings of Life&#8221;  (Supernova remix)
6.	Sebastien Drums ft. Niles Mason &#8220;French Rules&#8221;  (Muzzaik remix)
7.	Oliver Twizt  &#8220;Love Trip&#8221;  (Olav Basoski remix)
8.	Sak Noel  &#8220;Loca People&#8221; (Summertime remix)
9.	TJR  &#8220;Funky Vodka&#8221;
10.	NTFO &amp; Rhadow  &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop&#8221;
11.	Coll Selini &amp; John Harris  &#8220;Essential Love&#8221;
12.	Vitodito &amp; Oza  &#8220;Kawaii&#8221;  (Re-Lectro Extended mix)
13.	Adrian Lux  &#8220;Teenage Crime&#8221;  
14.	Joe Garston  &#8220;The Promise&#8221;
15.	Sebastian Krieg  &#8220;Rei&#8221;

      <title>Episode 29 (December 2011)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_5514849.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has been only a few weeks since our last Episode, but in the Spirit of the Season another episode is already to go!  More along traditional lines for this podcast there&#8217;s a bit of everything in here.  Starts out funky with a good dose of attitude&#8230;but part way through there is a distinct shift in gears.  Get ready to scratch that dancin&#8217; itch because this one&#8217;s gonna make you SHAKE IT.  Not to worry, the finish will let you down gently...

As always, hope you enjoy it and this gives you all the energy you need to get you through the holidays!  Merry Christmas!!

      <itunes:summary>Has been only a few weeks since our last Episode, but in the Spirit of the Season another episode is already to go!  More along traditional lines for this podcast there&#8217;s a bit of everything in here.  Starts out funky with a good dose of attitude&#8230;but part way through there is a distinct shift in gears.  Get ready to scratch that dancin&#8217; itch because this one&#8217;s gonna make you SHAKE IT.  Not to worry, the finish will let you down gently...

As always, hope you enjoy it and this gives you all the energy you need to get you through the holidays!  Merry Christmas!!

      <title>Episode 26 (April 2011) - Spring Is In The Air</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_4218767.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although warmer seasons seem to be late arriving where I am (*ahem, this bitch Winter can piss off already), the thoughts of Spring alone are already warming all of us up!  Using that as inspiration I put this episode together for April of 2011.  All of the tracks are upbeat and original sounds, playful tracks that have the necessary touch of soul.

Thinking of you all down in Miami this week.  Looking forward to all the momentum you create for this wicked music and excited to ride the wave into an amazing summer!!

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_4117831.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no official theme for this episode but there are many common threads that run through it.  Mostly it is a collection of some really cool shit I&#8217;ve come across in the past few months.  There are some other threads here though:  a couple of chances to hear the distinct Morgan Page sound, the debut of my new fave DJ &#8216;Avicii&#8217; on this podcast, and a good funky sound through the middle of the set.  

Lots to listen to and get jacked about.  Enjoy the episode, tell all your friends, and cheer LOUD for spring to get here sooner with it&#8217;s warmer weather!

Love the feedback, keep it coming.  It helps keep the podcast alive and also helps shape the mixes.

      <title>Episode 24 (Feb. 2011) - Axwell Special Edition</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_3944099.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome back!&amp;nbsp; This is a special episode&amp;hellip;full of inspiration.&amp;nbsp; A couple of weeks ago we had the pleasure of seeing Axwell LIVE in concert and it was an amazing treat.&amp;nbsp; FREEZING cold night but he lit the club on fire with HUGE sounds, vocals, big synths, amazing sampling and of course smashing drops.&amp;nbsp; I had another episode lined up but couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself after the concert and put it aside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this set does a good job of conveying the happiness and energy that night.&amp;nbsp; These are a collection of songs produced and remixed by either Axwell alone or in collaboration with another artist.&amp;nbsp; Some brand new tracks and some ageless classics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone should have the chance to hear and FEEL how good shows like that are.&amp;nbsp; There really isn&amp;rsquo;t much that some good house music can&amp;rsquo;t fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me hear from you!&amp;nbsp; Love the feedback&amp;hellip;helps keep the podcast alive and also helps shape the mixes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Welcome back!&amp;nbsp; This is a special episode&amp;hellip;full of inspiration.&amp;nbsp; A couple of weeks ago we had the pleasure of seeing Axwell LIVE in concert and it was an amazing treat.&amp;nbsp; FREEZING cold night but he lit the club on fire with HUGE sounds, vocals, big synths, amazing sampling and of course smashing drops.&amp;nbsp; I had another episode lined up but couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself after the concert and put it aside.&amp;nbsp;
I hope this set does a good job of conveying the happiness and energy that night.&amp;nbsp; These are a collection of songs produced and remixed by either Axwell alone or in collaboration with another artist.&amp;nbsp; Some brand new tracks and some ageless classics.&amp;nbsp;
Everyone should have the chance to hear and FEEL how good shows like that are.&amp;nbsp; There really isn&amp;rsquo;t much that some good house music can&amp;rsquo;t fix.
Let me hear from you!&amp;nbsp; Love the feedback&amp;hellip;helps keep the podcast alive and also helps shape the mixes.

This one has a bit of everything&#8230;my version of Indie House, some deeper tracks, a great Kaskade remix, a really cool, bangin Armand Van Heldan mix, and of course three Progressive tracks to finish the episode out.

      <title>Episode 19 (Jan. 2010) - The Swedish House Mafia</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_2504143.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get into the deets of the episode, I wanted to give you all a heads up that this is the first episode with CHAPTERS!  This means when you play this on your ipod or on itunes you can skip through tracks just like on a CD.  Cool new feature many of you have been asking for awhile about...no more waiting:  Chapters are here!


This episode is all about BIG house music at its best.  BIG sound that gets better the louder it gets so turn it up!!  First couple of songs will ease you in&#8230;but get ready to go! 

The Swedish House Mafia is a group loosely formed by three very talented and high profile DJ/Producer/Remixers from &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; Sweden.  Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso are all known for their big synths and big energy inspiring sounds and together it&#8217;s a hell of a combination.  Depending on who you talk to Eric Prydz (Pryda) could also be included, although either way he is a legend unto himself and deserves to be here.  Their annual parties at WMC in Miami and new weeklies in Ibiza are already known for consistently tearing the house down in the few years they&#8217;ve been throwing them.  So, with some pent up energy I decided to turn to them for inspiration for Episode 19:  The Swedish House Mafia.    

This is definitely peak hour stuff and best used to get your ass movin&#8217;&#8230;so in the gym, on the dancefloor, cleaning the house...or maybe like SKel sometimes you need a bang of a jump in the morning, or need to rock the office at work...if so fire up this mix! =)


Here&#8217;s the tracklisting for this hot track after hot track DLite Session inspired by the Swedish House Mafia:

1. Roger Sanchez  &#8220;Turn on the Music&#8221; (Axwell remix)
2. C-Mos  &#8220;2 Million Ways&#8221;  (Axwell remix)
3. Steve Angello, Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, Laidback Luke  &#8220;Leave The World Behind&#8221;  (Original mix)
4. Dirty South ft. Rudy  &#8220;Let It Go&#8221;  (Axwell remix)
5. Axwell &amp; Dirty South  &#8220;Open Your Heart&#8221;  (Vocal mix)
6. Steve Angello &amp; Laidback Luke ft. Robin S  &#8220;Show Me Love 2009&#8221;  (Extended original mix)
7. TV Rock ft. Rudy  &#8220;In The Air&#8221;  (Axwell remix)
8. Steve Angello  &#8220;Tivoli&#8221;  (Original mix)
9. David Guetta, Sebastian Ingrosso, Dirty South ft. Julie McKnight  &#8220;How Soon Is Now&#8221;  (Extended Version)
10. Temper Traps  &#8220;Sweet Disposition&#8221;  (Axwell &amp; Dirty South remix)
11. Eric Prydz  &#8220;Pjanoo&#8221;  (Original mix)
12. Sebastian Ingrosso  &#8220;Laktos&#8221;  (Original mix)

      <title>Episode 18 (Nov 2009) - SPECIAL EDITION KASKADE INSPIRED</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_2329830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;HI ALL, and welcome back!!&amp;nbsp; Its been a very busy and eventful layoff &lt;img title=&quot;Smile&quot; src=&quot;../../javascripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-smile.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Smile&quot; /&gt; &lt;img title=&quot;Frown&quot; src=&quot;../../javascripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-frown.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Frown&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp; But now that some clarity has descended on life again its time to moooooove on and get back to the music!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to post a regular Episode 19 in short order (hopefully the next two weeks) as I&amp;rsquo;ve got a collection of tracks that are bangers and just itching to get out of your speakers&amp;hellip;but for now you&amp;rsquo;ve got this SPECIAL EDITION DLITE SESSION to keep you going.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Friday we had the pleasure of seeing Kaskade live here in Calgary&amp;hellip;and this time he was awesome enough to sprinkle quite a few of his own tracks into his set that had a decidedly progressive slant to it.&amp;nbsp; It was a very melodic and feel good night with Kaskade at the helm&amp;hellip;so much so that I was inspired to put together my favourite tracks of his, along with some other tracks that share this or that with Kaskade&amp;rsquo;s signature style and sound, into a feel good mix.&amp;nbsp; EDX and Deadmau5 are influences here for sure as well.&amp;nbsp; Above all else:&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listen, feel, and escape to a better place&amp;hellip;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss if I didn&amp;rsquo;t give S Kel big credit here for giving me an awesome reason to get this done&amp;hellip;because noone likes driving that far without good music right? &lt;img title=&quot;Wink&quot; src=&quot;../../javascripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-wink.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Wink&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Houseboat Sessions 2008 (Episode 12)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_1134770.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here it is...another year and another RIPPING two nights at Nielson Beach, Shuswap Lakes, B.C., Canada.  The Saturday night raging beach party was by far the best we've seen on our boating trips and we'll be looking to top it next summer!

WARNING:  This is a BIG mix...approx 2 Hours and 15 Minutes.  Have some patience with the download - any problems let me know.

I've put together a HUGE mix here for memory's sake...some tracks from all over the range.  Poppy to get started, some progressive mixed in, some massive drops, and of course darker and dirtier as it goes along.  The last track is completely mocking of George W. Bush...I love it.  I hope the mix is successful in getting across how much energy was on the beach those two nights.  It really was electrifying...and I hope you enjoy listening to this mix as much as I loved playing to the beach and then recording the set. 

Here's the massive tracklisting for the hot track after hot track filled Houseboat Sessions 2008:

1.  Katy Perry  &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;  (Jason Nevins remix)
2.  Lady Gaga  &quot;Just Dance&quot;  (HCCRS Bambossa remix)
3.  Nelly Furtado ft. Timaland  &quot;Give It To Me&quot;  (Electro mix)

      <title>Episode 11 (July 2008)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_1077048.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well well well...July has rolled around, the Stampede is about to hit full swing here in Calgary and DLite has finally got some summer beats to help rock away the hot weather!!  As is with the image selected for the episode art this hour long cracker is all about moooovin' on.  Take the beats, the energy, and message how you will - but bottom line let it ENERGIZE you and get moving!
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                This episode is full of vocal bangers that have become a custom around here so handle the heat with care!  It would seem that 'Double Shots' are also becoming a tradition - and so this month the honour goes to David Guetta.  I had the privilege of seeing him live here in Calgary in April and the show was S.I.C.K.  What a talent and inspiration...and the double shot will be just a taste of how hard he rocked that night.  Here is the track listing for 2008's first summer hot tracks to hit the airwaves:
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                1.  Out of Office  &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;  (club mix)

                                                                                                                10.  Mastiksoul  &quot;Jacobino&quot;  (Original mix)

                                                                                                This episode is full of vocal bangers that have become a custom around here so handle the heat with care!  It would seem that 'Double Shots' are also becoming a tradition - and so this month the honour goes to David Guetta.  I had the privilege of seeing him live here in Calgary in April and the show was S.I.C.K.  What a talent and inspiration...and the double shot will be just a taste of how hard he rocked that night.  Here is the track listing for 2008's first summer hot tracks to hit the airwaves:

      <title>Episode 10  (April 2008)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_845160.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!  That took forever!!  Thanks for all of your patience waiting for Episode 10 to drop&#8230;the best explanation I have is that life got in the way a couple of times the last few months.  Never to fear though, DLite is back with a vengeance.

Episode 10 by design is a peak hour mix and so it pounds from start to finish!  Definitely less funky than usual and much much dirtier with electro and progressive touches to be sure.  Spring is in the air (here in Canada anyway) and you should absolutely let the energy of the music pull you out of you winter numbness&#8230;beats and summer were made for each other and this is the perfect start!

We&#8217;re still kickin&#8217; the music out to 50+ countries around the globe and the listenership is growing strong&#8230;thanks in no small part to all of you who pass the music onto your friends and let them know where to find the hottest tracks! A HUGE thanks for all those who return faithfully for each episode and lend their feedback...it is much appreciated!

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_691208.gif&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long wait after the last 'cast and Episode 8 is finally here!  Had some tech issues switching to a Mac platform, but with those almost resolved I FINALLY got to unload a mix.  Two months of pent up energy has come tearing out in the form of Episode 8 and it&#8217;s a Ripper!!  It definitely has an Electro slant to the set, but not without the touch of Funk and Vocals that are Dlite staples.  I hope you enjoy listening to the mix as much as I enjoyed making it!

Thanks to all of you who wrote with comments of encouragement while asking for the next episode...clearly at just over 4000 subscribers this podcast wasn't forgotten in the absence of a fresh mix!  Now that we're back up, we'll do our best to get you bangin' funky house mixes as often as we can!

      <title>Houseboat Sessions 2007</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1039948/600x600_691210.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always the summer brought us two raging nights rockin' Neilson Beach in the Shuswap, British Columbia, Canada.  DJ-Dlite played a five hour set each night on the beach and almost brought the roof down (literally) &#8211; some of my favourite tracks from the last six months.  Rooftop patio, fireworks, full moon, perfect breeze, summer vacation for many and WICKED music!  

Unfortunately we can't put the sessions in their entirety up here, but we've put together a mix of songs an hour and a half long that had the crowd pumping their fists for more!  

Check out pictures of the event here:
