</p><p class="p1">BIO:</p>
<p class="p1">Komatic is a Bedford based producer, originally from the North East of England. Komatic first found drum and bass through listening to tape packs back in early 1992 / 1993.  It was from these packs that Komatic desperately wanted to DJ and be involved. This led to a residency at Raindance, wining the ‘breaking new talent competition’ at Helter Skelter and various pirate radio slots, not to mention being a runner up in a national student DJ competition to find the best student DJ in the country, held at the Ministry of Sound.</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">After some hard saving for a computer, he hasn’t stopped making music since.  Over the last few years, things have started to progress.  The first was making it onto BBC 1xtra’s playlist with ‘Ring The Alarm’, Komatic’s first release.  Komatic continued to get support from 1xtra with DJ’s Chrissy Chris and Bailey all running tunes such as ‘Viscous’, ‘Night Drive’, ‘Solution’ and ‘Human Kinetic’.  Support from Nerm &amp; DCode on Radio 1 has also followed, with his ‘Black and Gold remix’ becoming a permanent fixture on the shows.  ‘Viscous’ has since been signed to Spearhead, ‘Lucid’ and ‘Night Fell’ signed to Phunkfiction, ‘Jazz Club’ and ‘Remain Free’ to Frequency Factory and ‘Simple Complexities’ to Ennex Records.  This exposure also landed him a weekly radio show on Bassdrive.  Komatic has since been working with Technique’s ‘Technicolour’, and so far their styles of production and music have been a perfect compliment to each other.  The collaborations are going from strength to strength, and definitely tunes to look out for in the future.</p>

<p class="p1">BIO:</p>
<p class="p1">Luka Per aka Smooth was introduced to music at 10 when he began to practice piano. He practiced it for about 3 years and later on he became more interested in guitar, also in such genres as metal, hardcore etc.</p>
<p class="p1">When a couple of years passed by he attended his first drum n bass party and he was stoaked! It was very soon after that he decided not just to love this music but also to make his own tunes.</p>
<p class="p1">Now he has been making beats for about 6 years. First release was in quite distant 2005 on Touchiní down records from which Lost Cause was played a lot from various djs.</p>
<p class="p1">As he researched sound more and more, he decided that his sound just wasn&#8217;t good enough, so he shut him self in the studio and waited till 2008 when his improving sound was noticed by Dementia and together with Rregula they released Obfuscate on Trust in music 12?. Between there and now he released Space attack on Recon and massive Out of time on Ruse records. Then he was picked up by the massive Viper collective. He had his debut release on the label on &#8220;Acts Of Mad Men&#8221; album which was pronounced &#8220;Album of the Week&#8221; by Zane Lowe on Radio1. He also had a single on Vipers sister label Viper VIP witch included tracks 7th Sense and Squirm and later on he did a big remix for John B feat. Shaz Sparks - Red Sky with his friend Subsonik and another single on Viper VIP with tunes Feel so Free, Music Takes Me Higer and Micro.Now he has prepared an EP witch is coming out soon on Viper rec.</p>
<p class="p1">Dj support from the likes of Matrix and Futurebound, DJ Hype, Andy C, Concord Dawn, Netsky, Danny Byrd and many more!</p>

BIO:
Luka Per aka Smooth was introduced to music at 10 when he began to practice piano. He practiced it for about 3 years and later on he became more interested in guitar, also in such genres as metal, hardcore etc.
When a couple of years passed by he attended his first drum n bass party and he was stoaked! It was very soon after that he decided not just to love this music but also to make his own tunes.
Now he has been making beats for about 6 years. First release was in quite distant 2005 on Touchiní down records from which Lost Cause was played a lot from various djs.
As he researched sound more and more, he decided that his sound just wasn't good enough, so he shut him self in the studio and waited till 2008 when his improving sound was noticed by Dementia and together with Rregula they released Obfuscate on Trust in music 12?. Between there and now he released Space attack on Recon and massive Out of time on Ruse records. Then he was picked up by the massive Viper collective. He had his debut release on the label on "Acts Of Mad Men" album which was pronounced "Album of the Week" by Zane Lowe on Radio1. He also had a single on Vipers sister label Viper VIP witch included tracks 7th Sense and Squirm and later on he did a big remix for John B feat. Shaz Sparks - Red Sky with his friend Subsonik and another single on Viper VIP with tunes Feel so Free, Music Takes Me Higer and Micro.Now he has prepared an EP witch is coming out soon on Viper rec.
Dj support from the likes of Matrix and Futurebound, DJ Hype, Andy C, Concord Dawn, Netsky, Danny Byrd and many more</itunes:summary>

BIO:

Nu Directions was conceived in the summer of 1999 by Neil Hutchinson,
aka Tricksta, as a continuation of his previous label project Urban
Flavour, Nu Directions was formed as an outlet to release quality
musical and forward thinking drum 8 bass.

The first few releases on Nu Directions continued on an
atmospheric theme. As the drum 8 bass sound matured into the millennium
the label followed suit with an array of twelves from new and
established artists culminating in the labels first compilation
following the tenth release.

In May 2004 Nu Directions released their first solo artist LP in the
form of Environments by long-standing label servant ASC. A producer who
debuted through Nu Directions back in 2000 finally delivered a
groundbreaking LP for the concerning junglist and home listener alike.

Today Nu Directions has just entered its 11th year. It has clocked up a fine
reputation for releasing quality drum 8 bass.

Nu Directions also boasts a successful monthly club sessions
Nu:Motion. Held in the heart of the UKs drum 8 bass scene, east
London, Nu:Motion at 1001 Cafe is the perfect reflection of the ethos
and style of this small but long standing independent drum 8 bass

<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">Hailing from North London, Artificial Intelligence are a production duo comprising of Zula Warner and Glenn Herweijer.</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">As a production unit, A.I’s releases are anything but predictable and they tend to reflect a variety of drum&amp;bass styles. Over the years they have spanned the slighter darker side, with releases out on Commercial Suicide and 31 Record, as well as flirting with some other labels including Full Cycle, Goodlooking and CIA. A.I have even dabbled with commercial labels, releasing remixes of some of the biggest dance and hip hop tracks of the past few years including Kelis’s Trick Me, Eric Prydz Slammin’ and more recently Fat Freddys Drop Cays Crays</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">Undeniably one of the busiest and most popular drum &amp;bass talents around today, their diversity and adaptability have made them regular headliners in both Europe and beyond with their music taking them to The Ministry, End, Fabric, Swerve, Movement, Faster and Breakin’ Science just to name a few</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">If the last decade is anything to go by from this London pair, 2010looks set to be their best yet, with their debut album &#8220;Stand Alone&#8221;, has got everyone in drum&amp;bass waiting in anticipation, definitely something that only happens once in a while.</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">LOWQUI</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">A host, a lyricist and a crowd entertainer, he brings a passion for drum n bass to the fore that is sure to electrify the dance. His love of the music always comes first and LowQui´s true skill is in matching his flow to the DJ to get the vibe of the night just right. With over a decade of experience at some of the biggest club nights across the UK and beyond, it´s no surprise that LowQui is Goldie´s number one MC of choice. In 2008, LowQui has continued his affiliation with Metalheadz as well as featuring alongside D-Bridge for the Exit Records boss debut album tour.</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">This notion of balance and harmony is at the core of LowQui´s style on the mic and comes from a philosophy embedded in all that he does: no wonder then that the regular London club night he helped to establish back in 2004 is named Essence of Chi.</p>
<p class="p2">
</p><p class="p1">A versatile MC, LowQui has worked with a diverse range of UK crews and record labels: Metalheadz, Movement &amp; Liquid V, Drum and Bass Arena, Traffic, Bassbin Records, Widescreen Recordings, Technicality (InperspectiveRecords), Desire, Detonate, Dread Records, Therapy (Freak Records), FormationRecords, Digital Soundboy, Cyberfunk Records, and many, many more. LowQui has also played a vital part in pirate, internet and overseas radio stations, including: Life FM, Ministry Of Sound, Ruud Awakening 104.2FM, Breaks FM, Flex 103.6 FM, Groovetech, Drum and Bass Worldwide and Feierwerk FM (Munich)</p>

</p><p class="p1">Metrik has already come a long way as one of the new names to look out for in drum &amp; bass. In 2006, Tom&#8217;s debut release appeared on the boundary pushing drum &amp; bass label, Collective. By 2007 he had released the anthemic soulful refrain of &#8216;Your World&#8217; on Intrinsic Recordings. It was to become arguably one of the biggest tracks of the year. With admirers across the whole of the drum &amp; bass spectrum and having been contacted by Futurebound, Metrik became an esteemed member of the Viper Recordings family. In 2008 Metrik released his first single on Viper, the epic &#8220;Moving On/Stranger&#8221; which was to become his second single to reach number one in the download charts.  The end of that year saw Metrik unleash the huge !Technicolour&#8221; which received major radio support from the likes of Zane Lowe, Hugh Stephens, Annie Mac and Colin Murray as well as all of the heavyweight drum &amp; bass DJs. This culminated in BBC Radio 1&#8217;s poignant use of the track as a sound bed on their coverage of Barrack Obama&#8217;s victory speech on Colin Murray&#8217;s show to breathtaking effect.</p>
<p class="p1">Metrik&#8217;s rise behind the decks has seen him travel further afield, headlining parties across the UK, With a string of new releases lined up and with his first solo EP in the works, Metrik&#8217;s name will soon become indelibly etched across the face of contemporary electronic music.</p>

<p>This is a dub filled mix by Possibility, head of Touched By Records, new deep and minimal dnb label launching next month that&#8217;s definitely worth taking note of as they&#8217;re sure to be making a serious impact. Already with their artists set to make a mark in 2010, and with backing in the form of remixes from the likes of S.P.Y, Zero T, Kasra and Sinnistarr but to mention a few Touched By Records are landing in a big way. The labels first release is due next month witch is Pessimist- Whispers of Scandal backed with the S.P.Y remix. Look out for it in all good vinyl shops. Now sit back and enjoy some of what this new label has to offer</p>

<p>BIO:</p>
<p>Dirrrty B, real name Michal Ratveisky, started to compose music in the early 90&#8217;s, when he was only 14 years old. At that time hardcore and gabber were very popular in his homeland of Slovakia, so his productions were in this style. His first &#8217;solo project&#8217; was called &#8216;Speed Freak&#8217;.</p>
<p>In 2001 he started a solo project and named himself &#8216;Dirty Beat&#8217;. He found the pleasure in drum&#8217;n'bass breakbeats, in chillout, downtempo and trip hop.</p>
<p>Michal has been producing drum&#8217;n'bass as &#8216;Dirrrty B&#8217; since 2003. The first release came in 2008 on Esprit Records. Since then he has found his form and had releases on labels from acoss the globe.

Future Thinkin, as the name suggests, are one of the UK’s most progressive, as well as respected D8B outfits. Since Future Thinkin were formed in late 1997. Danny Exile, DM C.U.T and Shylo have managed to nurture this collective and allow Future Thinkin to mature into a much loved fixture on the London D8B circuit. Through their sets as Future Thinkin, their flagship Clubnight “Traffic” and now with their Label (Future Thinkin Records) they continue to make an impact with everything they do, and most importantly, continue to represent the Full Spectrum of Drum 8 Bass music. Their events have gained a reputation for Excellent Music, lively matue crowds, and a genuinely unique vibe that follows FT Wherever they go. With Traffic creeping into its 6th year, and the label going from strength to strength, things have never looked better for all @ Future Thinkin</itunes:summary>

</p><p class="p1">BIO:</p>
<p class="p1">Martsman, real name Martin Heinze (currently based in Berlin and Karlsruhe, Germany) got into Drum&amp;Bass around the end of the 90s. Artists like Alpha Omega, 4 Hero, Sonar Circle and Squarepusher had a formative influence on him during the first years and after witnessing a Paradox live set in 2001, his ever growing interest in Drum&amp;Bass evolved to the point where he began to produce his own music. With his affection for prominent basslines and stumbling breaks in combination with glitchy edits and bleepy minimalism, Martsman has developed a unique musical style which extends the current perception of Drum&amp;Bass.</p>
<p class="p1">Debuting on New York based Offshore Recordings in 2005, he released on smaller as well as established labels like Alphacut Records or Counter Intelligence in the following years. For 2008, tracks on Warm Communications and Hospital Records&#8217; sub label Med School attract the attention of a steadily growing audience also from outside the Drum&amp;Bass scene.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Scribbler 016: MARTSMAN (Med School)

A true experimental artist, Martsman is as much an explorer as a musician, as he searches to unearth and discover new sounds, new methods and expand the realm of electronic music. Such forward thinking has made him a stand-out artist to the extent that the massive Hospital Records have signed him to their sister label Med School.

BIO:
Martsman, real name Martin Heinze (currently based in Berlin and Karlsruhe, Germany) got into Drum8Bass around the end of the 90s. Artists like Alpha Omega, 4 Hero, Sonar Circle and Squarepusher had a formative influence on him during the first years and after witnessing a Paradox live set in 2001, his ever growing interest in Drum8Bass evolved to the point where he began to produce his own music. With his affection for prominent basslines and stumbling breaks in combination with glitchy edits and bleepy minimalism, Martsman has developed a unique musical style which extends the current perception of Drum8Bass.
Debuting on New York based Offshore Recordings in 2005, he released on smaller as well as established labels like Alphacut Records or Counter Intelligence in the following years. For 2008, tracks on Warm Communications and Hospital Records' sub label Med School attract the attention of a steadily growing audience also from outside the Drum8Bass scene</itunes:summary>

</p><p class="p1">BIO:</p>
<p class="p1">DJ Samurai &amp; DJ Kryptik rose from the murky depths of Edinburgh’s underground to form one of the music scene’s most forward thinking outfits. DC Breaks burst onto the DnB scene in 2004 on DJ Kid’s label Restless Natives, receiving enormous support for their fresh talent from Knowledge Mag and 1Xtra, as well as the likes of Bryan Gee, Kenny Ken &amp; Mace, Peshay and Andy C. ‘Going Down’, ‘Dayz’ and ‘Sundown’ all made major waves across the DnB scene turning heads in the direction of DC Breaks.</p>
<p class="p2">

BIO:
DJ Samurai 8 DJ Kryptik rose from the murky depths of Edinburgh’s underground to form one of the music scene’s most forward thinking outfits. DC Breaks burst onto the DnB scene in 2004 on DJ Kid’s label Restless Natives, receiving enormous support for their fresh talent from Knowledge Mag and 1Xtra, as well as the likes of Bryan Gee, Kenny Ken 8 Mace, Peshay and Andy C. ‘Going Down’, ‘Dayz’ and ‘Sundown’ all made major waves across the DnB scene turning heads in the direction of DC Breaks.

Having caused a major buzz north of the border with their innovative DJ sets and eclectic sound the duo found themselves, only a year later, being approached by Ram head honcho Andy C to secure tracks for Frequency and High Lite. Around the same time DJ Samurai displayed his superb DJ skills by winning the Drum And Bass Arena National DJ award at The End Club in central London. After such high profile releases as ‘Be Mine’ 8 ‘Sound With Fire’ (Frequency Recs), both receiving colossal support from DJs and radio stations across the globe, they decided to found their own label in conjunction with Ram Records. DC Breaks Recordings was born.

DC Breaks have sinc secured releases on Viper and SUdden Def, with plenty more in the pipeline for Ram and Frequency. Be sure to also check out DJ Samurai's new genre-defining act "VENT" (www.ventaudio.co.uk</itunes:summary>
