    <title>DJ Mr Jay's Podcast</title>
    <link>http://djmrjay.podomatic.com</link>
    <description>Dj Mr Jay hosts &quot;The Truth&quot;The latest and best R&amp;B, Soul, Funk and Disco show live on the Internet.

If you want to get a feel for the development or urban black music in the UK, and the effect it&#8217;s had on club culture, a quick glance at Mr Jay&#8217;s resume gives you a potted history of it all!

His roots go back to 1978, being part of Soul Incorporated Roadshow, which went on to play all over the UK alongside the best reggae and soul sounds, such as Sir Coxsone, Saxon International and Java Hi-Power.

By 1981, Jay had moved into early hip-hop, hosting the best jams in London&#8217;s Swiss Cottage working with Mindgame and the group Syn-Di-Cut.

Since 1986 Jay has spent his time between playing at underground jams and more commercial affairs, often hosting corporate parties for film launches and the like.

      <title>Micheal Ayers &quot;Mine Tonight&quot;</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1066017/600x600_5573136.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Ayers is a singer/songwriter/producer from St. Mary Parish Louisiana &amp; a recent signee of Atlantic Records who has crafted a sound that he affectionately calls &#8220;Free &amp; Open&#8221;. 

&#8220;I get tired of hearing songs that are so full of production and sounds for the sake of having sounds on the track that you barely even hear the singer that the song is supposed to be for. 

Back in the day, every instrument was just another way to tell the story.  Another part that added to the whole. Music is the framework, the artist is the canvas.&#8221; 

Born to a singing father from Ohio and a songwriting mother from Louisiana, the second youngest of eight children all singer/musicians in their own right, Mr. Ayers was literally born into music.   &#8220;My mother told me that I literally rode into this world to The Isley Brothers. 

That&#8217;s not what most kids would want to hear from their parents, but I loved it. It let me know that this was my destiny from the get go.  &#8221;Mr Ayers has been singing since the age of two and performing professionally since the age of 13. He has been a writer and producer of his own music since the age of 15. 

Many have described him as a true homage to great soul singers from the past as well as a sure sign of the future. One listen to him weather LIVE or on wax leaves no mistaking who and what his influences are. 

&#8220;Music is like time, there are no straight lines, only circles. Everything comes back around again. The 60&#8217;s, 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s have all had a resurgence.

It&#8217;s only a matter of time before the 90&#8217;s get their turn in the limelight once again.&#8221; That means good singing laid back production and style marrying substance, not replacing it. And if Mr Ayers has his way, then he plans on being one of music&#8217;s leading archaeologists.

Back in the day, every instrument was just another way to tell the story.  Another part that added to the whole. Music is the framework, the artist is the canvas.&#8221; 

Born to a singing father from Ohio and a songwriting mother from Louisiana, the second youngest of eight children all singer/musicians in their own right, Mr. Ayers was literally born into music.   &#8220;My mother told me that I literally rode into this world to The Isley Brothers. 

That&#8217;s not what most kids would want to hear from their parents, but I loved it. It let me know that this was my destiny from the get go.  &#8221;Mr Ayers has been singing since the age of two and performing professionally since the age of 13. He has been a writer and producer of his own music since the age of 15. 

Many have described him as a true homage to great soul singers from the past as well as a sure sign of the future. One listen to him weather LIVE or on wax leaves no mistaking who and what his influences are. 

&#8220;Music is like time, there are no straight lines, only circles. Everything comes back around again. The 60&#8217;s, 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s have all had a resurgence.

It&#8217;s only a matter of time before the 90&#8217;s get their turn in the limelight once again.&#8221; That means good singing laid back production and style marrying substance, not replacing it. And if Mr Ayers has his way, then he plans on being one of music&#8217;s leading archaeologists.

      <title>The Truth - Interview with Dj Fingers</title>
      <description>With 28 years experience Dj Fingers is without doubt one of the finest breakbeat Dj&#8217;s in the world.  For this exclusive interview he takes time out to speak to Dj Mr Jay (SSRadio) on &#8220;The Truth&#8221; about the definition of Hip-Hop.

DJ Fingers is one of the UK&#8217;s original Breakbeat DJ for MC's, and understood the link to Afrika Bambaataa's Bronx River Sound system Tradition. As one of the first turntablists in the UK, DJ Fingers was influenced by DJ&#8217;s like Grandmaster Flash, Herc, Grandmixer DST, DJ Whizz Kid (Rip)and DJ Jazzy Jay.
Foreword from forth coming Book: &#8220;The Misappropriation of Hip-Hip&#8221; There&#8217;s very good reason why you should take time to engage with Dj Finger&#8217;s thoughts on hip-hop.

As a child of the pre-Technics days of pause button cassette mixes, he can rightly claim to being one of the earliest deejays in Britain to devote himself (under the name of DJ Fingers) to the spirit of hip-hop, and the fact that he&#8217;s done so in the service of the emcees he&#8217;s worked with - rather than in that of his own ego - is testament to his heartfelt belief in hip-hop as a community pursuit.

      <title>The Truth - Swiss Cottage (Live) 1986</title>
      <description>Friday 26th September 1986, Dj Mr Jay presented 100% Hip-Hop and Go-Go to the UK.  The live session was recorded at the Swiss Cottage Community Centre (London) to a live audience and featured the best in UK Hip-Hop.  The line up; Dj Fingers (The Syn-Di-Cut), Cash C (Soul Inc), Mc Crazy Noddy (The Syn-Di-Cut), Turbo C (Soul Inc) and the legendary MC Seargent Rock.&lt;br&gt;
The simple concept of two turntables, one microphone, an MC and a fusion of different beats is a true definition of real Hip-Hop.  After 23 years this still remains a true masterclass of UK Hip-Hop.&lt;br&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Trouble Funk Exclusive</title>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;If you like your Washington Go-Go, check out the exclusive track available to the listeners of the Mr Jay's Podcast.&lt;/b&gt;

Miles off the radar of popular music during the early '80s, Trouble Funk energized their D.C. home with the sound of go-go music, an uproarious blend of swinging, up-tempo '70s funk and a '60s-style horn section. The band formed in 1978, and the line-up coalesced around drummer Emmet Nixon, percussionists Mack Carey and Timothius Davis, guitarist Chester Davis, bassist Tony Fisher, trombone players Gerald and Robert Reed, trumpeter Taylor Reed, keyboard player James Avery, and saxophonist David Rudd. </description>

Hear the best selection of music from Dj Mr Jay and Sherri G, Also our live interview with Mose from the band Civilian.

When Adam Moseley remarked to his friends how amazing it would be to create one of the best bands in Britain, there was only one problem, none of them could play an instrument.

Undeterred, the gauntlet was taken up, and with little equipment and no immediate spark, the group locked themselves away and began to work hard. 

Surprised by the sound that they eventually developed, and the incredible reaction to it, the Horsham-based group decided Civilian was a suitable name for the band, showing that though it is easy to keep your head down and be content to blend in with the crowd,when you actually make the effort to search inside you can find abilities that make you shine.

He is the son of a former newspaper editor Nicholas Lloyd and his step-sister is well-known UK TV presenter Claudia Winkleman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His debut &#8216;Pain of Life&#8217; EP is a very special record, urgent and profound; it makes a striking impression on all who hear it. From the driving pulse of blues drenched masterpiece &#8216;Red Blood Sky&#8217;, with it&#8217;s pulsating rock guitar and gritty vocal punch, to the full throttle hum of sublime classic &#8216;Sundown&#8217;, you know you&#8217;re in for a spine tingling ride.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was at the ripe young age of eight when Del&#233; wrote his first song and also discovered that he had the ability to hold a musical note. That is when it all started for him and he embarked on his musical career. Being new to the world of music he started off as a member in a band then decided to go it alone and consequently went solo. He has remained a solo artist ever since specialising in a number of musical styles such as R&amp;B, Soul and Pop.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first single, &#8216;She Makes Me Hot&#8217; put him in the spotlight and further enhanced his already burgeoning reputation to a wider audience and it was from that initial exposure, Del&#233; was approached to do other projects in 2004. The second single &#8216;Ex&#8217; has taken Del&#233; to a whole new level and has courted a number of rave reviews from radio stations all over the UK with him being likened to a number of already established artists. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

The show includes an exclusive interview with Mamacoca: 

It has only been a few months since the completion of their debut album &#8216;Secrets&#8217;, and already has Mamacoca signed a distribution deal that would see their album hit the shops shortly; this is on the back of countless radio plays, radio and TV interviews and live appearances nationally and abroad. Not satisfied with their current repertoire, Mamacoca has greedily taken to the studios again and have continued their crusade-like writing campaign, completing tunes to be showcased on the stages of a number of 2008 summer festivals.

Mamacoca blends emotions drawn from Herbie Hancock to Led Zeppelin, back to Stevie Wonder, producing a funky union of Soul and Jazz, and has been akin somewhat to the funkiness of Jamiroquai on a liberal diet of Quincy Jones.</description>

Dj Mr Jay and Sherri G from www.lifefm.org.uk play the best in soul and R&amp;B, with our special guest &quot;Harry Mindgame&quot;.&lt;br \&gt;

Mindgame - Been in and around Hip-Hop, R&amp;B, and Soul for a number of years.  Been there in the early days when UK Hip-Hop was developing and evolving. Started out DJ&#8217;ing with Soul Incorporated Roadshow where he was schooled in Soul, R&amp;B, Jazz and early Hip-Hop. &lt;br \&gt;

During these days MindGame met up with Dave Cash C, DJ Fingers, who, at the time was deeply involved in the burgeoning UK Hip-Hop scene.  As with most things, this led to the younger guy&#8217;s in Soul Incorporated (Mr Jay, MindGame, Big Steve) slipping off and developing their own Hip-Hop promotions.&lt;br \&gt;

Pure Indulgence Promotions&lt;br \&gt;

Was set up in 2007 by Vivienne &quot;Empress' Morgan and Harry Mindgame as a vehicle for club and event promotions.  Pure Indulgence is aimed at the sophisticated &#8220;raver&#8221; who enjoys a comfortable, relaxed and friendly night out. &lt;br \&gt;

Two successful events have been held so far with the next on 12th July 2008 in association with Mr C from the Nasty Boyz.</description>

      <title>The Truth feat Anatasha</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1066017/600x600_1067408.bmp&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anatasha is a singer, musician and prolific songwriter from Royal Leamington Spa, in the heart of England. 

She has grown up surrounded by musicians and singers, listening to music of many genres, from many decades. This has provided a wide influence and a great passion of music has developed since an early age. Anatasha loves performing live on stage and has produced heart stopping a cappella performances to room-filled, star-struck audiences. She has performed on the same billing as Dexy&#8217;s Midnight Runners&#8217; Kevin Rowland.

Influences are Norah Jones, Frou Frou, Tegan &amp; Sara and KT Tunstall.  Her other favourite artists include Wallis Bird, M.I.A., Mr Hudson &amp; The Library, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tiesto and Pendulum.

The sweet, dulcet tones of her voice really do move the listener, together with the beautiful lyrics and melody she writes for her songs. A guitarist and classically trained pianist, she is also studying Law at De Montfort University in Leicester.

Anatasha is very excited about the collaboration with producer and multi-instrumentalist Paul Hogg (aka &#8216;Ox&#8217;). Paul has written and recorded 5 tracks for which, Anatasha has written the lyrics and melody. The combination is simply exquisite, bringing Paul&#8217;s smooth sounds and originality to Anatasha&#8217;s soul searching lyrics with her beguiling voice.

The first of the 5 tracks is to be released as the single &#8216;Take Your Time&#8217; in August 2008 and will be followed by a 5-Track EP later in the year.

With a sophisticated blend of acoustic folk/pop and a hint of reggae influence, this album&#8217;s appeal aims at a wide and diverse spectrum of listener.

Spoonface had his first taste of international recording success as Black Legend with his reworking of the Barry White classic &#8220;You See The Trouble With Me&#8221; reaching No. 1 in the UK and selling over 2 million copies.
                                
His distinctive vocals make him instantly recognizable and provide the uniqueness that commands a strong following from his loyal fan base, as well as the appreciation and respect from fellow musicians.
                                
He has collaborated with numerous renowned artists from varying genres, and presently enjoys success in the UK and Europe with a number of dance projects including Floor Boogie act Ear Dis. Living On The Venus Express glorifies the true depth of his ability.

Kobe was born Vincent Kobina Enos on 11th December 1984. Named after his father Vincent Enos Snr. From an early age his name was abbreviated to Kobe. His middle names literally means &quot;born on Tuesday&quot;, hence his first album being dubbed &quot;Tuesday&#8217;s child&quot;. 

His mother Abigail Louisa Parkes, decided she would teach him her language (goa) before she taught him English, so as to keep in touch with his roots. This made difficult communication in his early days, but before he left nursery, this was no longer a problem. 

His first true experience of music came from his mother who was an avid church goer and also an active member of the choir. Kobe became quite attached to the idea of music, but started of with an instrument before he discovered his voice. 
It wasn't until midway through primary school that Kobe was told he had a voice.

      <title>The Truth - Live Interview with T'rese</title>

Take a little of Sade, Tracy Chapman, Des'ree mixed with a little Roberta Flack then you have T'rese, already acclaimed for her talent in the likeness of these top chart-selling legendary artists.

T'rese's music unveils a wealth of talent... the labour of a genuinely multi-talented Singer/Songwriter.   She's a lady who knows precisely what she desires. And when necessary, she resorts to her overwhelmingly mesmerising charm to dictate the sort of response she expects. In view of her positive outlook on life and the way she so apply utilizes her tremendous gratifying propensities, she's ever so willing to make the sacrifices to attain her ultimate goal.

T'rese's music unveils a wealth of talent... the labour of a genuinely multi-talented Singer/Songwriter.   She's a lady who knows precisely what she desires. And when necessary, she resorts to her overwhelmingly mesmerising charm to dictate the sort of response she expects. In view of her positive outlook on life and the way she so apply utilizes her tremendous gratifying propensities, she's ever so willing to make the sacrifices to attain her ultimate goal.

On Wednesday 4th July we featured a special show focuced on Washington D.C. Go-Go, with an exclusive live interview with James Blake live in the USA.

Go-Go is a unique sound, with many rap and R&amp;B artists having sampled beats from existing Go-Go records, to create some of the finest hits that you have heard in Rap and R&amp;B music over the past two decades (most often without crediting the Go-Go scene in Washington D.C.).
