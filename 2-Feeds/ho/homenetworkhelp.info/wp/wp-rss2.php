# 06:00 Content: Buying a New Computer on a Budget.
~~ 3 signs you need a new computer.
1. Bootup Issues.
2. The system grinds away.
3. Your computer will not handle Windows XP or certain software applications.
~~ Should I buy a laptop or a desktop?
1. Compare size vs. portability.
2. Determine how much power and memory you need.
3. Factor in the price.
4. Evaluate upgradeability and repair options.
~~ 7 things to look for in a new desktop PC.
1. The Microprocessor.
2. The Operating System.
3. Random Access Memory.
4. Hard Drive.
5. Video Card.
6. The Monitor.
~~ 7 tips for getting the laptop you need.
1. Know your needs.
2. Choose your speed from a multitude of multiprocessors.
Pentium 4: This is a desktop chip. It's powerful and power-hungry and runs hot.
Pentium 4-M: These are less powerful than their desktop brothers. But they are better with batteries, and the computers are not as heavy.
Pentium M: These run slower than the 4, but they are just about as powerful.
Athlon XP-M: Advanced Micro Devices answer to the Pentium. This is a good chip, and is usually cheap.
Athlon 64: This is a top of the line chip from AMD. 64-bit based software but runs 32. This chip is extremely fast.
Celeron and Celeron M: The budget chip from Intel. This is not as fast as the Pentiums or the AMD chips.
Transmeta: These are used by a few Japanese manufacturers. Transmeta chips are on the slow side.
3. If you travel a lot, invest in a wireless-equipped laptop.
4. Random Access Memory.
5. Hard Drive.
6. Video Card.
7. Accessories.
~~ Disposing of the old PC.]]></description>

# 06:00 Content: Buying a New Computer on a Budget.<br />
~~ 3 signs you need a new computer.<br />
1. Bootup Issues.<br />
2. The system grinds away.<br />
3. Your computer will not handle Windows XP or certain software applications.<br />
~~ Should I buy a laptop or a desktop?<br />
1. Compare size vs. portability.<br />
2. Determine how much power and memory you need.<br />
3. Factor in the price.<br />
4. Evaluate upgradeability and repair options.<br />
~~ 7 things to look for in a new desktop PC.<br />
1. The Microprocessor.<br />
2. The Operating System.<br />
3. Random Access Memory.<br />
4. Hard Drive.<br />
5. Video Card.<br />
6. The Monitor.<br />
~~ 7 tips for getting the laptop you need.<br />
1. Know your needs.<br />
2. Choose your speed from a multitude of multiprocessors.<br />
Pentium 4: This is a desktop chip. It&#8217;s powerful and power-hungry and runs hot.<br />
Pentium 4-M: These are less powerful than their desktop brothers. But they are better with batteries, and the computers are not as heavy.<br />
Pentium M: These run slower than the 4, but they are just about as powerful.<br />
Athlon XP-M: Advanced Micro Devices answer to the Pentium. This is a good chip, and is usually cheap.<br />
Athlon 64: This is a top of the line chip from AMD. 64-bit based software but runs 32. This chip is extremely fast.<br />
Celeron and Celeron M: The budget chip from Intel. This is not as fast as the Pentiums or the AMD chips.<br />
Transmeta: These are used by a few Japanese manufacturers. Transmeta chips are on the slow side.<br />
3. If you travel a lot, invest in a wireless-equipped laptop.<br />
4. Random Access Memory.<br />
5. Hard Drive.<br />
6. Video Card.<br />
7. Accessories.<br />
~~ Disposing of the old PC.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you have quick and immediate access to all your family's important documents? Do you have access to yours or your children's health card info? What about passwords or other financial data? If an emergency happens right now, would all of your vital documents and records be destroyed?

If you have not stopped and thought about the potential of being in this type of situation, you need to seriously consider a strategy for recording and storing vital family records and documents. There really is much more to organizing important information than just throwing it in a drawer or box.

In this podcast we cover all the steps to getting your personal information and assets protected.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for being part of the HomeNetworkHelp.Info interactive live event for:</p>
<p>~~ Saturday, July 30th, 2005 @ 10:30 AM PST.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t see the other live event, that is fine. Each event is separate and can be attended separately.</p>

<p>~~ Misc Information:</p>
<p>1) If you have any questions about the process or how to participate, etc. there is information on the main website. All Saturday show details can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.homenetworkhelp.info/index.php?pg=live-show-info">http://www.homenetworkhelp.info/index.php?pg=live-show-info</a></p>
<p>2) The software used to show my screen is only supported by Windows systems. So if you are on a Macintosh or Linux system the only way to participate is to listen to the live stream and join the IRC channel. I am sorry about that.</p>
<p>3) If you want to try the GoToMeeting software yourself for free for 30 days, use the promo code: homenetwork</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you at the event&#8230;</p>
