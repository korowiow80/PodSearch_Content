<p>I started smoking cigarettes when I was just 13 years old. Like a lot of kids in my neighborhood, some of the kids smoked, and some of them did not <strong><a href="http://www.buyecigs.com">electronic cigarette</a></strong>.  Most of my friends smoked cigarettes, especially when we at house parties, or just every day.</p>
<p>In the navy you smoke a lot. The cigarettes are a bit cheaper, because when you go out to sea, they sell the cigarettes cheaper to you, and don&#8217;t charge you the high taxes you have to pay when you are import, so it is much cheaper if you wait for the ship to go out to sea.</p>
<p>In the navy, lots of people drink coffee and smoke cigarettes, even thou it is obviously getting harder and harder to find a place to smoke, without some coming down on you. When I quit, cigarettes were no where near as expensive as they are these days!</p>
<p>Well, my mother had died from lung cancer, and her age was not that far away from the age I was approaching. One night, I was in my kitchen, and their was a medical book someone had left, and when I was reading something in it, it said that if a person quits smoking, and does not smoke for 10 years, it is like they did not smoke <strong><a href="http://www.buyecigs.com">read e cigarette reviews</a></strong>.  I don&#8217;t know if that is true or not, I&#8217;m no doctor, but I thought about it, even if it was half true, I figured I better stop, because I&#8217;m just going to die from it like my mother, she was 37.</p>
<p>I looked at the calendar, and it was only about 2 weeks and it would be my fathers birthday. I&#8217;m a terrible remember of dates, but I could remember that I quit smoking on my dads birthday.</p>
<p>I figured the only way I could quit smoking, would be if I tortured myself with cigarettes, to the point that I hate them, and never want anything to do with them again, and I knew I had to make it work, or I would just keep smoking cigarettes, and I already smoked about a pack a day every day, for 23 years, and I knew it was not good for me, but I always would have that craving, after sex, after food, after even a toke of you know what, and that never changed, I never lost that craving, but cigarettes are a thing of the past, for about 10 years now, and it worked for me.</p>
<p>I went into my garage on the eve of my fathers birthday, and I don&#8217;t think I ever even told him that I picked that day to quit, he was a working alcoholic most of his adult life, owned and ran a chain of 5 bakeries, and was always working, but would drink every single evening at home. He was always nice to me, but his vice was alcohol, my mothers were cigarettes, and she died at 37, my father lived into his late 70&#8242;s, and he drank almost a fifth a day, and lived a long life, but cigarettes killed my mom way to early.</p>
<p>I thought about that, and I hardly drink anyway, just at parties or when we do something special.</p>
<p>I say in my garage, and lit up a cigarette, and then smoked it, then lit up another one, and smoked, it, don&#8217;t think I ever smoked one right after the other, unless I was heavy drinking, and then I lit up a 3rd one, and I could not almost take that one, and then I started inhaling the cigarette into my nose, and it was burning, and my eyes were burning, and I started thinking I hate these cigarettes, and then I lit up another one, and smoked it, and could hardly smoke it, and then snorted it up my nostrils, until it was burning so bad, my body hated it, and wanted to reject it now, and my eyes were watering and burning, and I did it more, and I did it until my nose was so burning from the smoke, and my eyes could not take it, and then I put everything out, and went in the house, and from that point on, I have never ever had the craving for a cigarette, and now since the price is like $5 a pack or so, I&#8217;m so glad I quit, and I could smoke with my friends some funny weed sometimes, and I never get a craving for a cigarette, and even when I drink anything, like alcohol, or a big mean, I never have a craving for a cigarette, I don&#8217;t even think about it.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m in a casino playing a machine or something, and someone sits down next to me with a cigarette, it actually stinks to me now, and I wish they would go away from me. I have seen it from both sides, and I do not recommend it to anyone, it&#8217;s just me. I was in the navy for 8 years, and I don&#8217;t care if I was in another country, if I had to eat some bugs off the ground, I would, so this is not for everybody, just letting you know how I kicked the habit myself, and did not have to go threw a withdraw system that does not work for a lot of people, my body did the natural thing, it told my body it does not want that crap anymore, since it was tortured with it. I wonder if anyone else ever quit like that?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">Self-directed IRA funds can be invested in a wide variety of options. One very promising investment option for self-directed IRAs is real estate. However, to be eligible to make such an investment, you need a fully <strong><a href="http://www.nafep.com">self directed IRA</a></strong>. This way you can choose to invest in real estate, which even when the economy is in a recessive mode, will still pay reasonably good profits.<br />
Few are aware of the fact that they can use your IRA funds to invest in real estate and even fewer are aware that when their IRA funds alone are not sufficient to invest in a real estate it can be combined with a few other eligible sources of funds. An example of an eligible source would be another IRA, preferably of a spouse, family member or partner. Even the personal funds of such closely related people can be used. In such a partnership venture, your IRA would own a corresponding percentage of the property and all transactions will occur through it. Income and expenditure will also be divided between the partners according to their respective shares. This way, the participating individuals can minimize risk and maximize benefits.IRA funds can be invested in almost all types of real estate including unimproved or developed land, commercial or rental properties, office, condos or single family homes, and multi-tenant complexes. However, no such investment should directly benefit you or a relative i.e you cannot buy a property and use it as the primary residence with your IRA funds. This is termed as a prohibited transaction and you should ensure that this does not happen.<br />
The IRA is always placed under the care of a trustee who is a well qualified professional custodian and who understands all the legal and revenue regulations. Your funds are managed by this trustee through an escrow account. The trustee not only helps plan your investment strategy but also performs the actual transaction on behalf of your IRA. Therefore, it is important to be involved in your investment and listen to the suggestions offered by your trustee and get your doubts clarified. You can then have a safe and beneficial real estate investment.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">Understanding the specific deal in the sales page from <strong><a href="http://www.veritransllc.com/payment-processing/" target="_blank">credit card processing</a></strong>company involves you comprehending what explores in your free account. Qualified purchases are those which meet specific demands, and they are usually the lowest rates easy for a charge card transaction because of their lower chance. If there is an enterprise that doesn&#8217;t cope with face-to-face transactions considering the customer placing your signature to a bill, then one will not be eligible for these costs.The major <strong><a href="http://www.veritransllc.com/payment-processing/" target="_blank">online credit card processing</a></strong> networks submit something called a certain amount Matrix which dictates just what the interchanged group of purchasers will be charged for:</p>
<p>How is it that the transaction has arrived and this type of card can be used (returns, non-rewards, corporate charge cards)? After the card is inserted and before it is authorized, the plastic card terminal communicates with your card-holder&#8217;s bank to spot the particular credit card type, after which it spots the purchase into one of the available tiers. It really is easiest to know this strategy when we tell you an illustration:</p>
<p>Qualified fee: 1.79% (typical card, swiped face-to-face purchases). Mid-Qualified fee: 3.09%. Non-Qualified fee: 2.39% (this may, most commonly, relate to the company card). A particular illustration: A returns card is swiped for your terminal by the <strong><a href="http://www.veritransllc.com/" target="_blank">credit card processing company</a></strong>. You pay the Qualified 1.9% + Mid-Qualified 2.1%, equaling 5.0 % for your purchase. Illustration 2: A company card is swiped for your terminal. You pay certified 1. 79% + Non-Qualified 3. 39%, equaling 5. 18% for your purchase.</p>
<p>A standard sales trick is usually to push these costs, possess a merchant signal and hope that they don&#8217;t realize they are simply over paying when their regular statement comes. Worse often, they don&#8217;t care if you learn about this, while they often disguise 3 yr contracts with weighty cancellation costs for the individual, meaning you&#8217;ll be able to either be caught paying more every month, or crack the deal and pay out to escape it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://homeschoolvideoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/13.jpeg"><img src="http://homeschoolvideoblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/13.jpeg" alt="" title="13" width="240" height="240" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12" /></a>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> The average customer replaces his car every three or four years. A new car loses part of its worth immediately after it is bought. However, this effect caused by the pass of time, can be reduced if the buyer takes some precautions when purchasing a car. There are many things to be taken into consideration if you want to lose as little money as possible. This article points out a few tips to avoid depreciation as much as possible.</p>
<p>After three or four years, a car is worth 70% of its original price on average. If you paid it in cash without financing, you may have lost 30% of its worth but you may have compensated with amortization. However, if you required financing to buy it, the amount you paid on interests probably increased the amount of money you lost to depreciation. You may wonder thus, what can be done to ease this problem.</p>
<p>Different Cars Depreciate differently</p>
<p>Some cars, being more demanded, depreciate more slowly than others. If you wish to reduce the incidence of depreciation, you should purchase a car that depreciates slowly. You can find this information at specialized magazines, on the internet or by doing your math yourself looking at the prices of used cars advertised on newspapers and on the internet.</p>
<p>Timing is essential when Buying or Selling</p>
<p>A used car with only a year of use can be sold for at least 20% less of its retail worth at dealerships. After 4 or 5 Years, the price can drop up to 50%. As you can see, buying a car at the right time can save you lots of money and selling it on time too. If you plan to sell a car you are buying today, you shouldn’t wait more than 3 or 4 years if it is new. If you want to buy a used car, as long as it’s in good conditions, a car with 4 or 5 years of use starts depreciating more slowly since it already lost half of its worth.</p>
<p>Smart Financing</p>
<p>Financing smartly implies paying lower interest rates. If you are going to pay for the capital to buy an asset that will loose its worth immediately after you buy it, you might as well pay as little as possible for that money. In order to do so, it is better to request a home equity loan or an interest only mortgage rather than a personal car loan. Or at least combine an interest only mortgage with a personal car loan.

With a bankruptcy looming large on your credit history, you are probably anxious to start getting more positive indicators on your report. This is a good thing. You can do this by getting a new credit card or taking out a personal loan. A lot can be said for either avenue, but you will have to take a good look at your current financial situation to figure the option that would work best for you.</p>
<p>Personal Loans</p>
<p>A personal loan is kind of a friendly peg onto which a variety of financial instruments can be hung. Amounts can vary widely, as can interest rates and repayment terms. Usually, right after bankruptcy, your chances of finding a decent loan with acceptable rates and terms can be pretty difficult, but not impossible.</p>
<p>Bad Credit Loans</p>
<p>You may have to enter the world of private lenders and bad credit lenders. These loans can carry interest rates and terms that would make a loan shark blush, but they can improve your status if they are paid off as stipulated in the contract. Also, since this market is tuned to borrowers with bad credit, many lenders act as if they are doing you a great big favor. They prey on the unworthiness and exasperation of their borrowers. Check the credentials of any lender you may approach thoroughly. If you sense the Big Favor syndrome, find another lender. Honest lenders willing to make bad credit loans are out there.</p>
<p>Credit Cards</p>
<p>Just as with a personal loan, landing a good credit card deal with appropriate interest rates can be a struggle if you are fresh out of bankruptcy. But that is okay. You can fall back, calm yourself, and seek the alternative. Also, if you are having trouble landing a credit card, it could be that you are applying around too much. Making multiple applications over a short period of time will only heighten a lenders concern that you are credit hungry. Credit card issuers do not like to see that. Some issuers will deny a card just on the basis that you have been denied elsewhere.</p>
<p>Bad-Credit Credit Cards</p>
<p>If your are stymied in your quest for a regular credit card, you should consider a secured credit card. They work in very much the same way as regular credit cards regarding where they are accepted and how they report to the various credit agencies. They just require a security deposit which can range from $200 to $500. That deposit sets your spending limit. The deposit is never used toward payment unless you default, and you are expected to maintain your monthly payments according to agreed-upon terms. Benefits will be apparent on your credit reports within months.
