<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Prior to being a Life Coach and Laughter Yoga Leader, Mary Rives enjoyed a fruitful career of 20 years as a Clinical Social Worker “on the front lines” and as a Director for non-profit programs. Entering mid-life, she discovered new passions that led her to a joyous path as a “Mirth Maker” and Life Coach.

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Having experienced a great deal of tragedy in the course of her life, Mary spent some of her earlier years oppressed by the dark emotions. However, she did whatever it took to heal from the wounds and truly live again, which meant letting go of my addictions to drama, tobacco and playing the role of victim. Learning to access her inner wisdom–or Higher Self–and opening her heart to self-love, acceptance and forgiveness, Mary discovered that it was much more powerful to courageously love, forgive and embody compassion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kimber Simpkins is an Anusara Yoga Certified Teacher and attorney who earned her law degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1997.  After a brief career in civil rights law, she now teaches yoga in the San Francisco Bay Area, reaching thousands of students from all walks of life.   Her passion for helping women love their bodies comes from her own experience of overcoming anorexia and the persistent, self-destructive mindset that accompanies it.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1468" title="Kimber Simpkins" src="http://www.holistichealthtalkradioforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/kimber1-101x150.jpg" alt="Love Your Body" width="101" height="150" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Throughout her inner struggle she has continued to embrace the humor and beauty of life.   Kimber credits her more than decade long study of yoga, meditation, and spirituality and seven-plus years of teaching yoga and yoga philosophy with giving her the tools to let go of her self-critical mental patterns and replace them with a deep appreciation for her body and the world.  Many women have already experienced the transformational effects of Kimber’s stories and strategies through her “Love Your Body” workshops in the Bay Area.  Her greatest hope is that women across the continent and around the world will profoundly benefit from reading her <a href="http://kimberyoga.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Love Your Body blog</a> and her yet-to-be published memoir, <em>Full: How one woman found yoga, eased her inner hunger, and started loving herself,</em> and undertake their own inner journey to change their relationship to their bodies. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her playful and open manner allows her students to be accepting of where they are both physically, and emotionally.  One of her favorite things to teach is “conscious breathing.”  It is here she believes that the true journey begins in repairing, restoring or maintaining good health, especially for women in recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Diana has observed that having the working knowledge to control the breath will  realistically balance everyday activities and brings a quality of life. When tired or fatigued, which is one of the most prevalent symptoms of cancer treatments, breathing properly can aid in the control and function of the Autonomic Nervous System which is comprised of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system (fight or flight and rest and digest). Balanced energy is needed to perform the most simplest tasks. Deep breathing stimulates an inner calm for the brain which translates out to a relaxed breath. This relaxed breath allows and supports the capacity to perform efficiently.  It gives greatly towards combating fatigue, anxiety, stress and fear and on the tasks at hand. Diana believes that maintaining awareness on the breath when needed will  support women in recovery on many levels.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Crossing the threshold of 40 isn’t the dark, dismal, over the hill event our society has so cleverly convinced you it is – it’s a right of passage, and it should be celebrated as such. You’re wiser now, you’re bolder now, you’ve been through the valley, you’ve paid your dues, and you’ve learned from your mistakes.

A message from Sondra Wright:
Crossing the threshold of 40 isn’t the dark, dismal, over the hill event our society has so cleverly convinced you it is – it’s a right of passage, and it should be celebrated as such. You’re wiser now, you’re bolder now, you’ve been through the valley, you’ve paid your dues, and you’ve learned from your mistakes. Now you can enjoy your mountaintop experiences with all the wisdom, confidence, and money (if you’ve been fortunate) that comes with maturing well.

I embarked upon 40+ and Fabulous because I wanted to give women a gift; a gift that will set you free from the bondage of the invisible chains of limitation. Self imposed boundaries that keep you from reaching for all you would dare to have, do, and become – because of what, AGE? Didn’t you get the memo? Age didn’t limit you, it qualified you!
 And just so you’ll know: being 40+ and Fabulous has nothing to do with wardrobe, attractiveness, size or shape. The 40+ and Fabulous woman is magnificent in the way she values herself and the woman she has and is becoming – and that, girlfriends, is power!

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Stephen Lewis, Developer of <a href="http://www.aimprogram.com">The AIM Program</a>, Co-founder of EMC², and Co-Author of the novel Sanctuary: The Path to Consciousness has been exploring energetic balancing for more than 25 years. His path began with an interest in oriental philosophy combined with German psychiatry, specifically the work of W. Reich who believed energetic imbalance was the cause of all pathology.</span><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1117" title="Stephen Lewis" src="http://www.holistichealthtalkradioforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/StephenLewis.jpg" alt="founder of AIM Program " width="155" height="203" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Eventually Lewis was led to the healing arts. His degrees include acupuncture </span><span style="font-size: medium;">and homeopathy, both of which are forms of energetic healing. Lewis&#8217; extensive studies and research led him directly to the insights upon which EMC² &#8216;s spiritual energetic balancing technology is based. Lewis&#8217; energetic balancing technology, called AIM, has been used by thousands of individuals worldwide and has earned the endorsements of Dr. Wayne Dyer, Rev. Michael Beckwith, author Kevin Trudeau and many others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">EMC² &#8216;s purpose is to find imbalances in consciousness and offer energetic balancing as a way to assist living beings in the clearing and release of those imbalances in order to increase their well-being. Lewis has always made an explicit distinction between the healing that is the natural result of a shift in consciousness as compared to the medical trio of diagnosing, treating and, hopefully, curing. That medical trio is the work of medical professionals and is done TO you. Healing, on the other hand, is definitively in the realm of spirituality and must be done BY you. Lewis points out that true healers don&#8217;t actually heal you, but rather teach or inspire you to find the healing power that you naturally possess. All healing is a result of your consciousness directing your Life Force. And, in that realm, because everything is energy, anything is possible! The character of Max in the novel Sanctuary: The Path to Consciousness by Stephen Lewis and EMC² co-Founder Evan Slawson is based on the life and work of Stephen Lewis.</span><br />
