      <description><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, 2005 to be exact, Isabelle and I had a podcast called Roca's Area.  We went through a couple of format changes etc but we had fun.  We packed it in back in 2009.  We resurrected the show for the first Canadian National Day of Podcasting (Dec 1, 2010).  Well, it is December 1, 2011, so we are back.  Now, I would love to get back into doing this show, but that is another matter.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Everybody out there welcome Maddie to the show.  

Here is episode 113 we discussed Mongolia, a central Asian country Mongolia is probably best known as the home of Genghis Khan.  Good times....

Mongolia has a fascinating recent history too.  They were a communist client state of the Soviet Union, and they became a much more democratic country after a non violent revolution in 1990.  

Mongolian is an interesting language it seems.  You can see the script above, it looks like vulcan...  Then again, in Mongolia itself they use cyrillic rather than the traditional alphabet.  It is also one of the few places where people sometimes go only by a single name, which means Bono or Teller would be happy there..

As far as food goes, they eat a lot of meat and dairy products.  It seems that their food is not that spicy or even seasoned.  Then again, they have been and many still are, nomads.  

Culturally Mongolai is known for a two stringed instrument whose name I forget currently, and throat singing.

It seems they are trying to start a tourism industry, which is pretty cool.  We made a little fun of their website, but in all seriousness, their English is much stronger than our Mongolian...

Next time we are off to the Czech Republic.</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We invited Madeleine to sit in with us in this episode as we talked about Nepal.  Nepal is the birthplace of one of the many Buddhas.  This got us into a discussion of the idea of enlightenment and what it might mean.  Our conclusion, umm, we don’t know.</p>

<p>Nepal is of course the home of the tallest mountain in the world, and apparently people want to climb it and get naked, these people are idiots (clearly Dave is writing these show notes...)</p>

<p>We spoke a bit about the Nepalese culture, which seems to be a multicultural one.  Sort of a melding of Indian and Tibetan traditions, which seems cool.  One group the Newari are a multicultural ethnicity, which is odd and quite well, almost Canadian, except for their music videos...</p>

Well you will have to listen to this episode about Macedonia to find out.</p><p>Macedonia, to Dave, is an interesting country, whereas Isabelle finds it boring...  A landlocked country, Macedonia is one of those countries that used to be part of Yugoslavia.  When they gained independence they of course wanted to call themselves Macedonia.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In our latest trip around the globe we stopped in Venezuela.  Like many South American countries it has been the victim of bad government, too much US influence and frankly it shows.  Venezuela is an interesting case because their government, run by one Hugo Chavez is (at least in name) trying to fight this stuff.  Doubly interesting is the amount of oil they have.</p>

<p>Neither of us are big Chavez fans,(attempting to jail your opposition and shutting down tv stations and newspapers is not that cool) though I guess we see where he is coming from.</p>

<p>Venezuela depends a lot on selling oil.  Now the price of oil has dropped a great deal just in the past two weeks, so we figure the global economic crisis will affect Venezuela too.  We then got into a discussion of the current economic crisis, be concerned...</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the chaos of Episode 106 (which we kept calling episode 107 for some reason).  We had the house full with Madeleine’s friends and we also had one of our most faithful listeners the AmHam, join us over skype.  The AmHam visit was not planned, Dave just twittered that we were about to record and the AmHam showed up.</p><p>We did talk Turkey a little, of course we mentioned Mahir (pictured above) the famous I Kiss You guy, who was probably the first big time net meme.  Isabelle mentioned seeing Paris Hilton of all people judging a beauty contest in Turkey.  AmHam even mentioned a friend of his from Turkey.  Finally we talked a little bit of James Whittingham, our buddy.

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to the chaos of Episode 106 (which we kept calling episode 107 for some reason).  We had the house full with Madeleine’s friends and we also had one of our most faithful listeners the AmHam, join us over skype.  The AmHam visit was not planned, Dave just twittered that we were about to record and the AmHam showed up.We did talk Turkey a little, of course we mentioned Mahir (pictured above) the famous I Kiss You guy, who was probably the first big time net meme.  Isabelle mentioned seeing Paris Hilton of all people judging a beauty contest in Turkey.  AmHam even mentioned a friend of his from Turkey.  Finally we talked a little bit of James Whittingham, our buddy.  Well next time it is off to Portugal.  You are forgiven if you cannot make it through “The Longest Episode Ever That We Never Really Started”.</itunes:summary>

The Taekwondo tenets of courtesy, integrity, self-control, perseverance and indomitable spirit could possibly be all that one needs in order to live a balanced life.  But doesn’t all sports teach you these same attributes? Maybe so, maybe no...Do you agree or disagree? Then, we talked about the Korean war, technology and sports. Hey, remember that guy who died after playing Starcraft for 2 days straight? Thanks Andy for coming and thanks to everyone who commented on our French episode. Our next episode will be our 100th and for that episode, we have planned something very much unexpected. Stay tuned for number 100. Coming soon to earphones near you.  And while you wait, check out these few youtube finds on South Korea...and this one too on tae kwon do... We await your comments ^^...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Meet the revolutionaries, the leftists, the rightists and the absolutists. David and I discuss past and present French politics, including the new contrat social proposed by Nicolas Sarkozy which Quebec’s Jean-Claude Corbeil wishes to emulate with a contrat moral.  (Jean-Jacques Rousseau proposed the original one.) We argue over civil liberties and accomodement raisonnable and la Charte des droits et libertes. We realise that while France and England are now far away countries which do not have much influence in our everyday affairs, we still hold some attachment with these countries. And finally Isabelle ends with a rant about things that bug her about people’s reactions to her French identity. Laissez-nous vos commentaires...Merci...Next, South Korea!]]></description>

      <itunes:summary>Meet the revolutionaries, the leftists, the rightists and the absolutists. David and I discuss past and present French politics, including the new contrat social proposed by Nicolas Sarkozy which Quebec’s Jean-Claude Corbeil wishes to emulate with a contrat moral.  (Jean-Jacques Rousseau proposed the original one.) We argue over civil liberties and accomodement raisonnable and la Charte des droits et libertes. We realise that while France and England are now far away countries which do not have much influence in our everyday affairs, we still hold some attachment with these countries. And finally Isabelle ends with a rant about things that bug her about people’s reactions to her French identity. Laissez-nous vos commentaires...Merci...Next, South Korea!</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[From Rome to Naples and from Classical times to the “Cosmic Rot,” Italy has always been a shaper and driver of the Western World. Our discussion led us to fascism, the Vatican, the Garbage strike in Naples, a philosophical-like debate over “civilizations,” the ability of the Italian people to adapt, and a short discussion about the designs of Daniele Lago. All that from our home, complete with our son Jonathan’s very talkative state and Leap Pad.  This discussion will no sure continue onto our next podcast: FRANCE... Finalement!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This time we are off to Tahiti, an island, well the most important island probably, in French Polynesia.</p>

<p>French Polynesia is a self governing territory of France.  Indeed, there is talk of a referendum to allow independence from France.  This will probably eventually happen.  Historically the islands were annexed to France without France even knowing about it, which says something about global communications in the early 1800s.  We have a (somewhat distant) connection to Tahiti, as Capt James Cook explored the island, and he also explored the region where Corner Brook NL is today.  We lived in CB, so there you are...</p>

<p>We talked quite a bit about Paul Gauguin, who famously moved to Tahiti.  We were looking forward to discussing his work in Tahiti, then, well, we saw the book (his journals) that Isabelle ordered.  He married a 13 year old child while there, then if that was not bad enough, he turned around and left her.  This lead us to a discussion of moral relativism, and well, a discussion of how disgusting we thought Guaguin was as a human.  What do you think?</p>

<p>We recorded this one just after Christmas, so we would like to pass on holiday (whatever holiday you celebrate) greetings to all of our listeners.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to visit Bring Da King to bring James Whittingham to PAB 2008.</p>

<p>Next time it is off to Italy!</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Another in our fine series of road episodes..  In this one, Dave had just returned from Toronto.  While he was there he went to the Futureplay conference (where he was the official blogger) and attended the Toronto Podcast Meetup.</p>

<p>The conference was pretty cool, and there were people there from all over the world, including a video game design team from Sweden that made a game for the DS where you serve drinks to bar patrons (seems they know Dave well....)  This was probably the first year where someone mentioned that there might be a darker side to games.  That said, the conference focussed on the positive.</p>

<p>The podcaster meetup included Sage, Katherine, Scarborough Dude, Jay Moonah from Uncle Seth, John Meadows and Mark Blevis (among others).   The meetup was a blast, and a great time was had by Dave and the crazy left wing nuts in the Canadian podcasting community....</p>

<p>Next tim eit is off to Paraguay, honestly.  Oh, Canada is still ranked number 2 by the IIHF, but we do have the Hockey Hall of Fame which Dave walked by each time he went from his hotel to the conference, so really, we are better than Sweden...</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I was a traveller again these past few days. Iza la voyageuse ! This episode is a phone conversation between Dave and myself describing my stay in “Ottawa-The-Respectable” to meet Mark Blevis and Andrea Ross of the Just One More Book podcast (- and many, many other podcasts) at the Wild Oat Cafe. I felt like royalty spending time with Lord Blevis and Lady Andrea and their two beautiful and talented daughters. Their 6 yr old and 9 year old both speak French and English and each play the violin and the flute. Plus, they are incredibly smart and vivacious. This show is about my two days in Ottawa. The days were filled with various spheres in my life intercepting one another: history, art, podcasting, food, books, family, friends, life with a big L. </p><p>Mark and Andrea made me feel part of the family by including me in their lives. I read stories with the girls and helped with French homework. What a delight it was to get to be a part of the everyday organized chaos that represents family life.  I also enjoyed the company of Mark and Bob as I was a guest on the Canadian Podcast Buffet and I discussed podcasting at the Ottawa Meetup at the Arrow and Loon bistro with a bunch of rowdy people. Some of the podcasters, I had already seen at the Podcasters Across Borders Conference but for the most part, I did not know anybody. (You have to hear this guys’ story about the band Kiss... I still have cramps from laughing so much. What was that guys’ name? Was it Andy?)</p><p>I apologize for all the mistakes I made with names in this episode: I am making sins of inexactitude. You will forgive me, as I was on my way to my Dad’s funeral and my head was in another dimension. Thanks again Mark and Andrea! Merci de tout mon coeur.
