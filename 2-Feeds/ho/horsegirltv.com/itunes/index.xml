<title>Fabulous And Functional Interlocking Mats </title>
<itunes:author>Horse Girl TV</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>The basics of installing interlocking mats </itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>If you have ever install stall mats before you know they are heavy, hard, unforgiving on your back and quite often more trouble than they are worth. We discovered the Interlocking Royal Mats at the Tractor Supply Company show in Nashville when we were out visiting with the Absorbine group. Their stall mat kit was the coolest and easiest installation of mats! Heavy duty yet easy to cut with a few passes! With the interlocking there are no edges to rub and shift when the horse moves around. We installed these mats five months ago and still there is no lifting or shifting what-so-ever. AWESOME!

<title>GGT Footing And The Attwood Pros</title>
<itunes:author>Horse Girl TV</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>HorseGirlTV Talks With Nick Attwood Of Attwood Equestrian Surfaces About Installing GGT Footing</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Several decades of experience with equestrian surfaces, makes Nick Attwood the perfect person to talk with about producing an effective sport horse training surface. Angelea met with Nick Attwood of Attwood Equestrian Surfaces to talk about the installation of GGT, German Geo Textile, footing. GGT-Footing, a shredded textile, that stabilizes the sand particles mimicing the effect of the rooting system of turf, which has a stabilizing effect on the surrounding soil particles. GGT footing give more resilience, reduces the amount of packing and helps to hold moisture in the surface, which leads to reduced dust. The secret with GGT really is in the sand.

<itunes:subtitle>Stall Cleaning Is A Cinch With Shake'n Fork</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Many of the HorseGirlTV fans have emailed about the manure fork we've used in previous webisodes so we're opting simply to show you all how it works. It's a pretty neat fork that definitely saves on the back breaking work of stall picking. At the farm here in NC, we've been using it for over a year now and enjoy it very much. The innovator that created this fork, Joseph Berto, is located in Oregon and passionate about creating time saving and technologically advanced farm related products. We think the folks handling the Gulf Coast oil spill need to connect with him about his tarball fork to help with the clean up efforts!

<title>The HorseGirl Supplement, Flex Max</title>
<itunes:author>Horse Girl TV</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>HorseGirl Mail: What supplement does HorseGirl use?</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Many viewers have emailed in asking about what Angelea uses around the farm for feed, forage and supplements so we decided to cover the basics of supplements. The preferred supplement around the HorseGirlTV farm is Flex plus Max because it contains everything we could want in a supplement in it so there's one bucket, one scoop and it's definitely a time saver too. The plus side is being able to feed it to the dogs as well and they love the taste as much as the horses. We use the pellets but you can get it in a powder as well. For more info on Flex plus Max you can check out Absorbine's website.
