			<title>Laconia, NH's Ghostly Places</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/laconia-nh-s-ghostly-places]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Laconia, New Hampshire is a gold mine of haunted locations.&nbsp; This is Part 2 (of 2) about haunted places around Tilton, Franklin, and Laconia, New Hampshire.</p>
<p>In the previous podcast, Fiona Broome discussed these locations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Hall Memorial Library, Northfield-Tilton, NH.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Tilton Mystery Tunnel, Tilton, NH.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Two buildings and a cemetery at Webster Place, Franklin, NH.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Daniel Webster birthplace, Franklin, NH.</p>
<p>In this 27-minute podcast, Fiona talks about visiting Laconia, NH with a neighbor.&nbsp; He remembered a house from his childhood; the house had "ghost stories" and a legend about a hidden Underground Railroad room.</p>
<p>Fiona describes what happened when they visited the house, including evidence of its Colonial history, the Underground RR room, and hash marks on the attic staircase walls and the inside of the door.</p>
<p>However, the owners of the home assured Fiona and her neighbor that there were no ghosts there.</p>
<p>The next day, Fiona returned to that area and found several other sites worth investigating:</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" title="Tavern 27, Laconia, NH" href="http://www.tavern27.com/">Tavern 27</a></strong> at the Mystic Meadows, 2075 Parade Road, Laconia, NH, and the gift shop behind it.</p>
<p>The former site of the Anti-Pedo Baptist Church of Meredith, NH, which was burned to the ground on behalf of a neighbor, Mrs. Morgan.</p>
<p>Mead Cemetery (433427N / 0712936W) and Round Bay Cemetery, Laconia, NH.</p>
<p>Fiona also recommends looking for the Folsom graves at Laconia's Union Cemetery (between Garfield St. and Academy St.), where the petrified bodies were reburied.</p>
<p>How to find similar haunted locations where you are:</p>
<p>1. Ask people if they know any local, haunted places.</p>
<p>2. Follow your instincts.&nbsp; Drive around, look at maps, and -- psychic or not -- pay attention to your "gut feelings."</p>
<p>3. Research history! Look for patterns -- geographical or historical -- that connect the locations.</p>
<p>4. Ask more questions.&nbsp; Collect more stories and look for "odd" comments and history.</p>
<p>5. Investigate, then ask more questions, and conduct more historical research.</p>

			<title>Ghost Lab, Provoking, and Being Mystic - Fiona Broome of HollowHill.com</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/ghost-lab-provoking-and-being-mystic-fiona-broome-of-hollow-hill-com]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this 14-minute podcast, Fiona Broome talks about several controversial topics.</p>
<p>First, she explains that she's not going to <em>appear</em> on a TV show (unless absolutely necessary), she's been working <em>behind the scenes </em>on a TV series.&nbsp; She finds, researches and recommends locations for a new TV series that's airing beginning in June 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, she talks about ghost-related TV shows in general, and admits that she watches (and likes) one paranormal TV show: Ghost Lab.</p>
<p>Here's why she likes them:</p>
<ul>
<li>They get the history right, usually.</li>
<li>They try new, interesting things and admit when those experiments don't work.</li>
<li>The show is realistic.&nbsp; They don't act as if all the cool stuff happens in one hour or even six hours.</li>
<li>The cast react appropriately to phenomena.</li>
<li>The cast are blunt and connect with the ghosts with integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, Fiona revisits the topic of "provoking," because the Ghost Lab team's version of provoking isn't the same as the taunting seen on some other shows.</p>
<p>The question is, if you were talking with that person (the ghost) in real life, would you be challenging them and helping them come to terms with what's happened, or are you taunting them?</p>
<p>After that, Fiona reviews a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1846945283/hollowhill">Being Mystic - In Touch with God</a>, by Betsy Balega.&nbsp; It addresses psychic issues and paranormal research from a Christian (Catholic) foundation.&nbsp; In this book, Ms. Balega tells her own story in a chatty, personal manner.&nbsp; Then, she talks about being psychic in the context of spiritual beliefs.&nbsp; The book is written with tremendous sensitivity, and shares excellent advice.</p>
<p>Though you may not agree with Ms. Balega's spiritual choices, open-minded readers will discover useful insights that resonate across religious lines.&nbsp; (If you really can't stand Catholicism, or Christianity in general, this book is not for you.)</p>
<p>Finally, Fiona reminds listeners that challenging spirits in healthy ways, giving them good advice, can be part of a productive parnormal investigation.</p>

			<title>Ghost, Demon, or What?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/ghost-demon-or-what-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>If it's not a ghost or a demon... <em>what is it?</em></p>
<p>In this 17-minute podcast, paranormal researcher Fiona Broome talks about phenomena that don't fit our usual "ghosts" context, but aren't demons, either.</p>
<p>First, Fiona provides her own definitions for ghostly, poltergeist, and demonic activity.&nbsp; Her main emphasis is on the scope of the phenomena and how much seems externally-caused v. internal, and how people react to it... and how quickly.</p>
<p>Then, she talks about the <em>main</em> explanations for activity that's <em>probably</em> not a classic ghost or a demon, as those words are popularly used.</p>
<p>Here are a few explanations:</p>
<p>1. Nothing is going on.&nbsp; The person is making it up.&nbsp; (This can still be a serious problem that needs to be addressed.)</p>
<p>2. The phenomena are natural, from animal sounds to EIFs. (Experience Inducing Fields including infrasound, EMF and geomagnetic energy anomalies.)</p>
<p>3. It's a deliberate prank.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4. The phenomena relate to alternate paranormal, supernatural or spiritual contexts, including faeries, aliens, the Loa, imps, djinns, and so on.</p>
<p>5. We're experiencing effects from a parallel reality, as described by quantum science.&nbsp; This could be the influence of someone alive &amp; well in that reality, a ghost in that reality, or a demon in that realm whose influence is seeping into our world.</p>
<p>Fiona's main point is:&nbsp; No matter what is actually going on, if someone is clearly in trouble, they need immediate help.</p>
<p>She also explains the difference between a <em>demonologist</em> and an <em>exorcist,</em> and why a second opinion is always important.</p>]]></description>

			<title>'Impossible' Hauntings - New Evidence</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/-impossible-hauntings-new-evidence]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>For years, people have said, "My house is only five years old and there wasn't anything on the land before.&nbsp; Why is my house haunted?"In this 22-minute podcast, paranormal researcher Fiona Broome provides possible answers.</p>
<p>Fiona starts with the usual explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Something <em>was</em> on the land, long ago, but the new home's builder didn't know it had been there.</li>
<li>Something about the current residents -- possibly their family history -- connects with each other and/or the immediate geographical area.&nbsp; That energy enables spirits to act-out past events or go through the (sometimes slow) process of closure.&nbsp; (Fiona admits this a a very "woo-woo" concept.)</li>
<li>Your family has a secret history -- perhaps nobody talked about "crazy" Great-aunt Prudence who was an amazing psychic and ghosts talked to <em>her</em> -- that suggests a genetic predisposition to attracting spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Then Fiona explains additional information from her most recent research.&nbsp; She starts with additional information related to Ireland's <a title="Duckett's Grove Castle article at HollowHill.com" href="http://hollowhill.com/ducketts-grove-castle-ireland-ghost-hunting-tips/" target="_blank">Duckett's Grove Castle</a>, featured in the St. Patrick's Day 2011 episode of <em>Destination: Truth.&nbsp; </em>Though hunting for a <a title="Banshees and ghost hunting" href="http://hollowhill.com/banshees-and-ghost-hunting/" target="_blank">Banshee</a> (bean sidhe) isn't recommended -- and <a title="Destination Truth Banshees - blond? shrouded?" href="http://hollowhill.com/destination-truth-banshees-blond-shrouded/" target="_blank">Banshees aren't always blonde or in a shroud</a> -- the cursed castle led Fiona to additional discoveries about <a title="Duckett Family Curse" href="http://hollowhill.com/the-duckett-family-curse/" target="_blank">the Duckett family and their cursed <em>English</em> home</a>.</p>
<p>That led to the apparent contagion of tragedy at Lowther Castle.&nbsp;</p>

			<title>Paragenealogy - Basics</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/paragenealogy-basics-1]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this six-minute mini-podcast, Fiona Broome shares <em>very</em> basic steps to begin your paragenealogy research.&nbsp; (Her book will explain this in far more detail.)</p>
<p>Begin with <em>your own</em> family history.&nbsp; That will show you the possible connections -- and innate rapport you may have -- with specific ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Step 1. Ask your family for information about your parents and grandparents.&nbsp; Include all information.&nbsp; Don't omit things that "everybody knows." <em>Write it all down.</em></p>
<p>For each person, you'll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name at birth</li>
<li>Place of birth</li>
<li>Full date of birth</li>
</ul>
<p>If possible (or relevant) ask also for when &amp; where they were  married, and -- if the person is deceased -- when &amp; where the person  died and is buried.</p>
<p>The correct name is very important.&nbsp; The  location -- country, state, county, and city or town -- are vital, so  get as much data as you can.&nbsp; The date is helpful, but not as essential  as the correct name and location.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tip: Allow for spelling errors in public records.&nbsp; For example, Fiona's <em>Maloney</em> ancestors' names have been spelled Mulloney, Malloney, Mallony, and so  on.&nbsp; Never rule out an historical record just because of a spelling  error.</p>
<p>Step 2. Visit Ancestry.com and use their <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1659230-10467608" target="_blank">free trial membership</a><img src="http://www.lduhtrp.net/image-1659230-10467608" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> to research more of your family history.&nbsp; (There are many other  resources, online and off, but Ancestry.com is the largest online  resource with the easiest interface.&nbsp; And, it costs nothing to try it;  you may find all the information you need during that free trial  membership.)</p>
<p>Once you know who your ancestors were, and the  important historical eras (and locations) that are part of your family  history, you'll also know the kinds of hauntings that may respond more  intensely to you, personally.</p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[In this six-minute mini-podcast, Fiona Broome shares very basic steps to begin your paragenealogy research.&nbsp; (Her book will explain this in far more detail.)
Begin with your own family history.&nbsp; That will show you the possible connections -- and innate rapport you may have -- with specific ghosts.
Summary:
Step 1. Ask your family for information about your parents and grandparents.&nbsp; Include all information.&nbsp; Don't omit things that "everybody knows." Write it all down.
For each person, you'll need the following:

Name at birth
Place of birth
Full date of birth

If possible (or relevant) ask also for when &amp; where they were  married, and -- if the person is deceased -- when &amp; where the person  died and is buried.
The correct name is very important.&nbsp; The  location -- country, state, county, and city or town -- are vital, so  get as much data as you can.&nbsp; The date is helpful, but not as essential  as the correct name and location.
Tip: Allow for spelling errors in public records.&nbsp; For example, Fiona's Maloney ancestors' names have been spelled Mulloney, Malloney, Mallony, and so  on.&nbsp; Never rule out an historical record just because of a spelling  error.
Step 2. Visit Ancestry.com and use their free trial membership to research more of your family history.&nbsp; (There are many other  resources, online and off, but Ancestry.com is the largest online  resource with the easiest interface.&nbsp; And, it costs nothing to try it;  you may find all the information you need during that free trial  membership.)
Once you know who your ancestors were, and the  important historical eras (and locations) that are part of your family  history, you'll also know the kinds of hauntings that may respond more  intensely to you, personally.]]></itunes:subtitle>

<p>In this 16-minute podcast, Fiona Broome talks about ghost hunting in 2010 and early 2011.<br /><br />Initially, she talks about cycles of interest in ghosts.<br /><br /><strong>The past 100 years</strong><br /><br />The Victorian / Spiritualist era (1870s - 1920s) when many researchers made remarkable discoveries, but today that time is remembered for its frauds.&nbsp; Modern researchers would do well to review the older books, journals and magazines of that era.<br /><br />The 1960s, when spirituality and the hippie movement led to a fascination with all things paranormal.&nbsp; Fiona recommends the book <a title="Conjuring Up Philip" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0770100058/hollowhill">Conjuring Up Philip</a>, and some episodes of the (somewhat dated but delightfully campy) TV series, <a title="One Step Beyond" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002DMJM7K/hollowhill">One Step Beyond</a>.&nbsp; Amid the hype and woo-woo silliness, breakthroughs in areas such as EMF could be helpful to us today.<br /><br />Modern researchers can read books by authors such as Jess Stearn and Hans Holzer, and find important bedrock studies related to paranormal studies.&nbsp; Then, search for those topics and researchers, online, to see what's been discovered since then.<br /><br /><strong>Where we are now</strong><br /><br />Fiona then talks about the ghost hunting field today.&nbsp; Paranormal research is facing a widening gap between entertainment -- particularly TV and radio shows -- and serious research.<br /><br />She reminds listeners that she's never lost her respect for many people on ghost-related TV shows, including the Ghost Hunters franchise&hellip; while seeing many shows scripted and edited for popularity instead of credibility.<br /><br />Fiona relates the current scene to election year, with a very vocal (and very small) minority loudly boasting about themselves while shamelessly trashing others.&nbsp; Fiona says that she's decided to step back from the fray before it turned into the paranormal equivalent of the Jerry Springer show.<br /><br />However, despite the sideshow fueled by social media sites and bad radio shows, Fiona raves about the serious research, such as real-time communication with ghosts as well as scientific studies of ghostly phenomena.<br /><br />She recommends websites, podcasts and books that focus on the academic side of ghost hunting&hellip; unless you're mostly interested in entertainment and a "good scare."<br /><br /><strong>EVP studies</strong><br /><br />Fiona talks about her current surveys of EVP recordings, looking for patterns in the noises and voices in those recordings.&nbsp; To participate in those studies (anonymously), see Fiona's article,&nbsp; <strong><a title="EVP Survey 1 - Hollow Hill Anomalies Project" href="http://hollowhill.com/evp-survey-1-voices/">EVP Survey #1 - Voices</a></strong>.<br /><br />Initial survey results support these popular beliefs:<br /><br />1.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this 16-minute podcast, Fiona Broome talks about the waning popularity of ghost hunting, and why that might be a <em>good</em> thing.&nbsp; However, on TV and off, people are going to extremes to try and maintain their corner of the market.&nbsp; Parts of this field are imploding in a flurry of drama, catfights, mudslinging and flame wars.</p>
<p>Fiona plans to sit this dance out.&nbsp; She'll be speaking at Dragon*Con 2010, but otherwise expects to keep a low profile -- and keep writing books -- through the end of 2010 and perhaps early 2011.</p>
<p>Also in this podcast, Fiona warns about the folly and liabilities of focusing more on ghost hunting tools than on the haunted environment around you.&nbsp; She offers several tips, including ways to use your real-time communication devices (EVP, Puck, Ovilus, Frank's Box, Shack Hack, pendulum,etc.) to <em>plan ahead</em> for a ghost investigation.</p>
<p>Finally, Fiona recommends reading the beginning of <a title="Embraced by the Light" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553382152/hollowhill">Embraced by the Light</a>, by Betty Eadie.&nbsp; As one of the most detailed descriptions of a reported near-death experience, we can learn from what she describes.&nbsp; If some ghosts go through the same steps, this may help us understand where they are and what they're dealing with, before they "cross over."</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ontario Ghosts - GHOSTS Report / Part 1</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/ontario_ghosts_ghosts_report_part_1]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ontario is far more paranormal than most people realize.&nbsp; Ghosts, Bigfoot sightings, UFOs, and more make this a great destination for researchers.</p>
<p>In this 18 1/2 minute podcast, Fiona talks about some haunted sites she explored during the May 2010 <a title="GHOSTS conference, Ontario, Canada" href="http://www.ghostsconference.com/" target="_blank">G.H.O.S.T.S. Conference</a> hosted by Margaret Byl and her team.</p>
<p><strong>Fort George</strong> - Here, Fiona burned through four sets of camera batteries in a little over an hour, taking just 89 photos.&nbsp; This 1802 fort is known for apparitions and paranormal encounters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Link:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/on/fortgeorge/index.aspx" target="_blank">Fort George National Historic Site</a> and <a href="http://www.friendsoffortgeorge.ca/ghost.htm" target="_blank">Friends of Fort George :: Ghost Tours</a></p>
<p><strong>Fort Mississauga</strong> - This 1814 fort was built to replace Fort George when the older fort was captured by U.S. forces in 1813.&nbsp; Fiona encountered residual energy in the basement, cold spots around the first floor, and noted considerable activity in the top floor/attic.&nbsp; Outside, she saw two full apparitions, one in costume.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/on/fortgeorge/natcul/natcul2b.aspx" target="_blank">Fort Mississauga</a> (part of the Fort George National Historic Site)</p>
<p><strong>The Prince of Wales Hotel</strong> at Niagara-on-the-Lake was where Fiona participated in an eerie seance that involved more active participants (on both sides) than expected.&nbsp; Spirits were named George, Ben, Cindy or Cynthia, plus an entity with a frog-like appearance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This elegant Victorian hotel is a charming location for a good night's sleep during your visit to the area. You can stay here without any worries about troublesome spirits.</p>
<p>However, it's also a very powerful setting for seances, if (and only if) you choose to participate in one. This is not recommended for novices or anyone easily frightened.&nbsp; Spiritual protection is advised if you attempt a seance.&nbsp; Fiona strongly discourages use of a Ouija board in this location.</p>

			<title>Ghosts - Trends, Questions, Answers</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/ghosts_trends_questions_answers]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>What new and what's "old" in ghost hunting?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TRENDS AND POPULARITY</strong></p>
<p>Fiona Broome explains the latest ghost-related trends, based on search volume at Google:</p>
<p>"Ghosts" have been declining in popularity since October 2004.&nbsp; Interest peaked over five years ago.</p>
<p>"Ghost hunters" gains and loses popularity, based on interest in the show of the same name.&nbsp; Search volume for "ghost hunters" reached an all-time high at Google in October 2009, and Google predicts that 2009's levels will continue through 2010.</p>
<p>"Demons" spiked in May 2009, and then resumed its usual lackluster performance at Google.</p>
<p>By contrast, "demonology" began attracting interest in September 2009, and has maintained popularity with an overall upward trend.</p>
<p>"Paranormal" surged in popularity in October 2009 with the release of "Paranormal Activity."&nbsp; A slump in searches quickly followed, but we're now seeing a gradual increase as more people choose to say "paranormal" rather than "ghosts."</p>
<p><strong>NEW PEOPLE IN GHOST HUNTING</strong></p>
<p>Fiona is receiving more interesting emails and good questions.&nbsp; She believes that many bright people are new to ghost hunting, having avoided the field during its trendiest years.</p>
<p>Other interesting emails are from people who were too young to get involved with paranormal research in 2004 and earlier, when interest in ghosts was at its peak.</p>
<p>Those are the two groups of new ghost hunters not included in the <a title="Diffusion of Innovations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_Innovations" target="_blank">Diffusion of Innovations</a> theory.&nbsp; (According to that theory, innovators and early adopters are involved at the <em>start</em> of any trend or fad.&nbsp; Later arrivals aren't as likely to think in original terms.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though there are many people arriving on the ghost hunting scene now, thinking it's the "cool" place to be, Fiona's readers (and listeners) seem to be <em>original </em>thinkers and innovators, ready to take ghost hunting in new directions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p>Question: Will a rock salt gun work against dangerous ghosts?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fiona's answer: Probably not.&nbsp; That was a plot device on a (fictional) TV show, Supernatural.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Rock salt guns are used for riots and crowd control. Salt is used as a ghost repellant, but it's simply something that ghosts seem to avoid.&nbsp; Using it in self-defense seems silly; ghosts don't have physical bodies in our world -- or they don't seem to, anyway -- and a physical weapon is unlikely to have any impact... literally.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Besides, there are annoying ghosts and territorial ghosts, but no truly <em>dangerous</em> ghosts. Not by intent, anyway. (Some pranksters cause harm, but it's usually unintentional and not severe.)</p>
<p>Question: What's the scariest ghost you've ever met?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fiona's answer:&nbsp; I've never encountered a scary ghost.&nbsp; Ghosts are just people without physical form in this reality/realm/world.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I'm not comfortable around certain non-ghost entities and energies that seem to be at a few "haunted" locations -- including Vale End Cemetery in Wilton, NH and the Falstaff Experience in Stratford-upon-Avon in England -- but those aren't ghosts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I don't have "scary" ghost stories because I'm not afraid of ghosts, and I don't think anyone should be afraid of them.</p>
<p>Question: If ghosts are real and the evidence is so startling, why don't most TV shows include helping the people who have to live or work in the haunted places?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fiona's answer: I like to think that most shows have a special team that handles that, after the cameras stop filming.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, the before-show and after-show work isn't very interesting to watch.&nbsp; In many cases, it's tedious.&nbsp; Because people don't see that and don't realize what goes on, I wrote <a title="Is My House Haunted?" href="http://www.hauntedhousebook.com/" target="_blank">Is My House Haunted?</a> to explain the steps to determine if a house is probably haunted.</p>
<p>Question: Why do people talk in English to ghosts that never spoke English?&nbsp; Also, why are most EVPs in English?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fiona's answer: "Talking" to a ghost isn't so the ghost hears you -- <em>if</em> ghosts actually have ears that can hear in our world -- it's to improve your own focus and intent to communicate with the spirit.&nbsp; After that, it's all telepathy... sort of like silent prayer communicates "telepathically" with Deity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">People are most familiar with EVPs they've seen on TV. Since most ghost-related TV shows are for English-speaking audiences, they generally play English language EVPs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, several researchers report recording EVPs in other languages.&nbsp; So, I think there are plenty of non-English EVPs.</p>
<p>Question: If artifacts are such a problem (as skeptics claim) with digital cameras, why do TV shows use digital video cameras on ghost hunts?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fiona's answer:&nbsp; There are two practical reasons to use digital video cameras on ghost hunts.&nbsp; One is economy; with tens of hours of footage from most ghost hunts, the cost would be prohibitive if we were using film.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The other benefit of digital media is that we can review it instantly, and debunk the apparent anomaly... or gather further evidence to support it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, I plan to use a film camera more often during my ghost investigations.&nbsp; We may photograph more anomalies and apparent evidence with digital cameras, due to how they perceive physical form, light and energy.&nbsp; However, a good photo supported by an unretouched film negative adds a lot to credibility.</p>
<p>Question: Are there any truly credible ghost photos?&nbsp; If so, where are they?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fiona's answer: If you're looking for something that we can point to and say, "That's a ghost," I haven't seen that kind of photo yet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, I've taken (and seen) many photographic anomalies that defy explanation.&nbsp; Though I still won't say the <em>anomalies</em> are actually ghosts, those photos -- and other, supporting evidence -- suggest that something odd is going on at the location.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The supporting evidence is key, in my opinion.&nbsp; I <em>never </em>start with an anomalous photo and then decide that the site is haunted, based solely on a couple of odd photos.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[What new and what's "old" in ghost hunting?&nbsp;
TRENDS AND POPULARITY
Fiona Broome explains the latest ghost-related trends, based on search volume at Google:
"Ghosts" have been declining in popularity since October 2004.&nbsp; Interest peaked over five years ago.
"Ghost hunters" gains and loses popularity, based on interest in the show of the same name.&nbsp; Search volume for "ghost hunters" reached an all-time high at Google in October 2009, and Google predicts that 2009's levels will continue through 2010.
"Demons" spiked in May 2009, and then resumed its usual lackluster performance at Google.
By contrast, "demonology" began attracting interest in September 2009, and has maintained popularity with an overall upward trend.
"Paranormal" surged in popularity in October 2009 with the release of "Paranormal Activity."&nbsp; A slump in searches quickly followed, but we're now seeing a gradual increase as more people choose to say "paranormal" rather than "ghosts."
NEW PEOPLE IN GHOST HUNTING
Fiona is receiving more interesting emails and good questions.&nbsp; She believes that many bright people are new to ghost hunting, having avoided the field during its trendiest years.
Other interesting emails are from people who were too young to get involved with paranormal research in 2004 and earlier, when interest in ghosts was at its peak.
Those are the two groups of new ghost hunters not included in the Diffusion of Innovations theory.&nbsp; (According to that theory, innovators and early adopters are involved at the start of any trend or fad.&nbsp; Later arrivals aren't as likely to think in original terms.)&nbsp;
Though there are many people arriving on the ghost hunting scene now, thinking it's the "cool" place to be, Fiona's readers (and listeners) seem to be original thinkers and innovators, ready to take ghost hunting in new directions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Question: Will a rock salt gun work against dangerous ghosts?
Fiona's answer: Probably not.&nbsp; That was a plot device on a (fictional) TV show, Supernatural.&nbsp;
Rock salt guns are used for riots and crowd control. Salt is used as a ghost repellant, but it's simply something that ghosts seem to avoid.&nbsp; Using it in self-defense seems silly; ghosts don't have physical bodies in our world -- or they don't seem to, anyway -- and a physical weapon is unlikely to have any impact... literally.
Besides, there are annoying ghosts and territorial ghosts, but no truly dangerous ghosts. Not by intent, anyway. (Some pranksters cause harm, but it's usually unintentional and not severe.)
Question: What's the scariest ghost you've ever met?
Fiona's answer:&nbsp; I've never encountered a scary ghost.&nbsp; Ghosts are just people without physical form in this reality/realm/world.&nbsp;
I'm not comfortable around certain non-ghost entities and energies that seem to be at a few "haunted" locations -- including Vale End Cemetery in Wilton, NH and the Falstaff Experience in Stratford-upon-Avon in England -- but those aren't ghosts.
I don't have "scary" ghost stories because I'm not afraid of ghosts, and I don't think anyone should be afraid of them.
Question: If ghosts are real and the evidence is so startling, why don't most TV shows include helping the people who have to live or work in the haunted places?
Fiona's answer: I like to think that most shows have a special team that handles that, after the cameras stop filming.
However, the before-show and after-show work isn't very interesting to watch.&nbsp; In many cases, it's tedious.&nbsp; Because people don't see that and don't realize what goes on, I wrote Is My House Haunted? to explain the steps to determine if a house is probably haunted.
Question: Why do people talk in English to ghosts that never spoke English?&nbsp; Also, why are most EVPs in English?
Fiona's answer: "Talking" to a ghost isn't so the ghost hears you -- if ghosts actually have ears that can hear in our world -- it's to improve your own focus and intent to communicate with the spirit.&nbsp; After that, it's all telepathy... sort of like silent prayer communicates "telepathically" with Deity.
People are most familiar with EVPs they've seen on TV. Since most ghost-related TV shows are for English-speaking audiences, they generally play English language EVPs.&nbsp;
However, several researchers report recording EVPs in other languages.&nbsp; So, I think there are plenty of non-English EVPs.
Question: If artifacts are such a problem (as skeptics claim) with digital cameras, why do TV shows use digital video cameras on ghost hunts?
Fiona's answer:&nbsp; There are two practical reasons to use digital video cameras on ghost hunts.&nbsp; One is economy; with tens of hours of footage from most ghost hunts, the cost would be prohibitive if we were using film.
The other benefit of digital media is that we can review it instantly, and debunk the apparent anomaly... or gather further evidence to support it.
However, I plan to use a film camera more often during my ghost investigations.&nbsp; We may photograph more anomalies and apparent evidence with digital cameras, due to how they perceive physical form, light and energy.&nbsp; However, a good photo supported by an unretouched film negative adds a lot to credibility.
Question: Are there any truly credible ghost photos?&nbsp; If so, where are they?
Fiona's answer: If you're looking for something that we can point to and say, "That's a ghost," I haven't seen that kind of photo yet.
However, I've taken (and seen) many photographic anomalies that defy explanation.&nbsp; Though I still won't say the anomalies are actually ghosts, those photos -- and other, supporting evidence -- suggest that something odd is going on at the location.&nbsp;
The supporting evidence is key, in my opinion.&nbsp; I never start with an anomalous photo and then decide that the site is haunted, based solely on a couple of odd photos.

			<title>Ghosts Near Salem Massachusetts</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/ghosts_near_salem_massachusetts]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Haunted Salem, Massachusetts</strong> is known for a colorful maritime history  and its witch history.&nbsp; Some people also call it one of America's most  haunted cities.</p>
<p>However, some of the most intensely haunted areas  aren't actually in Salem.&nbsp; They're in nearby Danvers and Lynn.</p>
<p>In  this 18-minute podcast, Fiona Broome describes four haunted sites --  three of them connected with the Salem Witch Trials of 1692 -- that are  worth visiting.</p>
<p><img src="http://hollowhill.com/ghosthunting/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/parris-parsonage-illus.jpg" alt="Reverend Mr. Samuel Parris' home site in Danvers, MA" hspace="15" width="250" height="188" align="left" />Salem Village of 1692 is now in the town of  Danvers.&nbsp; In addition to a lovely witch memorial and several related  historic sites, Danvers is where the witch hysteria began.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At  Center Street in Danvers, you can see the foundation of the parsonage of  <strong>the Rev. Mr. Samuel Parris</strong>.&nbsp; His daughter Betty and niece  Abigail were among the first "afflicted" girls, and his slave, Tituba,  was among those accused.</p>
<p>The site is open to the public and has  interesting historical markers explaining what's there.&nbsp; It's also  unnaturally quiet.</p>
<p><img src="http://hollowhill.com/ghosthunting/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/whipplehill-salem-illus.jpg" alt="Odd vines and plants at Whipple Hill, Danvers, MA" hspace="15" width="183" height="242" align="right" />Nearby,<strong> Whipple Hill </strong>--  sometimes called "witch hill" -- was the site of supposed spectral  gatherings of witches in 1692.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, it's a lovely location for  hiking, but it's also a little eerie.&nbsp; Park at nearby Endicott Park  (fee charged) to explore it.</p>
<p>The hiking paths are well-marked but  uneven, so wear appropriate hiking shoes, boots, or sneakers.</p>
<p>The  hill is a gentle climb, suitable for a family outing.&nbsp; From the top of  the hill, the view can be lovely.</p>
<p>However, like the other sites  connected with the witch trials, there's something very odd about the  sense of solitude and silence at Whipple Hill.&nbsp; It starts almost as soon  as you leave the nearby road.</p>
<p>Also notice the odd, twisted plants  growing wild just off the hiking path.&nbsp; They're lovely.&nbsp; Strange... but  lovely.</p>
<p><img src="http://hollowhill.com/ghosthunting/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/nurse-homestead-illus.jpg" alt="Rebecca Nurse Homestead" hspace="15" width="232" height="174" align="left" />Before  leaving Danvers, visit the <strong>Rebecca Nurse Homestead</strong>.&nbsp; It's just  off Pine Street, not far from the Parris site and Whipple Hill.&nbsp;  (However, you'll drive there.&nbsp; It's a little far to walk.)</p>
<p>Open  seasonally, this is a large historical attraction that shows many  aspects of life from the 17th century to the present.</p>
<p>Rebecca  Nurse's story was one of many tragic tales from the 1692 hysteria.&nbsp; Her  grave may also be on the property, making this a site especially  interesting if you're mixing history and ghost hunting.</p>
<p>Not far  from Danvers, <strong>Lynn Woods State Park</strong> is the home of an even older  haunted location.&nbsp; Park near the Rose Garden entrance to the park, and  hike in to the stone stair -- sometimes steep -- that lead to Dungeon  Rock.&nbsp; There, the pirate Thomas Veale guarded a pirate treasure.&nbsp; An  early earthquake sealed him inside the rocky hill along with the  treasure.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Veale contacted Hiram Marble, who  bought the land and began excavating to find the treasure.&nbsp; His efforts  were not successful, and -- according to legends -- the site is still  haunted by Veale and others.</p>

			<title>Who Attracts Ghosts?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/who_attracts_ghosts_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Who attracts ghosts?&nbsp; How can you attract a ghost, and how can you  get them to leave you alone?</p>
<p>In this 18-minute podcast, Fiona  Broome talks about the four main reasons ghosts may seem drawn to some  people and not others:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ghosts seem to manifest more often to people who will notice them  rather than ignore them.</li>
<li>If you don't order ghosts to perform ("Knock once for yes"), <em>some</em> seem more interested in manifesting. (Others like to be told what to do.)</li>
<li>Some people seem to be beacons and -- sometimes just briefly --  attract individual spirits.</li>
<li>Sometimes it's not the person, it's the location that's attracting  spirits.&nbsp; (For example, if there are heavy quartz deposits under the  house.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Fiona also reminds listeners that ghosts have personalities.&nbsp; Some  are nice, some are fearful, some are shy, and some are bullies.&nbsp; The  latter should not be encouraged, as they can prey on vulnerable,  frightened people.</p>
<p>Ghosts don't kill people.&nbsp; The Bell Witch is  the only significant story that suggested otherwise, but Fiona believes  the Bell Witch "murder" -- and many of the so-called hauntings -- were  actually committed by someone very human and alive.</p>
<p>Some ghosts  seem to cause harm, but it's usually either a playful spirit whose  efforts went awry, or it's a poltergeist.</p>
<p>If you want to attract  spirits, pay more attention to them.&nbsp; Like people, they seem to respond  better to those who treat them like everyday people, and respect them as  equals.</p>
<p>However, be sure to establish your boundaries before you set out  the welcome mat.</p>
<p>If you want ghosts to leave you alone, ignore  them.&nbsp; If you are afraid of them, that can attract bully-type ghosts.&nbsp;  Overcoming your fear is vital.</p>

			<title>What Do Ghosts Look Like?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/what_do_ghosts_look_like_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>What do ghosts look like?&nbsp; In this 18-minute podcast -- the first of two -- Fiona Broome explains what to look for, if you'd like to see a ghost.</p>
<p>She divides visual phenomena into five kinds:</p>
<p>1. Light and shadows, including shadow figures.</p>
<p>2. Figures that look like people -- sometimes with clearly observed faces and clothing -- seen out of the side or corner of your eye.</p>
<p>3. Visual distortions, where proportions seem odd, or you see wavy lines.</p>
<p>4. Reflections, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflections from windows, especially at dusk or after dark.</li>
<li>Reflections on shiny and polished surfaces such as metal, tabletops, and hardwood floors.</li>
<li>Strange reflections in mirrors, especially older mirrors, and often at dusk or at night.</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Full apparitions that appear like living, breathing people... but they do something that signals that they aren't regular, living people.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/ghosts_of_the_spalding_inn_part_one]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In the first of a two-part podcast, Fiona Broome describes her experiences at the haunted Spalding Inn in Whitefield, New Hampshire.<br/><br/>Fiona first explains how the Spalding Inn is similar to Lousiana's haunted Myrtles Plantation.&nbsp; Both seem cute by day, and change dramatically after dark.<br/><br/>However, that's where the similarity ends.&nbsp; The Myrtles is haunted by tragic events that occurred to previous owners and residents of the plantation.&nbsp; The Spalding is primarily haunted by former hotel guests, who return (or exist in a parallel realm) to a favorite vacation site.&nbsp; (Note: There is at least one exception, and Fiona will describe that in the next podcast.)<br/><br/>In this podcast, Fiona provides an overview of the Spalding.&nbsp; She talks about the ghosts at the end of the guest wing, and the Native American lore that may attract or lend power to its ghosts.<br/><br/>She also explains the odd entity -- or projection -- she encountered during an earlier investigation at the Spalding Inn.<br/><br/>Fiona talks about the daytime anomalies upstairs at the hotel, and the sense of &quot;stepping back into an earlier time&quot; that guests can experience in the dining room as well as in the guest rooms.<br/><br/>Link: <a href="http://www.thespaldinginn.com/">The Spalding Inn</a>, Whitefield, NH<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

Demons and malicious spirits are very rare.&nbsp; If you think you're being bothered by a demon, call an expert, not just the local ghost hunting club.&nbsp; However, demons and evil entities appear at about 1% of the hauntings we encounter... if that many.<br/><br/>3.

            <description><![CDATA[Is my house haunted?&nbsp; People often ask that question.<br/><br/>In this podcast, Fiona Broome explains the three important steps to take if you think your house (or a client's) is haunted.<br/><br/>1. Keep a diary of what's going on, and then have someone evaluate it from a &quot;home handyman&quot; (DIY) viewpoint.&nbsp; If there's no reasonable explanation for the phenomena, it may be a ghost.<br/><br/>2. Decide if the ghost is a problem.&nbsp; If there are no safety issues, your sleep isn't interrupted, and no one is excessively stressed by the haunting, find ways to live with your ghost/s.&nbsp; Otherwise, consult a professional in the paranormal field.<br/><br/>3. Find a genuine professional.&nbsp; Ask for references (not just the person's neighbors and family members) and be sure to check all of them.&nbsp; Look for significant experience (<span style="font-style: italic;">at least</span> six months to a year of professional-level work) and consistently happy clients.<br/><br/>Remember, the vast majority of haunted houses either aren't really haunted, or the haunting is simply residual energy, not an actual ghost. <br/><br/>This logical, step-by-step approach can relieve worries and stress over a possible haunting.<br/><br/>Mentioned in the podcast:<br/><br/><a target="_blank" href="http://www.myrtlesplantation.com/">The Myrtles Plantation</a>, Louisiana (<a href="http://hollowhill.com/podcasts-the-myrtles-plantation/">related podcasts</a>)<br/><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thespaldinginn.com/">The Spalding Inn</a>, Whitefield, NH<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right;">Music: Zombie, by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.podsafeaudio.com/jamroom/bands/3/somnolent_electronic_neo-existentialism.php">Devin Anderson</a><br type="_moz"/></div>]]></description>

			<title>Ghost hunting: Witching hour? Spirituality?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/ghost_hunting_witching_hour_spirituality_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In this HollowHill.com podcast, Fiona Broome answers several questions from readers.<br/>
<br/>
Q. Is ghost hunting related to some religion or faith?<br/>
<br/><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
A. No. Some groups are formed by members of one faith, church, temple,
coven/circle or grove. However, ghost hunting -- in general -- isn't
related to any specific set of spiritual beliefs.&nbsp; <br/><br/>
Also, remember that TV shows &amp; movies -- and the public ghost tours and events that emulate them -- are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> the best resource for questions about spirituality.&nbsp; Simply: Don't look for spiritual answers in the entertainment field.<br/></div>

<br/>
Q. Is there really a &quot;witching hour&quot;?<br/>
<br/><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
A. Traditionally, the witching hour is midnight. There's also a
tradition that 3 a.m. is Satan's time.&nbsp; Are they accurate?&nbsp; Fiona
explains that neither of those have relevance to ghost hunting, and
talks about her favorite times for ghost hunting.<br/></div>
<br/>
Q. I was at a ghost tour (or a ghost hunt, or saw a movie about a
haunting, or a TV show, or a website that claims that ghosts travel
through Internet and phone connections).&nbsp; Now, I think a ghost is in my
home (or business, or car).&nbsp; Is that possible?<br/>
<br/><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
A. In this part of the podcast, Fiona explains that your home or office
may be haunted.&nbsp; However, it's not likely that the ghost followed you
home or arrived via your TV, phone or Internet connection.<br/><br/></div>Music: Zombie, by Devin Anderson<br/>Related link: <a href="http://">HollowHill.com</a><br/>

            <description><![CDATA[Fiona Broome talks about ghost hunting during the winter. These are some of her suggestions:<br/><br/>If it's too cold outside for outdoor ghost hunts, investigate indoors.&nbsp; Check haunted theatres, hotels, restaurants, museums and haunted houses.<br/><br/>Review last year's investigations.&nbsp; Re-read your notes, review your photos and EVPs, and see which sites should be revisited for more research.<br/><br/>Plan the upcoming year.&nbsp; Include a ghost hunt at one location you've been planning to visit, but haven't investigated yet.&nbsp; If it's a popular location, make your travel reservations now.<br/><br/>Research other locations using new and popular ghost-related books.&nbsp; Also skim 19th century histories of your vicinity, looking for references to ghost stories, haunted places and other paranormal phenomena.<br/><br/>Practice with your ghost hunting tools.&nbsp; The better you understand them, and the easier it is for you to use them in the dark, the more you'll be able to observe during future ghost investigations.<br/><br/>Schedule ghost hunts starting the week before April 30th.&nbsp; In many cultures, that's a night when -- like Halloween -- the ghosts walk among us.&nbsp; Discover Walpurgisnacht (or Walpurgis Night) traditions and make the most of them on this second eerie and magical night for spirits.<br/><br/>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.hollowhill.com/" title="Hollow Hill, ghosts and haunted places">HollowHill.com, the ghost hunting website</a>.<br/>]]></description>

These are some of her suggestions:If it's too cold outside for outdoor ghost hunts, investigate indoors.&nbsp; Check haunted theatres, hotels, restaurants, museums and haunted houses.Review last year's investigations.&nbsp; Re-read your notes, review your photos and EVPs, and see which sites should be revisited for more research.Plan the upcoming year.&nbsp; Include a ghost hunt at one location you've been planning to visit, but haven't investigated yet.&nbsp; If it's a popular location, make your travel reservations now.Research other locations using new and popular ghost-related books.&nbsp; Also skim 19th century histories of your vicinity, looking for references to ghost stories, haunted places and other paranormal phenomena.Practice with your ghost hunting tools.&nbsp; The better you understand them, and the easier it is for you to use them in the dark, the more you'll be able to observe during future ghost investigations.Schedule ghost hunts starting the week before April 30th.&nbsp; In many cultures, that's a night when -- like Halloween -- the ghosts walk among us.&nbsp; Discover Walpurgisnacht (or Walpurgis Night) traditions and make the most of them on this second eerie and magical night for spirits.For more information, visit HollowHill.com, the ghost hunting website.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <link><![CDATA[http://hollowhillpodcasts.com/ghost_hunting_tools]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Psychic ghost hunter Fiona Broome discusses ghost hunting tools.<br/><br/>Using the K-II meter as an example, she comments on the benefits and liabilities of highly sensitive, high-tech ghost hunting equipment.<br/><br/>The more sensitive the equipment, the more it will detect normal -- but often unnoticed -- phenomena, in addition to the paranormal.&nbsp; For this reason, researchers must do far more extensive baseline studies before relying on sensitive equipment to document ghosts.<br/><br/>The more complex the ghost hunting equipment, the more it can hold the attention of the researcher.&nbsp; This is a liability as well.&nbsp; <br/><br/>Fiona suggests that EMF surges, orbs, cold spots, etc. aren't the ghosts; they could be <span style="font-style: italic;">signs</span> of ghosts, or an indication that the door between the worlds has just opened.&nbsp; If you're busy watching the flashing lights on the meter, you might miss seeing an actual apparition or other spectacular paranormal display.<br/><br/>Fiona also notes that the <span style="font-style: italic;">absence</span> of EMF could be as important as EMF spikes in haunted settings.<br/><br/>Fiona recommends relying primarily on your five (or six) senses.&nbsp; Ghost hunting tools can support and document paranormal experiences, but they shouldn't be the only way we connect with the ghosts around us.<br/><br/>Links<br/><br/>Grant Wilson (as Grant-o-Lantern): <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=20763368&blogID=443221314">What We Know About the K-II Meter</a><br/><br/><a href="http://hollowhill.com/ghost-hunting-tools/">Ghost Hunting Tools</a>, an article by Fiona Broome<br/><br/><a href="http://hollowhill.com/basic-tools-every-ghost-hunter-must-have/">Basic tools every ghost hunter must have</a>, by Fiona Broome<br/>]]></description>

Fiona will talk about investigating another wonderful haunted house, Houmas House in Louisiana.<br/><br/>Links:<br/>Margaret Byl, <a href="http://www.amateurspiritseekers.com/">Amateur Spirit Seekers</a><br/><a href="http://www.myrtlesplantation.com/">The Myrtles Plantation</a><br/>Wikipedia's entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtles_Plantation">Myrtles Plantation</a> (mentions Wm.
