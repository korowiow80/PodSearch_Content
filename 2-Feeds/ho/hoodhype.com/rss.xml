	<description>What we thought the Trayvon Martin case would be a single topic we&#39;d carry through the show and it ended up taking it completely over.  The episode was full of heated debate and overrode any of the other segments, so we&#39;re releasing this as a &quot;special episode&quot; since this has never happened on the show before, as we&#39;re sure you&#39;ll hear.  We were all in rare form and the episode was not your typical installment of the show. Everyone was extremely emotional and passionate about the topic so things go crazy at times.  We&#39;re still recovering.</description>

<title>Episode #135</title>
<description>Inspired by our trip to South By South West this year (catch us down there March 17-20)  we loaded up this episode with music features by artists who will be performing at the festival down in Austin, Texas.  We also got a few minutes to speak with hip-hop coordinator of SXSW and owner of AustinSurreal.com, Matt Sonzala.  We also had Strong Arm Steadys Arms and Hammers on the the lid for blend it or bump it and we mixed up some real delicious #TigerBlood for the stash box.  Hit the notes for the recipe!</description>

<description>We kicked things off with the Hip Hop Fight Club's East Coast bracket, and youll  be surprised to find out who came out on top. We also got into the holiday spirit and discussed what if Santa was black, which led us into another racial conversation centered around the white bank robber who dressed up as a black dude while putting in his work. We put Cliffords latest release No Mercy on the chopping block for this episode's Blend It or Bump It, sampled a domestic brew for the Stash Box, and chopped it up on a bunch of other topics to wrap up our last show for 2010. </description>

<description>Five years weve been doing this.  A simple thank you would never be enough for your support and listening to our show.  To kick off our fifth year episode we gave away a copy of NBA2k11 live on the show, ran through the stash box and previewed Statik Selektah and Termanologys album 1982 for Blend It or Bump It.  Half way through Statik called in randomly to talk about the album and what hes been working on.  That, a ton of phenomenal music (as always) and a lot more.</description>

<itunes:summary>Aside from our long awaited interview with the infamous independent and more recently recently Def Jam signee Big K.R.I.T., we had a real good time this episode seeing Phro off for his wedding (Phro will be back in a couple episodes, but until then, look out for some special guests to fill the seat!).  This episode we spoke on Tila Tequila and Method Man vs. The Juggalos, 50 prank calling Shyne, Detox not living up to the hype, Jeezy vs. Officer Ricky and much more.

<description>Sticking to the promise that we are stepping it up around here, here’s the first of many mini-episodes to come.  We do the “big show” every couple weeks, but because we’re getting so much music these we’re gonna step it up and put out these solo mini-shows to give you guys even more music in the off weeks.  If you have ideas or suggestions on what you’d like to see us do in the future for these mini-shows hit us up anytime!  This week I talked a little more than I expected, so expect less talk and more music for future mini-episodes.</description>

<title>Episode #113</title>
<description>We had alot of fun with this one as we jumped in on music  Scarface vs VH-1, Dame Dash getting Roc back and more.  Everything was going great for yet another great episode of the HoodHype show, but when Scarface called in out of the blue to comment on the VH-1 situation, the show did an instant 360.  We talked to Face for damn near a half hour about everything from the VH-1 debacle, to Oprah, to paying for pum (lol).   Later in the show, we got to the Stash Box to taste a new brew, we talked about guilty music pleasures and brought back the almighty, Blend it or Bump It segment, which is always a good time.  If you have a CD youd like featured on the segment, you can mail it to the address on our Contact Us page, whether its mainstream or not! </description>

Although the liquor got us there quicker than we anticipated, all was good.  Although we didnt get to the Stash Box this week, we had Playboy Tre who also threw B.o.B. aka Bobby Ray on the phone for a quick second.  Good show and some GREAT music.</description>

<description>For those of you who frequent the site, you may have caught on to the April Fools prank we pulled this April 1st.  For those who dont, earlier last week we changed the design of the site, dropped a press release, changed the name of the show to Double-Hits, dropped all nasty language, drinking alcohol and spun strictly mainstream for the first 10 minutes of the show.   Some listeners caught it, some listeners left with their hands in the air, some listeners totally stuck around rode it out (shouts to you guys)!  It was a great time and we had a great show and made sure to make it up to everyone with tons of great music and interviews with Atlantas Stat Quo, and Detroits Danny Brown.  Check it out!</description>

<title>Episode #68</title>
<description>Episode 68 was all about having fun and touching on the topic of the age gap in hip-hop.  Early in the show we spoke with the winner of Episode 67 Najee and discussed the topic at hand as well as his album “Westside Story”.  We also spoke on the Ice-T vs Souljah boy debate (the live show was 2 weeks ago).  Later in the show we caught up with Fresh, genius writer supreme and owner of the entertainment news blog, Crunktastical.net and talked about her site, and laughed for about a half hour straight.  Hopefully we didnt harrass her too bad and she will come back for the next episode.  Through the rest of the show we took some calls, spoke on SOHH getting hacked to death, more Kwame Kilpatrick hip-hop mayor talk, discussion of the double standard N.E.R.D. music and more!</description>

<title>Episode #67</title>
<description>This episode was recorded about 3 weeks ago as we took our annual summer break.  But were back!  This episode was loaded with great music and we had alot of fun, although we had to work through a major technical failure and a nasty ass heat wave when we recorded this episode.  Make sure you check out the HoodHype blog and peep the Shows category to get the second half of this episode which included the white boy water taste test as well as another special interview with Bishop Lamont.</description>

<title>Episode #65</title>
<description>Episode 65 was a crazy one.  The show itself ended up being 3 hours, but luckily after some editing we managed to get it down to a more manageable hour and a half so we arent continually murdering your iPods space.  So you may notice some continuity shit going on in the show.  We kicked the show off immediately with a track and a FRESH interview with Killer Mike, talking about everything from conscious rap (which he said is rather whack) to Alexis Tyler on his show Grind Time Sports Show (BANG! BANG! BANG!).    We spoke on marketing beef vs the legitimate rap beef.  We then spoke with the winners of Episode 63 Rideout and Terry Cole for their song Ways to lose Detroit.  COP THEIR ALBUM!! Overall we had a great time, and we really wish we could post the last segment of the LIVE show but we figured maybe we would post it some other time so we could FINALLY get this one out to yall.   Enjoy and we look forward to your feedback.  Please post here, email or call us with your comments for the next show! </description>

<title>Episode #64</title>
<description>A three hour show.  It was three hours long.   We kicked off the show with an interview with last episodes vote winner, Lungz for his track "Am I Black Enough For You". which got things off to good start.  Truth be told we didnt expect to run this long, but once NY Oil got on the phone it was all over.  The conversation kept getting deeper and deeper as JMack got quieter and quieter (LOL @ JMacks silence).  Major, JMack and Phro (but mostly Major) sat down and had a great discussion with NY Oil from everything from the whole Nas issue, to the Sean Bell case.  Episode 64 was an episode loaded with Black Pride.  As always, there were six crazy underground hip-hop and reggae joints and much more.  Also, our apologies for the mild vocal distortion...human error our end.  Oh, and make sure you login to our blog at http://www.hoodhype.com/blog to hear an entire hour of bonus audio that wasnt included in this episode!</description>

<title>Episode #63</title>
<description>Its been almost a month since the entire HH crew got together for an episode so we were ampd up and ready to go. We got things started by congratulating JMack on his newest child, and spoke about every fathers worries when their child is first born. From there we got into some hip-hop talk with Nonseq from the production team Tin Men whose track "Video Chick" received the most votes from Episode #61. Nonseq filled us in on the hip-hop scene in North Carolina, and how their production team goes about deciding what MCs they want to work with. Next, Phro gave us the run down on his vacation to Tampa, FL and their  24/7 2-for-1 drink specials. After the break we got into some conversation about Busta Rhymes recent Hot 97 interview, which lead us into a conversation about Aftermath Records and their rosters bulked up appearance. From there we discussed why DJs get so much love, re-lived some drunk moments, gave our thoughts on Stacy Dashs KING Magazine cover, and a lot more. As always, the music featured in Episode #63 is pure flames. We featured 5 new joints, which are be up for voting, and a couple of HH throwback tracks.</description>

<title>Episode #60</title>
<description>As you can tell from the title, this was our first-ever live show. We streamed our show live via ustream.tv and had a chance to get some real-time interaction with our audience via the chat. The whole experience was tight and we hope to do more shows in a live format in the future. The episode got off to a good start as we caught up with Capital Z, the winner from Episode #58, to talk about his track "Family Ties", and his loyal fan base (he set a HoodHype record for most votes). After that, we had a chance to speak with Brooklyns own Joell Ortiz. Right from the jump we took the opportunity to squash any misinformation surrounding our previous interview with Bishop Lamont. With that aside, we got into what projects Joell will be dropping next, what hes looking for in his next label situation, working with Rik Cordero, his hoop game and more. After hollerin at Joell, we got to speak with another one of Brooklyns elite, Buckshot from the Duck Down camp. Buck gave us the scoop on The Formula, his 2nd project with 9th Wonder, which will be dropping in April. He also talked about Duck Downs recent expansion with the new signings of Kidz In The Hall, and Special Teamz. Finally, we called up Phro who wasnt able to be in the studio on this night, and shot the shit with him for a couple minutes. All interviews aside, Episode #60 is loaded with fire music, so click to listen, or download it and listen on the go! (sorry the audio quality was a little low on our end....live and learn)</description>

<title>Episode #58</title>
<description>With three hours of equipment problems, and a couple interviews falling through Episode #58 got off to a rough start, but we managed to hold it down and put together a fire show. We got things started by talking to J. Rose of Bacu Entertainment, whose track "Chillax" earned the most votes from Episode #56. Next, we took a look back at the year that was 2007. We touched on everything from the best and worst albums of year, to which MCs made a come up in 2007 and which MCs took a loss for the year. After reflecting on 07, we began to look forward to 2008 and whats on the horizon for hip-hop. Finally, we textd Bishop Lamont and got him on the phone for an impromptu interview, and it was definitely worth it. Bishop took some time to step out of a Detox recording session to discuss his most recent street album The Pope Mobile, and his progress on his upcoming LP. He also discussed Joell Ortizs Aftermath situation with us, and youll be surprised and disappointed by what he revealed. All in all this show is thorough, and is packed with more heat from the most talented indie artists out there. Download and enjoy!</description>

<title>Episode #57</title>
<description>This episode touched on alot of different things including “balance” between concious rap on the show versus gangsta rap.  The show kicked off to a good start with an interview with episode 55s winner Donny Goines for his song “Never Let My Talent Die” and Major and JMack talked with Donny about his career, his relationship with Disco D as well as upcoming projects and issues in hip-hop.  JMack and Major also got into it about “balancing out the shows” with their music selections from the review panel picks. They argued about the “nature” of the lineup for this show JMack had put together versus previous episodes and what to expect for future episodes of the HoodHype show as far as the music lineups are concerned.  Later in the show, Major, JMack and Phro discussed their worst drinking adventures and the lessons they learned from them.  Youll just have to listen because there was a ton more they touched on including Remy Ma vs. Lil Kim, Phros white people moment and racial and/or outdated slurs.  A damn well rounded episode for yall musically so definitely make sure you subscribe through iTunes and download this to your iPod or download the show and listen on your computer or burned to cd!</description>

<title>Episode #53</title>
<description>JMack, Phro, and I were back at it this week, and this show is SERIOUS!  To get things started we discussed our nomination for a VH-1 Hip-Hop Honors award. Later in the show we got Jay Casteel (CEO of Ballerstatus.com) on the phone to get his take on being nominated in the Best Hip-Hop Lifestyle Site category. We talked about NYCs latest beef involving Saigon and Prodigy/Mobb Deep. We also covered Kanyes first-week sales victory over 50 Cent, and we brought in Milk Dee of Audio Two to get his take on the entire Kanye vs. 50 marketing campaign. Milk also spoke at length about how many times Audio Twos classic record "Top Billing" has been sampled, his behind-the-scenes success in the music game as a producer, and his video parody of 50 Cents "I Get Money". We also continued our commentary on the Jena 6 situation (this is before we were aware of Bells release), and took a look at Jesse Jacksons comments about Barack Obamas involvement with the case. Episode #53 is jam packed with 6 fire tracks, so check it out.</description>

The trailer for American Gangster which stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, also made its way into our conversation. We caught up with the winners from Episodes 45 and 46, Cashmere aka Black Ross and K-Beta to see what projects theyre working on. We also had a little fun going through a list of hit it or skip it scenarios involving various female celebrities; you wont believe some of the answers.

<title>Episode #47</title>
<description>Sorry for the delay on getting this show out, but its finally here. JMack, Phro and myself got together before the Floyd Mayweather vs. Oscar De La Hoya mega-fight to put down another wild show. The Patron was flowing, and the mouths were running. We were joined in the studio by Mayday and SINcere of Mid Mobb Section. As usual we shot the shit about hip-hop, and spoke on the hip-hop version of myspace, GoldMic.com. We hit up Khaos from Yung Onyx, to get his prediction on who would win the fight.

<itunes:summary>Sorry for the delay on getting this show out, but its finally here. JMack, Phro and myself got together before the Floyd Mayweather vs. Oscar De La Hoya mega-fight to put down another wild show. The Patron was flowing, and the mouths were running. We were joined in the studio by Mayday and SINcere of Mid Mobb Section. As usual we shot the shit about hip-hop, and spoke on the hip-hop version of myspace, GoldMic.com. We hit up Khaos from Yung Onyx, to get his prediction on who would win the fight. As you all know, the Pretty Boy went on to defeat Oscar by split-decision, so look for us to catch up with Arben from boxingtribune.com in the next episode so we can rub it in a little.</itunes:summary>

<title>Episode #46</title>
<description>JMack and I were at it again, and this episode was "out of control"! This week we were joined in the studio by a special guest host, my homie Snoop-E from Lansings own Mid Mobb Section.  We took another look at the medias attack on hip-hop, but instead of us rehashing our opinions we got a chance to holla at Duck Down Records Sean Price and get his take on the situation. After chopping it up with P, we switched gears to the boxing world and the upcoming mega-fight between Floyd Mayweather and Oscar De La Hoya. We got some top notch analysis on how De La Hoya may be able to pull off the upset from boxingtribune.coms Arben Paloka, while Snoop-E threw out some knowledge on why Pretty Boy Floyd should come out on top. As if that wasnt enough, we got a chance to catch up with Ques who won the vote for Episode 44. And for the icing on the cake we caught up with Hoodhype.com blog writer Tarah and had a good ol fashioned Democrat vs. Republican debate.  This episode is the longest show weve ever recorded, but its full of real talk and fire music, 7 songs to be exact, so check it out!</description>

	<title>Episode #42</title>
	<description>After all the hate and venom expressed in Episode 41, JMack, Phro and myself decided to kick back and express a little racial U.N.I.T.Y this episode. Listen in as we dig into JMacks mind a little bit, to find out how he first became a hip-hop fan, and we also discuss his dislike for certain white folks. The beef between Timbaland and Scott Storch was brought up, as well as CNNs negative story on the hip-hop industry. We took the time to catch up with The Academy, winners of Episode 40, and talk to them about their future projects. Of course the music in Episode 42 is on point as usual featuring tracks from Loose Cannons from Pottsville, PA, Hollywood Kill out of Hollywood, CA, Yung Onyx and Fredro Star coming from Queens, NY Prince Genisiz and Peter Lake from Chicago, IL</description>
