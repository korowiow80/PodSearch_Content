			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BodiesBeautiful.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2573" title="BodiesBeautiful" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BodiesBeautiful.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>The next time you rummage through your life in search of things to feel good about, I urge you start with your mirror.</p>
<p><span id="more-2569"></span></p>
<p>My friend Ron has the tiniest dimple. It’s just down and off to the right of her smile. Her smile is radiant, like flicking on the brights at night. She’s got full wide lips and big strong teeth that speak of vitamins and a solid constitution; her gap speaks of a solid constitution. Ron’s got a space between her two front teeth that I would have happily traded my lunch money a thousand times over for. It’s stunning. It’s famous. When they say <em>Mind the gap</em>, they mean check out my friend’s smile. Were you aware of this?</p>
<p>Growing up, I used to floss a little harder between my two front teeth, trying in vain to create that magic sliver of space. Oh, how I longed to ignite my smile and distinguish myself as a toothy darling, just like my friend. But it wasn’t meant to be. In fact, my dentist told me my teeth are packed so tight, it’s a wonder any food wedges its way in between them.</p>
<p>Like Ron, several of my friends have amazing features that make me want to write poetry and burn candles: Jaime’s hazel eyes that sparkle when she laughs, Bailey’s caring hands and mothering hips like the goddess, Carmella’s breasts perky and timeless. Vel’s nose—and so is Hope’s—just this side of perfect. Then there’s Gloria, whose pillowy curves ooze bedroom everything, twenty-four seven. Movies must be made about them.</p>
<p>As for me, I’ve got my own body parts I love to pieces, too. In time, I’ve come to treasure them all. But, it hasn’t always been so. For many of us, the journey to acceptance of our bodies and our selves can be an uphill, winding passage of rutted roads that switchback, drop off, and dead end with way too much frequency along the way.</p>
<p>I have a high forehead and, from my earliest memories, I’d been told that big features like mine were to be covered and minimized. No one could tell me why, and that wasn’t the point. The point was to not advertise how big my face was/is by showing it. Well, that’s not easy to do when: a.) my hair doesn’t fall naturally into my face and b.) even if it did, there would still be problems like wind and rain—weather, nature’s non-compliance—which c.) conspire to blow my lid off, thusly exposing the big-faced lie.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Back in March I had some professional pictures taken. I asked my friend Belle for her feedback, so we agreed to meet in a café to go over the images. Belle said very nice things while I told her about those early attempts to wrangle my bangs and minimize my features through equally ridiculous means. She laughed at the spectacle of me trying to keep hair in my face against the wind and other odds; I laughed too, happy to be so exposed.</p>
<p>Belle and I carried on for the next two hours, trading stories of the impressive feats we’d achieved in service to being passably pretty and acceptably minimized. Belle’s attempts to deflate her thighs with girdles, the right kind of stripes and diets made me think she’d been hoodwinked by beauty myths, too. It was good to laugh out loud, uninhibited in a crowded place like that. It was only right, given the time we suffered alone, quiet and diminished in the past. We teared up cackling, and it was grand.</p>
<p>How many collective days and hours do you reckon we&#8217;ve spent feeling less than good about our bodies because someone told us we should? No matter the shape or size, condition, color, or gender, our bodies are a wondrous blend of mystery and mechanics that run largely on what we feed them—the food we eat, the things we think, the company we keep. Our bodies are singular masterpieces, far more fetching than any painting gathering dust in some museum&#8217;s box. Our bodies are dynamic works of art that will never come this way again, so why not celebrate and bless them now? There’s no better time to embody this amazing gift, which is yours alone, no matter what.</p>
<p>When you take a second to contemplate the miracle of myriad synapses, history, and the infinite clicking and whirring somewhere deep within us that allow us to read love letters, to hear birds chirping, to smell cake baking, to feel sun on our shoulders, it’s staggering. When you consider we breathe the same air of our ancestors—Rumi, Toussaint, Mary, Buddha, all the great grands and more—when you realize we’re a common collection of dust, water, and minerals, that our earthly rhythms are divinely synchronized by the sun and moon, that we truly <em>are</em> heavenly bodies—well, how can that be anything but beautiful?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hanging a painting the other day when it occurred to me that I am a tool. Perhaps you’ve had your suspicions about this, but I can assure you it’s not for the reasons you think.<br />
<span id="more-2531"></span></p>
<p>“If I Had a Hammer” is a folk song I’ve always associated with Joan Baez. I know lots of other people sing it and other folks wrote it, but to me it&#8217;s always only been Joan.</p>
<p>The song is about peace and harmony, but you might not pick that up If you studied the lyrics like I did. It talks a lot about hammering  justice and freedom and love between brothers and sisters all over the land. And if that wasn’t enough, she&#8217;s hammering out danger and warnings <em>all</em> day long, too. Pretty ambitious if you ask me. Too ambitious, to tell you the truth.</p>
<p>As I drove the nails into the wall, I imagined the reactions I’d get from my neighbors—and the police—when I explained why I chose 3am to do my home improvement projects. <em>You don’t understand, </em>I’d say, my tools at the ready, <em>I’m hammering for justice… all over this apartment. </em></p>
<p>I kept thinking of Joan and how fiercely committed she’d been in her fight for human rights and peace. I thought about all the great things she was going to do with her hammer where all I did that day was hang a crooked picture. <em>Look at her</em>, I said. <em>She’s been hammering away for decades—warnings, love, freedom, justice, danger, everything. And what have I done?</em> I wondered. I looked at the tool in my hand and considered the power I&#8217;d possibly been squandering. Just how much good could wield in the world if only I put my mind and metaphorical hammer to work? I felt a surge of respect for Joan’s fervor and for that of everyone who ever worked for worthy causes like she did.</p>
<p>I know this woman named Janet. Janet is a natural born healer. She’s the type of person people share their private feelings with; they trust her with their stories and she listens deeply to every one—but not without feeling ambivalent about it sometimes. <em>Kriste, </em>she said, strangers <em>seek me out and they tell me things. Isn’t that the weirdest thing? </em>Janet paused as though waiting for a scripted reply. I could tell that mine wasn’t what she expected.</p>
<p><em>No, </em>I said. <em>I don’t think it’s weird at all. </em>I was still turning over the hammers of peace thing in my head, but the exchange with Janet helped me see it all differently. For one thing, I could easily see why people drew to her: she was extremely compassionate, she was patient by nature, and she was kind. Janet also happened to be a nurse.</p>
<p>Whether people knew it consciously or not, they felt safe around her, and that is a healing by pretty much any standard. I suggested that Janet was giving a gift to those people just by letting them share their stories with her. Don’t get me wrong, Janet’s no martyr; she doesn’t go looking for people to save. And she knows what it means to have healthy boundaries. As she explained it to me, Janet considers it a privilege to be of service in that way. She takes pleasure knowing that—by being herself and doing what comes naturally to her—she’s made a positive impact in the lives of others.</p>
<p>I recognized lots of similar moments in my own life when people showed up in similar ways for me: the copy shop attendant who read the stress on my face, wished me a great day, and didn’t charge me a dime, the dancer with the zebra jumpsuit and free hugs in the public square, neighbors bearing cookies, the smiling cashier who remembered my name, to name but a few. All of them made a choice to let themselves be used in little ways by something greater than they were in the moment. A great thinker once said, <em>Miracles come in moments. Be ready and willing</em>. Those people I mentioned were willing, just as Janet was—and Joan with her hammer and rigorous work ethic.</p>
<p>What moments come to mind where people have shown up like this for you? Better yet, in what ways have you let yourself be this kind of tool?</p>
<p>I believe the choices we make at any given moment can serve as a response to our higher guidance, whether it’s in the affirmative or not. Like Dylan said, <em>You gotta serve </em>somebody<em>.</em> When I look at my life in this way, as a series of choices and opportunities to be of service or not, it requires me to place an awareness on everything I do. It makes me deeply responsible for my actions, or lack thereof, and it becomes a spiritual practice of mindfulness in the moment. Suddenly, every blow of my hammer takes on new meaning.</p>
<p>I’m not the best at wielding real life hammers, but I tend to stick with it until the work is done. But the metaphorical hammer stuff, this letting myself be used in service to others, well, that’s a different kind of DIY and it often gets <em>messy</em>. I might not stay up late hammering out justice and freedom and warnings all over the place, but I’m doing my best to lean into higher hands when I can; I&#8217;m <em>willing</em> to be the tool. And, for now, that’s plenty good enough for me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sandals-on-grass.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2499" title="sandals on grass" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sandals-on-grass-1024x612.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="330" /></a><br />
Picture this: Two parents, two kids, and a dog, all happy at the beach. Both kids and one parent play in the water, splashing back and forth as crystal blue waves swell and break against them. The other parent and the dog remain on land, chilling in the sun. Suddenly the dog begins to bark, rushing toward the water. And then…</p>
<p><span id="more-2492"></span>I ran this scenario by ten different people and asked each one what happened next. Without fail, every one of them  offered up a tragic finale. The conclusions ranged from mildly disturbing to truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The thing about my informal experiment was even though the reactions I got didn’t exactly shock me, the fact that I <em>wasn’t</em> shocked bothered me and caused me to investigate.</p>
<p>Disappointments and pain will do drive-bys on us a lot in life, and no one is immune. On top of that, sometimes we’ll be subjected to people who seem to specialize in causing trouble, pushing buttons, and general crazymaking. Perhaps you know, love, work with or for someone like this? If so, may The Force be with you.</p>
<p>Have you ever been caught off guard by love or joy that caused euphoria so complete it made you fear a string of bad luck wasn’t far behind? Do you ever catch yourself saying things like this when you’re really happy: <em>I don’t want to push my luck? </em>or <em>I’d better quit while I’m ahead?</em> This is a great indicator that reveals our tolerance for happiness. And the fact that those ten responses were unanimous is deep.</p>
<p>Imagine going to an amusement park wearing full riot gear and crash padding just to ensure your safety. And let’s say you purchase a hefty insurance policy on the off chance that the fun gets dangerous. How much enjoyment can you really have like that? We know there are no guarantees beyond the obvious—that we will get hurt, we’ll make mistakes, and come up short sometimes—and no amount of padding, insurance, or precaution can protect us from risking our hearts for goodness&#8217; sake.</p>
<p>To be sure, embracing happiness, love, and joy won’t make us immune to the pain of disappointment; they go one better by increasing our capacity to experience the goodness that these emotions can bring to our lives. And even if you’re still reeling from the latest hit to your heart, what good is it doing you to expect the worst?</p>
<p>The other day I called my friend Lena and shared with her how excited I was about a creative project I&#8217;d been working on. I told her how the research I’d been doing was finally starting to come together. I told her how eager I’d been to finish what I started on a whim months ago. I admitted it felt great to imagine the work I was doing might help other people in some way. By the time we hung up, she was as psyched as I was and she let me know it.</p>
<p>Basking in the glow of our shared excitement, I hung up the phone feeling happy about realizing the potential of all of my hard work. Within seconds, though, my thoughts of awesome slipped behind a storm cloud that washed out every great feeling I had just moments before. I stared at the phone, still warm in its cradle, and wondered whether anybody would really be interested in my work at all. <em>Lena is my friend</em>, I said, immediately dialing down our kind words of great expectation. <em>She loves me and she supports me in whatever I’m working on. That’s what friends do, </em>I told myself.</p>
<p>It took all of ten seconds for my excitement to float, take on water, circle the drain, and disappear. Both feelings were real, but they came so quickly, the contrast literally made my head spin as I watched my emotions play out. That’s the funny thing about experiencing joy and happiness: there’s no way to feel fear at the same time. They may vie for center stage, but it’s up to us to choose which one wins out.</p>
<p>We’ve been conditioned to expect the worst, to fear, to anticipate trouble, to ensure <em>and</em> insure against accidents, to protect what’s <em>ours</em>. And providing it keeps us out of harm’s way, then some types of caution are necessary. Like that family at the beach: most of us were inclined to go right to what could go horribly wrong, right? But when it comes to happiness and joy, elation and love—all the ‘good’ stuff—we’ve got far less training in that area. That’s why we have to work harder at expecting amazing things to happen; we must train our sights on recognizing our good. We must attune to its frequency and listen. And set another place at the table when it comes knocking.</p>
<p>Remember when I said happiness is a habit? So is joy. We’ve been hurt, all of us, and we will be hurt again. But what good is it to dig your heels in, drawing lines in the sand while holding vigil against the inevitable pain of living? Why fend off happiness while you wait for yet another shoe to drop? Why not go barefoot into joy?</p>

		<itunes:summary>Picture this: Two parents, two kids, and a dog, all happy at the beach. Both kids and one parent play in the water, splashing back and forth as crystal blue waves swell and break against them. The other parent and the dog remain on land, chilling in the sun. Suddenly the dog begins to bark, rushing toward the water. And then…

I ran this scenario by ten different people and asked each one what happened next. Without fail, every one of them  offered up a tragic finale. The conclusions ranged from mildly disturbing to truly heartbreaking.

The thing about my informal experiment was even though the reactions I got didn’t exactly shock me, the fact that I wasn’t shocked bothered me and caused me to investigate.

Disappointments and pain will do drive-bys on us a lot in life, and no one is immune. On top of that, sometimes we’ll be subjected to people who seem to specialize in causing trouble, pushing buttons, and general crazymaking. Perhaps you know, love, work with or for someone like this? If so, may The Force be with you.

Have you ever been caught off guard by love or joy that caused euphoria so complete it made you fear a string of bad luck wasn’t far behind? Do you ever catch yourself saying things like this when you’re really happy: I don’t want to push my luck? or I’d better quit while I’m ahead? This is a great indicator that reveals our tolerance for happiness. And the fact that those ten responses were unanimous is deep.

Imagine going to an amusement park wearing full riot gear and crash padding just to ensure your safety. And let’s say you purchase a hefty insurance policy on the off chance that the fun gets dangerous. How much enjoyment can you really have like that? We know there are no guarantees beyond the obvious—that we will get hurt, we’ll make mistakes, and come up short sometimes—and no amount of padding, insurance, or precaution can protect us from risking our hearts for goodness' sake.

To be sure, embracing happiness, love, and joy won’t make us immune to the pain of disappointment; they go one better by increasing our capacity to experience the goodness that these emotions can bring to our lives. And even if you’re still reeling from the latest hit to your heart, what good is it doing you to expect the worst?

The other day I called my friend Lena and shared with her how excited I was about a creative project I'd been working on. I told her how the research I’d been doing was finally starting to come together. I told her how eager I’d been to finish what I started on a whim months ago. I admitted it felt great to imagine the work I was doing might help other people in some way. By the time we hung up, she was as psyched as I was and she let me know it.

Basking in the glow of our shared excitement, I hung up the phone feeling happy about realizing the potential of all of my hard work. Within seconds, though, my thoughts of awesome slipped behind a storm cloud that washed out every great feeling I had just moments before. I stared at the phone, still warm in its cradle, and wondered whether anybody would really be interested in my work at all. Lena is my friend, I said, immediately dialing down our kind words of great expectation. She loves me and she supports me in whatever I’m working on. That’s what friends do, I told myself.

It took all of ten seconds for my excitement to float, take on water, circle the drain, and disappear. Both feelings were real, but they came so quickly, the contrast literally made my head spin as I watched my emotions play out. That’s the funny thing about experiencing joy and happiness: there’s no way to feel fear at the same time. They may vie for center stage, but it’s up to us to choose which one wins out.

We’ve been conditioned to expect the worst, to fear, to anticipate trouble, to ensure and insure against accidents, to protect what’s ours. And providing it keeps us out of harm’s way, then some types of caution are necessary.</itunes:summary>

<p>You know that approach to seeing life as a glass that’s half full, half empty or both? What does it mean when there&#8217;s nothing in the glass?</p>
<p><span id="more-2471"></span>There’s a lot to be said for <em>nothing</em>. The experience of emptiness, I mean. After all, it’s the empty glass that’s ready to be filled. The empty glass is receptive; it’s expectant. How I love the metaphor of being open.</p>
<p>Then there’s the <em>other</em> emptiness. What I don’t like about it is that it shows up in unexpected places, in ways we can’t control. It would be different if I could schedule private time to feel awkward, insecure and disconnected, but it just so happens that before I can get around to planning for it, I’ve already put my foot in it for pretty much everyone to see. And that doesn’t do much for making me feel connected. Maybe you’re familiar with this experience?</p>
<p>Emptiness likes to make its appearance when we feel alone or isolated. It can show up in a crowded room and entice us to judge, compare, withdraw and count up the differences between us and them. Emptiness scrapes us dry from the inside out, and it can expand like a void in space when it really revs up. To make much ado about nothing, emptiness drains away our hope and optimism, leaving us parched, bleak and despairing.</p>
<p>The good news is emptiness isn’t all bad. In fact, it’s not bad at all if we give it a chance to soften and change us.</p>
<p>It was two days ago. I’d pulled an all-nighter on a work project the day before. I was exhausted, down for the count. My task had overwhelmed me and put me in a sleeper hold; I was just about beat and I knew it. In the weeks prior, I’d paced the carpet down to a nub and bit my nails back to the quick. I pulled out every last lick of hair and chanted the great lamentations. I hurled myself to the floor in fits of consternation. Then, against every pitiful instinct in me, I met my friend LA for an afternoon run. I pulled into the dusty lot, relieved to see the smile on her face. Preparing to launch into the details of my despair, I began with,<em> I’m running on empty. I got nothing.</em> I swallowed hard.</p>
<p>LA let me talk on for ten minutes or more. As we stretched our limbs and our muscles warmed, I ran on about the rigors of creativity, the precious nerves it burns, and the isolation it often entails. I explained to her that this is what happens when we’ve got nothing left and we’re nowhere near the finish. <em>I’m really not sure how to move past this</em>, I said. <em>But I just know I have to</em>. She nodded as we jogged east. With the first mile behind us, I fell quiet and settled into the crunch of gravel underfoot.</p>
<p>We slowed heading south and then slowed some more before I noticed I wasn’t panting like I usually was by that point. LA winced, rubbed her knee and stopped. <em>I’m really sorry about this</em>, she said, <em>but I’m scared I might have an injury.</em></p>
<p>LA is a serious runner. The day before we met for our run, she’d completed a  twenty five mile training loop in preparation for an upcoming fifty mile race that’s going to be held at an altitude of more than fourteen thousand feet. Boulder rests at an altitude of barely six thousand feet.</p>
<p>As she stretched and massaged her leg, LA told me how hard it was to carry on in the rain and cold of the previous day and that she’d gotten so soaked, she had to double back home after thirteen miles to change into dry clothes and hit the road <em>again</em>. She told me how depleted she was after hitting a wall at the eighteenth mile and wondered how she’d go on. That’s when, <em>I shit you not</em>, she said, <em>a running mate appeared</em>. She’d literally run into a friendly jogger who also happened to be a coach from out of town and was looking for route suggestions. They wound up running together and she got the surprise support she needed in the moment.</p>
<p>For the next three miles we cycled in and out of running, all the while sharing our stories of fatigue and depletion. We related our experiences of isolation and the irony of sometimes despising what we loved to do most. We acknowledged the deliciousness of victory after a long fight and the daily challenge of closing gaps between excuses and the execution of hard work.</p>
<p>Do you know what it’s like to let yourself be emptied and not run from the sight of what’s left? It’s not an easy thing; that’s why I ask. Harder still is to bring that emptiness to another person and trust her enough—or maybe that’s trust yourself or life enough—to let her in on it. I don’t know which was more difficult for me: the uphill run or admitting how utterly gutted I’d been feeling before.</p>
<p>As we neared the parking lot my sense of connection had begun to return where, barely an hour before, I thought it was all I could do to tie my running shoes. Something unexpected happened that day. We each risked letting the other see what we look like in our most vulnerable places—and we reached the finish better than when we started. For me, it was a welcomed renewal of mind, body, and spirit. I showed up literally with nothing to lose and it was just what I needed to fill me up again.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Signs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2437" title="Signs" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Signs.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>About that lecture I was going to do at the metaphysical fair last month: I’m happy to report it went really well. It didn’t matter that I couldn’t get the projector to play my presentation, and nobody seemed to care that I&#8217;d left my good shoes in the car.</p>
<p><span id="more-2436"></span>Turns out, I was great on the fly and did just fine with what I had. For an hour I spoke and fielded questions about the energy of oneness and how we’re never truly alone in anything we do because we’re all connected.</p>
<p>After finishing my talk, I floated back to the hotel, high on the experience of having connected with new people who offered lots of positive feedback. I was happy to know that I’d been able to teach people about a things that meant a lot to me. I was passionate and engaging and it showed. I could hardly sleep because I was even more excited about the next two days that would be filled with readings and the chance to connect with even more new people. That next morning I was up with the sun, but little did I know what a rude awakening it would be.</p>
<p>I returned to the venue and took my place among a gallery of readers. There were rune casters, reiki masters, past life regressionists, divination specialists, energy healers, trance channels, psychics, mediums, animal whisperers, tarot readers, spirit drawing artists, aura photographers and … me.</p>
<p>For more than two hours I sat and watched as people filed through the room only to flock to all the places I wasn’t. I ran the range of emotion from detached to perplexed, upset and back again. When that got boring, I went inward and asked myself some hard questions, starting with, <em>“What the &#8230; ?”</em></p>
<p>The longer I sat, the worse I felt. But rather than give myself to a downward spiral, I went straight to the top: I called the event organizers and asked them to help. I’ve been sitting here, I said, my voice as thin as a playing card. No one’s stopped by yet. What’s going on? I tried desperately to beat my embarrassment back and be receptive to whatever they had to tell me. It’s hard enough asking for help sometimes, and it’s something else when you’re asking strangers. But, in public. In a strange town. At a psychic fair.</p>
<p>They listened as I vented and they shared with me what good things they’d heard about my work. They told me how welcomed I was and how committed they were to making sure my experience was a good one. They embraced me into their loving community and introduced me around. My tension eased. Then they looked at my space and at each other before saying I needed a sign. “People need to see who you are,” they said. “They need to know what you do.” Oh.</p>
<p>That night, I went back to the hotel, brainstormed a bit, and finally got it together. More to the point, it was the sign that helped me get it together.</p>
<p>I think everyone should have a sign.<a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/VERT-NOW2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2274" title="Good Energy Readings information poster." src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/VERT-NOW2-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>As I sat down to work, I quickly realized I’d only been identifying myself relative to everyone else with a generic, “I’m not one of them.” It was as if verbally distancing myself was going to set me apart in some kind of special way. It didn’t. Now I ask you, what kind of marketing strategy was that? In truth, it was my subversive way of saying, “Yeah I’m here, but it’s not what you think.” Uh, yes it is, folks. What I wasn’t saying was, “Keeping my distance keeps me safe.”</p>
<p>Part of the so-called safety in maintaining our distance and not participating—in any area of our lives—means we’re never expected to truly produce, and if we do, we’re free to be vague, should anyone try to pin us down on the fine points. Put another way, we never run the risk of risking anything if we don&#8217;t allow ourselves to be seen. The other safety in not defining ourselves <em>for</em> ourselves means we get to avoid all of the messiness that too much up-closeness requires. It means, we hope, that we can get out before things get too serious. In my case, I hadn’t realized my own internal conflicts until I sat down to make my sign and commit my intentions to print.</p>
<p>By the time I’d finished my work, I was surprised to find the oft contentious parts of me gravitating toward center for what felt like the first time. Gathered around the table, my inner critic had begun an exchange with the artist in me, refining my words, smoothing lines and placement to create something new and uniquely me; my religious observer had embraced my inner mystic, and together they celebrated the truth I’d been steadily approaching—the certainty of oneness and love; my college-educated coed and certified clairvoyant put their heads together in honor of their ongoing education; my giddy young girl and wisdom-seeking self reveled at the promise of a new adventure.</p>
<p>More than likely, you won’t be asked to make the kind of sign I did. I never expected I’d be creating one either. But, even if it’s a project you do on your own, and nobody ever sees it, it’s worth it to engage in the act of writing up your strengths and committing them to the page—any page. If you had to create your own mission statement, what would it be? What gifts do you mean to bring to the world? You may be surprised at the parts of you you’ll meet in the process. I sure was. Me and my selves, we came out from our corners to connect across the distance. It was a completion that put me at peace; it made me hopeful. What better sign is there than that?</p>

As I sat down to work, I quickly realized I’d only been identifying myself relative to everyone else with a generic, “I’m not one of them.” It was as if verbally distancing myself was going to set me apart in some kind of special way. It didn’t. Now I ask you, what kind of marketing strategy was that? In truth, it was my subversive way of saying, “Yeah I’m here, but it’s not what you think.” Uh, yes it is, folks. What I wasn’t saying was, “Keeping my distance keeps me safe.”

Part of the so-called safety in maintaining our distance and not participating—in any area of our lives—means we’re never expected to truly produce, and if we do, we’re free to be vague, should anyone try to pin us down on the fine points. Put another way, we never run the risk of risking anything if we don't allow ourselves to be seen. The other safety in not defining ourselves for ourselves means we get to avoid all of the messiness that too much up-closeness requires. It means, we hope, that we can get out before things get too serious. In my case, I hadn’t realized my own internal conflicts until I sat down to make my sign and commit my intentions to print.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Stars2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2413" title="Stars" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Stars2.jpg" alt="A collection of golden confetti stars in various sizes." width="540" height="404" /></a></p>
<p>Remember that time I said <em>&#8216;If I hear one more Chirpy Do Gooder tell me to </em>let my light shine<em>, I think I might break something?’</em> Well, my feelings still haven&#8217;t changed and I need to tell you why.</p>
<p><span id="more-2395"></span>When I first made that statement, it was in response to a woman who told me how tired she was from hearing New Agey types like me dole out directives like that without suggesting how to <em>keep on </em>shining. She already knew that <em>letting her light shine</em>—or daring to be her real self without asking anybody’s permission—sometimes meant letting her butt get kicked by life too. That probably explains why she wound up in my course in the first place; she wanted some support for those times it felt like all people wanted to do was put her lights out.</p>
<p>When a Chirpy Do-Gooding New Ager says, <em>&#8220;Let your light shine,&#8221;</em> here’s what it sounds like to me: <em>Permit the blissful radiance of The Divine to surge outward through your primordial essence to illumine the darkness of this manifest world like a spiritual lightning bug flickering thither and yon and alighting joyously upon your midnight rose of quivering despair.</em></p>
<p>Please, hold the phone whilst I barf.</p>
<p><strong>Here are my issues with Chirpy Do Gooders:<br />
1.)</strong> Chirpy Do Gooders speak in flowery tones most of the time, and real people—people who give themselves access to their full range of emotion—don’t limit themselves to just one spot on the dial. That’s because as humans, every now and again, we lose it. We cry ugly, we get messy, we goof and struggle. And if Chirpy Do Gooders do, they don’t let on. And I don’t like that.</p>
<p><strong>2.)</strong> Chirpy Do Gooders are so consumed with ‘healing’ and being chirpy that they’re useless. My aunt Cleo used to say religious zealots were so holy, high and mighty that they weren’t no earthly good. It’s hard to relate to them (see #1). How can we take people like that seriously. I mean, seriously?</p>
<p><strong>3.)</strong> Chirpy Do Gooders don’t give us the whole story. People who only hand me the rosy part of the picture leave out the thorns, which are as much a part of the image as the rest. It’s a disservice to omit the fact that answering the inward call to shine and be oneself in the world is a carefree affair. It’s not. It often comes as an inconvenience and at great cost—a cost we can’t grasp until we’re in the thick of it.</p>
<p>Remember that phrase coined by the late American mythologist and writer, Joseph Campbell? He’s the guy who said, “Follow you bliss” if you wanted to live on purpose. But, wouldn&#8217;t you know it, Chirpy Do Gooders swooped in and disfigured its meaning. Campbell later grumbled, ‘I should have said, follow your <em>blisters’</em> because it’s a huge mistake to overlook the sacrifice and hard work required.<strong></strong></p>
<p>We lost a lot of greats last year. Within the span of ten days, the world said goodbye to three luminaries who touched our lives in ways we may never fully comprehend. There was Wangari Maathai, whose fierce environmental and political activism earned her a Nobel Peace prize. There was Steve Jobs, whose innovative design and vision changed the way the world computes. There was Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, whose fearless pursuit of freedom and equality not only introduced Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to the world, but it also put the cause of civil rights at the forefront of American politics. Each of these pioneers let their light shine.</p>
<p>Despite the many odds against them—powerful opposition from the status quo, unthinkable political pressure, no proper offices from which to work, no benefits nor backup plans, personal failures made public, and in some cases, racism and persistent death threats—they followed the call of their convictions without buckling under the tremendous weight they carried.</p>
<p>These people gave themselves to the world by doing what stars are born to do: they shined. Because they were stars, their contributions live on, lighting the way for the rest of us. And that’s what the Chirpy Do Gooders don’t get: <em>shining</em> is a powerfully natural inclination, and it’s almost always an inconvenience.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that <em>shining</em>—daring to be your real self without asking anybody’s permission—could get you killed or jailed? What if shining put your family at risk and meant you rarely saw them?  How would you handle the knowledge that your <em>shining</em> decisions meant the difference between whether or not hundreds of people got to eat on any given day?</p>
<p>Most of us won’t have to make choices as hard as all that but being stars, and doing what’s in us to do, means we’ll face challenges that require us to make decisions that are inconvenient. But just because things get hard doesn’t mean it’s not <em>meant to be</em>. Don’t <em>even </em>get me started on that one! What if any of the stars I just mentioned refused to shine because the way was tough or their muse went missing, or their check came late, or their marriage went bust, or somebody unliked them in Facebook?</p>
<p>I believe this relentless urge to shine is like the rumbling of solar flares and fire in the belly: it wants out! And <em>not</em> by way of acid reflux meds and garden-variety pills, distractions, excuses, and other forms of sabotage disguised as blather and jive. <em>Letting your light shine</em> means strapping in (or on!) for the ride and staying the course as long as you need to.</p>
<p>If you fire up and quit before you’ve finished, then so be it as long as you own it and move on. You wouldn’t be the first to bow out before the end, you know. If this stuff was easy, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. The thing is, if we do quit, we must do so consciously rather than acting like the fire’s not in us. It <em>is</em>. So, what can you do today to get your flame on, rock star? I’ve got a suggestion to get you started: Be inconvenient. It could save a life one day.</p>

<span id="more-2345"></span></p>
<p>Well, the votes are in and you’ve done it one more time. You have obliterated the competition—me—by creeping into my blind spot and, if I may be frank and earnest, I just–well, how do you <em>do </em>that?</p>
<p>Before you take the stage again, I’d like to acknowledge your career is among the longest in any industry and you’ve been the tops in every category, barring none. I am boggled at this victory, humbled, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t the teensiest bit jealous!</p>
<p>I’m going to call you up here in just a minute to accept your award for Best Performance, but before I do, I’d like to present a few noteworthy highlights from your career that have directly impacted my life:</p>
<p><strong>SOME ENCHANTED EVENINGS: THE ANTHOLOGY</strong>  Your prolific work in the romance genre has been copied, shared, distributed and referenced in countless collections for a really long time. It’s astounding, the way you keep telling those same old stories of ones who got away, of misplaced affections and missed connections, of emotional awkwardness and creaky third wheels. It’s legendary stuff that keeps our hearts racing in place—and broken.</p>
<p><strong>TITANIC  </strong>We’re still scratching our heads on this one. An iceberg. Really? This role might have been your best physical acting yet. You were stoic as a rock, wordless—no lines!—frigid. Hidden in plain sight, you were perfect. What composure! And we thought <em>Costner</em> was cold! What an understatement that was. You really held your own and you even inspired a fleet of plastic recorder music. Awesome.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>WTF ‘N’ THE BADASS BOYZ  </strong>Speaking of your inspiration in music, I absolutely love that you went in and set the industry on its ear so that artists can reach their own fans, sell their own stuff and go around the top-heavy music mill if they feel like it. But I just wish you’d do something about all of the misogyny and hateration. It doesn’t do much good for the people, you know? I guess we shouldn’t expect much; look who I’m talking to.</p>
<p><strong>THE UNWRITTEN  </strong>Even more than your impressive work in Titanic, the way you insinuated yourself into this one was out-and-out genius. The Unwritten is the tragicomic horror story of a good-intentioned writer who sets weekly deadlines, but can’t get a damn thing done. I don’t know if you planned it like this, but the main character’s name was Kriste. I found that fascinating. Crazy, but she looked like me too. Like, she <em>was</em> me, but only, not.</p>
<p>If I might say a few more words about this last one, ladies and gentlemen? Sabotage, I’m downright baffled as to how you knew so much about me, and how you managed to conduct your research.<em> </em>You infiltrated my place and created a totally warped story of me. So much so that I have to ask: was that your intention, to make a mockery of me? For the record, this production of yours is unauthorized, and I may pursue damages.</p>
<p>Before I wrote this speech—this acceptance of my defeat—I wrestled for a long time with the truth of it. I didn’t want to believe it. You should know; you were there, buttering me up as the hours and deadlines passed. You never let on you were undermining my every hope of a win. You encouraged me to rest on my laurels, and I did. <em>You did a lot last week, Kriste, </em>you said. <em>Take a break</em>, you said. Then you served me a nightcap and that was all she wrote.</p>
<p>How about that scene where your Kriste sat down to work, doing great for about an hour? Then you came and plumped the pillows. You shifted her to the softer chair, dimmed the lights and pointed her attention to the night sky. You told her to take in the spring air because it was good for creativity. I watched, nervous and thought, <em>Oh, no. What </em>will<em> she do?</em> Well, she went to the window, walked out the door, and left her deadline to the dogs.</p>
<p>I guess I’m here to present this medal because I’m so familiar with your work. I’ve seen you in thousands of plays—on and off the screen, you fiend. Devilishly charming, assuming an intimacy we don’t share. <em>No harm done,</em> we say at first. Then you roll out your act, bulldoze us and leave our best intentions shredded. Well, that’s a hollow victory if you ask me. I don&#8217;t know <em>how</em> you sleep at night. But congratulations all the same. It’s bittersweet, but I know when I’m beat.</p>
<p>Okay, so you deserve this win. You used crazy talk to explain away the importance of minding my business to the end. You duped me, and I fell for it. Lots of us have lost to you, and speaking for myself, Frank <em>and</em> Earnest, it doesn’t feel good. So, come take your award and add it to the others. You’re sharp, I’ll give you that. I’ll absorb the loss this time. But you should know I’m clever too. I’ve changed the locks. And I will be back. Next week. Count on it.</p>

Well, the votes are in and you’ve done it one more time. You have obliterated the competition—me—by creeping into my blind spot and, if I may be frank and earnest, I just–well, how do you do that?

Before you take the stage again, I’d like to acknowledge your career is among the longest in any industry and you’ve been the tops in every category, barring none. I am boggled at this victory, humbled, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t the teensiest bit jealous!

I’m going to call you up here in just a minute to accept your award for Best Performance, but before I do, I’d like to present a few noteworthy highlights from your career that have directly impacted my life:

SOME ENCHANTED EVENINGS: THE ANTHOLOGY  Your prolific work in the romance genre has been copied, shared, distributed and referenced in countless collections for a really long time. It’s astounding, the way you keep telling those same old stories of ones who got away, of misplaced affections and missed connections, of emotional awkwardness and creaky third wheels. It’s legendary stuff that keeps our hearts racing in place—and broken.

TITANIC  We’re still scratching our heads on this one. An iceberg. Really? This role might have been your best physical acting yet. You were stoic as a rock, wordless—no lines!—frigid. Hidden in plain sight, you were perfect. What composure! And we thought Costner was cold! What an understatement that was.

<p>I’m on the phone recently with a girlfriend until the wee hours discussing one of the most inevitably precarious and tiresome topics known to man: men.</p>
<p><span id="more-2321"></span>Based on my girlfriend’s personal research, extensive dating history, and painstaking observations, she concluded men don’t communicate well, they’re low-down, on the down-low, no-good, posturing, emotional inverts who refuse to grow up and damn them, she added, for being the only datable options available to straight women. Adding to her aggravation, I chimed in where our experiences overlapped, and by the end of the talk, our voices raspy and spent from the analysis, we went about our business, affirmed in our assertions of the opposing sex.</p>
<p>I’m at a coffee bar last week, trying to finalize this post when I overhear a group of attractive women pitching fits over that same guy who just doesn’t get it; he won’t do right, doesn’t call back, can’t commit, and wouldn’t know a good woman if she stalked him on Facebook then appeared at his door, which, I gathered some of them had. Like my friend’s rant, the frustration turned to laughter that was giddy and contagious, and it floated through the room like a bright balloon riding high on its own hot air. Bubbles like that <em>always</em> need hot air to keep them afloat.</p>
<p>I want to talk about what you can do when they sag, droop, and burst.</p>
<p>The gift of having good friends as sounding boards to vent my stuff with lets me relax in knowing I’ve got a safe place to go when I’ve had it; I can be real with them; I can cut up and act a fool, and that&#8217;s a much needed relief all its own. It can also be a tricky line to walk, being painfully honest when the hurt goes deep. But let&#8217;s keep in mind those people who stay stuck in the vent: what they don&#8217;t get is there&#8217;s no room to breathe or navigate in that space and before too long, that space becomes a trap.</p>
<p>Last year I went to a social mixer. The special feature of the event was that singles were encouraged to bring their wingmen along for the fun. As I understand it, wingmen are male sidekicks who tag along with male friends to help make introductions to potential dates. I&#8217;d never heard of wingmen for women, and guy friends told me it didn&#8217;t make sense for women to have men pump them up to would-be boyfriends. Nonsense, I said. What great lady couldn&#8217;t use an equally awesome male counterpart speaking favorably about her to men she&#8217;s interested in? I certainly don&#8217;t know any woman who&#8217;d mind having a good guy say great things about her, do you? We already know there are plenty of men who don&#8217;t on a daily unsolicited basis.</p>
<p>Well, I couldn&#8217;t get a wingman. (But, my friend Bill would have been if he could have!) So, I drew a deep breath, pumped myself up like the biggest balloon in the room and floated off to the function. To tell you how much of a poorly executed, mighty failure it was would be a waste of everybody&#8217;s time, but I can&#8217;t let it go without telling you that the chasm between people wanting connection is as wide as it is deep, and by the looks of that mixer, seems it&#8217;s riddled with rusted nails, greased banana peels, cut glass, battery acid, and emotional razor wire, too.</p>
<p>I mention the horrible mixer to tell you that, even with all of our education and new-millennium gadgetry, social networking and so-called &#8216;communication&#8217;, if you put strange grown folks in a room and leave them to their own raggedy mingling devices—<em>not</em> the cellular or electronic kind—you couldn&#8217;t have a more colossal mess on your hands if you&#8217;d tried to direct Tokyo traffic with an arm behind your back.</p>
<p>By the end of the night, despite my own manufactured efforts to speak to everyone in the room—making the rounds as the self-appointed event photographer—I went home feeling defeated and that much worse for going at all. So much for pumping up and hot air. And this is but part of the tragedy: it seems we&#8217;re so terrified of rejection and extending ourselves to each other, we&#8217;d rather pad our old corners and diddle our gadgets, posing as connected, instead of reaching out for real.</p>
<p>You take my flop of a single&#8217;s event on its own and it&#8217;s easy enough to blow it off. But don&#8217;t let me off the hook for faking like a photographer either. I don&#8217;t count myself out of this sorry equation, believe me. But when you extend this fear of extension out to my girlfriend and then to that group of women in the coffee shop and the men who couldn&#8217;t see why women needed wingmen, and to yourself, it paints a dismal picture of us being way too comfortable rolling out the same old stories only to leave them there; they can&#8217;t ever get it right; there don&#8217;t seem to be any Good Ones left; nobody sees the real me; old dogs; new tricks and so on.</p>
<p>Now spread that same superficial gripe across countless dating sites and social situations to millions of men and women too afraid to show up in real time with a real willingness to wing it, to be open and show some sincere interest in the other person. This breakdown butts up against the walls of all of the interactions we&#8217;re too afraid to have in the world. Connection is about a whole lot more than clicking boxes, linking in and joining circles. And if we ever get that figured out, then, wow. Just wow. Nearly one hundred years ago the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw said, <em>The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.</em> That&#8217;s even more of a mouthful today.</p>
<p>Among the many perks of being a writer and creative sort is the fact that we get to spur and expand the dialogue. But, as consumers, if we stop at simply regurgitating the work of other people as our own, we miss the chance to be original, to be ourselves. If I must be the one to break this to you, then so be it: we&#8217;re actually <em>not</em> those whimsical men and women from Friends or Living Single or Seinfeld or Waiting to Exhale or Girlfriends or Sex and The City. And neither are they. They are paid actors who play the roles and read the lines approved by test groups and studio execs, roles and lines written by paid TV writers. Those characters never have bad days, let alone bad hair, or issues that couldn&#8217;t be resolved in time for the laugh track and commercial breaks. You&#8217;ll pardon those old references; I stopped watching TV years ago.</p>
<p>The next time you get a chance to connect for real, it&#8217;s okay to reach for a borrowed line (or a camera, if you have to) but don&#8217;t let that be all you do. Next time, let&#8217;s be willing to flip the script or ditch it altogether. If what we want is real connection, we can&#8217;t afford to get caught up in our own hot air. Why wait to exhale, honey? Let&#8217;s breathe already—and learn to improvise while we&#8217;re at it.</p>

		<itunes:summary>I’m on the phone recently with a girlfriend until the wee hours discussing one of the most inevitably precarious and tiresome topics known to man: men.

Based on my girlfriend’s personal research, extensive dating history, and painstaking observations, she concluded men don’t communicate well, they’re low-down, on the down-low, no-good, posturing, emotional inverts who refuse to grow up and damn them, she added, for being the only datable options available to straight women.

The gift of having good friends as sounding boards to vent my stuff with lets me relax in knowing I’ve got a safe place to go when I’ve had it; I can be real with them; I can cut up and act a fool, and that's a much needed relief all its own.

</a>Several factors went into the creation of this post and not the least of which is my having recently seen the cheesy tearjerker of a movie that inspired this title. Sandra Bullock also happens to star in this film and—purely as an aside—Sandy&#8217;s a public figure with whom I have lots in common.</p>
<p><span id="more-2217"></span>The basics: Sandra’s fabulous, loaded, and funny. Plus she’s in great shape, she’s classy, and she’s a Hollywood darling. Then there’s the fact that I saw this movie (again) while taking a break from writing a lecture I’m giving that’s related to the very same topic of magic. I’d been spinning my wheels on it and was eager to kick my feet up with a bit of cinematic drivel when I realized the great connections between the film and real life—and not just because of my mystical kinship to Sandy.</p>
<p>The talk I’m giving is based on the premise that, instead of being some kind of otherworldly phenomena experienced by a select few, magic probably functions a lot more like luck. Meaning, it shows up once we’ve done our part in terms of putting in our hours, remaining vigilant, and paying dues. There was an ancient Roman philosopher named Seneca who once said, <em>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.</em> Replace <em>luck</em> with <em>magic</em> and I’m still down with what he’s saying. Almost entirely.</p>
<p>Here’s where the <em>practical</em> part enters in. Again, any results worth realizing will insist that we do what we must to help things along. And wouldn’t you know it, shortly after I started working in earnest on my lecture, here comes Practical Magic to help me illustrate my main points, of which there are about three.</p>
<p><strong>The Beginning: Old Lines</strong>  Sally Owens—insert your own name here if this feels familiar—comes from a long line of powerful women. For many generations these women have lived under a so-called curse cast by a disgruntled matriarch from way back. She was heartbroken and abandoned by a no-&#8217;count man. In her despair, she vowed that none of the women who came after her would ever know true love and any men they had would die horrible premature deaths. Generations later, Sally finds herself in love with a wonderful guy who dies a horribly premature death and, believing the curse, she falls prey to it, suffers miserably, and goes back to bed for months.</p>
<p>In the real world, this is a great parallel for showing us how we shut down our own magic, luck and opportunities by buying into The Story. <em>We’ve never been lucky in love, you know</em>. <em>Nobody’s </em>ever<em> done that before. What makes you think </em>you’re<em> so smart?</em> and <em>Dreams? They’re not for</em> us! If you’ve ever believed what I call the ‘lie of inheritance’ that says you must never be happier, more fulfilled, adventurous or actualized than anyone who ever lived in your immediate, extended, real or imaginary family, then, well, you’ve just shut down your own magic. And that’s simply not a practical thing to do if you want to embark on a new life path, now is it?</p>
<p><strong>The Middle: Breaking Points</strong>  Sally Owens—insert your own name here if this feels familiar—has now given up on love, she&#8217;s closed off a natural, magical part of herself just to fit in, and it’s all backfiring big time. She’s feeling alienated and trapped, and oh how she suffers! Then, as life would have it, she is forced into a situation that forces her to drum up her magic to save her sister’s life and, ultimately, her own. It doesn’t stop there. She also has to ‘come out’ to her community and let them see her as the wildly gifted woman she is.</p>
<p>Have you ever had an experience where you’ve whittled and wedged yourself down into an unwelcoming environment that you hoped would embrace you but didn’t? Well, you don’t have to be David Blaine to know that even though stuffing yourself into somebody else&#8217;s box is a pretty good trick, it’s hardly an act of magic.</p>
<p><strong>The End: Last Words</strong>  So Sally Owens—insert your own name here if this feels familiar—has survived the massive challenge of accepting herself and has finally come to appreciate who she is, along with her magic. Once she does she breaks the curse, which in turn, releases its hold on everyone up and down the family line. We know it’s Hollywood, and they’ve only got about 85 minutes to make for a tidy ending while our own stories tend to drag out a whole lot longer. But, here’s my point: clinging to the old narratives of being born under a bad sign only have as much power as you give them.</p>
<p>When you consider your own experience, look at the ways you might be unwittingly cutting yourself off from your own magic. Look at your family story, the story of your environment, and your own personal bio, too. Do you ever catch yourself telling yourself things like this: <em>Oh, I’m not really creative. I couldn’t possibly write anything people would read</em>, or <em>No way could I ever get up in front of a big crowd and talk about </em>spiritual<em> things. Magic? Really? Who does that.</em> Or what about this one: <em>I’ve never had (fill in the blank), and neither has anybody in my family. I can&#8217;t see it, so I guess it&#8217;s out of the question, thank you not so much.</em></p>
<p>Sally’s last lines send me into histrionics every time. She asks, <em>Can love really travel back in time to heal a broken heart? Was it our joined hands that finally lifted Maria&#8217;s curse? I&#8217;d like to think so.</em> She says other stuff too, but I’m usually wailing too loud by that point and blubbering back to the screen, <em>Yes, Sally, ye-heh-hesss!</em> Not to give the ending away or anything, but love turns out to be the practical magic that breaks the curse and mends the family after all. Like I said, it&#8217;s Hollywood. I&#8217;m sure you saw that one coming.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Poppies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2185" title="Poppies" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Poppies.jpg" alt="Golden hillside poppies in front of an old house." width="283" height="424" /></a></p>
<p>Now that it’s spring and winter has begun to loosen its grip all around us, there&#8217;s no better time for nurturing the seeds of dreams we planted a few months back. Remember in January when I lobbied like mad for The Revolution? Well, in doing so I consequently plunged myself into a deep sea of change by deciding to get even more serious about my goals.</p>
<p><span id="more-1173"></span>By this time it shouldn&#8217;t surprise anybody to learn I’m an expert at knowing how I work—and at knowing how I get tempted to shirk my work once I&#8217;m seeing results—so, this time around, I made sure to put some supports in place that keep me honest when the lure of bad habits started to tug at my growth. And you? Have you enlisted this kind of help for yourself?</p>
<p>Have you surrounded yourself with folks who keep you focused on your stuff? Do you check in with them to answer for your actions—and your inaction if that&#8217;s the case? Better yet, who are you supporting in their personal season of revival?</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the very real truth of reciprocity, in that what goes around comes around, you&#8217;ll find that sincerely encouraging someone else to break new ground will work wonders to scoot you along in the progress. There&#8217;s a caveat here too: you&#8217;ve got to make sure your your motives are genuine when you lend a hand. Otherwise, if you start attaching strings and conditions to your support, they&#8217;ll choke off the flow of your growth like the worst kind of weed, and before you know it, you&#8217;ll start focusing on the thorns and mud wondering why you bothered at all.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t yet know who your key people are, then let me suggest 4 questions to help you identify them. Don&#8217;t be discouraged if no one comes quickly to mind; it&#8217;s just a matter of discovering them. Bigger still is the fact that as you become the answer to each of these questions, finding others who fit the bill will get that much easier:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Who&#8217;s the first person you call when something great—or terrible—happens?<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Whom can you trust to tell you the truth in a way that doesn&#8217;t wreck your relationship or jeopardize your confidence in yourself?<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Who gets excited when you excel and win?<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Who comes around to love you up when you&#8217;re down, broke, and depressed?</p>
<p>Like I said, I put a few friends and fellow changelings on notice and, personally, while I think they might have a little too much fun kicking me in my crap and pointing out the less than amazing aspects to my plans, never once do they enable my excuses and blustery explanations as to why I&#8217;m not doing my work. Besides, I said I gave up excuses for Lent, remember?</p>
<p>As I continue to experience the rush and boom of my revolutions, I&#8217;m reminded time and again that the magic to any achievement is sustained hard work. No amount of affirming, energy and imagination are going to do the actual work for you. Granted, intention, faith, attitude, and all the other unquantifiables are important. Equally important, though, is the amount of effort you put into your labor of love.</p>
<p>To resolve to achieve something means we’re determined; it means we’re setting down a firm decision to <em>do</em> things differently. And putting action behind it—and all around it—demands responsibility, accountability, a fair amount of creative challenge, and surrender to the known and unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve convinced yourself you just can’t do the thing you said you would, or somehow you&#8217;ve worked it out all by yourself that your ideas once striding and brilliant have now fallen lame, I urge you to take a second, third, hundredth look, and be honest. Brutally so. Then figure out what still matters and get back in the game. Don’t bother bringing your C-level work, either; that just won’t do.</p>
<p>Imagine if a C-level spring rolled in and instead of our usual billion birds chirping and the sun blazing its brightest, what if all we got was a handful of bloated, broken-winged birds and a dreary sun that barely peaked past the horizon line each day? And what if all of our flowers punched through the ground only to flop to one side in a lackluster display across our gardens?</p>
<p>Take your lead from spring and bust out that thing that&#8217;s in you to do. Nature doesn&#8217;t have a choice about how it&#8217;s going to present itself in any given season. And as far as I can tell, it doesn&#8217;t worry about failure or judgment. Here at home, I don&#8217;t see my plants catfighting and comparing themselves against each other. You won&#8217;t find my flowers freaking out about whether they&#8217;re being too bold in expressing their natural beauty. I suspect they know their growth is guided by an unseen hand, and because they know, I doubt they entertain the lie that they&#8217;re unworthy to thrive and be in the world.</p>
<p>We may only be human, and unlike the simple profundity of the natural world, we get to choose how and whether we bloom. But this spring—and in any season—why not crack out of your respective shells and unleash your vibrant, natural self on life? Birds do it, bees do it, and trees do it too. Turn over some new leaves, break new ground, unfold to your full height and stretch, why dontcha? Need more inspiration? Well look out your window. Nature is bodacious in its glory. Now it&#8217;s our turn.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Now that it’s spring and winter has begun to loosen its grip all around us, there's no better time for nurturing the seeds of dreams we planted a few months back. Remember in January when I lobbied like mad for The Revolution? Well, in doing so I consequently plunged myself into a deep sea of change by deciding to get even more serious about my goals.

By this time it shouldn't surprise anybody to learn I’m an expert at knowing how I work—and at knowing how I get tempted to shirk my work once I'm seeing results—so, this time around, I made sure to put some supports in place that keep me honest when the lure of bad habits started to tug at my growth. And you? Have you enlisted this kind of help for yourself?

Have you surrounded yourself with folks who keep you focused on your stuff? Do you check in with them to answer for your actions—and your inaction if that's the case? Better yet, who are you supporting in their personal season of revival?

Bearing in mind the very real truth of reciprocity, in that what goes around comes around, you'll find that sincerely encouraging someone else to break new ground will work wonders to scoot you along in the progress. There's a caveat here too: you've got to make sure your your motives are genuine when you lend a hand. Otherwise, if you start attaching strings and conditions to your support, they'll choke off the flow of your growth like the worst kind of weed, and before you know it, you'll start focusing on the thorns and mud wondering why you bothered at all.

If you don't yet know who your key people are, then let me suggest 4 questions to help you identify them. Don't be discouraged if no one comes quickly to mind; it's just a matter of discovering them. Bigger still is the fact that as you become the answer to each of these questions, finding others who fit the bill will get that much easier:

1. Who's the first person you call when something great—or terrible—happens?
2. Whom can you trust to tell you the truth in a way that doesn't wreck your relationship or jeopardize your confidence in yourself?
3. Who gets excited when you excel and win?
4. Who comes around to love you up when you're down, broke, and depressed?

Like I said, I put a few friends and fellow changelings on notice and, personally, while I think they might have a little too much fun kicking me in my crap and pointing out the less than amazing aspects to my plans, never once do they enable my excuses and blustery explanations as to why I'm not doing my work. Besides, I said I gave up excuses for Lent, remember?

As I continue to experience the rush and boom of my revolutions, I'm reminded time and again that the magic to any achievement is sustained hard work. No amount of affirming, energy and imagination are going to do the actual work for you. Granted, intention, faith, attitude, and all the other unquantifiables are important. Equally important, though, is the amount of effort you put into your labor of love.

To resolve to achieve something means we’re determined; it means we’re setting down a firm decision to do things differently. And putting action behind it—and all around it—demands responsibility, accountability, a fair amount of creative challenge, and surrender to the known and unknown unknowns.

Even if you’ve convinced yourself you just can’t do the thing you said you would, or somehow you've worked it out all by yourself that your ideas once striding and brilliant have now fallen lame, I urge you to take a second, third, hundredth look, and be honest. Brutally so. Then figure out what still matters and get back in the game. Don’t bother bringing your C-level work, either; that just won’t do.

</a><em>Last year I received a request from a women’s conference to deliver an essay based on the theme of success. At first I wasn’t sure how much I had to say on the topic. Then it took me a minute to register that </em>I<em> was being viewed as successful in the eyes of the women who approached me. I said &#8216;Yes,&#8217; I wrung my hands, mulled it over, and </em>Phoenix Rising<em> is the result.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-1073"></span>Whenever I sit down to write I inevitably find myself scanning the room for inspiration. With my hands poised directly above my keyboard, I cock my head to one side and stare into the void of my office (which, to civilian eyes, is my kitchen table). Sometimes, I peer into the dusty corners, looking for lines I might have tossed aside in a fit of creative excess. Other times, I perform a mental sweep along the baseboards, scavenging for misplaced phrases that would give my material wings.</p>
<p>I’m a writer, and this is my waiting game of choice: looking and listening for the faintest break in the stillness, pining for that magical moment when the literal and figurative walls break down and talk to me if for nothing else that to lead me out of my creative fog long enough to set me on dry ground again. Unfortunately for me, this method isn’t without its flaws. F or starters, inspiration rarely comes when called, and outright brilliance turns up with even less frequency.</p>
<p>The good news, though, is this: whether my elusive muse shows up or not, I never stop writing. And I have the Phoenix to thank for that. Celebrated among cultures from Asia to the Americas as a symbol of redemption and second chances, longsuffering and determination, the Phoenix has come to define the very notion of success for me. So has the Sankofa bird.</p>
<p>Less widely known than the Phoenix, the Sankofa bird is popular figure in West African traditions and is shown flying forward while looking back. This depiction reminds us, in addition to the timeless message of the phoenix, that we cannot truly move forward without first learning from the past.</p>
<p>Once I settled into doing this essay—and to first stare at the walls—it was the vibrantly colored painting of this mythical bird that immediately captured my attention. I’d always been drawn to its rich colors and bold strokes; I admired at once the confidence and power in it. But, it wasn’t until I’d lived with the piece for quite some time that I realized the significance of the painted bird’s gaze: it was looking over its shoulder. And the flames that seemed to be licking at its tail feathers were propelling it upward with the intensity of a rocket being launched.</p>
<p>As I lingered on this image I realized that not only was this mythical bird anything <em>but</em> a static fairytale or pawn drummed up by long-ago tribes of so-called primitive people from various spots around the globe, I knew this creature was real. I mean, she <em>lived</em>.</p>
<p>Who else but a determined resilient, determined female could harness her supernatural resources to repeatedly transcend the stifling limitations placed on her by a short-sighted culture? Who but a female—a woman with a mission in mind—could bear the heat of having to reinvent herself every time her life demanded it? And, none other than a seriously focused woman could fly boldly toward her goal while taking into full account all of the flops and victories and close calls of the past. Little did I know how much this brilliant work of art and this notion of success had to teach me.</p>
<p>I’ve learned 2 things about success:<em></em></p>
<p><em>       Success is relative. And;</em></p>
<p><em>       Success has everything to do with failure.</em></p>
<p>As an artist, friend, teacher, student, sister, daughter, speaker, seeker and businesswoman, I know that in each role I play, success looks very different. I count being willing to be vulnerable in my close relationships—and having enough courage to ask for what I really need—as major success, given the fact that I wasn’t born into a family that won any prizes for modeling healthy relationships. Trusting my own instincts and talent to bring life to the blank page—literal or otherwise—is what calls me to mine the depths of my imagination—and to risk falling short of the goals I began with. Still, I write.</p>
<p>Calling on the resilience that helps me recover when slammed doors and random stresses threaten to send me back to my corner also constitutes success in my book. And let’s not even talk about waking up at early o’clock x times a week to break a sweat on the mountain trails or in the unforgiving gym!</p>
<p>A noted Spanish author once wrote:</p>
<p><em>       “The Phoenix hope can wing her way through the desert skies</em><em></em></p>
<p><em>        And still defying Fortune’s spite, revive from ashes and rise.”</em></p>
<p>I know this is true because I’ve come by this grace in my own life, and I’ve learned by examples of countless women who never settled complacent in their nests, content with the lives handed them. In the spirit of Sankofa, they looked around with a nod of gratitude for lessons learned, and they got fired up one more time for the work that lie ahead. Now that’s success. And I couldn’t be in finer company.</p>

</a><br />
With my birthday fast approaching, I find myself thinking a lot about where my life is headed, about how I got here, and about what all the seemingly scattered bits and pieces of my eclectic experience up to this point is supposed to mean. The more I considered it all, the less I got. And that frustrated me on account of I&#8217;m older now and, according to The Rules, I&#8217;m supposed to have <em>answers</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-415"></span></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it written somewhere that, at my age, I&#8217;m supposed to have arrived at some profoundly paradigm-shifting realizations about the new post-racial, post-post-feminist, green-leaning world order and my place in it all? Isn&#8217;t it my <em>job</em> to be up on these issues since I am, after all, the world&#8217;s foremost expert on me? How come, instead, I&#8217;m sitting up in the middle of the night, tapping out an inconclusive entry when what I initially hoped for was to show up on the page oozing enlightenment, a shining example of fabulousness that so many women seem to exude without trying? Even when I was a tweener, those women, fully self-actualized at the crest of their respective sexual, psychological, and socially-oriented peaks seemed more mythic than real and unlike any of the women I knew.</p>
<p>They were presented as larger-than-life modern-day goddesses who handily straddled demanding worlds of home, husbands, and high-profile jobs in stacked pumps, power suits, and perfect hair. Not only did they bring home the bread, they came bearing bacon too, fried it up for their guys, and never, <em>never </em>let them forget they were men. I had no clue what that was supposed to look like in real life, and wondered if it involved me tailing him around the house—when I wasn&#8217;t busy making bacon sandwiches—affirming his sex by way of verbal reinforcement each time he behaved mannishly. Would it have warranted a constant clutching at his crotch as a loving reminder of his ever present maleness? I simply didn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of decades beyond my tweens, and I&#8217;m still marveling at middle-aged ladies who seem to do, be, and have it <em>all</em>. How&#8217;d they manage that? If it looks like I&#8217;m playing at comparisons here, you&#8217;d be right. I&#8217;d even add that after more than enough time spent stacking my life experiences up against this unbelievable standard, it&#8217;s obvious to me I was losing out every time I measured my life against values that hardly had me in mind. Even though I&#8217;ve always known this in my head, there&#8217;s a lot to be said for embodying a belief. Because when what you know in your head also resides <em>in your bones</em>, there&#8217;s no going back. At least, not in the same way. Ever again.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the twists and turns that brought me here to this very spot on my crushed velvet couch in snow-capped Colorado—for all of the short-lived loves, the interminable tests of faith, for loyal friends, for heart-and-mind-expanding travel, for committed students and teachers, for wonderful clients, an unconditionally loving pal of a cat, and more. For it all, I&#8217;m grateful. In my world, pan frying will burn if you&#8217;re not careful. And if my man doesn&#8217;t already know he&#8217;s a man, then he&#8217;d better move on because it&#8217;s not likely I can convince him.</p>
<p>All told, when we step out of the losing game of applying other people&#8217;s standards to our own lives, we get to see how clearly, possibly, our experiences knit together in a synchronous pattern, and we get a great reminder that all truly <em>is</em> well. Here&#8217;s a quote I love from Charles Schulz, creator of Pigpen, Linus, Peppermint Patty, Chucky B, Snoopy and the gang. It reminds me that, to the extent I&#8217;m able to embrace and celebrate the treasure of this unique journey as my own, guess what? I win. He said:</p>
<p><strong>My life has no purpose, no direction, no aim, no meaning, and yet I&#8217;m happy.<br />
I can&#8217;t figure it out. What am I doing right?</strong></p>
<p>- &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; -</p>

They were presented as larger-than-life modern-day goddesses who handily straddled demanding worlds of home, husbands, and high-profile jobs in stacked pumps, power suits, and perfect hair. Not only did they bring home the bread, they came bearing bacon too, fried it up for their guys, and never, never let them forget they were men. I had no clue what that was supposed to look like in real life, and wondered if it involved me tailing him around the house—when I wasn't busy making bacon sandwiches—affirming his sex by way of verbal reinforcement each time he behaved mannishly. Would it have warranted a constant clutching at his crotch as a loving reminder of his ever present maleness? I simply didn't know.

Fast forward a couple of decades beyond my tweens, and I'm still marveling at middle-aged ladies who seem to do, be, and have it all. How'd they manage that? If it looks like I'm playing at comparisons here, you'd be right. I'd even add that after more than enough time spent stacking my life experiences up against this unbelievable standard, it's obvious to me I was losing out every time I measured my life against values that hardly had me in mind. Even though I've always known this in my head, there's a lot to be said for embodying a belief. Because when what you know in your head also resides in your bones, there's no going back. At least, not in the same way. Ever again.

I can appreciate the twists and turns that brought me here to this very spot on my crushed velvet couch in snow-capped Colorado—for all of the short-lived loves, the interminable tests of faith, for loyal friends, for heart-and-mind-expanding travel, for committed students and teachers, for wonderful clients, an unconditionally loving pal of a cat, and more. For it all, I'm grateful. In my world, pan frying will burn if you're not careful. And if my man doesn't already know he's a man, then he'd better move on because it's not likely I can convince him.

All told, when we step out of the losing game of applying other people's standards to our own lives, we get to see how clearly, possibly, our experiences knit together in a synchronous pattern, and we get a great reminder that all truly is well. Here's a quote I love from Charles Schulz, creator of Pigpen, Linus, Peppermint Patty, Chucky B, Snoopy and the gang. It reminds me that, to the extent I'm able to embrace and celebrate the treasure of this unique journey as my own, guess what? I win. He said:

My life has no purpose, no direction, no aim, no meaning, and yet I'm happy.
I can't figure it out. What am I doing right?

<p>A few weeks ago my friend Matt and I were talking about our various projects and how this or that fear was making us squeamish about taking our much needed next steps. Maybe you remember Matt from the <a title="Reflections" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/02/11/reflections/" target="_blank">Reflections</a> post? Back then he was toying with the idea of starting a business. Actually, it was more like he was being toyed <em>with</em>—by his fear and doubt.</p>
<p><span id="more-2060"></span></p>
<p>Today Matt has the luxury of having a new set of fear that&#8217;s based on how to run the business he courageously started. No longer worrying about whether he could do it at all, now my friend finds himself skittish about issues of time management and choosing which among his many projects to develop. <em>These are excellent problems to have,</em> I reminded him. <em>You&#8217;d never have faced this batch of fear if you didn&#8217;t decide to go for it in the first place, way back when.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing what we discover by looking back at what used to scare us, if only to be shown that we made it through; we lived to fight (and squirm) another day. Whether you went boldly with your head held high, or if you got dragged screaming and wailing through your challenges—you made it, honey! And that is the victory that we must not overlook.</p>
<p>I look at fear as a scavenger, spiraling silently overhead waiting to swoop in and pick over the steaming remnants of my freshly deferred dreams. No need to seek it out in the skies, or defend against this buzzard because—trust me on this—it will be there, ready and ravenous the moment you give up on your goal. (And by the way, how&#8217;s your <a title="New Year Revolutions" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/12/31/new-year-revolutions/" target="_blank">New Year Revolution</a> going?) It&#8217;s in no rush and you better believe the old buzzard is patient and can outlast any of your indecisive, cowardly fence-sitting. It can smell defeat in us as soon as we let up on the thing we want, and it knows when we&#8217;re about to succumb. Oh, the things our fear knows about us!</p>
<p>As Matt and I talked we laughed at how easy it was to short-circuit our respective gripe sessions going straight to what we were up against: our fear. Only then were we able to relax and explore creative ways to move forward. Personally, I think everyone needs a confidant to share fears with. And we need reminders that, while scavengers will always be there preying on what looks like our weakness, we don&#8217;t have to give ourselves to it entirely.</p>
<p>Fear and real-life scavengers are natural players in the life cycle, and they can take on the form of negative family, friends, spouses, old ideas, and anything that makes us doubt our own dream. I&#8217;ve found that acknowledging my fear can keep me sharp if I let it. I&#8217;ve also experienced the grief of seeing it devour my hopes more times than I&#8217;ll tell you about. Not to make it out to be such a bad thing, fear can also offer us a good laugh when we let it.</p>
<p>I came across an old list of fears I created as part of my Soul Coaching exercises. Remember <a title="Fear of Air" href="http://honeyhelpyourself.blogspot.com/2008/04/day-seven-fear-of-air.html" target="_blank">that experiment</a>? Wow, talk about cleaning house. Anyway, by the time I&#8217;d finished my list, I was surprised at how much room I&#8217;d made for moving on—toward greater fear, even bigger buzzards, and problems I&#8217;m thrilled to be facing nowadays. Just curious, but can you see yourself in any of these?</p>
<p>1. <strong>I&#8217;m afraid of failure. </strong>Who wants to bear/bare their souls or bright ideas or even a new outfit or Significant Other and be subject to anything less than a warm reception and marching band? Taking the risk is risky. I&#8217;ve got a million ideas, and I&#8217;ve had plenty of them flop in the past. I couldn&#8217;t possibly present another one to public scrutiny. There&#8217;s a chance it could go belly up like my other Stuff. Leave all the creativity to people who really know what they&#8217;re doing, right?</p>
<p>2. <strong>I&#8217;m afraid of success. </strong>So let&#8217;s say I <em>do</em> venture forward with my Big Ideas, and somebody actually thinks it&#8217;s neat. And then, what if lots of people glom onto it and look to me to churn out even more, better, neater ideas and I come up short? I can&#8217;t possibly let everyone down like that. So maybe it&#8217;s better to stay where I am and not venture out into the deep waters of success. Besides, there&#8217;s no guarantee my cockamamie ideas will fly, anyway. So, yeah, I&#8217;ll just stay in bed. Pass the chips, please.</p>
<p>3. <strong>I&#8217;m afraid of mediocrity. </strong>For shits and giggles, how about we say my ideas, my pet projects, my Art finds its way into the hands of a few dozen people in the world beyond the handful of sympathetic friends and family members who put up with my artistic outbursts? They&#8217;re just being nice and can&#8217;t bear to tell me to sit down and shut up; I just know it, bless their hearts. After all these years, it stands to reason I&#8217;ve never gotten anywhere: I&#8217;m merely mediocre. Please save your Self Help books for me; I may need them down the road one winter.</p>
<p>4. <strong>I&#8217;m afraid of exposure. </strong>Great Scott! What if my creative musings and outbursts actually find a wider audience and people I may never meet face to face actually want to buy what I&#8217;m selling? That means they&#8217;ll want access to me. And if they get it, what if they see that I&#8217;m really a sham and not nearly as talented, beautiful and masterful—or kooky—as they were led to believe? Omigod, then I&#8217;m <em>really</em> sunk. I couldn&#8217;t bear being exposed for all to see like that. Help!</p>
<p>5. <strong>I&#8217;m afraid of being alone. </strong>Then again, what if no one ever truly <em>sees</em> me? I could wind up like one of those test babies that never got any hugs or love growing up and wound up being socially unacceptable and ostracized for the rest of their lives. There have been real studies done on this type of thing. If I play it safe, and stay inside the lines—even though it&#8217;s kind of too late for that—than maybe I&#8217;d never get noticed. By anyone. Even now, maybe the people who get me, what if they all move away and forget me? What if my loser friends make it B-I-G and I got nobody to burn my old manuscripts with for heat? Now I&#8217;m really getting frightened.</p>
<p>6. <strong>I&#8217;m afraid of rambling. </strong>What if nobody ever listens to me again because I simply can&#8217;t keep quiet? This Fear is really the only reason I have been able to hold myself back from giving you the extended version of this list. Consider yourself lucky.</p>
<p>See? Everywhere I turn, there&#8217;s Fear. Just like Air, it&#8217;s inescapable. Only now, I&#8217;m starting to see it. Unlike Charlie Brown&#8217;s funky friend, Pigpen, who was forever plagued with a cloud of Stuff, I&#8217;m becoming aware of my persistent Crap (See items 1–6), and it has arrived with quite a thunderous revelation: Fear is <em>bor</em>ing.</p>
<p>Like I said, that fear was so 2008. I&#8217;m chewing on new fear now, one humble bite at a time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day and aside from the chocolate, I don&#8217;t see the point. In grade school we swapped cards and candy, and if only for that first few minutes in class, everyone loved us. But we&#8217;re grown up now, and things are different. We&#8217;re swamped by diamond jewelry ads, talking Hallmark cards and teary-eyed commercials pandering to us all day long. Hmpf.</p>
<p><span id="more-1987"></span></p>
<p>My thing is: love is an around-the-clock, unmufflered affair in that it&#8217;s noisy and indelicate and unlike anything Hollywood would have us believe. Love works us, heals us, and tips us like gravy boats, allowing our best flow out to the ones closest to us. It&#8217;s confusing, deeply soaring, and when it&#8217;s real, it could give a damn about greeting cards, candy and pop songs.</p>
<p>The other day a frustrated friend texted me asking, HOW CAN I MAKE A MAN LIKE ME. To the extent that she was saying, <em>All I want is a few good dates and not all of the mindgame-y aloof bs,</em> she was kind of joking. And to the extent she was saying, <em>What is wrong with </em>me<em> that I can&#8217;t meet a guy who seems the least bit interested</em>, she was absolutely not joking. My friend is representative of most women I know: she&#8217;s smart, funny, loving, beautiful, super creative, one of a kind, kind and doubting how awesome she is. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s upsetting.</p>
<p>To the scary parts in all of us, to those scabbed-over wounded pieces lodged so dee that we&#8217;ve long forgotten they&#8217;re there, let me just say, <em>You rock, you look fabulous, and the world is waiting for you to show us how it&#8217;s done.</em> I want to say, <em>Come on out and do your thing. Because we need you</em>. And this: <em>The fact that you doubt yourself sometimes means you&#8217;re normal. I mean, look what we&#8217;re up against with all of the messages that want us to believe the lies about what we can become.</em> Oh, and this too I want to say: <em>The fact that you have enough self-awareness and humility to think you&#8217;ve got room to grow is exactly the thing that makes you perfect! That plus the fact that you&#8217;ve got a great ass.</em></p>
<p>My friend&#8217;s question, again, representative of so many people&#8217;s questions about the same thing, made me think about how rampant this idea of being unlovable is. I thought more about the messages we get that only serve to whack us in ads and magazines and songs. Pop songs. And bam, Whitney Houston.</p>
<p>Pop&#8217;s First Lady of Song, The Original Queen of the Night, may have gone on too soon, but she left me a soundtrack that would play out in the backdrop of my love life in all of its joy and nonsense, ecstasy and depth, and I&#8217;d like to share a little bit of it–and the lessons offered up in the process.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m Saving All My Love for You</strong><br />
There&#8217;s this idea that we store up all the love in side us for the one day when that special someone rides into our lives on a chariot of fire, or on a crack of lightning, to deliver us into forever land. (insert losing game show buzzer sound here) I&#8217;m of 2 minds on this: 1.) It&#8217;s better to share the love you have now rather than later. Everyone is worthy of love, and when we give it, it just makes us better. Period. Doesn&#8217;t if feel good to get it? Then give it and watch how it boomerangs on you in surprising corners of your life. Why wait for The One before you start loving and living like you mean it? 2.) If this is about celibacy, then, yeah, handle your business. And keep on loving from your heart while you&#8217;re at it!</p>
<p><strong>Why Does It Hurt So Bad</strong><br />
Coming off of the celibacy thing, I realize this could be misconstrued in its meaning, but we&#8217;re talking about heart here, folks. So knock it off. Beat it, you smartasses. Seriously. Ever been in love with someone who was about as loving as a feral dog trapped in a corner, baring its teeth at you? This is the equivalent of a wounded lover we&#8217;re trying to rescue. Only we can&#8217;t see it when we&#8217;re in love with is potential. Trust me, this scenario isn&#8217;t good for either of you, so spare yourself some hurt by holding out for the love you deserve.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How Will I Know?</strong><br />
How many years have I wasted on this one, people? <em>Did what he had said mean he loves me? Was he interested when he looked at me like that at the club and took my number last year? Maybe his SIM card fell out and he lost my number? I think we were flirting, but when he put his arm around me, he tucked in the tag in the back. You think he wants me? He&#8217;s a real sweetheart; he does my hair for free.</em> Yeah. Shit like that. So, let me save you some time on this one, kay? Here&#8217;s how you know if he loves you or loves you not: ASK HIM.</p>
<p><strong>Where Do Broken Hearts Go?</strong><br />
Survey says they go to bars and clubs and they migrate like hell to online dating sites. If the object of your affection is acting on unfinished business, forgetting your name (your name is not Susan! (Unless it is.)), or worse, calling you his ex&#8217;s name, and seems unable to connect with you in a healthy loving way, then he may need time to deal with what&#8217;s eating him. And the same goes for you. Please do not unleash yourself of the dating population without having taken stock of your stuff. No one wants to be punished for what the last one did. We all deserve a chance to fuck up or fly on our own merits.</p>
<p><strong>I Have Nothing (If I Don&#8217;t Have You)</strong><br />
Somebody bring me my buzzer for this one! For every time my mother asked me if I&#8217;d met Mr. Wonderful, and I told her I hadn&#8217;t, she&#8217;d say something like, <em>Well, you can do bad all by yourself.</em> Uh, thanks ma? I don&#8217;t have time enough to address the whole premise of low expectation on that one, so I&#8217;ll just deal with the other part. It&#8217;s true that having a partner who is not adding value to your life, or enhancing the wholeness you already feel about yourself, is a good indicator that you&#8217;re not working with much. And if you&#8217;ve convinced yourself that you&#8217;re a nobody without the object of your affection, you might be a stalker or borderline personality and I just can&#8217;t help you.</p>
<p><strong>Didn&#8217;t We Almost Have It All?</strong><br />
This is another time suck and I advise you to turn tail and run if you find yourself in love with the &#8220;story&#8221; of someone rather than who he or she truly is. Looking good on paper does not a great relationship make. And hanging on to the hope of what he said he was going to do without ever having any proof of it should be proof enough that you&#8217;re living the dream, and not a good one. What&#8217;s worse is if you&#8217;ve left the relationships yeeeeears ago and you&#8217;re still holding on in your mind, shutting yourself off from the love that&#8217;s waiting for you. Please, honey, keep it moving. That was One Moment In Time, and you owe it to yourself to embrace new Good Love, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p><strong>My Name Is Not Susan</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re beloved doesn&#8217;t know your name, then the relationship might be at a bit of an imbalance. And you may need medication. Otherwise, if you&#8217;re involved with someone who refuses to see the beauty of who you are, you&#8217;re doing yourself a serious disservice. Real love meets people where they are and accepts them as is. It softens us, opens us to each other in  ways that make us feel good–and better. Not in a cotton candy Lifetime TV way, but Love reminds us of the way things could be in a perfect world. It&#8217;s the Heaven on Earth deal.</p>
<p><strong>I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re &#8216;feeling heat after&#8217; your dance, you may want to see a doctor. Remember to exercise safety and precaution when you &#8216;dance&#8217; too. And may I say, <em>Good for you</em> if you know how you want to be treated and you carry yourself accordingly. This is the key. I find that accepting oneself first is a great aphrodisiac. It&#8217;s the oozing comfort and confidence in simply <em>being</em> that resonates warmth and accessibility in any situation. It&#8217;s wildly attractive and it rings out as clear as a dog whistle to likeminded mates who pick up on that signal.</p>
<p>Wherever you are in your romance life right now, I wish you lots of love and an equally amazing soundtrack.</p>

My thing is: love is an around-the-clock, unmufflered affair in that it's noisy and indelicate and unlike anything Hollywood would have us believe. Love works us, heals us, and tips us like gravy boats, allowing our best flow out to the ones closest to us. It's confusing, deeply soaring, and when it's real, it could give a damn about greeting cards, candy and pop songs.

The other day a frustrated friend texted me asking, HOW CAN I MAKE A MAN LIKE ME. To the extent that she was saying, All I want is a few good dates and not all of the mindgame-y aloof bs, she was kind of joking. And to the extent she was saying, What is wrong with me that I can't meet a guy who seems the least bit interested, she was absolutely not joking. My friend is representative of most women I know: she's smart, funny, loving, beautiful, super creative, one of a kind, kind and doubting how awesome she is. And that's what's upsetting.

To the scary parts in all of us, to those scabbed-over wounded pieces lodged so dee that we've long forgotten they're there, let me just say, You rock, you look fabulous, and the world is waiting for you to show us how it's done. I want to say, Come on out and do your thing. Because we need you. And this: The fact that you doubt yourself sometimes means you're normal. I mean, look what we're up against with all of the messages that want us to believe the lies about what we can become. Oh, and this too I want to say: The fact that you have enough self-awareness and humility to think you've got room to grow is exactly the thing that makes you perfect! That plus the fact that you've got a great ass.

My friend's question, again, representative of so many people's questions about the same thing, made me think about how rampant this idea of being unlovable is. I thought more about the messages we get that only serve to whack us in ads and magazines and songs. Pop songs. And bam, Whitney Houston.

Pop's First Lady of Song, The Original Queen of the Night, may have gone on too soon, but she left me a soundtrack that would play out in the backdrop of my love life in all of its joy and nonsense, ecstasy and depth, and I'd like to share a little bit of it–and the lessons offered up in the process.

I'm Saving All My Love for You
There's this idea that we store up all the love in side us for the one day when that special someone rides into our lives on a chariot of fire, or on a crack of lightning, to deliver us into forever land. (insert losing game show buzzer sound here) I'm of 2 minds on this: 1.) It's better to share the love you have now rather than later. Everyone is worthy of love, and when we give it, it just makes us better. Period. Doesn't if feel good to get it? Then give it and watch how it boomerangs on you in surprising corners of your life. Why wait for The One before you start loving and living like you mean it? 2.) If this is about celibacy, then, yeah, handle your business. And keep on loving from your heart while you're at it!

Why Does It Hurt So Bad
Coming off of the celibacy thing, I realize this could be misconstrued in its meaning, but we're talking about heart here, folks. So knock it off. Beat it, you smartasses. Seriously. Ever been in love with someone who was about as loving as a feral dog trapped in a corner, baring its teeth at you? This is the equivalent of a wounded lover we're trying to rescue. Only we can't see it when we're in love with is potential. Trust me, this scenario isn't good for either of you, so spare yourself some hurt by holding out for the love you deserve.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SmallPlantCutting.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1958" title="SmallPlantCutting, www.honeyehlpyourself.com" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SmallPlantCutting.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="423" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s this lady in my neighborhood. She started out pleasant enough, but I&#8217;ve since found her to be judgmental, fickle, overbearing, pushy, and loud. I&#8217;m not talking about me just yet. I&#8217;m talking about Sharon, the red headed sixty-something who chain smokes, suns her wig outdoors, and has a country twang that could hail from just about any notch on the Bible belt.</p>
<p><span id="more-1957"></span></p>
<p>Sharon is the eyes and nose of our neighborhood, and she has confirmed that she&#8217;s aware of what I&#8217;m doing, how I&#8217;m doing, where I&#8217;m doing it, and who I&#8217;m doing it with. My second floor bedroom window looks across the parking lot and faces her apartment. Sharon lives right across from me, which means I shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised back in August when she responded to my indoor gardening question by commenting on how much I left my windows open and the rate at which I came and went in my <em>cute little car that I bet must have cost a right pretty penny. Now what is it you </em>do<em> again, sweetheart?</em></p>
<p>One day I stopped in to her place because she wanted to give me a houseplant. She and I share a love of plants, and when she offered to give me one, I was happy to accept. When she handed me the old jelly jar with the cutting in it, I noticed the half empty vodka bottles on the counter. They were party-sized and they suddenly seemed to explain everything: why she talked a little loud sometimes and didn&#8217;t seem to be aware of it, why she set her bright red wig outside on her &#8216;beauty stand&#8217; whenever the weather was good and she wasn&#8217;t wearing it and why she couldn&#8217;t ever seem to hold the thread of a full conversation.</p>
<p>There was that time I invited her over to diagnose my sick ficus tree. I&#8217;d been struggling with it, trying every remedy I could think of, and if anybody knew what to do about it, it was Sharon. She had dozens in her apartment and as many crowding the patio table where she kept her wig and ashtray. It was probably four days out of seven that I&#8217;d seen her out front spraying her hanging plants, careful not to douse the burning end of her cigarette.</p>
<p>Sharon examined my my ailing plant with the attention of a doting mother to a feverish child. She suggested I follow her lead and fill a bottle with soapy water and spray the leaves. <em>That&#8217;ll kill any of them little $#%^! bugs on &#8216;em, darlin.</em> I asked her to repeat herself because I&#8217;d been so stunned at hearing her the first time around. Instead of referring to the pests as mealy bugs, Sharon used a gay slur and didn&#8217;t waste any time repeating it. I shot her a look. <em>Oh,</em> she said, waving me off, <em>my daughter tells me I all the time, she says, &#8216;Mama you shouldn&#8217;t be calling them bugs that,&#8217;</em> Sharon shrugged her shoulders. <em>I know, but that&#8217;s just what I always called em.</em></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t challenge Sharon on her language because I knew there was a whole lot more where that came from, and all I wanted was plant advice. Remember back when I said I was going to invite Boulder folks to my place for a <a title="Nuts ‘n’ Honey" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/06/19/nuts-n-honey/">cultural sensitivity meet-n-greet</a>? Let&#8217;s just say Sharon is on my list. When I turned toward the door to in an attempt to close our visit, Sharon turned toward me and asked if I was single. I told her I was. <em>So you&#8217;re in the market, sweetheart?</em> I nodded, adding that I hadn&#8217;t actively been seeking anybody but, yes, I nodded. I was available.</p>
<p>Sharon gave me the fish-eyed once over, no doubt sizing up my suitability for potential matches. I knew that look. She leaned in, placed her hand on my forearm and pressed, <em>&#8230;. for a man?</em> Yes I said. <em>Have you met Phil?</em> she asked.</p>
<p>According to Sharon, Phil was <em>more horizontal than vertical if you don&#8217;t mind fat.</em> But he owned his own house even if he&#8217;d been stuck with it because he never found a buyer. <em>I&#8217;ve seen him up in his window just playing that guitar for hours. He never goes </em>anywhere<em>. I&#8217;m going to introduce you.</em> I didn&#8217;t see much of her after that, and I can&#8217;t say I minded.</p>
<p>Then one day Sharon found herself a man of her own. He was barrel-chested, smoked a lot and didn&#8217;t say much. Let&#8217;s call him Dick.</p>
<p>By the time Dick had come around, even if it was for the sole purpose of trying to block my parking spot, Sharon had stopped sunning her wig outdoors, and never made another mention of Phil. I could have sworn I saw her duck into her apartment at least twice without the usual greeting when I pulled up.</p>
<p>It just so happens that I had begun dating around that time too. One day my man and I pulled up and saw Dick out front, sitting at Sharon&#8217;s table with a plastic cup clutched in his scaly, outsized paw. She must have stepped inside for something because there was another cup where her wig used to be.</p>
<p>My friend and I got out and said hi. Dick looked straight at us and said nothing. I figured maybe he was deaf and that accounted for his not speaking. I already knew he wasn&#8217;t blind because he&#8217;d seen his way clear enough to block my parking spot just fine in the past. I had my suspicions about his being dumb, but I won&#8217;t go there.</p>
<p>Once inside my place, I asked my friend if it had been my imagination, or did we just get dissed by Dick? My friend confirmed the latter.</p>
<p>Sharon&#8217;s beau reminded me of that man in the old battery commercials. He was the pseudo badass in the Members Only jacket who dared you to knock the thing off his shoulder. Dick was still wearing that jacket, and he was still carrying something on his shoulder too. From what I could tell, it looked like bitter resentment at passage of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>For weeks, I scoured my memory of Sharon for all of her off-color comments and offenses I&#8217;d  overlooked out of neighborly courtesy, or a touch of too much permissiveness, or, frankly, apathy on my part. Plus, I thought, Sharon might be just like the rest of us, only she had fewer social censors. &#8216;Just like the rest of us&#8217; meant she was allowed to have her own opinions and be awkward sometimes, frequently misunderstood, human, and therefore always seeking some kind of connection. But <em>this?</em> Had she become so pickled in her twilight that she could invite this knuckle-dragging behemoth into her life and shut down whatever she had left of a free-thinking mind?</p>
<p>Based on what little I&#8217;d seen of Dick, I suspected he went home at night to leaf through dogeared supremacist literature and Nazi paraphernalia and to chip away at the cross he was itching to burn on somebody&#8217;s lawn or semi-covered carport one day.</p>
<p>Two more months went by like that, without really seeing or talking to my neighbor, and without missing her either. I&#8217;ve talked about the <a title="Victims" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/11/04/victims/" target="_blank">usefulness of building cases against people</a>, and I go on about <a title="P.S. I Love You" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2012/01/17/p-s-i-love-you-2/" target="_blank">love and neighbors</a> and <a title="The Deacon’s Boot" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2012/01/11/the-deacons-boot/" target="_blank">trying to do right by others</a> in a whole bunch of other essays, but this was another thing. This time we&#8217;re talking about issues really <em>really</em> close to home. So it&#8217;s different. Right?</p>
<p>Before I got through with Sharon in my mind, I&#8217;d whittled her down to a drunk and witless, badly-aging Southern belle, who also happened to be a flaming bigot to anybody unlike her &#8230; and her Dick. I&#8217;m not proud of it, and we all know I know better. It&#8217;s the <em>doing</em> part, that&#8217;s the tricky bit.</p>
<p>It was two weeks into the new year and I hadn&#8217;t seen Sharon&#8217;s car move once. It snowed and thawed and snowed again, and nothing. Even her beauty stand and her ashtray were gone. Despite my judgments, I started to wonder if she was okay, then dismissed the thoughts as they came. Until the day I pulled up and saw her lights on. Finally.</p>
<p>I got out of my car and started toward her door, backed up and thought twice about it, figuring if she was dead, then it was a next of kin who had turned on the lights and was handling her business. No matter how I played the scenario out in my mind, it came down to not being one bit of my business. Except that it was, and I knew it. So I knocked.</p>
<p>Another neighbor was already inside and opened the door. Sharon was sprawled across the couch, ready for an evening out, it seemed, in full makeup, three-quarter length leggings and slouchy asymmetrical tunic. She waved me in like she was the queen of Colorado holding court in her living room. Sharon&#8217;s right index finger was wrapped in a fat bandage and despite the glitzy earrings that hung to her shoulders, I noticed she wasn&#8217;t wearing her wig. She looked frail.</p>
<p>I said I&#8217;d been concerned because I hadn&#8217;t seen her car move in weeks, and told her to call me if she needed anything. Sharon smiled and said she&#8217;d been in the hospital for the last ten days on anti-biotics after surgery to remove a blood clot that could have killed her. She told me about a pre-existing condition that was slowly attacking her nervous system and how she&#8217;d have to find something to do now that she&#8217;d given up smoking. She wondered aloud how she&#8217;d pay without insurance. But lucky for her, she said, they only had to amputate a part of her index finger where the clot was and she could live with that.</p>
<p>Sharon thanked me for coming by. <em>I don&#8217;t know why no one else came,</em> she said shaking her head to one side and the other. <em>I&#8217;m nice to everybody, but I just &#8230; I almost died &#8230; I just don&#8217;t know.</em></p>
<p>I felt the grip of my own resentment toward her loosen. It didn&#8217;t all disappear like magic, but it took a load off of itself, and opened up room enough to be grateful for the fullness of my own health and to be glad my small action comforted her–no matter what the other assumptions had been–because what mattered in that moment was something else entirely.</p>
<p>I left my number on her notepad and urged her to use it if she needed to. Sharon thanked me again and told me she loved me as I turned to go. As I wrote this post I thought about the love King and Ghandi and Mother Theresa and Jesus and all the great teachers talked about and emulated in their own lives. I thought of <a title="P.S. I Love You" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2012/01/17/p-s-i-love-you-2/" target="_blank">the old lay preacher</a> and everybody who&#8217;d ever said something similar: that the only thing worth holding on to—and giving—was love.</p>
<p>Now take a second to think about your own neighbors. See what I mean?</p>
<p>Marianne Williamson said: <em>In every community there is work to be done. In every nation, there are wounds to heal. In every heart there is the power to do it.</em> What if you could access this power and get busy where you live right now? When you do, <em>if</em> you do, may you feel yourself breaking past your confines of bias and into that place where there&#8217;s room enough to turn to your neighbors, tell them you love them too, and mean it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/MartinLutherKingJr.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="MartinLutherKingJr" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/MartinLutherKingJr.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>Two years ago I convinced myself to go to an MLK open mic night full of stringy-haired boomers and aspiring hippies who read, sang, and recited their way across the creaking platform stage of a tiny coffee bar on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado. I’m sure theirs wasn’t the only show in town, but the local paper said it was the closest. So I went. And while I could fill pages with a creative inventory of characters who passed through that night, there’s an unforgettable man who bears mentioning here: the old lay preacher. I don&#8217;t remember his name, but he looked like a shorter, frailer version of Gandalf, the gray-haired wizard from Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p><span id="more-1945"></span></p>
<p>I first noticed him shuffling through the café in a way that made me wonder if he’d lost something on the floor of the darkened room. When he took to the makeshift stage, he ad libbed for more than twenty minutes on the virtues of kindness and brotherly love in a way that evoked oratorical skill of King, and it made him seem much bigger and stronger than he appeared. His words roused my inner activist from sleep, that part of me that wanted nothing more than to leap from behind my wall of indifference and align with something truly revolutionary and <em>on purpose</em>. The preacher held our attention as he spoke, and peered out from behind his sawtooth bangs to invite us deeper into his story.</p>
<p><em>Uh oh.</em> I got the distinct feeling this man was about to launch the audience participation part of his act. It’s all well and good until they ask you to do something. <em>Here we go&#8230; </em>I thought<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Turn to your neighbor,</em> the old man said. And I did. <em>Now say, ‘Neighbor… .&#8217;&#8221;</em> I winced.</p>
<p><em>Neighbor&#8230;,</em> I said. It comforted me knowing that if things went poorly as a result of this impromptu social experiment, I could say <em>The preacher made me do it</em>. Usually I’m all too willing to make fun of myself for a good cause, but I was new to Boulder then, I didn&#8217;t know those people, it was a small room. But when you go out to a small place in a small town, and you plunk yourself down near the front, you should probably make room for things to happen. The upside of it was, my neighbor was handsome and friendly, and we’d already been flirting through the night. So, truth be told, I didn&#8217;t mind one bit turning to my neighbor. <em>Neighbor,</em> I said smiling.</p>
<p>We sat quietly, uncomfortably, looking at each other, grinning, nervous, waiting for everybody else to find and address their own neighbors. And then the old preacher gave us our next line, <em>I want you to look &#8216;em dead in the eye and say … &#8216;I love you.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>Say what?</p>
<p>We squirmed, and then, again, did as we were told. In that tight little space (yes, the room was contracting), we leaned in across the table to declare our love to each other—strangers!—and then to the entire bar full of people I&#8217;d probably never see again.  It was weird. I felt exposed; my face flushed hot; I liked it.</p>
<p>Years ago, a former meditation teacher approached me after seeing me at a school function. She hugged me and looked deep into my eyes and told me she loved me. I feel kind of dopey admitting it now, but the experience couldn’t have jarred me any more than if I&#8217;d been splashed in the face with salty ice water. I blinked and scanned for the proper response. She held me lovingly by my shoulders, and smiled. It was all I could do offer her a drippy squeak of a reply along the lines of, <em>Uh, thanks?</em></p>
<p>It was a full six months before I realized what had happened to me that day: my teacher had <em>seen</em> me. In what took all of a moment between us, she&#8217;d breezed right by everything I&#8217;d ever been taught or thought I knew about love or loving and voided my notion that love had to be earned or built over time, or was only to be shown when people were good and secure on all sides before we daring to share something so intimate. She gave me a gift that day, one that I turned over and chewed on until the light switch finally flipped: <em>I am lovable and worthy of love just because I </em>am! Whoa. I ran into her months later and gushed, <em>I finally get it!</em> I was giddy at my revelation. <em>And I love you, too!</em> I exclaimed. I wanted to tell her how profound her words had been, how they&#8217;d shown me how skewed my own notions of love and my receptivity to it were. I felt full; I wanted to beat my breast and burst into song. I cleared my throat. The teacher looked at me half-smiling and replied, <em>It took you this long, Kriste?</em></p>
<p>I see these moments with the teacher and the preacher as the <em>Namaste</em> principle at work: it the grace that floats in when the divine or higher part of ourselves recognizes or bows to the divine in others. It&#8217;s bigger than just <em>us</em> and it&#8217;s this guiding force that serves as the foundation for what leaders like Ghandi and King exemplified in their lifetimes and teach us still. They staked their lives on it and derived great power from it. They gave this gift to the people, <em>all</em> people, despite the resistance from their many adversaries. And with it, they changed the world. It&#8217;s loving the neighbors we don&#8217;t know—and the people we do know but don&#8217;t care much for—in equal measure. Including our enemies. Oh, <em>especially</em> the enemies.</p>
<p>I remember being super pissed off after an exchange with someone once. We were going rounds in a ridiculous power struggle and wore ourselves out sparring and sniping back and forth for days. I told my girlfriend Jewel about it, and anybody else who&#8217;d listen, snorting and fuming at all the ways I&#8217;d been wronged. Jewel heard me out and then told me to send that person love. <em>You&#8217;ve got to send &#8216;em love,</em> she said. She was so serene when she said it. I wanted to throttle her. I wanted to spit. I lost it. <em>Here we go again,</em> I grumbled. <em>What the </em>hell<em> is with these people trying to make me love and be happy and sing My Little Pony unicorn rainbow songs when they don&#8217;t get it?</em> <em>I am pissed off and I want me some justice!</em> The kicker was that each of these people: the preacher, the teacher, King and my friend were dead serious about invoking love as the elixir and<em> I</em> was the one who didn&#8217;t get it. At the time, I was like, <em>Fine. I&#8217;ll be over here, stewing in my juice, mounting my defense, while y&#8217;all twist your beads, grow your hair, and burn your incense—whatever.</em></p>
<p>And then, the miracle: I started to get it. Like drops from a leaky faucet over a dry sponge, one by one, my teachers (including the enemy) and the lessons they brought landed somewhere in my mind and eventually saturated my thinking. Eureka! Dr. King said: <em>I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.</em> I feel the truth of his words because he&#8217;s reminding me that to love each other is a conscious moment-by-moment decision that&#8217;s often difficult to get behind—but it&#8217;s always imperative. To me, this is what love is: it&#8217;s the real deal, the uncut stuff that breaks new ground, plants the seeds, feeds the people, and changes nations from the inside out. Hey, neighbor, break me off a piece of that, would you?</p>

		<itunes:summary>Two years ago I convinced myself to go to an MLK open mic night full of stringy-haired boomers and aspiring hippies who read, sang, and recited their way across the creaking platform stage of a tiny coffee bar on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado. I’m sure theirs wasn’t the only show in town, but the local paper said it was the closest. So I went. And while I could fill pages with a creative inventory of characters who passed through that night, there’s an unforgettable man who bears mentioning here: the old lay preacher. I don't remember his name, but he looked like a shorter, frailer version of Gandalf, the gray-haired wizard from Lord of the Rings.



I first noticed him shuffling through the café in a way that made me wonder if he’d lost something on the floor of the darkened room. When he took to the makeshift stage, he ad libbed for more than twenty minutes on the virtues of kindness and brotherly love in a way that evoked oratorical skill of King, and it made him seem much bigger and stronger than he appeared. His words roused my inner activist from sleep, that part of me that wanted nothing more than to leap from behind my wall of indifference and align with something truly revolutionary and on purpose. The preacher held our attention as he spoke, and peered out from behind his sawtooth bangs to invite us deeper into his story.

Uh oh. I got the distinct feeling this man was about to launch the audience participation part of his act. It’s all well and good until they ask you to do something. Here we go... I thought.

Turn to your neighbor, the old man said. And I did. Now say, ‘Neighbor… .'" I winced.

Neighbor..., I said. It comforted me knowing that if things went poorly as a result of this impromptu social experiment, I could say The preacher made me do it. Usually I’m all too willing to make fun of myself for a good cause, but I was new to Boulder then, I didn't know those people, it was a small room. But when you go out to a small place in a small town, and you plunk yourself down near the front, you should probably make room for things to happen. The upside of it was, my neighbor was handsome and friendly, and we’d already been flirting through the night. So, truth be told, I didn't mind one bit turning to my neighbor. Neighbor, I said smiling.

We sat quietly, uncomfortably, looking at each other, grinning, nervous, waiting for everybody else to find and address their own neighbors. And then the old preacher gave us our next line, I want you to look 'em dead in the eye and say … 'I love you.'

Say what?

We squirmed, and then, again, did as we were told. In that tight little space (yes, the room was contracting), we leaned in across the table to declare our love to each other—strangers!—and then to the entire bar full of people I'd probably never see again.  It was weird. I felt exposed; my face flushed hot; I liked it.

Years ago, a former meditation teacher approached me after seeing me at a school function. She hugged me and looked deep into my eyes and told me she loved me. I feel kind of dopey admitting it now, but the experience couldn’t have jarred me any more than if I'd been splashed in the face with salty ice water. I blinked and scanned for the proper response. She held me lovingly by my shoulders, and smiled. It was all I could do offer her a drippy squeak of a reply along the lines of, Uh, thanks?

<p>The woman looked left and said: the day is a bird in the bush, easy to tease it into my hand. She hiked her skirt higher and crouched down low.</p>

<p>The woman looked in and said: the day is no measure of time, for I am timeless. And she breathed deeply.</p>
<p>The woman looked out and said: the day is a mystery I may never know. And she sighed hard.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DeaconsBoot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1913" title="The Deacon's Boot" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DeaconsBoot.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>This piece was supposed to be different. But this piece is what we get on account of a ghost wandered in and hijacked my story. By the time he finished with me, I forgot all about that thing I started out with. That&#8217;s exactly how it went. Almost.</p>
<p>Bro Druitt—also affectionately called Deacon Eddie—had a gimp leg, a club foot, and an incomparable way with words. Every Sunday he graced the front pew of our tiny southern church in his nut brown pants and broad-shouldered green jacket the color of olives, though it wasn&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call olive green. I couldn&#8217;t have been more than 9 when I knew him, if you could call my young impressions &#8216;knowing&#8217; him, but I remember the Deacon, a narrow-faced, mild kind of man, a gentle stalwart in the Christian army, always seeing to it that no one went wanting for a warm smile or a solid handshake if there was anything he had to say about it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1912"></span></p>
<p>Bro Druitt was a shy, consistent man, I think. He didn&#8217;t much talk to me, and I often wondered what might have been playing behind the squared black frames of his old bifocals when he glanced up toward the far corner each time the choir sang. I wondered what his foot looked like. Was it clenched like a fist in his black leather boot? Had his boot been wadded up with cotton to pad the space left by his disfigured appendage? I wondered what it must have been like for him as a kid in his neighborhood where, if his experience looked remotely like mine, his friends ran and jumped and hollered to the heavens as they tore through the neighborhood, seldom looking back and rarely looking out for the slow and weak ones among us.</p>
<p>I wondered whether the Deacon had ever married or dated with that intention in mind. I imagined what his teachers and parents might have told him about his chances in a Jim Crow world that proved to be far less kind than they&#8217;d been at home. What kind of dreams had he been given and which ones did he pick for himself? Was it his own flood of memory wafting in on the songs each week that caused him to cry softly to himself when he led the church in prayer?</p>
<p><em>Lord</em>, he&#8217;d begin, with a weary resignation, his eyes intent on something just above our heads. Leaning against a table that itself had a short leg too, Bro Druitt finally closed his eyes as he addressed the church–and the Heavenly Father–in his singular style of modest supplication. <em>I come before you as &#8216;umbly as I know how, without no form nor fashion and we thank you for bringing us heart to heart and breast to breast one more time.</em> I mulled over the image of the congregation all ringed together in a band of touching breasts and hearts like a giant Siamese-twin fellowship. I giggled, playing out the scene in my head, wondering who I&#8217;d get to stand next to, and how we&#8217;d change clothes, not to mention how we&#8217;d sleep and eat. Maybe, I reasoned, heavenly bodies fused so impossibly close together like that didn&#8217;t worry about earthly details.<em> </em></p>
<p><em>We thank you, O Lord, for waking us up from our sleeping couches, clothed in our right minds this morning,</em> the Deacon prayed on, <em>knowing had it not been for You, our Father, we could have woke up on the cooling board</em>. For as colorful has his language was, Bro Druitt&#8217;s gratitude for his <em>portion of health and strength</em> was unmistakable: this man was glad to be alive, and he seemed pleased to remind us of it.</p>
<p>Thomas Campbell was an 18th century traveling clergyman and writer who once said that <em>to live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.</em> Bro Druitt showed me this in the loving imprint I&#8217;d barely realized he left on my life. I thought about what impressions I might leave when I&#8217;m gone, and more important, how am I doing now?</p>
<p>We may never understand how we&#8217;re seen, if we&#8217;re seen at all, in the eyes of others—a child, a stranger, our families. Even so, it might do us good to think about how we&#8217;d like to be remembered in time. I used to cringe thinking of Chandra and Syreeta, the sweet-hearted neighborhood girls I used to babysit. Those girls ratted me out to their mom early one November, told her rightly that I&#8217;d been skimming from the tops of their fresh Halloween candy. I was wrong, maybe, but I was a tweenager then, and being obnoxious is one thing tweeners do well. I don&#8217;t like it that Ms. Denson may have forever filed me in her mental waste category the day she banned me from class for defying her no-food rule (in an unrelated incident).</p>
<p>The other side of this is I know I have people who are glad I&#8217;m in the world, who will remember a kind thing I said or did to them without my realizing it. Thats stuff&#8217;s the gravy. Yet I can&#8217;t control those impressions either. But what I can do is what lies at the soul of this entry.</p>
<p>If I <em>intend</em> toward treating people well, if I know that at the end of the day—and not just on Sundays, at Christmas, or when I think I&#8217;m at last on my way out of this world—if I can rest easy knowing I did my best by somebody, if maybe my word or deed teased this person or that one out from behind a mound of fear, or maybe put a little puff in the sail of somebody&#8217;s dream and helped them brave the headwinds a few minutes more, then, good.</p>
<p>And not just at the end of the day. How about if we go one better and another and another, until we get right down to the moment—and down to doing our best to <em>be</em> our best any time of the day. Not to be fooled, sometimes being my best means keeping my mouth shut when I&#8217;d rather lay waste to an ass. Other times my best might mean jumping into the fire only to realize when I&#8217;m up to my eyeballs that I burned my rule book back in &#8217;92.</p>
<p>Whenever I call my friend Anthony to bounce ideas off him or to question whether I&#8217;ve done enough, worked hard or long enough, if I got it right this time, he reminds me that doing my best is the best I can do. Granted, he takes three words where I take a thousand to say the same thing: <em>Do your best</em>. I might have arrived at this point a lot sooner had I been paying closer attention. Guess I needed that kick from the deacon&#8217;s boot to finally get me here.</p>

For as colorful has his language was, Bro Druitt's gratitude for his portion of health and strength was unmistakable: this man was glad to be alive, and he seemed pleased to remind us of it.

Thomas Campbell was an 18th century traveling clergyman and writer who once said that to live in hearts we leave behind is not to die. Bro Druitt showed me this in the loving imprint I'd barely realized he left on my life. I thought about what impressions I might leave when I'm gone, and more important, how am I doing now?

We may never understand how we're seen, if we're seen at all, in the eyes of others—a child, a stranger, our families. Even so, it might do us good to think about how we'd like to be remembered in time. I used to cringe thinking of Chandra and Syreeta, the sweet-hearted neighborhood girls I used to babysit.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/carpe-diem.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1869" title="carpe diem" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/carpe-diem.jpg" alt="" width="316" height="380" /></a>The time is ripe for a revolt. I&#8217;m talking, like, raining down change more swift than the Arab Spring and the autumnal fall of dictators a world away. I&#8217;m talking more peace-inducing than flower power, greater than Beyoncé&#8217;s baby and Demi&#8217;s pending divorce. This is huge. And it&#8217;s not a movement for <em>those</em> people <em>over there</em>, whether it&#8217;s on the other side of the world or across your street. This is insurgence at its best, an unmitigated mutiny of the highest order, and your presence is required.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about YOU stirring up some change right now in the comfort of your own home, for no money down. It won&#8217;t cost you anything but your lethargy and defeat. What you&#8217;ll stand to gain in return for staging your own revolt is its own reward: it&#8217;s the gift of taking your place in the struggle against mediocrity, boredom, cluelessness and your same old stuff. It&#8217;s simple, really, this revolutionary action plan of mine. I call it Showing Up.</p>
<p><span id="more-1864"></span></p>
<p>As I wrote this post, women of all ages and abilities were taking to the streets of Egypt telling their leaders – and the world – Enough. We&#8217;re through fueling your machine that only serves to bulldoze and trample us. We will make ourselves visible; we&#8217;ll tell the world we&#8217;re here and we will keep speaking out. As they marched, they called women out of their homes and down from balconies to add their voices to the outcry. They wanted to create some serious change so they Showed Up.</p>
<p>Just down my street, and at a great many city centers throughout the United States, frustrated citizens have pitched a great many fits – and tents – in an act of solidarity with their ideological comrades-in-arms to tell leadership, <em>We&#8217;re tired of your stalled, go-nowhere government and, guess what, we&#8217;re not going anywhere, either.</em> There&#8217;s a rash of uprising that has broken out in similar fashion around the world and average citizens are decrying widespread corruption as commonplace, they&#8217;re calling for an end to blanket defaults on promises, if not platitudes, made by power brokers in more prosperous times. In one collective global gesture, people everywhere are disrupting bad business as usual by Showing Up.</p>
<p>In other areas of the Year In Revolt and breakaway from the everyday, three extraordinary women were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of &#8220;their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women’s rights to full participation in peace-building work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Journalist, politician, and human rights activist Tawakel Karman led protests for freedom of the press during uprisings in Yemen. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is that Liberia&#8217;s first female leader and the first woman president in all of Africa. She&#8217;s scored unprecedented reforms in debt relief and post-conflict reconciliation. Leymah Gbowee, also Liberian, is a civil rights activist, whose coalition of Muslim and Christian women staging sit-ins, prayer vigils, and appeals to rebels to sign a peace deal ultimately brought an end to their fighting. These women saw a need and assumed responsibility for their futures by Showing Up.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way a single post could do justice to even a handful of the revolutions and revolutionaries that rocked our worlds this year, but I touch on them because they illustrate my point that change is indeed happening all around us at every moment and, lest we be left feeling left out of the sweeping shifts in going on around the globe, I&#8217;d also like to point out that changes are also happening to us, whether or not we participate in them consciously.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to shift and shape the landscape of your life in the New Year, I&#8217;d like to propose a few ways to help you make it happen—and I mean, starting now. Going in, you should know that your personal revolution won&#8217;t require any travel. Scratch that: your revolt may demand that you take the metaphorical path less traveled or that you blaze a new trail altogether. And while your revolution may not necessarily call for any official training and won&#8217;t cost you a dime, you will be called upon to pay close attention to your behavior and to exercise, strengthen, and develop your powers of discernment and choice on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to guarantee you won&#8217;t come to any bodily harm once you start shaking things up, but that depends on how you carry out my forthcoming proposition. I cannot be held responsible if you experience some gentle bruising when random admirers start bear hugging you, high-fiving and hoisting you up on their shoulders, singing your praises, chanting your name in the streets. I might feel bad if your ears ring for the next few months as fans fawn and coo at the waves of change you&#8217;re instigating, but so it goes. I don&#8217;t have to tell you there&#8217;s the certainty of cold shoulders and occasional crickets that will surface as you revolt against the tyranny of inertia and low expectations because naysayers are to be expected when shift happens. Alas, they are the norm. But the presumption here, dear reader, is that you are anything but normal.</p>
<p>In the spirit of genuine revolution and Showing Up, I&#8217;d like to offer you:</p>
<p><strong>10 tactics to change the world from where you are. Right now. Today. Beginning of story.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. GIVE UP.</strong> Let go of your old notions of how things should be. You know that saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t should on yourself?&#8221; Yeah, taking on guilt and pressure for what&#8217;s not yours to manage siphons your creativity and gets you nowhere. Forget about trying to control other folks&#8217; behavior and outcomes that don&#8217;t concern you. Let them have their own lessons and get busy figuring out how best to mind your business. Remember that they may be trying to create some change of their own, so give them room! You&#8217;ll be doing them and you a favor in the end. Plus, you&#8217;ll be surprised at how much time you&#8217;ve freed up for ticking things off your list instead of ticking people off around you.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOLD ON.</strong> Put another way, don&#8217;t abandon what you want. And if you&#8217;re letting other people trick you into thinking your dreams are dumb, knock it off. And, worse yet, if you try to get other people to tell you your dreams don&#8217;t count, like in <a title="Reflections" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/02/11/reflections/"><strong>this example</strong></a>, then you and I will officially have a problem. If you want to be or do something, figure out how you can Show Up in big and small ways to create that change. Right now. Want to write? Then write (soon as you finish reading this, of course). Want to run? Run. Start by walking and take it from there. Want to save? Then save. And keep at it. Consistency is one of the greatest gifts you can give to the realization of your dream. Inspiration is often the fuel, occasionally rides shotgun, and can even feel like it&#8217;s D.O.A. some days, so it&#8217;s better to know that from the start. Do what you can in whatever measure you can; it all adds up. There&#8217;s no way around putting in the work to get where you want to go (#8). The upside? There&#8217;s no sweeter reward than feasting on the fruits of your own labor (#7).</p>
<p><strong>3. FLIP SCRIPTS.</strong> Another great way to revolutionize your life is to change your perspective. Got a nagging problem that seems to be blocking you at every turn? Try looking at it with fresh eyes. Imagine your creative block(s) as a person; ask it/him/her what it wants from you. Sometimes what look like our greatest obstacles contain our greatest stepping stones, not to mention answers and epiphanies. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve issues with someone. Rather than relying on the defense of a sharp tongue or cold shoulder, try putting yourself in that person&#8217;s shoes. Try to understand how miscommunication, hurt feelings or their own old beliefs and esteem might account for the friction. Give yourself permission to disagree or even dislike it and then let it go (#1). And don&#8217;t stop there. If you can&#8217;t come to peace with that person or issue in that moment, at least give yourself credit for responding in a new way. Be mindful of the boomerang effect and send love along with everything you do. Then watch how it ripples into your own revolutionized life!</p>
<p><strong>4. LOOK ALIVE.</strong> There&#8217;s no such thing as a narcoleptic revolutionary. Meaning, when&#8217;s the last time you saw a freedom fighter asleep on the front lines? When you Show Up to your life, it means you&#8217;re paying attention to the world around you in a new way. What kind of language do you use in your conversations? What roles are you playing in your relationships? How are your actions reflecting or projecting the real you? How much are you &#8216;putting up&#8217; with simply because you want to &#8216;keep&#8217; the peace? Here&#8217;s a hint: You&#8217;re not experiencing any real peace if you&#8217;re withholding your feelings because you fear someone&#8217;s possible response.</p>
<p><strong>5. KEEP QUIET.</strong> Truth: you can&#8217;t tell everybody what you&#8217;re up to all the time. As a self-confessed <em>semi-full-disclosurist</em>, I tend to talk too much. And when I do, I find the energy I&#8217;ve expended in all my telling and sharing and &#8216;splaining runs the risk of dissipating the energy I could be applying to moving my plans forward in a real, measurable way while staying on track with my goals. It takes focus and a commitment to own your own agenda and to cultivate it, away from the heavy winds of doubt, the backdraft of blowhards, and the burning glare of stink eyes and unsolicited opinion. So the next time you feel the urge to tell all, hush up for a minute and ask yourself what&#8217;s the truest and best use of your time in that moment.</p>
<p><strong>6. SPEAK UP.</strong> I&#8217;ve covered this territory in a <strong><a title="Small Talk" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/12/16/small-talk/">previous entry</a></strong>, but even if this was the only topic I ever wrote about for the rest of my days, I could never come close to wearing out the value of finding, hearing, and following your own voice. There&#8217;s a difference between keeping quiet and being silenced, and you won&#8217;t know which mode you&#8217;re in unless you&#8217;re looking alive in the moment (#4) and considering the situation from a new angle (#3) and resisting the urge or habit of judging others for how they respond to you (#1). You&#8217;ve also got to be willing to trust your own heart enough to know have to believe in YOU and to go in the direction of your calling (#2). Whether or not you use your words to speak up for yourself — because it&#8217;s our energy and actions that do all the talking, in case you didn&#8217;t already know — keep in mind that when you&#8217;re truly focused on what you want — when you&#8217;re really minding your business, you have seriously Shown Up and that message rings out loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>7. GO EASY</strong>. For all this talk of Showing Up and outward revolutionizing, I have to include this interior piece in the process: easy does it. I can personally point you to lots of my own false starts dropped balls littering the roadside of my revolutionary, evolutionary path, like <strong><a title="Spare Some Change?" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2010/03/05/spare-some-change/">here</a></strong>, <strong><a title="Seeds of…Change?" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2010/04/22/seeds-of-change/">here</a></strong>, and <strong><a title="Ruts" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2010/05/30/in-a-rut/">here</a></strong> for starters, but even when we fumble, we have to keep in mind that the game goes on, that we&#8217;re not in it to be perfect, but to be engaged. Take time to give yourself credit for venturing beyond your comfort zone and realize that every conscious step (#4) taken toward your goal is a Victory. I&#8217;ve touched on this <a title="I won! I won!" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2010/03/24/i-won-i-won/"><strong>here</strong></a> and it was a super reminder that no matter where I find myself on my personal timeline, I&#8217;m right where I need to be. And knowing that is a gift in and of itself.</p>
<p><strong>8. PLAY HARD.</strong> When you&#8217;re going for the gold of your goals, you&#8217;ve got to make sure it&#8217;s a long-term game. I&#8217;m talking even longer than baseball. There&#8217;s no way around it; the overnight discovery and fantasy of &#8216;making it&#8217; takes years of work. In his thought-provoking book on genius, game changers and trailblazers, Outliers, my man Malcolm Gladwell tells us through a series of painstaking research, interviews, and personal history that overnight success takes about 10,000 hours. That breaks down to 416.6666667 days, not including breaks for cyberjiving, sleep or showering. That&#8217;s full on 24/7. So when you spread those hours out into a real-life timeline, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s doable, and it&#8217;s going to require your best efforts. So hunker down and get your mind and behind in the game, that is, if you&#8217;re playing to win. And by winning, I could have easily said self-actualizing or following through or believing in yourself. I just use that term because I&#8217;m fond of an occasional sports analogy like keeping eyes on balls, leaving things on fields, going long, and all those other gamey go-get-&#8217;em-isms.</p>
<p><strong>9. FAIL BETTER.</strong> Mahatma Gandhi once said, “My imperfections and failures are as much a blessing from God as my successes and my talents and I lay them both at his feet.” I often talk about having gratitude for everything, like <strong><a title="Thanks" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2010/11/26/thanks/">here</a></strong>, and I like what he said because it reminds us there might just be a greater plan, like <a title="Origins" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/04/18/origins/"><strong>here</strong></a>, that we&#8217;re all a part of, no matter how worthy or not we perceive ourselves to be. If and when we can wrap our minds around the fact that love in action and humility are powerful allies in the Revolt, and that success and failure are two sides of the same coin, then we become unstoppable. As an individual who Showed Up, told his truth to the establishment and mobilized a movement that rippled around the world, Gandhi is a revolutionary whose life reminds us it&#8217;s ALL good (#3) and plainly lays out what we&#8217;re capable of when we Show Up: we can fail a little bit better every time we try.</p>
<p><strong>10. REPEAT 1-9.</strong> Of course I could go on about how to Show Up and change your life and the world from the inside out, but I hope you get my point(s). Besides, I&#8217;ve got my own work to do. Now let&#8217;s get busy giving up, leaving folks alone, keeping quiet, going easy, failing, letting go, and having a truly revolting 2012!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SmallTalk.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1840" title="SmallTalk" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SmallTalk.jpg" alt="Young girl being scolded." width="409" height="293" /></a></p>
<p>There are two types of Small Talk: Type I and II. Type I is the wordy filler, a politely pointless attempt to ignite conversation between strangers in checkout lines and elevators, at post offices, motor vehicle places, beauty shops, and random reception areas. It&#8217;s the chitchat while-u-wait. Most often run along the lines of a neutral back-and-forth about the weather, celebrity foibles, politics or last night&#8217;s game. Never intending to go anywhere or mean anything, Type I Small Talk is idle.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Type II. Unlike the harmless annoyance and time suck of the first kind, Type II is lethal and spreads like the pox if allowed to go unchecked. It&#8217;s a lethal, persistent disorder handed down to us as plentiful sweet nothings intent on numbing our initiative, dumbing us down, and lulling our ambition to sail beyond familial shores.</p>
<p><span id="more-1836"></span></p>
<p>Type II is the gentle bitchslap of Cousin Betty&#8217;s velvet glove when she remarks on your <em>creativity</em> with lines like <em>You know</em> we <em>don&#8217;t do that</em> or <em>What&#8217;s that little thing you were involved in?</em> And <em>I remember when you used to be so cute/slim/pretty/smart/popular</em> while you wrack your brain trying to recall a time when they ever said as much<em>. </em>It&#8217;s the off-color comments lobbed across the holiday table by Uncle Fred&#8217;s <em>Are you still taking up with that little (not-your-race, not-your-age, maybe-your-same-gender) person&#8230; ?</em> Type II is insidious because, like Type I, it&#8217;s not supposed to mean anything or go anywhere, and therefore, you&#8217;re not supposed to address it nor take offense when the hits keep coming.</p>
<p>This type of small talk collects in the system and diminishes our desire to dream and do. It starts early with an implicit agreement go along with The Program at the expense of what you know, knowing somewhere inside you that there <em>will</em> be consequences to eating your heart out. This is going to burn. In time, Type II quiets your capacity to fend off the syrupy influx of buzz kills, insults, and deliberate blocks to your progress.</p>
<p>Years in, you&#8217;ll forget how it happened, this chronic fatigue and bloat. When you suffer from Type II, you&#8217;ll find yourself asking yourself questions like <em>Is this my life? </em>and<em> How did I get here?</em> Well, honey, you&#8217;re the only one who can answer that properly, but what I can do, just because it&#8217;s Christmas–is regale you with the following holiday tale.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas four days before Christmas when all through my loft,<br />
I was feeling quite shitty and riddled with coughs.</p>
<p>So I called a good friend who said, Don&#8217;t worry, my dear,<br />
I&#8217;ll cook us a dinner and share Christmas cheer.<br />
The days came and went without a phone call,<br />
when I feared for the worst: alone after all.<br />
(I was new in town and barely knew anybody at that point.)</p>
<p>So I drummed up my courage and cleared my throat with <em>Ahem</em>,<br />
&#8217;cause I&#8217;d been sick and stuffed up with phlegm, remember?<br />
I picked up the phone and dialed my friend,<br />
knowing inside me it might mean the end.</p>
<p><em>Hey friend</em>, I said, doing my best to stay articulate.<br />
It was a tough thing to do, with my throaty particulate. And jitters.<br />
<em>Hey there</em>, she replied,<em> what&#8217;s up with you?</em><br />
<em>Not much, I said, just wondering about that meal?</em><br />
And then there was silence, I&#8217;m talking silence for <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>After the crickets, she offered me this:<br />
<em>I chose to leave town rather than stay through Christmas.</em><br />
<em> But what of our plans?</em> I asked with a start.<br />
<em>What about &#8216;em?</em> she said with an absence of heart.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I knew Type II was at play:<br />
I was supposed to keep silent, not challenge her say.<br />
The feeling was old, snaking back to my past,<br />
I was queasy and weak, wanting to end the call fast.</p>
<p>But I trusted my gut, and wasn&#8217;t going out like that,<br />
Like I should sweep my hurt feelings under the mat. Again.<br />
Hell no, honey!</p>
<p><em>We made plans and you never looked back</em><br />
<em> Well I changed my mind and decided to pack</em><br />
<em> I went to be with my family this time</em><br />
<em> Yeah, but you left me hanging without reason or rhyme</em></p>
<p>For thirty minutes or more, we went round and round<br />
She kept small talking while I held my ground.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tricky trying to break Type II habits because their roots go deep. Most of the time it&#8217;s easier–and always expected–to keep quiet and not ask for consideration, accountability, sincerity from the people we love. Especially when we&#8217;re used to being shunted to back burners and low-priority lists of our own making. But here&#8217;s the thing: indulging in Type II behavior–and managing the chronic pain that comes with–it isn&#8217;t healthy for anybody.</p>
<p>I often talk about the resistance that kicks in whenever we move in new directions and away from business as usual. I touch on this in my <a title="Passages" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/08/30/passages/">Passages</a> post and <a title="Who do you think you are?" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/04/17/who-do-you-think-you-are-2/">Who Do You Think You Are</a> and <a title="Origins" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/04/18/origins/">Origins</a>, too. Honoring yourself by refusing to participate in your own dismissal is no different. FYI, I went crazy on this in my <a title="Reflections" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/02/11/reflections/">Reflections</a> post. Check &#8216;em out.</p>
<p>Permission to follow your own road makes you take yourself seriously and to be accountable to YOU above all others. Once you get going, it might feel like you&#8217;re on an uphill crusade to piss people off. But you&#8217;ll be the better for it—for showing up for yourself and choosing healthy habits over the rusty old traps laid out in the family pattern.</p>
<p>In the end, my friend and I were able to talk through to the difficult stuff we&#8217;d been ignoring in our shallow conversation. It didn&#8217;t feel like it at the time, but diving beneath the surface of our Small Talk showed me there are a great many gifts to be had by admitting our feelings and acknowledging we all have needs and expectations that count.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s resume our holiday programming, shall we?</p>
<p>This holiday season, when you&#8217;re faced with a choice,<br />
don&#8217;t quiet, disable, or hush your own voice<br />
Be kind as you can while you let your peeps know<br />
that Small Talk is no longer running your show</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got things to do and dreams to live out<br />
And playing small ain&#8217;t what it&#8217;s about<br />
When they start to balk as you assert your sweet voice<br />
Remind them that living well is a matter of choice.</p>

		<itunes:summary>There are two types of Small Talk: Type I and II. Type I is the wordy filler, a politely pointless attempt to ignite conversation between strangers in checkout lines and elevators, at post offices, motor vehicle places, beauty shops, and random reception areas. It's the chitchat while-u-wait. Most often run along the lines of a neutral back-and-forth about the weather, celebrity foibles, politics or last night's game. Never intending to go anywhere or mean anything, Type I Small Talk is idle.

Then there's Type II. Unlike the harmless annoyance and time suck of the first kind, Type II is lethal and spreads like the pox if allowed to go unchecked. It's a lethal, persistent disorder handed down to us as plentiful sweet nothings intent on numbing our initiative, dumbing us down, and lulling our ambition to sail beyond familial shores.



Type II is the gentle bitchslap of Cousin Betty's velvet glove when she remarks on your creativity with lines like You know we don't do that or What's that little thing you were involved in? And I remember when you used to be so cute/slim/pretty/smart/popular while you wrack your brain trying to recall a time when they ever said as much. It's the off-color comments lobbed across the holiday table by Uncle Fred's Are you still taking up with that little (not-your-race, not-your-age, maybe-your-same-gender) person... ? Type II is insidious because, like Type I, it's not supposed to mean anything or go anywhere, and therefore, you're not supposed to address it nor take offense when the hits keep coming.

This type of small talk collects in the system and diminishes our desire to dream and do. It starts early with an implicit agreement go along with The Program at the expense of what you know, knowing somewhere inside you that there will be consequences to eating your heart out. This is going to burn. In time, Type II quiets your capacity to fend off the syrupy influx of buzz kills, insults, and deliberate blocks to your progress.

Years in, you'll forget how it happened, this chronic fatigue and bloat. When you suffer from Type II, you'll find yourself asking yourself questions like Is this my life? and How did I get here? Well, honey, you're the only one who can answer that properly, but what I can do, just because it's Christmas–is regale you with the following holiday tale.

'Twas four days before Christmas when all through my loft,
I was feeling quite shitty and riddled with coughs.

So I called a good friend who said, Don't worry, my dear,
I'll cook us a dinner and share Christmas cheer.
The days came and went without a phone call,
when I feared for the worst: alone after all.
(I was new in town and barely knew anybody at that point.)

So I drummed up my courage and cleared my throat with Ahem,
'cause I'd been sick and stuffed up with phlegm, remember?
I picked up the phone and dialed my friend,
knowing inside me it might mean the end.

Hey friend, I said, doing my best to stay articulate.
It was a tough thing to do, with my throaty particulate. And jitters.
Hey there, she replied, what's up with you?
Not much, I said, just wondering about that meal?
And then there was silence, I'm talking silence for real.

After the crickets, she offered me this:
I chose to leave town rather than stay through Christmas.
 But what of our plans? I asked with a start.
What about 'em? she said with an absence of heart.

Here's how I knew Type II was at play:
I was supposed to keep silent, not challenge her say.
The feeling was old, snaking back to my past,
I was queasy and weak, wanting to end the call fast.

But I trusted my gut, and wasn't going out like that,
Like I should sweep my hurt feelings under the mat. Again.
Hell no, honey!

We made plans and you never looked back
 Well I changed my mind and decided to pack
 I went to be with my family this time
 Yeah, but you left me hanging without reason or rhyme

<p>For all my positive talk, I have my issues with affirmations on precisely that point: they&#8217;re all talk. There was this guy once—Eddie. Even if you pressed me, I couldn&#8217;t tell you exactly how I found him, and I have no idea how to locate him now; it was a totally random web crawl. Eddie had an internet show devoted to affirmations and each week he&#8217;d spend about ten minutes going over a handful of handpicked one-liners based on a chosen theme for the next seven days. His platform was simple and straightforward: <em>Hi, I&#8217;m Eddie and here are today&#8217;s affirmations. They&#8217;re blah, blah </em>and<em> blah.</em> Then he&#8217;d do about fifteen repetitions and sign off with something like, <em>Okay, I&#8217;ll see you next week.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-1788"></span></p>
<p>For a few weeks I tuned in regularly and became fascinated with Eddie, not fascinated by what he was saying so much, but it was his delivery. I don&#8217;t know if it was intentional, but Eddie&#8217;s voice was a solid cross between the flat intonation of the eyedrops guy—you know, Clear Eyes—and the Dunkin man from back in the day. Remember him? He&#8217;d get out of bed, shuffle off to work each morning moaning, <em>Time to make the donuts.</em> That&#8217;s what hooked me—I couldn&#8217;t tell if Eddie was joking. But, he must have been doing something right because I was right there with him each week for a month—right up until he dropped the whole project.</p>
<p>In as few words as possible, Eddie returned several weeks later and said that repeating all of those positive messages over and over had begun to bring stuff up for him that he didn&#8217;t like and that made him see he needed to step away from it all while he <em>dealt with it</em> and made sense of what was happening to him. I wish he&#8217;d have called me because I have a few ideas about what he was experiencing.</p>
<p>I liken Eddie&#8217;s situation to spring cleaning. In the beginning it&#8217;s the innocuous anticipation of the new season, affirmations are. <em>This time it&#8217;s going to be positive, fresh, revitalized and vibrant,</em> we say. And so it&#8217;s only right that we get all frothy and lightheaded about the new season of potential. We&#8217;re going to rearrange the furniture, clear out clutter, and beat the curtains. We get a taste for how things could be and start to dream and lay out our vision of the sparkling new future.</p>
<p>In Eddie&#8217;s case, and in lots of our cases, we try a few phrases of possibility on for size before launching into the work. It&#8217;s a sort of preliminary assessment taken before the official launch. How about this: <em>I am fit and loaded and everybody loves me&#8230;</em> or something like <em>I am popular and fabulous and happy on the inside&#8230;</em> Eventually we land on a couple of focus points and start in on the affirmative cleanup. And depending on how big our respective projects are, we can expect to have an equal amount of dust and very likely, resistance creeping in too.</p>
<p>In the literal act of spring cleaning and clean sweeping, it&#8217;s easy enough to see that if we&#8217;re to clear out the old, we&#8217;ll need to bring in the proper tools and cleaning agents before engaging with what needs to be trashed and rearranged. It&#8217;s unglamorous and tiresome, we know this going in. So we grab the bucket and glove ourselves up to the elbows and get busy. The energy part of it is parallel on this point. Only problem, though, is it&#8217;s easy to get defeated once we start to dislodge the old ideas and beliefs about what we&#8217;re capable and deserving of.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;ve ever worked together, you know I&#8217;m all about the multi-pronged approach. I&#8217;ll offer you at least half a dozen ways to get to your goal or to put you back on track to the thing you&#8217;ve been off course on. I&#8217;m good at that, naturally. You might even say I&#8217;m an expert at getting off track and losing the way and shrinking back from the dust I&#8217;ve kicked up in various corners of my own life. I do so not because I&#8217;m a loser, I do it for <em>you</em>. Think of it as me gathering information in the field on your behalf.</p>
<p>So, the multi prongs. I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s never about doing just one thing to create and sustain major changes in our lives, because it&#8217;s just not. No offense to Eddie, but Eddie only focused on telling himself great things that he had too little experience of in his life up to that point order to make an impact on his then current life. There he was saying, again without a trace of irony or enthusiasm, <em>I am fit and wealthy and everybody loves me&#8230;</em> when it’s possible he didn&#8217;t have an exercise plan in place or maybe spent too much time and money on his Xbox, which means that even if everyone did love him—because what&#8217;s <em>not</em> to love about a man devoted to his affirmations no matter how temporary?—it&#8217;s not a stretch to say he might have been isolating himself without realizing it and perpetuating the same past patterns he was trying to sweep out of his life. So when the dusty old thoughts and stuffy <em>un</em>affirmative ideas about himself started to kick in and blur his vision, rather than reaching for the energetic multi-prongs of his bucket and scrubbing bubbles, he buckled and called the whole thing off.</p>
<p>Last year I led a workshop on this topic of setting and achieving goals when a woman in the front row shot her hand up and cried foul. She was pissed off about positive thinking and couldn&#8217;t bear to hear another New Agey spin on it. She&#8217;d been frustrated by all the talk minus the action and I couldn&#8217;t blame her. It was my first experience with a spiritual heckler and, man, was it good. She was in my face, pitched forward and listening in with her whole body as I spoke. She couldn&#8217;t have been more focused on me than if she&#8217;d borrowed extra eyeballs and trained them on me too.</p>
<p><em>Yes, you&#8217;re right,</em> I shot back. <em>It</em> is <em>total b.s. if all we&#8217;re doing is talking. As a matter of fact,</em> I said, <em>if I hear another chirpy do-gooder telling me to &#8216;Let my light shine,&#8217; without preparing me for the shadows, I might have to break something</em>. And I thought the room was quiet before—</p>
<p>I told the group about the importance of giving ourselves messages that our brains can actually make room for. Otherwise, if we tell ourselves things we don&#8217;t actually believe, we do more harm than good, so why bother? So, instead of saying stuff like, <em>I&#8217;m awesome</em> when you generally think you&#8217;re a joke, it might be better to open the door from where you are to say something more truly affirming like, <em>Every day, I&#8217;m getting better</em> or <em>I&#8217;m willing to have an awesome life</em> and how about this: <em>I give myself permission to be awesome.</em> And don&#8217;t stop there, because &#8230; Eddie, remember?</p>
<p>When we begin the work of change, we&#8217;ve got to make sure we have supports—people, resources, fallbacks, shameless ploys, etc.—in place to help facilitate our transition. If you&#8217;re affirming your awesomeness, for example, then act like you know it. Replace those ratty grandma drawers and mateless holey socks with new and beautiful unmentionables because, underneath it all, you <em>know</em> you&#8217;re worth it. Frame awesome photos and art and put them where you&#8217;ll have constant visuals of awesome times. Scale back on the non-awesome things you put in your body. Remember what the Staple Singers said about eradicating air pollution: <em>Put your hand o&#8217;er your mouth when you cough, that&#8217;ll help the solution.</em> Your actions matter and every bit counts. And pay attention to the places you go when the fabulous feelings fade—because they will sometimes. Do you reach for sweets, alcohol, or non-foodish material things? Instead of dealing with your disappointment, do you displace it and let it spread out over your life like a giant schmear of funk that permeates everything you do?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another great energetic prong of awesomeness: project the feelings you&#8217;d like to experience on to the world around you. Tell a friend, whom you happen to think is awesome, that they&#8217;re just that. Watch this feeling expand and see how good it makes you feel too. It&#8217;s going to be awkward at first, <em>walking</em> the talk of your affirmations and edging outside of your comfort zone, letting yourself be playful with the possibilities—but that&#8217;s where the magic happens. Affirm your affirmations in word <em>and</em> deed. Walk your talk rather than watching and waiting on your talk to walk across the room and affirm things for you.</p>
<p>Infuse your world with great new energy so that it&#8217;s waiting to greet you throughout the day. And when old ideas start to kick up, not only will you know you&#8217;re on to something good, and that those thoughts have been stirred not to take you down but to be swept out like any other mental, actual, or imagined elemental form of dust bunny, but you&#8217;ll be able to counter with <em>evidence</em> that you are indeed <em>getting better all the time</em>. Just look at your matching socks, the lovely images around you now, your happy best buds who know you care, your new underwear. See?</p>

<p>This pic came from last year’s Halloween party. I’ve been meaning to write about it ever since. When I dug it up last month, I was horrified all over again at the story behind those batwing eyelashes and badass blue-black wig. Staring at the cosmetic puncture wounds and oozing blood I&#8217;d drawn on my own neck, I cringed. I gasped. <em>How do you do, my name is Kriste, and I am a Victim.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-1766"></span></p>
<p>That I&#8217;d casually drafted myself into that role without so much as an afterthought was chilling, because the realization went way beyond spooky dressup and made me think about some of the other ways I&#8217;d probably been playing that role in real life without realizing it. <em>Probably a lot</em>, I reckoned. Suddenly, the light table of my life had flicked on in my mind’s eye and a parade of my Victim slides fanned out into sharp focus for review. <em>Oh crap</em>, I thought, <em>I&#8217;m</em> good <em>at this</em>. It was my illuminating <em>nah-ah</em> moment, and I didn&#8217;t like it one bit. And that’s the main reason why it took me so long to get to this post: it&#8217;s not pretty, honey!</p>
<p>So, a story. Victims love stories. At last year&#8217;s Halloween party, a friend who&#8217;d never seen me in makeup and fake hair complimented my look—raved, actually—and told me how incredible I looked,<em> just like Naomi Campbell,</em> he said. He stared at me for a long time and even told in the days that followed that I should consider fake hair for real because it made me look so hot.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t about to venture into the minefield of what beauty and beautiful hair was or how narrowly-perceived his idea of it was/is at a Halloween party of all places. So, I let it go. I didn&#8217;t bother launching into the fact that even Naomi Campbell has a team of paid professionals to help her look like she does and that, if I look like her in makeup, then maybe she looks like me out of it. Not <em>out of it</em> as in inebriated, but out of makeup, I mean.</p>
<p>Instead of calling him on his remark, I went one better and quietly decided to begin the process of de-friending him after he&#8217;d returned me safely home at the end of the evening. The next morning I called my girlfriend Bailey and rolled the story out for her in chapter and verse, leaving no detail untold in the case against my ignorant friend and the culture at large that incubated and spawned such beliefs. For forty-five minutes I railed on about the impossible standards of beauty that get piped in through the mainstream and how society suffers as a result and discourages any true expression of and the stifling global oppression that emerges as a result.</p>
<p>I bemoaned the unnecessary, expensive burdens placed on women who couldn&#8217;t see past the lies long enough to recognize their inherent beauty and to value the tresses they’d been blessed with from birth. <em>I&#8217;m all for hair and nails and makeup as accessories and  fashion options</em>, I told her, <em>but it&#8217;s the message that expensive additions like these should be the norm that pisses me off.</em> Bailey listened while I called for women everywhere to come out from beneath the cumbersome burdens of weaves, extensions and wigs and, thusly, out from the pockets of the booming grooming industry.</p>
<p>I was angry that people seemed to be under the illusion that beauty and esteem were simply a matter of money and an over-the-counter transaction. Just a few dollars down for full, pixie, partial, single track, silky, waved and braided allure. What&#8217;s worse, I told my friend, was that my other friend, Kevin, had absolutely no idea how clueless he was about The Issues and that his ignorance only fueled the oppressor&#8217;s grasp around women&#8217;s minds and wallets everywhere and, and, and&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Will you calm down, Kriste?</em> Bailey interrupted. <em>That man was just paying you a compliment. I see that as him recognizing your beauty. You need to be grateful because I saw that picture and I think you look terrible, if you want the truth.</em></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want the truth. Not that one anyway.</p>
<p>Despite her attempts to diffuse the clarity and venom of my diatribe, I decided she didn&#8217;t get it because her natural hair was more like Naomi&#8217;s fake hair, so she could only go so far into the struggle and appreciation of my Victimization. In search of a more hospitable reception of my plight—someone with hair more like my own—I called my sister and rolled out the story in chapter and verse for her too. To my surprise, she cut me off about twelve minutes in with, <em>We never expected you to be normal.</em> I wasn&#8217;t sure how to take that, but I knew it was grounds for offense and on to my short list she went.</p>
<p>By the day&#8217;s end, I&#8217;d amassed a growing list of poorly-informed friends who were up for demotion in my book. It was a sweeping task, thinning out my A-list, but it had to be done. I was saddened to know that nobody in the world understood me, that I was alone in my indignation and Victimization and alienation, and it sucked.</p>
<p>And that, people, is but one way to play a prize-worthy Victim.</p>
<p>When you play the Victim—and you don&#8217;t have to be all that good at it like I was—one of the perks is that you get to hold your line in the sand and stack the offenses around you like a fortress. And when you get a good pile going, you can stand on it and thump your chest in righteous indignation that let’s the world know how great and deep is your suffering. Using a fake accent may go a long way here, too. In no time your makeshift soapbox fortress will bear you up like a proud conquistador, your heels dug firmly in, defying all comers to challenge your position. It&#8217;s a brilliant scheme, indeed.</p>
<p>Victims on soapboaxes know no one understands them. That&#8217;s part of the art of building cases and fortresses: you get to do it to your own specifications. Victims count on no one caring about their cause because they—people who choose to stay stuck in their version of The Facts instead of building bridges to real understanding and corrective action—they’re all too eager to condescend just enough to school ignorant masses and soon-to-be-defriended friends on The Issues.</p>
<p>Did I mention that it&#8217;s lonely at the top of that heap?</p>
<p>There are a great many ways to be good at playing the Victim. I&#8217;ve listed but a few from my own experience, and I point this out because it&#8217;s not always easy to recognize when we&#8217;re wrapped up acting out our parts. And even though this kind of unpleasantness can be hard to spot in ourselves, it&#8217;s even harder to embrace. Yes, embrace, I said. For the hardheaded among you, I say embrace because what else is there? You&#8217;ve got yourself backed into a corner, high on your horse and too proud to take your medicine the easy way, and that&#8217;s why where here, now isn&#8217;t it? So, pull your face back together, own your stuff, break down the walls, walk among the people again and, in so doing, be prepared to be relieved of your role because that&#8217;s what happens when you/we finally drop the act.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: the Victim is clever, and just like Uncle Sam, she wants you, preciousss! She wants to whisper sweet nothings in your ear and enlist you in the legion of doom unbeknownst to you. She wants to draw you out to sea with her intoxicating siren song, filling your head with half truths as she dashes you on the rocks, tramplea your faith, and drags what’s left into her lair away from all reason and clarity. As my friend Jaime says, she wants to break you down to your last compound and kick. your. ass. But sometimes that’s the only way to make it back to ourselves, huh?</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying The Issues are bogus, because I really do believe narrow standards of beauty and creativity and individualism are serious problems. I also know that using Issues as weapons rather than making room for real solutions and dialogue can be dangerous, not to mention isolating. If the capital C Cause winds up pulling you out of your center and into the lair, you&#8217;d better look alive, &#8217;cause you&#8217;re being played. You might think you&#8217;re running the show, but you&#8217;re in the role, you have assumed the position, and you&#8217;re going down.</p>
<p>The American author and founder of The Empowerment Dynamic—more widely known as TED—well his name is David Emerald Wolmendorf and he had this to say about Victims. It hit so close to the bone, you&#8217;d have thought I said it here first. He says, <em>Victims may be defensive, submissive, over-accommodating to others, passive-aggressive in conflict, dependent on others for self-worth, overly sensitive, even manipulative. They’re often angry, resentful, and envious, feeling unworthy or ashamed about their circumstances. Have you ever felt or acted this way?</em></p>
<p>Before you launch into a response, even if it&#8217;s a defensive one, it&#8217;s worth taking a moment to consider. Look back over the last times you played the Victim. Were you convincing? Did you get stuck in it and need a little help dropping the act? And were you the wiser for it in the end? I sure hope so. Another thing I discovered from my Victim stints is that it prepares me for another role to which I feel I’m much better suited. It’s the Phoenix. To make this role convincing, you’ve got to be resilient, hopeful and open, knowing that you&#8217;ll get knocked down again sometime because that&#8217;s just part of the deal. No two ways about it, you’ve got to bring your passion to this role; you’ve got to be on fire. I invite you to try it. Bring your best costume, do yourself up, and most important: look alive, honey. And, no, you may not borrow my wig.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are times when only a song will do. And this is one of them.</p>
<p>For as far back as I can remember Joe Cocker, I&#8217;ve linked the the grizzled crooner to his scratchy rendition of &#8216;You Are So Beautiful&#8217; (and, as of the eighties, the gospelesque hit &#8216;Up Where We Belong&#8217;). But it&#8217;s <em>this</em> tune, &#8216;With A Little Help From My Friends&#8217; that really sings to me. It&#8217;s about the everlasting importance of friendship and I&#8217;m loving it right about now. I know, we&#8217;ve already got the Beatles version. And we&#8217;ve got Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight, Stevie Wonder and friends who came along with their megahit &#8216;That&#8217;s What Friends are For&#8217;, and we can&#8217;t leave out Bill Withers&#8217; classic, &#8216;Lean on Me&#8217;. They all tug at my heartstrings, but I have my reasons for pulling Joe out of the bag this time around. The main one: he&#8217;s clearly unstable.</p>
<p><span id="more-436"></span></p>
<p>To watch him perform, all jerky and flailing like a palsied fish out of water, I often imagine myself asking him, &#8220;Would it kill you to actually sing sometimes, Joe? You know, without all of the breathless grunting and urgency?&#8221; He&#8217;d seem thrown, rendered momentarily speechless as though I&#8217;d been the only one to ever ask him this. Then with an involuntary shake of his shoulders, he&#8217;d reply in my mind, &#8220;Yeah, Kriste, yeah it just might.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was drawn to this video like a rubbernecker to the scene of an accident: I couldn&#8217;t tell what was going on, but I knew whatever it was was big and very likely dangerous if I got too close. And that&#8217;s exactly the way Joe Cocker sings. It&#8217;s an immediate, messy collision of raw emotion and spectacle that demands your attention and impacts you in ways can&#8217;t readily explain.</p>
<p>I may be attributing too much to his delivery—and I&#8217;m willing to acknowledge my own singing experience makes me hyper-aware of dramatic onstage mannerisms like his—and yet, at the end of the day, I know this man <em>knows</em> what he&#8217;s singing about.</p>
<p>I confess I don&#8217;t know all of the words to this tune, nor have I bothered to look them up. Still, I&#8217;m certain everything I need to know is right there in the title. And the refrain. Which leads me at last to my most pressing question: Do you need anybody?</p>
<p>Given all the messages of high-achieving, self-directed, living-the-dream can-doism that come from the world around me, I often feel like I&#8217;m supposed to know it all, have it all, and be all things to more than a few people&#8230;all without ever needing anyone else along the way. In the sense of being responsible for myself by making a living, paying my bills, and doing whatever I see fit to do for myself, I&#8217;d say, no, I don&#8217;t <em>need</em> anyone to take care of me. Nor do I require anyone else to provide my sense of my esteem or value either. I&#8217;ve got that relatively well covered, too. And even in knowing that I&#8217;m already energetically connected to everyone, there&#8217;s still a sizable chunk of living that requires person-to-person connection to make things interesting, not to mention worthwhile.</p>
<p>So, when&#8217;s the last time someone besides me encouraged you to fearlessly extend yourself to other people for goodness&#8217; sake?</p>
<p>Even on my recent foray back into the dating scene, as I was tweaking my online profile, I felt oddly wrong for saying I ultimately wanted a partner to share my life with. Why? Because, if I&#8217;m honest, I run the risk of appearing desperate, too needy, and, consequently, about as appealing as an old hand towel.</p>
<p>Reaching out for anything from other people has the potential to make us feel uncomfortable at best. Not to mention weak in exactly all the ways that run counter to the self-selfing teachings of culture.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t look away from Joe Cocker. Because, for all of his thrashing about and painful articulation, he puts his heart on the line without a care for his tatty appearance and garbled renditions. In doing so, he reminds me what we must look like to each other when we risk our own vulnerability to make real and lasting contact with the folks who matter most around us.</p>
<p>Like Joe, my emotional delivery occasionally comes across as a trembling mess of nerves and rambling non sequiturs, but I&#8217;m trusting my heart is in the right place, and that counts for everything. It&#8217;s not always easy extending myself in this way, but who am I—who are any of us, really—without relationships?</p>
<p>I like to think the people I know and love who also know and love me know that I know they really <em>do</em> help me get by by sharing themselves with me in loving ways and that, while I may not be perfect or consistently clever, they don&#8217;t hold it against me if I&#8217;m a sputtering mess on account of they&#8217;re forgiving, human, loyal, and oh so tolerant. And patient&#8230;even when I don&#8217;t make sense. Kind of like just now. Thanks for the reminder, Joe.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Door.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1727" title="Door" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Door-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a><br />
For the past three decades and then some—ever since I got the hang of running my mouth—I’ve been trying in vain to get my mother to do my bidding. But it remains one of life’s great mysteries why she never bent to my will. It’s beyond me why she has chosen to live her life as though she were a self-directed individual with a mind and agenda of her own.</p>
<p><span id="more-1716"></span></p>
<p>When ma retired more than a decade ago, I did all I could to encourage her participation in activities beyond work and us ‘kids’. She wasn’t impressed. <em>Ma, you gotta take an interest</em>, I said, never initially bothering to specify what I thought she should be interested in. <em>Get out there</em>, I urged her. <em>Go date. Look </em>alive,<em> woman! Volunteer, socialize, learn a language</em>, I insisted. <em>Do</em> something, <em>ma</em>! Whenever I thought about her, which was often, I wrote notes, and phoned home from wherever I was in the world—in between my own adventures—to assess her status and gently clobber her with my attempts to pack the open calendar of her newly retired life.</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t having it.</p>
<p>Naturally, I stepped up my plan, drafting to-do lists (you know I&#8217;m infamous for my lists, honey), providing phone numbers, and slipping in the sobering statistics and manufactured facts about retirees who—by not remaining active in their golden years—ultimately retired from life itself after leaving the workforce. Having nearly reached my limit, I opted, as any keenly desperate strategist would, for overt tactics of fear and intimidation. <em>Did you know</em>, I said with much conviction as I could muster, <em>the FBI did a study that said life expectancy of retired people who don&#8217;t stay active after leaving the workforce is only 5 years</em>?</p>
<p>Still unmoved by this latest dump of misinformation, she replied, <em>What makes you think I want to </em>do<em> anything, Kriste? I been</em> doing<em> all my life. And I’m</em> tired. There aren’t many occasions when you’ll find me short for things to say, but that one shut me up pretty good.</p>
<p>After recovering from my mom’s ungracious outburst (and world-weary expression of her deeper personal truth, which I was powerless to fix), I grudgingly decided that, after decades of trying to run my mom’s life, I had to allow that maybe she knew what was best for her. Maybe, I considered, she could run her life without the intrusion of my unsolicited statistics, persistent lists, and thinly veiled demands to Move It. It was a difficult fistful of pills to swallow, but I was out of the nest living a life of my own and had to let my mom fly—or not—as she saw fit.</p>
<p>Then one day, not having fully and totally nor finally given up on the attempt to resurrect and direct my mom’s social life, I sent her a memoir I’d hoped would change <em>everything</em>. It was the story of a divorced, freshly retired teacher who—despite her many attempts at ‘staying busy’ by volunteering and senior activities—she got blindsided by a sudden desire to have sex and maybe even fall in love after so many decades spent on the shelf immersed in other things.</p>
<p>Bingo! <em>Just what my mother needs</em>, I proclaimed. <em>Sex!</em> I don’t give up easy.</p>
<p>I love that memoir because our heroine, Jane Juska, is a woman after my own heart. Some would say she was well beyond the age of ‘knowing better’,  past 60, and she still looked at her life as an adventure and knew that, even though she was clueless about getting into social circulation again—let alone getting into bed with someone new—she went for it anyway. She anted&#8217;d up and duked it out through the pages of her story and invited us in for the ride, so to speak. The book: <em>A Round-Heeled Woman: My Late-Life Adventures in Sex and Romance</em>. It was the perfect gift for any mother from a concerned daughter with her mom&#8217;s well-being in mind. I made a special trip to the post office just to send it off.</p>
<p>Once I’d given her enough time to read and marinate on the book, I called ma and engaged her in the following discussion:</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> So, ma, did you get that book I sent you?</p>
<p><strong>MA: </strong>What book?</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> You know, the one about that retired teacher who places a personal ad looking for sex. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>MA:</strong> Oh. That.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p>(Crickets.)</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>MA:</strong> I read that first chapter, and as soon as she started getting racy, I couldn’t go any further. I had to put that book down. I shut the door on that part of my life a long time ago.</p>
<p>(Cue the sound of slamming of doors and cacophonous padlocking hysteria in the distance.)</p>
<p>With that, our conversation turned, as it so often did, to the whether—as in whether or not I’d met ‘Mr. Wonderful,’ and when I was coming home.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about this notion of willfully closing doors to parts of my life. As a short-term solution or response it kind of makes sense. For example, suffering any kind of loss or disappointment is hardly a call to throw open the doors of one’s heart in search of more emotional rough-handling and whupass. I know I&#8217;m never keen on the idea of getting back out there wherever <em>there</em> is, only to feed my heart to what look like lions, and if I&#8217;m feeling wounded, I say screw any euphemistic chatter of romance. Emotional recovery and healing have their place and they take time. As long as they don&#8217;t take too much of it.</p>
<p>When you close the door to your heart, you may as well collapse in a heap, turn out the lights and forward your mail because you are effectively done at that point, you hear? D-O-N-E. I won’t lie; I sometimes look back and wonder how come this or that relationship of the past went bust, or why I behaved badly, if at all. And the more time I spend with ghosts, the more I see my responses steeped in fear, taking center stage like an horrific tragicomedy featuring me in all the up close, unflattering lead roles.</p>
<p>Oh, look! there’s me as Angela Bassett, burning down my house in a rage against the transgressions of a good man gone bad. How about me as Julia Roberts as the girl asking the boy to love the girl only to hear the record scratch during his loud and painfully protracted real-life <em>ambivilanche</em>. Then there’s me as Jennifer Lopez in profile during any given scene, forgetting my lines and hearing the hiss of my overexposed ass going flat on camera. Not pretty.</p>
<p>I can tell you in the full faith of my innermost conviction that the key to experiencing love and joy and romance and all of the goodies means that no matter what, I have to keep the doors of my heart thrown open as best I can. Sometimes it requires lots of grease in the hinges and other times I enlist the aid of an occasional crowbar and wedge. One thing that’s always required is a watchful eye. Otherwise, those doors slam shut and wind up needing a lot more muscle to coax them open again.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;ve packed it in on love—and I&#8217;m talking about love of life, of self, of others, of younameit— if we entertain the lie that our one and only ship has sailed, that it&#8217;s just as well, because we get seasick or, we&#8217;re not destined to ever be happy at anything all because there&#8217;s not enough and life is hard and so on—the doors to the heart will seal up with an unconscious gunk so thick, the sound and texture of truly loving connections get harder and harder to recognize.</p>
<p>Funny, isn’t it, that we say so easily and so often that we want this and that from our relationships, but, if our hearts are gummed up and bolted over on lockdown, we may as well be professing that stuff from behind bullet-proof glass in a hi-crime, late-night drive-thru because that’s how attractive you’re looking to Love. By the way, if you’ve never had the pleasure of ordering from one of those places, take my word for it: it’s dangerous, the food sucks and feels awful going down.</p>
<p>Because I can, I’ve drummed up a short list of 5 sure ways to know when and if you’re approaching the dangerous state of Love or Life on lockdown. Again, this is includes but is not limited to romantic love. I’ve left a lot off of this list, so feel free to send me your own personal favorites if you want, as I’d like to read &#8216;em.</p>
<p><strong>1. I&#8217;m too old for love. </strong>Once I officially entered the realm of what some would call middle age, which, last time I checked was 35, I quickly found that notion of being too old for anything that’s true and good, was bogus. I don’t know about you, but I fully intend to give and receive great loving in every area of my life until it’s curtains. And, me being me, I&#8217;ll find a way to keep doing it from the other side, too.</p>
<p><strong>2. There&#8217;s not enough to go around.</strong>In my unsolicited opinion, it doesn’t make sense to use this line of reasoning if you’re looking for a relationship, a hobby, or any other way to get engaged in your life because all you need is one person, one situation, one dream and all of it starts with <em>you</em>. So, unless you live in a town with a population of about six—providing four of whom aren&#8217;t you or related to you if it&#8217;s romance we&#8217;re talking about—then there’s still a chance for connection. Second, I’d ask you to revise that ‘out there’ bit, too. Because, odds are, when you take a moment to really listen to yourself talk in terms of limits, you’ll find that they come from somewhere inside your state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>3. I don’t ‘do’ the dating scene.</strong> So what. Neither do most of the people &#8216;out there&#8217; on the scene themselves. I’ve been to enough speed dating, singles’ dances, social outings, blind dates, and ‘special’ events to know there are plenty people who might have fared better to stay home and work on their presentation before unleashing themselves on the general public. But, they didn’t. And good for them because those people know, like the rest of us could stand to know for ourselves, that you have to at minimum—<em>minimum!</em>—show up to win.</p>
<p><strong> 4. Nobody likes me. </strong>Now you&#8217;re getting dramatic and, forgive me, but I&#8217;ve mislaid my violin. As one who’s all about healthy drama in appropriate quantities, I can tell you this one will get you nowhere fast. In fact, there are so many problems with this line of thought that I can’t even begin to address it. And furthermore, you’re starting to rile me up by virtue of the fact that you’re trying to make me convince you you’re likable in the first place. Know what? With that <em>nobody likes me </em>whiny attitude, maybe you’re right!</p>
<p><strong>5. I don&#8217;t want to be hurt again. </strong>Let me ask you this: Why stay locked in a bomb shelter eating Spam when you can live above ground dining on fancy organics any time your want? Keeping yourself hidden away from life, safely removed from the threat of any possible attack or upset from your canned routine winds up being a form of torture all its own, don&#8217;t you think? Now get yourself out there! Or not. I’ve learned my lesson and I’ve given up trying to tell people what to do. More or less.</p>

		<itunes:summary>For the past three decades and then some—ever since I got the hang of running my mouth—I’ve been trying in vain to get my mother to do my bidding. But it remains one of life’s great mysteries why she never bent to my will. It’s beyond me why she has chosen to live her life as though she were a self-directed individual with a mind and agenda of her own.



When ma retired more than a decade ago, I did all I could to encourage her participation in activities beyond work and us ‘kids’. She wasn’t impressed. Ma, you gotta take an interest, I said, never initially bothering to specify what I thought she should be interested in. Get out there, I urged her. Go date. Look alive, woman! Volunteer, socialize, learn a language, I insisted. Do something, ma! Whenever I thought about her, which was often, I wrote notes, and phoned home from wherever I was in the world—in between my own adventures—to assess her status and gently clobber her with my attempts to pack the open calendar of her newly retired life.

She wasn't having it.

Naturally, I stepped up my plan, drafting to-do lists (you know I'm infamous for my lists, honey), providing phone numbers, and slipping in the sobering statistics and manufactured facts about retirees who—by not remaining active in their golden years—ultimately retired from life itself after leaving the workforce. Having nearly reached my limit, I opted, as any keenly desperate strategist would, for overt tactics of fear and intimidation. Did you know, I said with much conviction as I could muster, the FBI did a study that said life expectancy of retired people who don't stay active after leaving the workforce is only 5 years?

It was a difficult fistful of pills to swallow, but I was out of the nest living a life of my own and had to let my mom fly—or not—as she saw fit.

Then one day, not having fully and totally nor finally given up on the attempt to resurrect and direct my mom’s social life, I sent her a memoir I’d hoped would change everything.

<p>Social networking is deep. For lots of reasons. But, today, I happen to think it&#8217;s particularly intense because it&#8217;s got me thinking about how it is that I can share a laugh, swap stories, discuss the issues, mingle, chat and seem totally engaging and current from anywhere—even the bathroom. And that I can do so with anyone from anyplace in the world totally blows my mind. From Colorado to Cairo if I want. Boulder to Bangladesh too—all without ever having to shower, shake hands, open my mouth or leave the comfort of my living room. Talk about friendship with benefits!</p>
<p><span id="more-1565"></span></p>
<p>Never before has so little been required to have so much. Hundreds of friends—thousands if I push it—at the click of a button. And they all like me; to them, I&#8217;m neat and happening. Savvy and smart. Me—they all think awesome. Until they don&#8217;t. Which brings me to the <em>un</em>benefits of friendship. My aunt used to tell us young drivers we had to &#8220;stick your nose out there&#8221; if we ever expected to merge into fast-moving traffic. She was hardly a passive shotgun rider, but she was right about that. And the same goes for navigating traffic on the Internet superhighway: if I want to get anywhere, I must jut my nose, toes—and neck, it appears—out there by letting folks all over the so-called social sites know I&#8217;m ready to take my chances in the fast lane.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all harmless enough at first, this act of getting out there. Last year I wrote a post about how I had pretty much resigned myself to thinking it might be enough, maybe, to write quietly in the margins of my life, to eek out a few pieces every now and again in hopes of persuading some publisher or generous real-life friend who owed me one to be so kind as to read my material. But I quickly gave up on that resignation because the thing about being a writer is that writers need readers. Which means we, I, by way of my work, have to be out there—nose, toes, head, neck and all. No two ways about it, it can&#8217;t be helped, this chronic writing condition. Sometimes, I liken it to psychosis.</p>
<p>The American essayist and scholar H.L. Mencken once said the writer was that person &#8220;in whom the normal vanity of all men is so vastly exaggerated that he finds it a sheer impossibility to hold it in. His overpowering impulse is to gyrate before his fellow men, flapping his wings and emitting defiant yells. This being forbidden by the police of all civilized countries, he takes it out by putting his yells on paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>A story: Within twenty-four hours of edging my nose into online traffic, which means creating a highly visible Honey Help YourSelf page on Facebook, I got quickly friended <em>and</em> unfriended by someone who didn&#8217;t care for what I was doing. If I read this another way, I&#8217;d say the outright rejection of my work felt like this person was not only calling my baby, my brand new labor of love, <em>un</em>lovable, <em>un</em>impressive and, horror of horrors, <em>un</em>friendable. When I learned of the loss, my mind went straight to the possible reasons why I&#8217;d been unliked. I wanted to message that person and let him or her know I really didn&#8217;t suck as a human being, that I truly didn&#8217;t mean to piss them off and that contrary to whatever it was they thought about me and my writing baby, I am generally not an irreverent upstart.</p>
<p>After deciding it would be pointless to find the offended or offending unfriender, as it were, I considered why I&#8217;d been so concerned about that one person&#8217;s response, rather than appreciating the support I&#8217;d received. When I take this exploration deeper and look at why the urge for approval from strangers, I can&#8217;t help but travel back to the kid in me who equated praise with acceptance, stability—however temporary—and an all-is-well feeling in the world. To that girl in me, whenever people left me without a proper explanation, it meant I probably had a hand in it or that I was somehow responsible for their departure. And, surprisingly, that feeling in me lit up like a string of Christmas lights when someone I hardly knew &#8220;left me&#8221; hanging by the side of the web.</p>
<p>Frankly, sometimes people just won&#8217;t like us—won&#8217;t like <em>me</em>, my writing, my opinions, or even my recent choice of hair color. And that&#8217;s okay. They&#8217;re not <em>wrong</em>. Do I need to call those people out as losers for not acknowledging my sparkling qualities and irrepressible need to flap my writing wings up and down the Internet highway? Absolutely&#8230;not.</p>
<p>I was reminded that every relationship has its own cycles and that, within those, each person has his or her own rules of engagement and freedom of choice that don&#8217;t always compliment the other person&#8217;s. That&#8217;s the nature of real relating and friendship, I think: we have to make room for each other and our stuff. Especially when we&#8217;re feeling sensitive in new and uncharted territory.</p>
<p>It takes courage to step into a brand new direction. And I can tell you already, when you begin to blaze new trails for yourself, you&#8217;d better expect things to heat up. There will be fire, much of it originating from under your own butt. When you blaze a trail, you may find that you&#8217;ll have to run that sucker right through the heart of town, laying waste to the old outposts of your fear and blasting past those zones of comfort. No doubt you&#8217;ll scare the children and babies, but they&#8217;ll be okay, taking courage from your lead as you gut it out and blow the roof off of business as usual. Count on it all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tasklist1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1558" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tasklist1-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>Psst, you. I want to talk to you about the Soulmate List. Also known as the Life Partner List, it&#8217;s the itemized, prioritized, idealized roster of traits, tastes and druthers of must-have qualities we want the person of our dreams to possess. It&#8217;s usually a make-or-break proposition, high-stakes in its attempts to define who and what our ideal mates must look like, sound like, feel like, be like. And depending on how serious we are about our List, it can backfire and blow up like mad if we get too attached to it and take our eyes off of life as we knew it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1557"></span></p>
<p>How much does he love me? Let me count the ways.</p>
<p>1.) First things first. He must be fine as all get out. Chiseled, buffed, taught, supple, hot and cool in all the right places.</p>
<p>2.) For as great-looking as he is, he&#8217;s also got to adore me in equal measure. Fawn over me, praise me, cuddle and coo me, too. Oh, and leave no mountain unmoved to ensure I know how much he cares.</p>
<p>3.) When he&#8217;s not maintaining his awesome physique, and keeping his hind parts high, mighty and muscled for nobody but me—and when he&#8217;s got a break from moving mountains on my behalf—the Ideal Man of my Dreams List will be busy bringing in the organic, consciously-fed, humanely-treated meatless bacon. Most of which he loves to fry up for me.</p>
<p>4.) Did I mention the Ideal Man of my List is an excellent chef who trained at Le Cordon Bleu, and is obviously fluent in French?</p>
<p>4a.) My Soul Mate, as described on my List, shall also happily put his big strong hands to work washing the dishes after dinner, while serenading me from the kitchen—after surprising me with his latest culinary masterpiece.</p>
<p>5.) Which also means the &#8220;dessert&#8221; is always tasty and never disappoints. No cream puffs for me, thank you!</p>
<p>6.) The Man of my List will hold doors open and lift heavy things in addition to mountains—things like furniture and recycled organic hemp bags filled with non-GMO groceries.</p>
<p>7.) He does the driving when I ask, he reads my mind, and even cries when appropriate; just enough to remind me of his deep river of strength and security churning mannishly beneath his steely composure and behind savage breast, which allows for just the right amount of occasional manly emotion.</p>
<p>And now, the teachable moment: Let&#8217;s say you want someone or even some thing that&#8217;s going to bring you pleasure and enhance your life. Using the example of Manifesting a Miracle Man, let&#8217;s say you want him to be friendly and outgoing. Fair enough. But what if, whenever you go out to social settings, you retreat to the darkened corners of the party, back by the coats where no one can see you?</p>
<p>From that vantage point, back behind the synthetic potted palm trees, you watch as your Mr. Wonderful works the room, much to the delight of all the single ladies. What if he&#8217;s actually looking for you in that moment, but you&#8217;re feeling too self-conscious, hidden and undeserving to show yourself to him, let alone to anyone who might be the brother, sister, kid, neighbor, colleague, Ex or parent of that guy who&#8217;s truly perfect for you?</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s say this chilling realization makes me think twice about my List, showing me that I could stand to scale my expectations back a bit, that I could benefit from developing my own social skills if I expect to be a match for the Man of My List. Because, frankly, even I can&#8217;t see being comfortable with a social butterfly when I&#8217;m about as engaging as the coat rack.</p>
<p>I happen to think that when we look for our Ideal Mates, Soul Mates, Perfect Matches, Life Partners, Better Halves—even our Unsuspecting Future Ex, let&#8217;s face it—we&#8217;re looking for the best, most balanced version of ourselves to be reflected back to us in their eyes—and actions. And if these desired traits aren&#8217;t already available in us, present for all the world to see, then it&#8217;s probably time to turn the search for the Great Mate inward on ourselves, so that we not only learn how to cultivate the traits we seek, but we also become more of a magnetic match in seriously delicious ways.</p>
<p>And another thing: Do I really want the pressure of having a man who does 10,000 crunches a day and has eliminated all traces of fun from his diet? Here, let me help you with that one&#8230;No, people! Because if my man&#8217;s spending all our together time doing sit ups, that&#8217;s time stolen from me and my hungry heart, and it makes me feel bad about myself, my life, my List, and <em>that</em> drives me right to the icebox or corner store for the much-needed solace that&#8217;s found in the blissful embrace of the only men I know who truly love me, who may <em>ever</em> love me—Ben &amp; Jerry.</p>
<p>I feel an anecdote coming on&#8230;</p>
<p>Once upon a time (more like thrice, a dozenth upon a time, really) I made a Miracle Man List of my very own. He had to be friendly, intelligent, considerate, open to new experiences, kind, close to his family, funny, blah blah blah. Then one day I befriend a guy in an evening class we were both taking.</p>
<p>Each week we seemed to naturally gravitate toward each other, laughing and trading jokes about random class topics, which soon shifted to quips about our personal lives. I loved that he was so easy to talk to. He was intellectually curious and had a dry wit that found an easy rapport with my own. He was a bit of a nerd, too. It was a no-brainer; I liked him. And he liked me. Totally my kind of guy. Only, not that kind of my kind of guy—he was hardly <em>The Man of My List</em>.</p>
<p>That got me to thinking. Friendly, intelligent, considerate, open to new experiences, kind, close to his family, plus a lot of the blah blah blah. So? What? Well, let me pause here to tell you this is the crucial point at which we lose out if we&#8217;re not careful, honey. By &#8220;not careful&#8221; I&#8217;m talking about we lose if we&#8217;re too busy listening to the voices of the past, the old fears and judgment from others about who we&#8217;re supposed to like and love. And let&#8217;s not forget that ill-placed allegiance to<em> Type</em> that loves to bite us in the ass as great people and opportunities dry up and float right out of our reach.</p>
<p>Bit by bit I give myself increased permission to let a great new kind of real man—and by extension, great new types of opportunities—come my way and oh what a difference it makes! There’s so much change, in fact, that it’s hard to keep up with everything that’s going on. I don’t want to lose track of it all. Wait, I know; maybe I’ll make a list.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Popcorn.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1525" title="Popcorn" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Popcorn-300x241.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="322" /></a></p>
<p>Have you heard about the latest menace on the streets, popcorn brain? No, I&#8217;m not hurling an insult at you, so calm down. I&#8217;m telling you about a very real threat to our overall mental health and wellness: popcorn brain. A group Chinese researchers did a big study recently and found that people who spend lots of time shopping, tweeting, texting, and IMing on their electronic devices have less gray matter, or brain power, to apply to critical thinking compared to folks who live holes and have no connection to computers, cell phones, e-readers, TVs, radios, appliances and anything else powered by an on/off button. Those researchers dubbed this electronic obsession as Internet Attention Deficiency. I think. And don&#8217;t ask me who officially dubbed this thing popcorn brain either. I can&#8217;t be sure because I wasn&#8217;t on the site long enough to actually retain what they said.</p>
<p><span id="more-1523"></span></p>
<p>I skipped down to the boldface hyperlink inviting me to take an online test on another website so I could determine whether I was indeed afflicted with this new disorder. Before I could get to that page, though, I remembered I&#8217;d been researching a topic for an article I&#8217;d been thinking about, which was the main reason I got online in the first place —after checking my Netflix queue, that is. That article, the one I was supposed to be researching, came up conveniently, at the precisely right time, as much of my inspiration does: right when I was busy doing other things.</p>
<p>In this case of &#8216;doing other things,&#8217; I&#8217;d been putting in some real work on the book I&#8217;ve been whining about doing for the last decade, or seven years, at least.  Remember? You know, it was one of those goals on my resolutions list way back in January. Speaking of goals, resolutions and January, shall I give you a moment to go back and consider your own priorities right now before you get all caught up in judging me and my tedious back-and-forth on my novel project, thank you very much? Seriously, I&#8217;ll wait. My Attention-Deficited popcorn brain could probably use the break anyway.</p>
<p>Right. Break. Did somebody just say <em>Take yourself a break, </em>honey? Done!</p>
<p>The way I see it, a break means getting out if I&#8217;ve been inside, or going in if I&#8217;ve been outside too long (because you never want to be the <em>last </em>one to leave the party, FYI). So, to give myself time away from the things I wasn&#8217;t doing, and from the latest shocking discoveries in the field of gray matter and brain science, I decided to take myself to hear some live music venue and order myself a rum and Coke—heavy on the ice—while I pondered my book and the new article I&#8217;m going to get to as soon as I do my research. Right after I finish this entry and recall that piece of the dream I had that was alerting me to&#8230; to&#8230; Oh, the accursed popcorn.</p>
<p>Not long into my outing, I grab a seat at the bar and drift into creating an imaginary list of things I need to get to, itemizing them into two columns of need vs. want, then fun vs. boring, then yes vs. no, and finally into no particular order at all, except maybe A vs. B or left vs. right. While unconsciously engaged in this process, I stop to catch my reflection in the bar room mirror when I realize my head was darting back and forth like I was a spectator engrossed in an invisible ping pong match. Catching myself like that, looking back out at myself from behind the bar and bottom shelf booze, the reflection was, to say the least, not flattering. <em>Gee, I&#8217;m hardly looking relaxed during this inspired break</em>, I thought. <em>In fact, I seem completely panicked and I&#8217;ve got that look of a trapped cat in a rainstorm.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s these kinds of comparisons, comparisons that contain more truth than fiction, that make me fear an even worse-case scenario: that there in the bar, where I went for an escape and undeserved break from the rigors of worrying about popcorn brain (undiagnosed), my book (unwritten), my article (unrealized), and honeycast (ha!), I come to the blatant conclusion in that moment that <em>I am one stinking hot mess</em>.</p>
<p>To the casual observer, my darting glances and look of puzzlement might have indicated I&#8217;ve got Social Anxiety Disorder. Or Seasonal Allergy and Disease. Either way, it is not cute what I&#8217;m seeing in myself. Not at all. It&#8217;s just SAD, really.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s epiphanies like these that make me think bad things about fun-time food and refreshments like popcorn and fizzy sweet drinks created with the express purpose of taking the edge off. They make me think all of the work I&#8217;m not getting done and that time is ticking—and that, if I truly am at the midpoint of this life journey of mine—then, oh crap. And worse: I&#8217;ve probably got MAD, too (The Midlife Apathy Deal)!</p>
<p>Sometimes, this is life.</p>
<p>And so is this: After pondering my hot mess self on the barstool, held captive by my SAD, MAD decreased-capacity popcorn thinking, I grabbed a cocktail napkin and began to write. It didn&#8217;t take long before I started laughing myself back toward a clearing away from the overgrowth my wild imagination. Once there, I was able to move into productivity mode more quickly than I would have if I&#8217;d tried to merely will my way through the madness by pretending that, U<em>m, no that rattling sound you hear is definitely </em>not <em>coming from that loose screw between my ears</em>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where knowing oneself and having faith enter in. If I didn&#8217;t know what I do about myself and the way I think and work, it would have been way too easy to stay mired in a pit of crippling messages from the media and consequent self-diagnoses. If I didn&#8217;t trust my own process of making friends with my emotions and all of the mental driftwood that floats up as a result of experiencing my feelings, I might have dropped those notions of writing, reading, recording and doing the work required to get me where I wanted to be. Had I tried to ignore my restlessness and frustration or force myself to act like everything was fine when that wasn&#8217;t entirely the case, I might have wound up doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>I could have simply explained away my monkey mind as it swooped in and swung me from fear to panic and back again without my permission. Had I not known what my own creative process sometimes feels like, I might have succumbed to the peanut gallery&#8217;s voices of insult, injury and doubt and never forged ahead with my ideas. Looking back, I might have never written the first word on this website. I could have feasted on the peanuts and popcorn junk food regimen of self-limitation. It would have been a no-brainer to beat back those dreams in me as the ramblings of a MAD SAD popcorn-brained crazy person. But I chose to ride the roller coaster of emotion wherever it carried me. <em>Well</em>, as CeeLo Green asks, <em>Does that make me crazaay? Does that make me crazaay?</em> Possibly. But, you know what? <em>We&#8217;re never gonna survive </em>– and get to living the lives we really want – <em>unless we get a little crazy</em>. Seal said some of that last piece; I can&#8217;t take all of the credit.</p>
<p>Having faith in the part of you that is always holding steady on the inside can change the game in ways we couldn&#8217;t anticipate on our best day. Some might call that all-knowing part of us the Inner Voice, the Higher Self, God, Buddha, Universe, Big Cheese or whatever. Maybe it doesn&#8217;t even matter what you call it, or that you call it anything. But the point is, if we want to change the game, we&#8217;ve got to get into it. Then we&#8217;ve got to be willing to play it out. I&#8217;ll quit the sports analogy now, but you get my point. I hope.</p>
<p>Moving through to the other side of my mini-drama helped to shift me somehow for the better, and I can tell you first-hand that the view from here is awesome. Distractionless, even. Feel free to join me, won&#8217;t you? You&#8217;ll find me in the clearing, just beyond the overgrowth. It&#8217;s not that far, so no need for extra baggage. Maybe you&#8217;ll want to carry water and snacks as you make your way. But, please, leave your popcorn—and peanuts—behind.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been away from posting lately, on account of work, study and other bandits of time and intention, but I finally decided I couldn&#8217;t let another day go by without making an appearance, honey!</p>
<p><span id="more-1511"></span></p>
<p>This piece is a re-tread of &#8220;Come On Out, Honey!&#8221; which I wrote back in October. But because I&#8217;m on a working vacation of sorts, I thought it was well-suited to record and present again here. Here&#8217;s why: the original piece was written in celebration of National Coming Out Day and, in the spirit of living out loud, I took the opportunity to let everybody know—those who weren&#8217;t already familiar with my &#8216;closet&#8217; metaphysical practices—that I was indeed a, shhh, <em>spiritual</em> person.  In that original piece (posted in October 2010), I addressed the insecurities that came up when a friend asked if she could &#8216;out&#8217; me on Facebook.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I felt that familiar chill of cold spiritual feet just before I decided to let everyone I knew know that I was going to start offering free card readings as a means to sharpen the skills I&#8217;d been cultivating recently. <em>Gulp.</em> I thought: <em>What if </em>they<em> think I&#8217;m really crazy  or super devilish and wicked now? What if</em> they <em>won&#8217;t like me anymore? What if I get shunned or unfriended on Facebook—horror of horrors!</em></p>
<p>Before I got too deep into the tailspin this time, I realized my pattern (as well as my answer) and went for it. I checked my intentions for wanting to make this move, confirmed that it was okay and let it rip. By day&#8217;s end I had an encouraging rush of support that dissolved any fear that rushed through me just a few hours before.</p>
<p>Because I had the benefit of reflecting on the events surrounding my original coming out piece just a few months ago, I was able to short-circuit those doubts and stand happily, fully, in my integrity. Which enabled me to share myself in a way that might have taken longer to get to otherwise. Which makes me happy. Which means, in the end, I posted the free reading invitation on Facebook and feel pretty damn good about it to boot.</p>
<p>And while I&#8217;m at it, I&#8217;d like to extend the offer to you, too!</p>
<p>Want me to read cards for you? I&#8217;ve just completed a fresh round of training, and in order to properly synthesize and apply what I know and think I know, I need a few kind and willing volunteers to help me get there. If that&#8217;s you, just go to <strong>https://tungle.me/honeyhelpyourself </strong>and put yourself on my calendar. Be sure to include a means to contact you. Or you can always email me <strong>honeyhelpyourself @ gmail.com</strong>, or you can  wait for me to intuit how to reach you.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever worked with me before, you know my readings are all about affirming your own awesomeness and power to choose. Please know that if you choose to help me out in this way, I can guarantee two things: 1. I won&#8217;t slide into a fake accent to distract you; and 2. you will definitely get your money&#8217;s worth!</p>

This piece is a re-tread of "Come On Out, Honey!" which I wrote back in October. But because I'm on a working vacation of sorts, I thought it was well-suited to record and present again here. Here's why: the original piece was written in celebration of National Coming Out Day and, in the spirit of living out loud, I took the opportunity to let everybody know—those who weren't already familiar with my 'closet' metaphysical practices—that I was indeed a, shhh, spiritual person.  In that original piece (posted in October 2010), I addressed the insecurities that came up when a friend asked if she could 'out' me on Facebook.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/NutsNHoney.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2178" title="Supermarket" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/NutsNHoney.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="276" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a week—a rickety emotional ride for every frigging minute of the 168 hours that comprised the last seven days. More or less. Well, if you want to break it down, I suppose you could take away the 56 hours I slept and the 40 I frittered away at work, which account for a different realm of headache than the issues I&#8217;m addressing here. Then we&#8217;ve got the time with friends, perhaps some of which was allotted to discussing the issues I&#8217;m about to lay out for you, but, for the most part, the time I took enjoying my friends isn&#8217;t the focus of this post, so yeah, let&#8217;s subtract 15 more from our running total.</p>
<p><span id="more-1437"></span></p>
<p>By now, my 168 hours of angst and upset is looking more like 57, but since I&#8217;m on a kick, I&#8217;ve got to go one better and tell you I burned lots of hours on the basics, too—maintaining my general upkeep and securing food, clothing and shelter type stuff—in addition to meditation and true minutia like texting, cyber jiving and thumb twiddling that I won&#8217;t bother to detail here. So the final tally for time in hours spent pissed off and emotionally locked in the jaws of this week&#8217;s beast was more like 6. I&#8217;m happy to report that I&#8217;ve got some perspective now, so I can see more objectively into these events, which couldn&#8217;t have been any more divinely timed—or absurd. And I assure you, it didn&#8217;t feel so &#8220;divine&#8221; being on the receiving end at the time.</p>
<p>Still, upset is upset—whether it&#8217;s 6 seconds or 6 hours. Granted, we all have those moments that challenge our good natures and make us want to call it all off, go fetal, pull the blankie up around our ears and not come out of our darkened rooms in the victim &#8216;hood until further notice. Believe me, I get it.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take my week of outrage as an example—okay, my 360 minutes of anger. On Sunday I had a phone reading with a lovely client who was referred to me by a dear friend we had in common. At the end of our session, the client and I had begun to chat about our wonderful mutual friend and during our exchange it turned out that this client and I had been to several of the same social events without ever having met officially at the time.</p>
<p>The client and I went on to talk about how much fun we&#8217;d had at one particular party when the client added how funny it was to see <em>that one van full of black people driving around in the dirt parking lot.</em></p>
<p><em>Hmm,</em> I thought. <em>What do we have here? </em>I asked myself. <em>Nothing,</em> I decided.</p>
<p>Very shortly thereafter we said our polite goodbyes and ended the call. As I considered the client&#8217;s comment, almost immediately my mind raced back to earlier that morning in the hardware store when, after finally having found the perfect terra cotta pot for the new plant I&#8217;d just bought, I rounded the corner of the aisle in the direction of the register when I noticed a woman who, not a moment before had been engaged in a lively chat with a man across the aisle roughly 4 feet away. Her eyes meeting mine, she scrambled back over to her shopping cart to secure the zippers and straps on the purse sitting unattended in the top compartment of the shopping cart near the end of the aisle from whence I had emerged.</p>
<p><em>Okay,</em> I thought. <em>Here we are again.</em> I say <em>again</em> because a similar incident happened in the Safeway a few days prior when a woman reaching for a can of beans down the aisle from me noticed my approach and quickly abandoned what she&#8217;d been doing to close the 2-foot chasm between herself, her cart and her precious purse.</p>
<p>Skip to the Saturday night concert I attended with my Kenyan friend Adimu as the two of us are laughing and chatting when a handsome white guy named Steve approached us and spoke of how he&#8217;d noticed us earlier at the bar, but he&#8217;d been <em>too afraid to talk to us because, well,</em> he said, he just didn&#8217;t <em>know</em>.</p>
<p><em>Didn&#8217;t know</em> what? Adimu and I smiled, inquiring in unison.</p>
<p><em>Well,</em> he flushed,<em> you were just standing there talking and you&#8217;re so exotic and beautiful. I just had to say hi.</em></p>
<p>The three of us chatted a bit and as he turned to go, my friend and I thanked him for saying hello. Later, we puzzled at how many more men probably felt similarly at seeing us.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s skip to the Memorial Day festival event at held down at the town creek when my friend Kelly and I venture into a stall to fawn over some particularly beautiful wind chimes. No sooner had we entered the stall than the vendor, who was white, tells my friend and I how stunning we are and how much <em>grounding energy</em> we&#8217;ve brought to her booth. So much of it, in fact, that it&#8217;s calmed the winds that had been kicking up all about the festival tents that day. Oh, I should mention here that my friend Kelly is also black.</p>
<p>I purchased a gorgeous wind chime, we smiled politely and said our goodbyes. Later, Kelly and I puzzled over how we might bottle and market our black magic to the masses.</p>
<p>Moving along. The following Saturday night: Adimu and I are standing on the sidewalk talking after having met for dinner. She&#8217;d asked me whether I&#8217;d heard about the latest pseudoscientific study outlining the myriad reasons why black women are the most ugly and fat of any women in the world. That&#8217;s according to a Japanese economist and blogger writing for a respected(?) psychology journal. By that point I was simply up to <strong>here</strong> with the madness and began to say as much when the distinct aroma of cannabis caught our attention.</p>
<p>Just as we recognized the wafting smell of pot in the air, a youngish brunette strolled up and clasped our right hands in hers before we could say a word. Then she began singing <em>don&#8217;t you worry about a thayayang pretty mammas</em> and kissed the backs of our palms, beaming at the both of us, repeatedly professing her undying love for Stevie Wonder and <em>do you love him, too? Don&#8217;t you just?</em> Her eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>Adimu and I smiled politely, nodded and said our goodbyes to the giddy young woman as she blew kisses in our direction, flashed us weak peace signs and strode away on the arm of an equally elated companion.</p>
<p>Like I said, <em>it&#8217;s been a week.</em></p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the thing: It&#8217;s so thoroughly tiresome to encounter people who are living in response to stereotypes, fears and foolishness. Even the occasional fantasy. Because it robs us of the chance to be ourselves and to create relationships from scratch, rather than from behind the eight ball of weird assumptions. Another truth: we all do it. And I like it even less when I see it at play in myself—it&#8217;s doubly exhausting because I <em>know</em> none of us are what we appear to be on the face of it all. In fact, we&#8217;re all of us far greater, infinitely more luminous, and just flat-out way more amazing than we realize. Can I get a witness here, honey? Anybody?</p>
<p>I want to run full-out, banging on drums, howling into the darkness like a loon, kicking up a ruckus, screaming this truth in the streets, but I&#8217;m afraid I might be profiled and surreptitiously disappeared into the Rockies.</p>
<p>Just kidding?</p>
<p>I want to let everybody know it&#8217;s safe and vitally necessary for us to come out from behind the lines, that it&#8217;s okay to drop our guards (not purses!) and really connect, to mingle more easily and simply <em>be</em>. It&#8217;s our duty to do so because it gives other people the permission to follow suit. And once we start taking this stuff seriously, the fact that we really are linked, like it or not, can&#8217;t you just <em>imagine all the people&#8230;</em> (cue John Lennon music). It could change the way we think, the movies that get made, the stuff we buy, the way we live and love.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s get started. I&#8217;m totally committed. Welcome one and all! Especially non-people of color! Or is that people of non-color? Okay, so first meeting&#8217;s at my place, Sunday. 2.5 hours max—150 minutes. There will be tofu turkey, potato salad. Maybe even a clown. You in?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/the-horizon1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1416" title="the horizon" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/the-horizon1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>You know that feeling of slowly waking up from a fog of days – weeks, months or more – of time spent navel gazing or gaping in the direction of a horizon you know is your own but doesn&#8217;t feel the least bit familiar?</p>
<p><span id="more-1412"></span></p>
<p>The Horizon: that metaphorical creme-filled moment of finally having arrived, of having at last achieved the elusive thing that would snap your life into place like the sorely needed chiropractic adjustment you never had. This horizon is the hoped for moment when you finally have all the money, time, freedom, courage, sex and love you need to live the life you&#8217;ve always wanted. This mythical place exists as a faraway, would-be parallel life that flickers in the distance, teasing us with the lure of perfect-world conditions tailor made for us if only&#8230;if only.</p>
<p>Recognize that place? Put another way, let&#8217;s say this horizon represents all of those goals you set for yourself by way of daydreaming, wishing, whining or laying down in writing way back in January. Yep – resolutions! – those things loosely hoped for and unmoored enough in our intentions to get pushed so far out to sea that they become practically impossible to bring back into focus or ever feel excited about again.</p>
<p>When our goals get set adrift, it becomes easy to dry up at the thought of traversing the uncertainty of murky waters and all that lies beneath you and the dream.</p>
<p>At the same time, those dull shores of our good intentions and rationalizing feel about as comfortable as the silent but deadly pull of quicksand. So, what to do when you feel yourself frozen and sinking fast in desperation for the unlived life?</p>
<p>For starters, breathe. Not only will doing so help you calm down and keep an unsightly meltdown at bay, but breathing and taking time to really feel the air moving through you is a tremendously simple, simply powerful grounding force that connects you to the moment, and what&#8217;s more present than breathing? It also keeps you tapped in to your own guidance and sends a message to your body that you&#8217;re safe, which helps it reduce the rush of what I call Holy Crap hormones that get deployed by our brains when shit hits the fan.</p>
<p>A &#8220;real world&#8221; scenario looks like this: On Monday, May 23rd, I awoke under a cloud of dread. For all intents and purposes, it was my own personal D Day. D as in discussion. D as in big decisions. D as in dammit. My D Day meant I had to meet with Greg, the financial planner. The only other day I dreaded as much or more than that came roughly 6 months ago, when I met with him for the first time this year.</p>
<p>Greg and I spent the morning – which to outside eyes looked more like fifty minutes – talking about money. My money. More like <em>he</em> spent the time talking about it while I attempted to listen, glassy-eyed in his direction as he assessed my situation, suggesting areas for improvement and proactive strategies that would keep me from being relegated to a cat-food diet in my twilight years. As he walked me toward the door I felt the clenching in my chest began to loosen as I slowly returned to normal breathing.</p>
<p>On the way home I wondered whether anyone else had ever felt as utterly frustrated and perplexed as I had in that moment. Sure, I&#8217;d heard accounts of people whose lives had been irrevocably wrecked by corporate greed and the likes of Enron as well as those who&#8217;d been mislead by woefully misguided Madoffs the world over. I also knew about recent catastrophic events on Wall Street and the current numbers that painted a far from pretty picture of the world&#8217;s economy. So, no, I knew intellectually that I was hardly alone in my concern about the financial future. I also knew that because I had the luxury of having resources enough to engage the help of a professional said volumes in and of itself.</p>
<p>Still, this was <em>me</em> we&#8217;re talking about, and that made it different somehow. Or so I told myself. More to the point, after our exchange I saw very clearly that I&#8217;d been picking at the bones of a leftover message that said I wasn&#8217;t good with money, and was in some way undeserving, destined to live from hand to mouth if I was lucky, despite the The Numbers that unequivocally said otherwise. That&#8217;s when I knew it was time to reach for help.</p>
<p>After our extended projections about how I could make my dollars stretch, climb, reach and expand across the void and swim upstream against a down current and then emerge from troubled waters to fly skyward, with an eye toward feathering my nest for the day when I was an old bird and would need it most – frankly, it was all too much. And I&#8217;d been way too emotional about the whole thing.</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m the <em>creative</em> one, I fed on the message given to me that said artists starve and because they do, they&#8217;re rarely savvy in business, nevermind what their Numbers say. In my head, number-crunching projectionists were aliens who spoke above my head in indecipherable percentage points and economic jargon that ranked lower even than the last item on my list of priorities. And my visit with Greg brought all of those old ghosts racing back to strike at the tender wounded artist heart of me. The room spun, my head throbbed and all I knew was I needed a cookie – fast!</p>
<p>The reason I chose this scenario was was not to admit how close I&#8217;d come to throwing my hands up in Jesus-take-the-wheel desperation at the mere suggestion of how I could make my money work harder for me. I use this example to illustrate yet again how vitally important it is to be in the moment and how equally necessary it is to enlist the help of a trained professional to provide us with a game plan when we can&#8217;t muster up an effective one of our own.</p>
<p>To my first point – and perhaps you&#8217;ll see how this example could apply to any number of your own blind spots and power struggles – because I woke up that morning with the <em>expectation</em> of dread and impending powerlessness, I had thrown myself completely out of the present and had yielded my power to the old fear-based lie of being a starving artist, destined to a paltry subsistence of cat food, cardboard boxes, and back alley gutters. All before my feet hit the floor. Honey, help!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse is that when I showed up, half-present to our meeting, I glazed over, looking for cover from a deadly ambush of The Numbers. So, I occupied myself by wondering about the antiquated flip phone I noticed sitting atop a mound of folders on Greg&#8217;s desk. I imagined that when people called him, their conversations were punctuated by the crackling background LP sound each time he said his piece.</p>
<p>But speaking of help, that&#8217;s the other point: it really is an act of empowerment to engage the assistance of trained professionals who know how to hold the space for us to truly get things done. And there&#8217;s absolutely no shame in that. And another thing: reaching for sweets in a time of perceived crisis is probably not the best means to achieving long-term results other than diabetes and weight gain.</p>
<p>For lots of years I&#8217;d said I wanted, needed, to organize my financial life in a way that I hadn&#8217;t felt confident enough to do on my own. So this year I flipped the script and actually did something I was good at in service to my goal: I made a list of objectives and browsed the web with them in mind. I placed some calls and booked informational appointments with advisors I felt I&#8217;d click with. And <em>voilà</em>, introducing Greg. I&#8217;m happy to say he&#8217;s fast become the ally I had in mind: a pro who wouldn&#8217;t flinch and bail when the markets tanked and interest rates rocketed. A formidable visionary whose passion and experience would help me stay the course and finish stronger than I might have, left to my on devices &#8230; and, until now, excuses.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever found it hard to ask for help in service to something you wanted to do, something that&#8217;s been in rotation on your own goals list for years, and especially if you&#8217;ve ever knocked yourself for not being able to <em>just do it</em> on your own, then you&#8217;ve probably experienced the dizziness getting stuck in this kind of irrational roundabout.</p>
<p>The truth is is that help is available when you make your needs known and reach out for it. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a matter of risking the truth of what&#8217;s eating you. Believe it or not, getting real about what&#8217;s been holding you back can act as the wind in your sails, setting you back on a direct course toward your dreams.</p>
<p>To me getting real – meaning getting outside of my own head and those old notions – enables me to breathe fully <em>into</em> the moment and <em>out</em> of the drama a lot more easily. Only then can I clear the way for real work to begin. Again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day, and because it is, I couldn&#8217;t let it pass without saying a little something – or a <em>lot</em> of something – about the enduring gift of a mother&#8217;s unconditional love. There&#8217;s nothing like it and I&#8217;m so glad I got it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1395"></span></p>
<p>I used to be terrified I might one day <em>wind up</em> like my mother. More to the point, I was afraid of becoming a collection of the bad habits and beliefs I either associated or projected on to her. But, as I’m fond of saying, we have a choice in deciding who we want to be and become and, truer still, is the fact that I couldn’t become my mother even if I’d wanted to.</p>
<p>With lots of forgiveness for us both, with grieving and releasing the past, and ongoing therapy – whether it was retail, culinary, or psychological. All of which were all invaluable in helping me release the resistance that held me in impossible opposition to all things mom for so long. Eventually, I happened into a newfound respect for all the great many gifts I couldn’t lay claim to had it not been for having her as my mother. Self-reliance, creativity, resilience, humor and a love of thrift stores are but a few of these traits that come to mind.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I remember telling a friend during a particularly challenging time in my relationship with my mother, that “I don’t have the mother I want; I have the mother I have.” It was an unguarded confession that stunned us both and succinctly captured the unarticulated pain and frustration that quite often comes with the territory of mother-daughter relationships.</p>
<p>What really surprised me in that moment of revelation was not that I’d shown my friend a less-than-perfect picture of my relationship with my mother; rather, it was my unconscious acceptance of who we were to each other – my mom and I – without my having to nurse yet again the insatiable ache of hoping she’d understand me, <em>get</em> me, see me in a way she never could. In the way I wanted her to.</p>
<p>In all fairness, I also wasn’t always the daughter I could have been either. Because I couldn’t be. And just like I felt my mom didn’t see me, I had plenty of blind spots where she was concerned, too. I have no doubt that between my mom’s mom and the long line of mothers before her, there is a great field littered with far too many lost treasures, stolen moments, and broken hearts to sift through in search of a place to lay blame for the who’s and why’s of how we relate to each other in the end. To say the least, the mother-daughter relationship is a predicated on a series of choices so extensive and intricate, well, where to begin, you know? And by the way, starting in with blame is absolutely useless.</p>
<p>And yet it’s a cycle, which, if we stay with the work, it can be an amazing grace-filled vehicle for delivering us back to an enormous sense of compassion for our mothers. I’ll speak for myself on this point, anyway. I found new room to appreciate my mother and all the richness she has brought and continues to bring to my life.</p>
<p>Because I’ve learned how to pull out of self-pity and grief at what I perceived to be the missed opportunities for us both to bond more deeply, I can count myself fortunate to be mothered by a hardwearing woman who raised four kids as a young divorcee in the shadow of segregation in the post Jim Crow south with little more to fall back on for support than prayer and the fact that everything would look different in the morning.</p>
<p>Sure, I didn’t have the mother I wanted — the fairytale mom with who’d feed me treats instead of greens, keep me stocked with designer jeans, and fight anybody who didn’t let me have exactly what I wanted on my very own timeline. Yeah, that mom who’d let me party and run my life the way I wanted as a teenager with no questions asked was so <em>not</em> the mom I got. I got the mom whose tough love wound up pressing me into a belief in myself that has served me well in the world. My mother’s love stretched me to open my heart in directions that, while foreign to her, were perfect for me.</p>
<p>Our relationship was tough going at times, for sure. But, at the end of the day — at the beginning, too — I know my mother’s love, or maybe it’s the expression of Universal love shining through my mother’s lens, is the stuff that never fades.</p>
<p>All told, I’m grateful to have gotten I got the mom I got. Because, for better or worse, I wouldn’t be who I am without her. Funny, but I think that makes her not only <em>not</em> the mom I wanted, and yes, the mom I have, but it also makes her the exactly right one for me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Threads.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-762" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Threads-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>Whenever I talk to my writing students about their work, I often introduce the topic of threads, or themes and recurring images that run throughout their stories, hold them together, and propel their narratives forward. We also talk about how well or poorly they flow as a result. And that&#8217;s when the discussion really heats up.</p>
<p><span id="more-761"></span>Threads are a perfect metaphor for our own life stories, too. I was the weird one growing up. Most people I knew might have described me as <em>creative</em> – which more often than not suggested an offputting predilection toward all things fantastic, dreamy, and inaccessible to anyone living outside my head. I was also deemed too <em>sensitive</em>, which didn&#8217;t help matters when facing unsolicited criticism for sharing the stories of my, well, anything. All of which can test the limits of even the most patient albeit, unprepared parent.</p>
<p>I had an extremely rich inner life, full of stories and color and ideas just waiting for me to reel them in from the ether and share with anyone in within earshot. In so doing, it happened that I often knew things I wasn&#8217;t supposed to. My dreams were vivid; inspiration and imagination were my constant companions and I was, as you might expect, a tremendously high-spirited and, some would say, annoying child.</p>
<p>Like lots of imaginative kids, I sometimes heard people talking to me and around me, without ever necessarily seeing anybody. Somehow, I knew I had support beyond what I saw and consciously understood. Some were people I knew or knew of, others not.</p>
<p>I remember recurring dreams in which I was told that I could <em>see</em> despite the fact that I knew my eyes were closed. From an early age, I&#8217;d been aware that there were different levels of consciousness available to us yet untapped. In school, I was always had among the most colorful ideas in class. Without fail, my mouth was the first to fly open with intricate explanations of story lines, artistic interpretations, and meanings behind metaphors; my penchant for unwrapping tricky symbolism like Christmas gifts to share with the group was unparalleled – and usually under-appreciated. I&#8217;ve also always had a cast of colorful friends that spanned the gamut of interests, orientation and ethnicity. In retrospect, it&#8217;s easy to see how those threads ran seamlessly through every area of my life. These days I see them as the integral, if not defining elements of my life&#8217;s purpose, present by varying degrees, in everything I do.</p>
<p>One of the things I wanted most in life – aside from the proverbial pony and private island all my own – was to be truly seen and understood as the magical, deeply dreaming child that I was. And although this validation was a long way off – decades away – I would first have to learn to dismantle the parts of me that drew all the criticism. Fortunately for me it didn&#8217;t work. Those threads of my early story kept running through my life like they&#8217;d been forever fastened to a silent loom spinning in the backdrop, all the while working up an amazing tapestry that I delight in displaying with pride today.</p>
<p>Like I&#8217;ve said before, disentangling other people&#8217;s agendas and opinions from our own in order to get to the truth of who we are and what we came here to do can sometimes feel like an uphill slog through driving rain, funky headwinds and low visibility. And that&#8217;s because once we begin the excavation of feelings that have been stuffed and denied over the years, we come face to face with it all. But, the truth is, to get to the heart of who we are, there&#8217;s no way around it. You can&#8217;t Tivo, text or phone in this kind of work.</p>
<p>When you stick with it, you enter into a true sense of a Self that looks nothing like the person you thought you knew or paraded around as in the past. In a word, becoming yourself – which, in my opinion, <em>is</em> our life&#8217;s work, passion and mission – takes bravery. And it&#8217;s worth every step. The 19th century British writer George Holbrook Jackson once said, <em>Happiness is a form of courage</em> and I know what he means.</p>
<p>Funny thing about growing up is, I realized the qualities I&#8217;d been shamed for — creativity, sensitivity, and curiosity — were actually my highest and brightest gifts all along. After Joseph Campbell, the late great American mythologist, writer and lecturer, expressed this sentiment in the phrase <em>Follow your bliss</em>, he later explained he wasn&#8217;t talking about pursuing unchecked selfishness and hedonism. In fact, he added that he should have said <em>Follow your blisters,</em> because the work he was really talking about – the work of becoming ourselves – required cahunas and fortitude of mythic proportions.</p>
<p>The fact that the work I do helps people find their own threads and points them back to what they&#8217;ve known for themselves, but might have been too afraid or unsure how to appreciate on their own, suits me perfectly. And, up to this point, I haven&#8217;t found any more satisfying work than to offer a truly spirit-filled hello to the heart of another human being.</p>
<p>It was a long time in coming, but being able to see how the threads of my life have been taking shape all along – and despite my attempts to cut them short – has led me to an appreciation of my purpose and a full-on embrace of what makes me who I am in the momen.</p>
<p>What are the major threads and themes running through <em>your</em> story? What&#8217;s with that recurring desire to tap into the greater part of yourself? What about those proverbial loose ends of <em>you</em> that you may have tried to unfriend, snip or explain away over time? And how about that whispery inspiration that seems to have always been there, patiently hanging out, doodling along your margins, starved for your focus?</p>
<p>If any of this sounds foreign to you, them maybe I&#8217;ve got it all wrong. Perhaps you&#8217;re one of those mythical creatures I&#8217;ve heard tell of; a SuperBeing whose got it all sewn up. You&#8217;re so special and rare, you hang with the likes of rainbow-chasing unicorns, mer people and the Bigfoot posse, right? Ok, then. But if life should ever catch you feeling pointless and frayed out &#8217;round the edges, it might do you some good to slow down a minute and check your threads.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Whenever I talk to my writing students about their work, I often introduce the topic of threads, or themes and recurring images that run throughout their stories, hold them together, and propel their narratives forward. We also talk about how well or poorly they flow as a result. And that's when the discussion really heats up.

Threads are a perfect metaphor for our own life stories, too. I was the weird one growing up. Most people I knew might have described me as creative – which more often than not suggested an offputting predilection toward all things fantastic, dreamy, and inaccessible to anyone living outside my head. I was also deemed too sensitive, which didn't help matters when facing unsolicited criticism for sharing the stories of my, well, anything. All of which can test the limits of even the most patient albeit, unprepared parent.

I had an extremely rich inner life, full of stories and color and ideas just waiting for me to reel them in from the ether and share with anyone in within earshot. In so doing, it happened that I often knew things I wasn't supposed to. My dreams were vivid; inspiration and imagination were my constant companions and I was, as you might expect, a tremendously high-spirited and, some would say, annoying child.

Like lots of imaginative kids, I sometimes heard people talking to me and around me, without ever necessarily seeing anybody. Somehow, I knew I had support beyond what I saw and consciously understood. Some were people I knew or knew of, others not.

I remember recurring dreams in which I was told that I could see despite the fact that I knew my eyes were closed. From an early age, I'd been aware that there were different levels of consciousness available to us yet untapped. In school, I was always had among the most colorful ideas in class. Without fail, my mouth was the first to fly open with intricate explanations of story lines, artistic interpretations, and meanings behind metaphors; my penchant for unwrapping tricky symbolism like Christmas gifts to share with the group was unparalleled – and usually under-appreciated. I've also always had a cast of colorful friends that spanned the gamut of interests, orientation and ethnicity. In retrospect, it's easy to see how those threads ran seamlessly through every area of my life. These days I see them as the integral, if not defining elements of my life's purpose, present by varying degrees, in everything I do.

One of the things I wanted most in life – aside from the proverbial pony and private island all my own – was to be truly seen and understood as the magical, deeply dreaming child that I was. And although this validation was a long way off – decades away – I would first have to learn to dismantle the parts of me that drew all the criticism. Fortunately for me it didn't work. Those threads of my early story kept running through my life like they'd been forever fastened to a silent loom spinning in the backdrop, all the while working up an amazing tapestry that I delight in displaying with pride today.

Like I've said before, disentangling other people's agendas and opinions from our own in order to get to the truth of who we are and what we came here to do can sometimes feel like an uphill slog through driving rain, funky headwinds and low visibility. And that's because once we begin the excavation of feelings that have been stuffed and denied over the years, we come face to face with it all. But, the truth is, to get to the heart of who we are, there's no way around it. You can't Tivo, text or phone in this kind of work.

When you stick with it, you enter into a true sense of a Self that looks nothing like the person you thought you knew or paraded around as in the past. In a word, becoming yourself – which, in my opinion, is our life's work, passion and mission – takes bravery. And it's worth every step. The 19th century British writer George Holbrook Jackson once said,</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Dinosaur.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2038" title="Dinosaur at Riverbank 6377" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Dinosaur.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>My neighbor&#8217;s kid is brilliant. He&#8217;s nine and because he&#8217;s all-knowing and misses no opportunity to remind us of it, he tells his mom one day as she&#8217;s taking a swig from her water bottle, <em>Hey mom, did you know you&#8217;re drinking dinosaur pee?</em> When my neighbor relayed that story to me, I laughed, thinking her son was being cute and wanted to hold her attention by making her laugh – and maybe, think.<br />
<span id="more-1326"></span>I had a boyfriend once who professed during a moonlit stroll as he pointed toward the night sky: <em>I come from the moon and the stars, you know.</em> I should add here that he was five kinds of yummy and back then he could have told me he was Mork from Ork and I&#8217;d have grinned and pressed my hand deeper into his just to let him know how well I and only I understood him.</p>
<p>Then I heard an interview with a respected researcher who echoed these previous sentiments of my friends: in many ways, we really are out of this world. The researcher went on to say that our water has come to us through the outer reaches of space and time – and is constantly being recycled throughout the universe. And when you throw in the fact that our bodies are composed mostly of water, it casts new light on the phrase <em>heavenly creatures</em>, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>When I considered these events coupled with my experience of having worked with hundreds of clients, it only underscores the irrefutable truth that we each carry within us the mystery and grandeur of the universe itself. Now that&#8217;s deep. And I&#8217;m here to tell you, <em>So are we</em>.</p>
<p>Every time I read for a client I&#8217;m filled with awe at the connections fostered and forged by spirit that allow me to relay information so rich and intimate that I ordinarily wouldn&#8217;t know about a person I may never physically meet. And whenever they ask me how I&#8217;m able to do what I do, I tell them among other things that far from being a cool party trick or special gift bestowed upon a select few, what I’m doing constitutes an acknowledgment and evidence of a greater matrix that connects us all within its design and, outside of which, possibly nothing exists.</p>
<p>So, I add, if ever you feel forgotten, unseen or <em>misremembered</em> by the world, rest assured that you come from something far greater, ancient, even, and that you&#8217;re part of a magnificence that defies our very notion of space and time. And if that&#8217;s not enough, you’re part dinosaur pee, so how about that?</p>
<p>You see? Just look how awesome you are.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230;this isn&#8217;t the reality most folks live in, let alone believe. Trust me, I don&#8217;t kid myself about that bleak detail, as a recent exchange with a well-intentioned friend illustrates. Mind you, the moment has long since passed and I&#8217;ve forgotten the context in which it was said, but what I do recall clearly is that it was a reprimand that went something like <em>don&#8217;t forget where you come from.</em></p>
<p>Now let me interrupt this story here to tell you that wordsmithing and storytelling are among my many loves and, consequently, language is huge for me, despite my occasional inability get it right sometimes. Which accounts for my need to sit with what my friend said for awhile before I could articulate a response.</p>
<p>When I put all my talk of spirits, moonbeams and prehistoric divinity aside, the matter of <em>where I come from</em> seems thin and pointless except that I can&#8217;t resist pointing out that the phrase itself, ironically, contains within it the very seeds of change given its implication that I&#8217;m no longer where or who I once was. And if you’ve followed any of my previous posts, you already know that I know that change can be a real sonofagun to people around you – especially when you’re in the thick of it.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when someone tells me not to forget where I&#8217;m from, I take it as a statement that, on a good day, is drenched in low expectation and insecurity that goes way back and, usually has nothing to do with me. Now to my friend&#8217;s thinking, I was perceived as uppity because I chose to live well, and beyond the old box I&#8217;d been given.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my thing, just in case I haven&#8217;t made my case clearly enough already: To well-intentioned types who profess to have victimized by the world and left for roadkill, if they’re choosing to play dead, or if they&#8217;ve run out of steam on the boulevard of dreams, it doesn&#8217;t mean I have to throw myself into reverse or shift gears in any direction for fear of arriving at my destination. Following my own path meant I&#8217;d be leaving some folks behind in the process. I knew that, going in. Not to get all Ayn Rand and <em>survival-of-the-fittest</em> on you, but what I’m talking about here is honoring that original part of ourselves that <em>knows we can</em> even if we don’t. It’s not fearful, stuck or beholden to peanut galleries, crabs in buckets or victimy whngy bitches who’d love nothing better than to see you fail. Dig?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more is that when you <em>come from</em> or come <em>into</em> a world, a culture, a society or even an mindset or mentality that would seek to train you away from your innate divinity, as we all have to some degree, it&#8217;s no wonder we buy into lies that would have us believe we don’t matter, and that we’re forever bound by the strictures of a tiny, random patch of dirt for the whole of our lives. Nothing could be farther from the truth of our Origins.</p>
<p>When you think about it, if you think about it, the fact that we&#8217;re connected to a greater organism that we can&#8217;t begin to fathom, that our bodies are composed of bits of the very celestial bodies that shine down on us every night – when you take all this together, then we really are stars…and dinosaur pee, but stars nonetheless. C&#8217;mon, even Prince has a song called &#8220;Baby, I&#8217;m a Star&#8221; so if you don&#8217;t believe me, listen to him, alright?</p>
<p>Granted, may take a lifetime, I think, to truly remember where we come from and to get a solid fix on what we&#8217;re essentially made of. And every time I step deep into this energy in my own personal work and in my work with clients, that&#8217;s when I&#8217;m blissfully flooded with memories of who I Am at heart.</p>
<p>As it turns out, my friend might have had it right all along when reminded me not to forget where I came from. If only she knew how much I&#8217;ve begun to recall.</p>

<p>One of the first items I created for this site was the <a href="../?page_id=6">About Me</a> page. By the time I finally sat down to write it, I had already spent weeks in my head—months, really, if you include time spent as a deer in headlights—composing the entry that would project a reasonably accurate image of who I was and clearly explain what I hoped to accomplish with Honey Help YourSelf. Nevermind the fact that I still don’t really know what I want this venture to ultimately do, but, since when is indecision a reason not to go for it?</p>
<p>Setting up that first page was tough because I realized it would have to somehow set the tone for everything that followed. No pressure, I just needed to explain who I was in a few hundred well chosen words so that it made sense to those who knew me and to the many visitors I would never meet in person. The gist of that introduction was to be well-reasoned, welcoming, and intelligent despite the fact that I sometimes find myself running low on those sparkling traits.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I thought, those visitors would be forming judgments about me based on what I wrote. And while it’s not that I mind those judgments so much, what concerns me is the challenge of presenting as clear a picture of myself–and my ideas–as I could.</p>
<p>So, in an attempt to break that task down into a bite-sized, doable assignment rather than an impossibly large and <em>unpindownable</em> one, I started in with the most basic question of all: Who am I anyway?</p>
<p>I liken the consideration of this question to pulling that loose strand of yarn at the tail end of a homemade scarf. Once you start tugging at it, the initial urge to keep going wears off. Still, you persist and the whole thing unravels, leaving you wondering what it is exactly that you’re left with. Do you salvage it? Do you toss it altogether in favor of a warmer, fuzzier scarf while pretending not to have trashed the original? Or do you poke at that pile, marveling at the relative ease of pulling apart something that took so long to create?</p>
<p>Such is the case with identity. Whether we’re aware of it or not, we spend lots of time creating the pictures we present to the world. Don’t get me wrong–families, friends, society, education, and all of the cultural <em>isms</em> play their part in shaping our identities too, but because this site is dedicated to the individual, I’ll try to leave the group dynamics alone.</p>
<p>Here’s how it went: When I started pulling at the loose ends of my own metaphorical identity scarf, I was surprised to find that all of my seemingly conflicting parts could co-exist and even compliment each other every now and again without leaving me strung out in a heap on the floor. Usually. This little exercise left me with lots more appreciation for the complexity and quirkiness I embody and even tweaked my take on how I fit in the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I drew up a list of identifiers, a few of which I’ll share with you here. I’ve used and may still use these at various points in my life, and, man, I’m thinking Chaka Khan and Whitney Houston were on to something when they sang, I’m Every Woman (with emphasis on <em>every</em>). Which leads me back to an earlier question, which I’d like to present to you as well: Who do you think <em>you</em> are?</p>
<p><strong>BLACK:</strong> Actually, it’s more like fifty years ago I would have been ‘black,’ and a few years before that, I’d have been ‘colored.’ Track back to the turn of the last century and I would have been identified as ‘Negro.’ These days, it’s been decided I’m African-American. By whom? Sharpton? Jackson? (I’m so <em>not </em>talking about our dearly departed King of Pop.) Add to that the contingent that deems me ‘not black enough’ and those who’d define me as ‘too black,’—on top of the folks offering sideways compliments that I’ve transcended race altogether and that, gee, they <em>didn’t even notice</em> I was/am black—and damn if I know how black I’m supposed to be after all that!</p>
<p><strong>AMERICAN:</strong> Whenever I travel abroad and people hear me speak, it’s a pretty clear I’m from the good ole U S of A. However. I’ve had several instances of conditional acceptance from ‘foreigners’ on that point. Like the Parisian waiter who pulled me aside and said, ‘Vous? Americaine? Ohhh, but zees is not your fault.’ Within these borders, it’s a different story. I often draw the attention of West Indians and black Africans—or would they be called African-Africans, Continental Sub-Saharan Africans, or what?—and they’re hungry to know <em>where I’m from</em> as if their assessment of me hinges on my response. We could lease a truck and drive it through the stunned silence that almost always follows my flat reply of ‘Virginia.’</p>
<p><strong>MIDDLE-AGED:</strong> When I look in the mirror these days, I still see the same woman who wanted to run marathons, travel the world, love deeply, learn a foreign language, and sip wine, and have sex on at least four continents. Despite having ticked many of those items off of my list, I still seek adventure. I still watch the occasional cartoon and wear tight clothes, too. Heck, some folks still call me ‘the baby’ when they learn I’m the youngest of four. Now, setting aside any obvious graceless traits that may appear in those moments when I’m called upon to be mature and insightful, I ask you, how can a forty year-old woman—me/I!—be a baby? (Don’t answer.)</p>
<p><strong>WRITER:</strong> So I write. But not all the time. And what kind of legitimate writer doesn’t write? Even when I was handing in articles every four weeks for a lifestyle magazine, I didn’t consider myself a real writer. (<em>Real</em> writers don’t cover the latest fashion trends and packing tips for desert dude ranch vacations do they? They don’t gush in print over ridiculously expensive pocketbooks and lo-fat recipes either, right?) Then I got published by a literary journal and felt quite accomplished for all of three weeks, despite their having spelled my name wrong.</p>
<p>One way I know I’m feeling more comfortable with the writing craft these days that I don’t fly into a tizzy at the thought of sharing my work with the world. Because one thing being a writer means is I need readers. And that I’ve got to produce. So, for better or worse, taaaa daaaah! here’s my work. Toward that end, I think William Faulkner makes a great point: “Get it down. Take chances. It may be bad, but it’s the only way you can do anything really good.” Amen, Honey!</p>
<p>Making this partial list reminds me that I exist beyond the confines of titles I wrestle with—especially those that have been chosen for me. Ever wonder who you’d be beyond the layers of your own labels? Without them, would you even recognize yourself?</p>

Nevermind the fact that I still don’t really know what I want this venture to ultimately do, but, since when is indecision a reason not to go for it?

Setting up that first page was tough because I realized it would have to somehow set the tone for everything that followed. No pressure, I just needed to explain who I was in a few hundred well chosen words so that it made sense to those who knew me and to the many visitors I would never meet in person. The gist of that introduction was to be well-reasoned, welcoming, and intelligent despite the fact that I sometimes find myself running low on those sparkling traits.

Inevitably, I thought, those visitors would be forming judgments about me based on what I wrote. And while it’s not that I mind those judgments so much, what concerns me is the challenge of presenting as clear a picture of myself–and my ideas–as I could.

So, in an attempt to break that task down into a bite-sized, doable assignment rather than an impossibly large and unpindownable one, I started in with the most basic question of all: Who am I anyway?

I liken the consideration of this question to pulling that loose strand of yarn at the tail end of a homemade scarf. Once you start tugging at it, the initial urge to keep going wears off. Still, you persist and the whole thing unravels, leaving you wondering what it is exactly that you’re left with. Do you salvage it? Do you toss it altogether in favor of a warmer, fuzzier scarf while pretending not to have trashed the original? Or do you poke at that pile, marveling at the relative ease of pulling apart something that took so long to create?

Such is the case with identity. Whether we’re aware of it or not, we spend lots of time creating the pictures we present to the world. Don’t get me wrong–families, friends, society, education, and all of the cultural isms play their part in shaping our identities too, but because this site is dedicated to the individual, I’ll try to leave the group dynamics alone.

Here’s how it went: When I started pulling at the loose ends of my own metaphorical identity scarf, I was surprised to find that all of my seemingly conflicting parts could co-exist and even compliment each other every now and again without leaving me strung out in a heap on the floor. Usually. This little exercise left me with lots more appreciation for the complexity and quirkiness I embody and even tweaked my take on how I fit in the bigger picture.

I drew up a list of identifiers, a few of which I’ll share with you here. I’ve used and may still use these at various points in my life, and, man, I’m thinking Chaka Khan and Whitney Houston were on to something when they sang, I’m Every Woman (with emphasis on every). Which leads me back to an earlier question, which I’d like to present to you as well: Who do you think you are?

BLACK: Actually, it’s more like fifty years ago I would have been ‘black,’ and a few years before that, I’d have been ‘colored.’ Track back to the turn of the last century and I would have been identified as ‘Negro.’ These days, it’s been decided I’m African-American. By whom? Sharpton? Jackson? (I’m so not talking about our dearly departed King of Pop.) Add to that the contingent that deems me ‘not black enough’ and those who’d define me as ‘too black,’—on top of the folks offering sideways compliments that I’ve transcended race altogether and that, gee, they didn’t even notice I was/am black—and damn if I know how black I’m supposed to be after all that!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Brimstone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2031" title="Brimstone" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Brimstone.jpg" alt="Birds, Bees, Fire and Brimstone. Young woman in a field of flowers." width="425" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of having a gentle mother-daughter conversation about the birds and the bees, I got a fire and brimstone sermon: <em>You think this feeling is love, but it ain’t. Love comes through Jesus. Those knuckle-headed boys don’t want nothing but to ruin your life and the only reason they come around acting like they like you is because they want to get in your pants. They don’t like you. They don’t want you either. And once they get what they want–after they’ve used you and taken something you can’t never get back–where will you be? </em></p>
<p><span id="more-1181"></span></p>
<p><em>They’ll leave you knocked up or knocked out somewhere in a gutter and then what? Where you gonna go? You ain’t coming back here because I can tell you I’m through raising babies in this house. Them twenty seconds of sin ain’t worth a lifetime of trouble. You better find love in the Lord if you know what’s good for you. But apparently you don’t because you’re so hot to throw yourself down behind these illiterate jailbound idiots. And for what? Ten seconds of pleasure, think you know so much. </em></p>
<p><em>Them boys don’t want you—them little ugly, nappy-headed rascals who don’t know no better than to scratch themselves in public. And for what? Five seconds of fun? They don’t care about you…”</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, her sermon worked. By the grace of our Lord, my grandmother, God and his assembly, I managed to avoid the evil clutches of those teeming, godless, rabid hooligans who went wilding in the streets, dicks in hand–cocked and ready–looking to do their business on tender preteens like me.</p>
<p>Nearing the end of my adolescence, and feeling mildly accomplished at having heeded my mother’s searing relationship messages, I proudly pointed myself in the direction of college, all but foregoing the forbidden pleasure of boys. My all but nonexistent dating life didn’t escape the notice of my mother. And that’s when she started asking questions like <em>Have you met anybody special yet?</em></p>
<p>She had no idea how deeply I had internalized her message of abstinence and ultimately, abandonment at the careless, callous hands of the unfair sex. By the time I’d hit my mid-twenties, I realized I’d steered clear of all manner of real relationships for years, choosing instead the risk-free types who didn’t ask much of me or require too much of an emotional investment.</p>
<p>There was the endearingly sexless geek whose idea of a hot weekend was ordering in and reading through a stack of obscure titles on loan from the neighborhood library. And the enigmatic foreign artist who’d suddenly succumb what he called the <em>constant tug</em> of his homeland whenever things heated up between us. And let’s not forget the kind-hearted borderline gay who kept my self-esteem on life support after a cool brooding musician and inflated jock played craps all over my emotions. All told, none of them were without their charm, but none of them had any real staying power either. I’d made sure of it. I’d been hardwired. Now I can’t say I was happy with what I got in return. But I can assure you I was safe. After all, men didn’t mean me no good, did they?</p>
<p>With the advent of my mother’s newfound crusade to get me hitched, I had a hard time reconciling her earlier insistence to the contrary. During our Saturday morning talks, she’d ply me with questions so predictable, she eventually resorted to plainly saying, <em>Well, you know what I’m gonna ask next.</em> Which consisted of at least two of the following, and not in any particular order: <em>Have you met Mr. Wonderful yet? What about Mr. Right or Mr. Right Now? Any secret admirers? Anybody calling? And lastly, Why are you being so picky and hard on men?</em></p>
<p>As the years progressed and my twenties came and went, the timbre of my man talk remained unchanged. From miles away I could feel my mother, having all but diagnosed my chronic manlessness as inoperable, sighing heavenward at the very real likelihood I wouldn’t be adding to the count of grandchildren she so enjoyed. All the while I marveled at her inability to understand how steadily her hard-driving sermon had been echoing in my head and repeating on me for so long.</p>
<p>By the time I’d entered my thirties, I realized I’d spent far too long feeling inadequate and, frankly, ugly around the men I liked. Sometimes, I’d have flashbacks of walking down my junior high school corridor smiling shyly at Kevin, the football and track star whom I secretly adored, only to have him point me out to his friends and make jokes at my expense. They laughed in my face.</p>
<p>But, I’m not fourteen anymore, I remind myself. And, despite the occasional suggestion to the contrary, I know that grown men don’t all act like insensitive, oversexed teenagers. Oh, and I can assure you that unpublished volumes of my own personal research has shown me that pleasure can indeed last much longer than five seconds.</p>
<p>It’s my good fortune to have met so many wonderful people who helped me debunk some longstanding beliefs of my childhood, those flinty ideas prized and passed down through the women in my family like purple hearts conferred for service in the Great War of Love. It was these friends and lovers who taught me I didn’t have to be a casualty of my own heart. And not every date, fling and flirtation needed to be met with stiff upper lips and riddled with grief, drama and dread. I actually had a choice about what happened. Mind you, I wasn’t a quick study, but eventually it started to make sense.</p>
<p>That’s why I love the quote from Alice Walker’s Celie when she says something like <em>I&#8217;m poor, I&#8217;m black, I might be ugly and can&#8217;t cook, but I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;m </em>here. Here’s a woman who – because of the odds against her – has learned to embrace herself and move courageously toward life on her own terms. She may stumble, but she loves who she is, understanding at last that she is divine, beautiful and free.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/reflections.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000" title="reflections" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/reflections.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Objects in your rearview mirror may appear closer than they seem. As far as today&#8217;s entry goes, truer words were never spoken-or in this case, poorly paraphrased. Looking at this image always takes me back to a reading I did once. As usual, the client was lovely, and the experience was illuminating for us both. At one point during our session, I saw the client in his car on an open road, his hands solidly grasping the wheel at ten and two. The quiet tree-lined street was lit by nothing more than a late afternoon sun. The picture was resplendent and warm – a very good sign as far as I was concerned. And yet, it felt &#8216;off.&#8217; For one thing, although my client was facing forward, his attention was focused behind him – in his rearview mirror – instead of out at the road and what lie ahead. And two, he wasn&#8217;t moving.</p>
<p><span id="more-999"></span></p>
<p>I use that snippet (with permission, of course) to illustrate not only the importance of separating ourselves out from the past in order to move ahead in life, but also to remind you that, if we know how to view them, mirrors to the past can be a great way to gauge our own progress. Neat, huh? Honey, who knew.</p>
<p>&#8216;Kay, so why this message now? you ask. Well, because it&#8217;s February, and February is the what-the-effingest month of short memory, of coming up short, of low motivation, of apathy, idling and neglect. And I&#8217;ll speak for myself here, but in the past two weeks alone, I&#8217;ve watched myself not only bungle, fumble and drop the metaphorical ball of my goals more times than I&#8217;ll ever let you in on. And how could I? After my last post — I mean, come on — I was all charged up and <em>gung ho</em> on my goals and everything was clicking and singing along just fine. But a hiccup arrived as Late January tugged at the edges of my magic carpet. Before I knew it, my <em>gung</em> was gone and all I had left was one tired <em>ho</em> that couldn&#8217;t be bothered to keep it up any longer, so to speak. Besides y&#8217;all, I&#8217;m the self-helping motivational one. I&#8217;m supposed to have all this stuff sewn up and at least be able to stay on track for a good ten days without buckling, right? Durrrr&#8230;</p>
<p>So: mirrors. Armchair Psych tells us mirroring occurs when a person&#8217;s actions are reflective of our own. For example, say you&#8217;re having a conversation with person A when A, who happens to like and respect you, starts unconsciously parroting your body language. Positive mirroring means A is engaged in what you&#8217;re saying and genuinely admires you and that&#8217;s a good thing. Unless, however, A is hip to this psych thing and is trying to manipulate you toward their own agendas, which then makes A an A-<em>hole</em>. Another form of mirroring occurs when people display behaviors we may recognize as our own, but are reflective of our past. This happens to us all the time in some form or another, and it can be a real game changer when we&#8217;re able to set our awareness on it. In my own recent experience I was relieved to find those mirrors of the past weren&#8217;t actually driving my life in the present. <em>Hot damn</em>, I thought, <em>shift really</em> does <em>happen!</em></p>
<p>A little story about one of several recent rearview mirroring incidents: I was in a bar — and, no, you don&#8217;t get to judge me for having meaningful life events in bars. Live a little! Anyway, we&#8217;re in this bar when my friend Matt tells me someone asked to buy a product from his brand new business. <em>Can you believe it?</em></p>
<p>Once Matt asked me that, I got triggered and all my alarms went off in that moment. But it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m a nasty drunk. I got triggered because, in case you didn&#8217;t already know it, I am freakishly serious when it comes to encouraging people in the direction of their dreams and toward the pull of the impossible. I mean, how can I not be? You think anybody struck up a parade for me when I announced I was going to do readings for complete strangers over the phone and get all up in their personal energy business and help them break down their blocks for a modest fee? You think I didn&#8217;t think twice about the glut of <em>bona fide</em> phonies who make my work seem that much more ridiculous – before deciding to go down this road? You think my loved ones hooted and hollered in jubilation when I <em>declared dead people aren&#8217;t really &#8216;dead&#8217; </em>and<em> we&#8217;re part of a Source that we&#8217;ll all return to one day</em> and that studying dreams and Jungian symbology was fast becoming a passion of mine? Yeah &#8230; no. <em><a title="Crickets" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2010/07/21/crickets/" target="_blank">Crickets</a></em>.</p>
<p>Oh, how easily the fragile embers of inspiration can be extinguished and abandoned at the slightest response, lack of response, perceived lack of response, poorly timed response from others. That&#8217;s part of why I got so pissed (as in angry, not drunk). Here he was, merely trying to be himself and follow the threads of his inspiration, but his fear was closing in without him even recognizing it, and what else could I do but mount up and ride in, my guns drawn against self-doubt and sabotage – the vicious tag team of catastrophe. Even though Matt was trying to enlist my &#8216;support&#8217; for his low-expectation having, confidence-lacking stance, it was the dreaming part of him that really called out to me. It requires a trained ear to listen for the weaving of one&#8217;s threads, and I discuss that in – you guessed it! – <em><a title="Threads" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/05/04/threads/" target="_blank">Threads</a></em>. I invite you to give it a look.</p>
<p>How many times have you had a tender hope or dream that you wanted to bring into the world and mustered up just enough courage to share the idea with someone you trusted and got nothing more than the stinkeye or worse in return? Sadly, repeated replies of non-support and indifference from others can lead us to believe that maybe our hopes are little more than jokes played on us by those in positions much higher than our own. It&#8217;s this kind of thinking that causes us to slam the doors on ourselves before we&#8217;ve even got going. I talk about this in <em><a title="Hold That Door!" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/10/08/hold-that-door-2/" target="_blank">Hold that Door</a></em>. But just because the dream gets dissed by some doesn&#8217;t make it unworthy of your best efforts to make it happen. And it&#8217;s never grounds for berating yourself before you&#8217;ve even begun. Such was the case with Matt. And all of us at various points along the way.</p>
<p>See, like most of us, Matt wasn&#8217;t willing to let himself move forward for his goal for lots of reasons that had accumulated over time. So he wedged himself into an impossible dark corner of insecurity and self-sabotage by acting surprised when a stranger showed up unbidden to openly inquire about his work. Rather than working on ways to stay the course with his project, Matt&#8217;s own self-doubt and ambivalence made him more comfortable laughing the incident off as a fluke yet again. Gotta love those reflections.</p>
<p>Hey, can we all join cyberhands in the spirit of kumbayah for a moment to collectively acknowledge all the times we&#8217;ve acted against ourselves and continue to do it in various ways all the time? Don&#8217;t worry, we won&#8217;t need candles or Coke products for this; this revelation will not be televised.</p>
<p>Rather than choosing to laugh with Matt that day, I looked into the mirror he unwittingly held for me and told him he&#8217;d better <em>never</em> again ask me to co-sabotage anything he truly wanted to do. Ev-er. <em>Of course I can believe in you and your work,</em> I yelled. <em>Why</em> wouldn&#8217;t <em>people want what you&#8217;re selling,</em> I cried. <em>And furthermore,</em> I wailed, <em>who are you</em> not <em>to use your natural born gifts when they can clearly help other people!</em></p>
<p>Speaking of A-holes, suffice it to say I cursed my friend <em>a new one</em> that night. Not because I was tipsy by then, or because I&#8217;d been scrambling to catch up on my own stuff, or even because it was coming up on February, the most short-sighted, bitter-fisted month of the year. I lathered my friend in expletives that night because, sometimes, it&#8217;s just what us ladies do in bars.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/FallWreath.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-830" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/FallWreath-296x300.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Ahh, the holidays. A time for selfless giving and sharing ourselves with loved ones and the occasional <em>strange</em> ones near and far. A time to present our favorite people, pets and neighbors, colleagues and cohorts with presents they’ll love us forever for. It&#8217;s a time to loosen our purse strings to charity, tax write-offs and special causes. You get my point: it’s time to give until it hurts. This year, though, I’d like to introduce a new way to engage the holidays, and every day, for that matter. Instead of giving until it hurts, how about we open to receiving until it heals?</p>
<p><span id="more-821"></span></p>
<p>Years ago, my friend Alice presented me with a gift for ‘no good reason.’ Actually, she wanted to present me with a gift. But I wouldn’t let her. Why? Because it made me feel weird that I was empty handed and hadn’t bought anything for her. It wasn’t Christmas, her birthday or a graduation of any kind, so I had no occasion to get her a gift, not to mention the fact that I didn’t think I ‘deserved’ one from her. In retrospect, I realize that I didn’t feel worthy of receiving on lots of levels. Still, my well-intentioned friend insisted I take it. I insisted that I not. I won. Yet we both lost.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a very nice man took an interest in me. We dated; things threatened to get serious; I bailed. Why? Because it made me feel weird that I was emotionally empty handed and felt I hadn’t really brought anything of value to our budding relationship. I was young, he was stable, not to mention the fact that on some level I didn’t think I ‘deserved’ real happiness or a sincerely nice guy. In retrospect, I realize I didn’t feel worthy of receiving on lots of levels. Still, he tried to convince me to give him a chance. I insisted that I not. I won. Yet we both lost. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got lots of <em>reasons</em> why I wasn&#8217;t ready for an emotional close up at various points throughout my past. I cover points like these in previous posts, too. For starters, I can point you to my <a title="Birds, Bees, and Honey" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/04/03/birds-bees-and-honey/" target="_blank">Birds, Bees, Fire and Brimstone</a> post, or my <a title="Victims" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/11/04/victims/" target="_blank">Victims</a> post, or <a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2011/08/17/the-list/">The List</a>, and even the <a title="P.S. I Love You" href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/2010/01/29/p-s-i-love-you/" target="_blank">PS I love You</a> post, too. All of these entries talk about how important – and hard sometimes – it is to acknowledge the wreckage and wounding of our past in order to clear it, to let go of old loves, lusts and losses in order to make room for the real deal, the <em>new</em> deal. And I assure you, it won&#8217;t be the last time I tread on that turf.</p>
<p>So here’s why receiving is at least as important as giving: when we’re open to receiving goodness in our lives, we emit an energy of gratitude for and faith in the unseen goodies that have yet to appear on the scene for us. Being in this kind of energy is what&#8217;s magnetic in the best kind of ways and, consequently, healing. It has the power to warm and unlock what you thought was a cold closed heart and it can melt the barnacles of busted relationships like butter while you&#8217;re at it, too. The American psychologist and lecturer, David Seabury said, <em>Enthusiasm is the best protection in any situation. Wholeheartedness is contagious. Give yourself, if you wish to get others. </em>I&#8217;m all for that.</p>
<p>When we give ourselves permission to receive all things in a spirit of openness and appreciation — without being driven by small-minded agendas or fear-based limitations predicated on the past (along with fear of the future based on the past!) — we get to participate in a cycle of good that all but invites others to give to us. And let’s not forget that in the act of giving, someone must also receive. Otherwise, nobody wins, remember?</p>
<p>Think about it. How open are you <em>really</em> to inviting your your good past the front door? Put another way, when’s the last time you denied your gifts — which include random acts of kindness, offers of friendship and support, sincere compliments, no-strings-attached tokens of love and affection, rampant joy, belly laughs just because, and all those myriad opportunities that tried like the dickens to land in your lap.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: how natural is it for you to accept a compliment? What if I told you you look positively smashing today, honey, and that you lift my spirits and make me smile whenever I think about you? Would it weird you out, make you uncomfortable? Would you call me crazy and douse the light being showered on you? Would you look me over in a mad scramble to match my spontaneous compliment out of obligation? Maybe you&#8217;d faint? Whatever your response, consider it your gauge of receptivity.</p>
<p>Receiving also opens us up to greater possibilities of surprise, expansion and prosperity — which can be catching, too, once we stop screwing and Scrooging ourselves out of the equation! When we allow ourselves open like this, what we’re saying to the world is, It’s okay for me to have, accept and receive, no matter what my past and peanut gallery think. It’s this kind of declaration that gets a message through to th e place where we exist outside of time and space and it lets the universe know we’re ready to step up our game. And I don&#8217;t have to tell you that the more we hang out in this kind of energy, the easier it is to give – because our cups are running over, we&#8217;re feeling bubbly and in the flow and, well, we just can&#8217;t help ourselves, honey! Before we know it, the old barnacles of self-sabotage begin to loosen and fall away and our gifts start rolling in like it was, I dunno, Christmas or something.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Ahh, the holidays. A time for selfless giving and sharing ourselves with loved ones and the occasional strange ones near and far. A time to present our favorite people, pets and neighbors, colleagues and cohorts with presents they’ll love us forever for. It's a time to loosen our purse strings to charity, tax write-offs and special causes. You get my point: it’s time to give until it hurts. This year, though, I’d like to introduce a new way to engage the holidays, and every day, for that matter. Instead of giving until it hurts, how about we open to receiving until it heals?

<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Leftovers1.jpg"><br />
</a><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Turkey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1812" title="Turkey" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Turkey-300x243.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="243" /></a></p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned, there&#8217;s never <em>not</em> a good time to express genuine thanks. And now that it&#8217;s Thanksgiving—an official day for assuming the position of gratitude—and on account of I&#8217;m partial to listmaking, I find that I&#8217;m so full of it–gratitude, that is!—I simply can&#8217;t resist sharing a partial inventory of items I&#8217;m happy about right now. Don&#8217;t let the numbering fool you, this list isn&#8217;t arranged in any particular order of preference; it&#8217;s <em>all</em> good.</p>
<p>1. <strong>CREATIVITY. </strong>I come from a long line of creative types. First in this line, my mama. Though I didn&#8217;t always want to own it, these days I can plainly say I&#8217;ve inherited my mom&#8217;s inventive eye for making old things new—from back before &#8216;green,&#8217; recycling, and niche boutiques came on the scene. I also have her knack for beating silk purses out of sows ears, for viewing the world through a quirky lens and for being able to find the juiciest of stories behind the obvious. She&#8217;s an interesting brand of visionary in her own right.</p>
<p><span id="more-763"></span></p>
<p>2. <strong>TIME.</strong> Willie Nelson sings a tune called &#8220;Healing Hands of Time&#8221; and it&#8217;s been on my short list for months. It&#8217;s a song about rebuilding a life from the ashes of heartbreak and the seemingly impossible task of it. Willie reminds us that sometimes time&#8217;s the only healer of &#8216;gloom, despair and agony on me.&#8217; (Anybody remember that tune from Hee Haw back in the day?) By the third time around the refrain we finally begin to believe we can let the song end without worrying he&#8217;s/I&#8217;m going to reach for kitchen knives or heavy artillery. Thanks, Willie!</p>
<p>3. <strong>HELP.</strong> Little did I know it at the time, but my decision to reach for<em> Soul Coaching: 28 Days to Discovering Your Authentic Self</em> three years ago would lead me to the seamless though protracted creation of this site, which in turn generated lots of inspiration, and I dare say, lots of material for my as yet unpublished book for which I have yet to write the manuscript. You can check out the blog that started it all <a href="http://honeyhelpyourself.blogspot.com/2008/04/flipping-script.html">here</a>. During the course of our 4 weeks together, I found Denise&#8217;s work was tailor made for me. Her penchant for dream interpretation, healing ritual, feng shui, all-around clutter clearing, intuition and intermittent butt-kicking has given more to my life than I can shake a ceremonial stick at and I love her for it.</p>
<p>4. <strong>DEBT.</strong> Don&#8217;t get me wrong on this one. While I dislike writing out monthly checks to So and So Credit Card Company and Acme Student Loan, Inc., I have to pause and give props to the vehicles that enabled me to drive up my debt in the first place: education. See, some people like food while others prefer clothes and travel. Me, I appreciate all three. But what do I truly adore above all else? Education. Roll out a program of study or weekend workshop to titillate my otherworldly curiosity and I am so there—the more obscure the better. What&#8217;s that you say? Someone&#8217;s teaching a course in Mazatlan on connecting with the ancient blue dolphins of Atlantis to lead me to my past life council of elemental faeries in the Outer Realms of Inner Narnia?! And extra-curricular cocktail/mani-peddies thrown in as part of the all-inclusive fee? Plus a free T-shirt? Sign. Me. Up!</p>
<p>At least, that was my philosophy a long time ago, before I began to clean up my overall act.</p>
<p>5.<strong> NUTS. </strong>I&#8217;ve addressed this topic in a previous entry, and it bears repeating here on my Thanksgiving list. Not to be mistaken for edible omega-rich treats, or treatable, legitimate illnesses of the mental sort, when I say nuts I&#8217;m talking about the occasional, willful abandonment of rationality, overrated logic and the status quo in the service of breaking through to a better you and me. Let&#8217;s face it: since when did anyone get led gently by the hand into a deeper realization of their highest potential? And when&#8217;s the last time conducting business as usual and running on auto pilot redirected anyone out of a life-stalling rut? Remember those wise words of Seal: <em>You know, we&#8217;re never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy!</em></p>
<p>6.<strong> ONE. </strong>One of the most amazing facets of the work I do revolves around the premise that we are all plugged into one source. And as I continue to train, teach, and apply what I learn in my interactions with clients and teachers and life, I&#8217;m convinced that we originate from and will return to that same source, as well. I&#8217;ve come to love this idea of our interconnectedness because it exists beyond reason and religion and still stands up to my constant inquiry. This truth of oneness reminds me, too, that we are never alone. It&#8217;s like Neo, finally waking up to the Mr. Joneses of the world and realizing he&#8217;s part of a force far greater than the old matrix that&#8217;s lulled most folks to sleep. Only then could he realize his true power and unleash some serious whupass in the world!</p>
<p>7.<strong> YOU. </strong>When I started this website I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted it to be aside from a place to post my thoughts and let people know what I was up to. With time, though, I see this site, my life and work constantly taking on new dimension. I used to wonder why this desire to do Honey Help YourSelf was so persistent. Believe me when I tell you it simply would not let me alone, people! Still, I thought, <em>Yeah. And? This is hardly earth-shattering stuff, Kriste. You&#8217;re not saying anything new, so why bother and who cares?</em> and the old standby<em> WTF?</em> I felt weird, overexposed and even more clueless as I labored on along with my doubts. Then you showed up—in private notes, phone calls and &#8216;by the way&#8217; comments at the end of random chats. In ways I&#8217;d never anticipated, you helped to remind me why it&#8217;s so important to stay with my/our hard-to-explain pursuits—our inexplicable passions—to plumb the depths of our inspiration and to share what we find because that&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;re going to get where we&#8217;re headed. I happen to think that&#8217;s the nature of growth itself; and it just doesn&#8217;t get any better than this, honey!</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s your turn. What do you find yourself grateful for right about now?</p>

As far as I'm concerned, there's never not a good time to express genuine thanks.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ducks_in_a_row_with_background.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-736" src="http://www.honeyhelpyourself.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ducks_in_a_row_with_background-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>According to my dusty savings brochure—the one I picked up on a long ago visit to the bank—my hypothetical $10,000 investment should be approaching six figures by now. At the time, I was wide-eyed with possibility and eager to get a nest egg going and pad it with lots and lots of money.</p>
<p>According to those idealized financial stats, I should also have 2.x worldly, well-mannered kids, a passably handsome pot-bellied husband (possibly my second), a &#8216;green&#8217; house in the &#8216;burbs, an insistent middle-age tummy and recurring daydreams from my corner office cube of priceless MasterCard- and Corona-themed getaways in the Keys. I should have it all by now. All this and more could have been mine, providing my ducks were in a row.</p>
<p>They ain&#8217;t.</p>
<p><span id="more-735"></span></p>
<p>Then again, if I&#8217;m to believe the other prevailing voices of media, I should have about 5 unruly jail-bound kids by now, each with distinctly different though disorderly babydaddies cruising and bruising through the inner city streets, burgling helpless old folks&#8217; homes to feed their latest fixes, never to be heard from again. So says that twisted branch of the media, my chances at marriage, stability and a piece of the so-called pie are all but dwarfed by the likelihood I&#8217;ll be jacked by terrorists first. Well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m here to tell you that not only is having ducks in a row overrated, it&#8217;s also relative and unrealistic at best. Why? Because it depends on whose ducks we&#8217;re talking about, and whose standards I agree to accept as my own. Version A of this duck business puts me sadly behind the Joneses with little hope of &#8216;catching up&#8217; — my measly ducks stumbling blindfolded through traffic toward the nearest puddle.

<p>If I&#8217;m to translate all of this into Energy language – and I am – it&#8217;s a great way to lose oneself in a never ending hunt for status and approval based on an impossible shifting series of standards that I had no part in creating in the first place. It&#8217;s also an insidious losing game I&#8217;d be playing either way because, whether I was aware of it or not, I&#8217;d always be buying into somebody else&#8217;s value system, not to mention a collective one of an entire culture, which means I can never measure up. Or worse, it would mean that I&#8217;ve already measured up and exceeded what &#8216;they&#8217; expected of me and, therefore, I should just sit down now and enjoy my relative successes.

<p>On a recent hike around the lake, I stopped to watch a family of ducks on the water. They bathed, spread out and ate their bugs or whatever on their own and after a while, seemed to come back together as though on cue. But here&#8217;s the thing: the ducks weren&#8217;t all in a tidy little row as they made their way across. There was a shiny little one in the back still doing curly cues and pecking at stuff along the water&#8217;s surface as she went. I couldn&#8217;t tell what she was so enamored with, but she certainly had my attention; maybe she was kissing her reflection and validating her own beautiful self along the way. And even though she took her time spinning around, frolicking and bringing up the rear, she never lost sight of where she was going. She didn&#8217;t fall far behind her group either. And all the while she simply <em>knew</em> she belonged.</p>
<p>When I look at how my own proverbial ducks are lining up, I take comfort in the family I saw on the water not too long ago. Probably because I&#8217;ve got a few spinners and lame ducks of my own. Still, I know that rather than comparing them to the Jones ducks across the way, or subjecting them to anyone else&#8217;s assessment, I know I&#8217;m doing just fine. And you are too, honey! But that&#8217;s for you to decide, now ain&#8217;t it?</p>

		<itunes:summary>According to my dusty savings brochure—the one I picked up on a long ago visit to the bank—my hypothetical $10,000 investment should be approaching six figures by now. At the time, I was wide-eyed with possibility and eager to get a nest egg going and pad it with lots and lots of money.

According to those idealized financial stats, I should also have 2.x worldly, well-mannered kids, a passably handsome pot-bellied husband (possibly my second), a 'green' house in the 'burbs, an insistent middle-age tummy and recurring daydreams from my corner office cube of priceless MasterCard- and Corona-themed getaways in the Keys. I should have it all by now. All this and more could have been mine, providing my ducks were in a row.

They ain't.



Then again, if I'm to believe the other prevailing voices of media, I should have about 5 unruly jail-bound kids by now, each with distinctly different though disorderly babydaddies cruising and bruising through the inner city streets, burgling helpless old folks' homes to feed their latest fixes, never to be heard from again. So says that twisted branch of the media, my chances at marriage, stability and a piece of the so-called pie are all but dwarfed by the likelihood I'll be jacked by terrorists first. Well.

I'm here to tell you that not only is having ducks in a row overrated, it's also relative and unrealistic at best. Why? Because it depends on whose ducks we're talking about, and whose standards I agree to accept as my own. Version A of this duck business puts me sadly behind the Joneses with little hope of 'catching up' — my measly ducks stumbling blindfolded through traffic toward the nearest puddle. Version B, however, shows me impressively outpacing my peers with an embarrassment of riches of ducks in a row, crowding the pond, plump and healthy, carefree and overflowing in a queue on land anxious to jump in and join the fun. Either way, I'm screwed.

If I'm to translate all of this into Energy language – and I am – it's a great way to lose oneself in a never ending hunt for status and approval based on an impossible shifting series of standards that I had no part in creating in the first place. It's also an insidious losing game I'd be playing either way because, whether I was aware of it or not, I'd always be buying into somebody else's value system, not to mention a collective one of an entire culture, which means I can never measure up. Or worse, it would mean that I've already measured up and exceeded what 'they' expected of me and, therefore, I should just sit down now and enjoy my relative successes. See how easy it becomes to 'leak' energy when we use other people's measuring sticks – and ducks – to gauge our own progress?

<p>There’s no mistaking when you’re on the receiving end of a good f-ing. It can hit you like a hot hammer between the eyes taking you completely unawares, tingling your extremities, leaving you breathless and wondering what you did to deserve such good loving. It can also unfold like a lotus in the spirit—cracking your heart open and connecting you to something far deeper, warmer and more expansive than you&#8217;d ever imagined. In another sense, a good f-ing is a lot like crossing against the light at rush hour only to find your pants are falling down once you&#8217;ve stepped into the road. It’s all you can do to make it to the other side without exposing your nakedness when you never intended to. Face it, when the F word comes for you, you’re rendered vulnerable like you wouldn&#8217;t believe. Because getting f&#8217;ed carries with it the subtlety of a sucker punch. It empties you out, it fills you up, and most definitely rocks your world. And there’s nothing like it when you get it good.</p>
<p><span id="more-685"></span></p>
<p>On the giving end, the F word tastes funny in the mouth at first, tart in its newness, requiring repeated attempts to build confidence over time. We&#8217;re shy in the beginning, not knowing how we&#8217;ll be received in addition to negotiating our own ambivalence in the situation. Will they embrace us with warmth and understanding, knowing all too well the shockingly tender position we put ourselves in when we&#8217;re new at doing it? What if that person laughs in our face at our stammering attempt to engage in such intimacy? In the end we just can&#8217;t know until we&#8217;ve stripped ourselves bare, thrown our hearts over the fence and ventured emotionally bare-assed behind the lines. And, frankly, it&#8217;s my hope that we never become so seasoned and all-knowing at f-ing that it becomes a heartless mechanical act drained of all sincerity or anything resembling real feelings.</p>
<p>With time the jitters fade and angst takes a back seat to the sweet, full-bodied satisfaction of doing it well. We learn to loosen up and throw our backs into it. I suspect there&#8217;s a special place in heaven for those who give themselves freely to the act of f-ing. After all, they make the world a better place, don&#8217;t they—one F at a time? I mean, think about it: When good f-ing comes from the heart, we can feel it. It&#8217;s that intention that creates a bond of trust and intimacy all its own. Because of it, we delight in the tenderness of the moment and give ourselves permission to finally relax.</p>
<p>So, how do we get good at doing it?</p>
<p>No matter how much we’d prefer to sidestep this fact, none of us arrives on the scene fully adept at f-ing. So take heart. And get busy f-ing, people! Get hold of that person you&#8217;ve had a hard-on for who knows how long and let them know you&#8217;ve done some thinking. Tell them in all sincerity that you&#8217;d like to F them and that you&#8217;re not looking for anything in return. You could also go one better by swallowing your pride and asking them to do it to you, too. This is the modern age, people. Go for it. But if that&#8217;s still too much for starters, maybe you&#8217;d do well to start where charity begins—at home. In other words, perhaps you&#8217;d prefer a gentler intro to f-ing by starting with yourself.</p>
<p>Further, I suggest you keep breathing while you&#8217;re at it, as this kind of exercise is definitely not for the faint of heart. It takes real maturity to put yourself on the line like that. You risk rejection, alienation and worse. But once you&#8217;ve done it, once you&#8217;ve unburdened yourself of this pressing, primal urge and finally gotten it off of your chest by sharing it with that designated someone—or by giving yourself this rapturous gift—you gain a new appreciation for the act and come to respect the power you wield when it&#8217;s firmly in your hands. And, seeing what a good f-ing can do will only make you want to do it more.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you&#8217;ll be encouraging others to start doing it, too. And who wouldn&#8217;t want to get in on the action? Look how radiant it&#8217;s made you! Kith and kin will wonder aloud at how much weight you&#8217;ve lost and what&#8217;s the secret to your newly acquired peace of mind. And that undeniable bounce in your step, oh my! You&#8217;ll inspire I&#8217;ll-have-what-she&#8217;s-having glances everywhere you go. Get used to it. It&#8217;s a win-win situation all the way around, honey. Yeah, forgiveness is amazing like that.</p>

<p>No matter how much we pout, scream, whine and barter with the powers that be, sometimes answers just don&#8217;t come. Sometimes, all we get for our efforts is crickets.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever lived in a place that goes quiet enough at night to experience the mysterious music of crickets, you&#8217;d likely understand why their nocturnal singing is synonymous with the &#8216;out-there&#8217; feeling that shows up when you&#8217;re waiting on laughs at weak jokes or answers—especially if they&#8217;re spiritual in nature.</p>
<p><span id="more-583"></span></p>
<p>For the past month or more I&#8217;ve been wondering at my own guidance. I&#8217;ve also been pouting, screaming, and whining at the void, if you must know. <em>What should I write about? Where am I going with all this stuff, anyway? Where&#8217;d my inspiration run off to? How can I tone up my inner thighs? </em>Nothing serious, really, just more existential pondering and navel gazing in hopes of finding my place in what it all means. Again. And I can tell you right now that, for all of my insistent pleas (please, oh please!) to the Higher Power, the answers that came surprised and confounded me in their simplicity and complexity. Without realizing it, I&#8217;d been bumbling around the gentle refrain that had been singing to me all along. All I had to do was slow down long enough to listen&#8230;to crickets.</p>
<p>But the crickets. When I hear them at night—which usually means it&#8217;s during that forced stillness just before sleep—I&#8217;m amazed at how many of them there are &#8216;out there.&#8217; Just chirping away in the dark, their chorus can rage on to the point of distraction, rising and falling in waves like the movements of a symphony. And depending on the day, either I&#8217;m all about the majesty of their night music, or I&#8217;m annoyed at how completely their persistent humming works my very last nerve.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way my answers have—or seemingly have not—been showing up lately, too. I&#8217;m either awed by the grace that reveals itself in mundane places or I&#8217;m pissed that I can&#8217;t make head nor tails of what might be guidance dangling like a juicy fruit just beyond my reach. And when I&#8217;m in that latter scenario—unable to grasp the guideposts all around me when I&#8217;ve asked for them—I get all drifty and sideswiped by that unproductive &#8216;out there&#8217; feeling. That&#8217;s when I throw my hands up to the heavens and ask, <em>What gives?</em> Still, crickets.</p>
<p>Naturally, I&#8217;ve got a handful of theories/stories behind this recent cricket phenomena of mine. I&#8217;ll spare you the whole list, but here are a few to chew on.</p>
<p><strong>1. WE&#8217;RE THE CRICKETS.</strong> What if every time any one of us sent up a prayer, wish, or thought, it joined the throngs of other people&#8217;s pleas to form a chaotic chorus of inscrutably beautiful noise offered up to the heavens? And what if that inscrutable noise was in and of itself a collective cry to the Higher Power? Which then might suggest how incredibly and intricately connected we are—right down to our private thoughts. So, if I ask the Higher Power for something, what if that means everybody else in the <em>world</em> is linked to that request too (not to mention their being impacted by the actions I take)? So, the admonition to be careful what we ask for takes on new meaning.<br />
<strong><br />
2. ANSWERS ARE CRICKETS.</strong> How about this one? What if the answers to our prayers, wishes, dreams and aspirations were as available to us as the constant thrumming of crickets? It&#8217;s that kind of hidden-in-plain-sight principle that makes us smack at our foreheads and rend garments when we realize how hard we were making things for ourselves when answers and guidance are simply everywhere we turn. It also means we may need to pay closer attention to our general surroundings if we really want to hear what&#8217;s coming through courtesy of the Higher Power.<br />
<strong><br />
3. CRICKETS ON A PLANE.</strong> In much the same way Sam Jackson alerted his unfortunate fellow travelers to news they simply couldn&#8217;t avoid, I too have come to share the inevitable truth of snakes on the plane, honey! Only, I&#8217;m announcing <em>crickets in the grass</em>. And while cricket music isn&#8217;t as life-threatening as a gang of poisonous reptiles slithering out from overhead bins to kill off random passengers, the fact that crickets are virtually everywhere (as symbolic stand-ins for divine answers we may be oblivious to) waiting for us to recognize their very real presence and ability to help us <em>spring</em> into action is an incentive at least as pressing as snakes on a plane.</p>
<p><strong>4. CRICKETS ARE CRICKETS.</strong> May as well leave the obvious for last. Even though it really isn&#8217;t so obvious as we might think. My affection for stories and finding <em>meaning</em> in everything runs deep and I know first hand how quickly this kind of curiosity—especially when expressed out loud—can clear a room. But if you&#8217;ve come this far with me, surely you can stand one last nugget? And that is this: perhaps crickets remind remind us in their <em>ordinaryness</em> just how magical our mundane world really is.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it: we don&#8217;t actually see them at night when they strike up their moonlit chorus in the grass, we don&#8217;t know how or why they sing like they do. Still, they do. And, just like Jiminy Cricket singing unnoticed on the teaming streets of New York, he kept at it until passersby couldn&#8217;t help but take notice his song. So, see? Maybe it&#8217;s this last cricket scenario that speaks to my theme the most. By merely <em>being</em> and continuing to do what they do naturally—and being fine with what<em> is</em>—they teach us to allow our answers to come to us by way of their own divine timing, to embrace life on its terms even when we feel out of our element, and to never give up while there&#8217;s still music left in us.</p>

		<itunes:summary>No matter how much we pout, scream, whine and barter with the powers that be, sometimes answers just don't come. Sometimes, all we get for our efforts is crickets.

If you've ever lived in a place that goes quiet enough at night to experience the mysterious music of crickets, you'd likely understand why their nocturnal singing is synonymous with the 'out-there' feeling that shows up when you're waiting on laughs at weak jokes or answers—especially if they're spiritual in nature.



For the past month or more I've been wondering at my own guidance. I've also been pouting, screaming, and whining at the void, if you must know. What should I write about? Where am I going with all this stuff, anyway? Where'd my inspiration run off to? How can I tone up my inner thighs? Nothing serious, really, just more existential pondering and navel gazing in hopes of finding my place in what it all means. Again. And I can tell you right now that, for all of my insistent pleas (please, oh please!) to the Higher Power, the answers that came surprised and confounded me in their simplicity and complexity. Without realizing it, I'd been bumbling around the gentle refrain that had been singing to me all along. All I had to do was slow down long enough to listen...to crickets.

But the crickets. When I hear them at night—which usually means it's during that forced stillness just before sleep—I'm amazed at how many of them there are 'out there.' Just chirping away in the dark, their chorus can rage on to the point of distraction, rising and falling in waves like the movements of a symphony. And depending on the day, either I'm all about the majesty of their night music, or I'm annoyed at how completely their persistent humming works my very last nerve.

That's the way my answers have—or seemingly have not—been showing up lately, too. I'm either awed by the grace that reveals itself in mundane places or I'm pissed that I can't make head nor tails of what might be guidance dangling like a juicy fruit just beyond my reach. And when I'm in that latter scenario—unable to grasp the guideposts all around me when I've asked for them—I get all drifty and sideswiped by that unproductive 'out there' feeling. That's when I throw my hands up to the heavens and ask, What gives? Still, crickets.

Naturally, I've got a handful of theories/stories behind this recent cricket phenomena of mine. I'll spare you the whole list, but here are a few to chew on.

1. WE'RE THE CRICKETS. What if every time any one of us sent up a prayer, wish, or thought, it joined the throngs of other people's pleas to form a chaotic chorus of inscrutably beautiful noise offered up to the heavens? And what if that inscrutable noise was in and of itself a collective cry to the Higher Power? Which then might suggest how incredibly and intricately connected we are—right down to our private thoughts. So, if I ask the Higher Power for something, what if that means everybody else in the world is linked to that request too (not to mention their being impacted by the actions I take)? So, the admonition to be careful what we ask for takes on new meaning.

2. ANSWERS ARE CRICKETS. How about this one? What if the answers to our prayers, wishes, dreams and aspirations were as available to us as the constant thrumming of crickets? It's that kind of hidden-in-plain-sight principle that makes us smack at our foreheads and rend garments when we realize how hard we were making things for ourselves when answers and guidance are simply everywhere we turn. It also means we may need to pay closer attention to our general surroundings if we really want to hear what's coming through courtesy of the Higher Power.

3. CRICKETS ON A PLANE. In much the same way Sam Jackson alerted his unfortunate fellow travelers to news they simply couldn't avoid, I too have come to share the inevitable truth of snakes on the plane, honey! Only, I'm announcing crickets in the grass.</itunes:summary>

<p>No two ways about it, ruts suck. Whether physical, mental, spiritual, categorical or slightly implied, sometimes you just can’t win against the sleeping, creeping threat of otherwise harmless ruts appearing along your path every now and again. Okay, maybe not <em>you</em> per se, but I know I can’t always avoid the pits.</p>
<p><span id="more-462"></span></p>
<p>There’s nothing like getting stuck in a rut to hinder creative momentum. Picture this: there you are, rolling along just fine, peacefully coasting through an idyllic countryside when you notice you’ve inadvertently steered yourself into an emotional, metaphorical or literal ditch of sorts. Stuck, confounded, powerless, you flail for awhile and throw up your hands wondering where you went wrong—and how to right yourself. If this has never been your experience, then bully for you. Put another way, dear reader, you’re lying and I don’t believe you one bit.</p>
<p>If, however, you know that sinking feeling of stuckness, and often wonder at how to free yourself, then read on because I’ve culled some info that might just help dislodge you and get on with it again.</p>
<p>Here’s what a popular bicycle website has to say on the issue of landing in a rut:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The most common mistake is panicking and trying to steer out of a rut as soon as you get into it. When you do this, your front wheel often can’t “climb” the wall of the rut. Your body leans out while your bike stays stuck-and you crash.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t that just beat all?</p>
<p>In case you’re not feeling the enormity of this allusion like I am, here’s the thing: when you find yourself in a slump or rut—a well-worn crevice, pit, or unhealthy habit of any kind, don’t worry about trying to solve it immediately. Sometimes it’s a better use of your energy to simply acknowledge it, period. That’s right, staying put might be just the thing you need for the moment.</p>
<p>To the point about “leaning out,” I totally agree. In energy language, this means being out of alignment within yourself. For example, if your body wants to do something other than what your mind and spirit have in mind, then it’s not long before something gives way and you topple over because of the imbalance. Plenty of folks are riding around like that right now, know. They&#8217;re lopsided and bent out of shape, incongruent—despite their best efforts to prop themselves up. So, for starters, slow down and assess where you are for a minute. It beats panicking, stressing out or otherwise fighting against yourself.</p>
<p>Bicycling.com goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>…make sure you’re in control and not going so slowly that you lack momentum and balance. Look for a spot within the next 10 feet where the walls get shallow, slope upward like a ramp or are uniformly steep (as opposed to jagged and crumbly). Those are the only places from which to steer out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ha! Now we’re cookin’.</p>
<p>See how important the balancing act is? They don’t tell us to stay in the rut/ditch indefinitely or to fill out a change of address form to the tricky location we’ve landed in. Instead, they say <em>Collect yourself, get a grip, and look ahead for an opening that will point you to higher ground again.</em> In symbolic talk, this means it’s our intention that makes all the difference. See, intention isn’t about where we <em>are</em>, it’s more about where we <em>plan</em> to be. Far stronger than hope, and somewhere in the neighborhood of faith, intention is about us knowing things are seldom as they appear and then pointing ourselves in the direction of our chosen outcome.</p>
<p>No offense to the bicycle pros, but my rut/energy analogy ends where they say there are only a couple of ways to get out. While this might be true in the riding world, energy simply abounds with liberating options if we acknowledge them as such. Good thing you’ve got me handy because I’ve come up with even more rut-releasing, loser-proof tactics of my own that&#8217;ll help you out the next time you get stuck:</p>
<p><strong>1.) CURL UP.</strong> Some folks might call this the Jesus-take-the-wheel approach, but I think this one’s about letting go altogether. Rather than wrestle against inertia and the claustrophobic pinch of ruts, sometimes all you can do is go fetal, surrender to what is and stay under the covers for a little bit. Note: We’re not talking about days and weeks on end. But if that’s what you’re thinking, maybe you <em>do</em> need that change of address form.</p>
<p><strong>2.) CRY OUT.</strong> Ever seen those old Lassie movies where Timmy/Susie falls down the well and cries out for help? Guess what? It worked! By the end of the hour, he/she had the whole town holding candle light vigils, dropping down lifelines to them, making banners and waiting with hot soup and cocoa before the final scene. That said, when you feel yourself hit what you may think is your bottom, don’t just accept the situation as the last word. Make some noise and let people know you&#8217;re down. Holler out from that hole! And here&#8217;s a really big one: let people lend you a hand once they start showing up. Contrary to all the bad news, I happen to know that people actually <em>do</em> want to help. So it&#8217;s up to you to make your needs known.</p>
<p><strong>3.) DON’T FORGET.</strong> Once you’ve curled up, cried out, and consumed all the help people gave you, remember the kindnesses of everyone who stepped in to lift you up. And pay it <em>forward</em>. Don&#8217;t create another rut out of trying to &#8216;pay people back&#8217; in a way that attempts to keep track and settle scores–unless it&#8217;s money you&#8217;ve agreed to repay. Equally important, the next time you feel yourself headed for an inevitable ditch, diversion, or any other type of unproductive rut, keep in mind that it’s only temporary and totally <em>get-out-ofable</em>.</p>
<p><strong>4. ) GO EASY.</strong> If there’s one thing I have a hard time bearing witness to, it’s the way we tend to knock ourselves when things don’t go they way we hoped they would. The next time you find yourself feeling generally bad or lacking in luster, give yourself a break. Think of how you’d ideally like to treat someone else when they’re down. You wouldn’t criticize Timmy and Susie for their unfortunate situation, now would you? (Personally, I blame the parents. But that&#8217;s a whole &#8216;nother story.) And I should hope you treat yourself at least as well as these fictionalized victims. Oh, one more thing: no matter what, you are <em>not</em> a victim. After all, even slumps serve an important purpose in our lives.</p>
<p>By this point, I’m sure you’re already working your way out of your ditch/rut/slump/well and have moved on to bigger challenges. So I’ll stop here for now, signing off and wishing you&#8230;<em>well</em>.</p>

When you&#8217;re standing at the baggage claim in a big city airport and your suitcase pops open as it&#8217;s coming down the chute–spraying your dirty laundry, private journal pages and sundries nobody but you ever needs to see all around the carousel—the last thing you want to do is pretend it doesn&#8217;t belong to you. Because things will only get worse if you do. Your bag will spew more of its contents as if to spite you, and embarrass you in worse ways than your mama ever could until you&#8217;ve turned four shades of purple. Naturally, I know from whence I speak since it happened to me.</p>
<p><span id="more-354"></span></p>
<p>The night before my return flight from Toronto I jam-packed my wheelie bag with all of the free books and literary magazines I&#8217;d snagged at my first writer&#8217;s conference. To me, it was a pretty big deal since it was an international affair, and everyone seemed so attentive and interested in what the published panelists had to say. Over the course of that oh so literate weekend, I pored over the writing advice of the <em>textperts</em> and dog eared poignant passages from soon-to-be remaindered books written by sexy youngish authors with cool glasses, devil-may-care dispositions, and just enough world-weariness to hold my rapt attention.</p>
<p>In my hotel room, I fantasized about the type of writer I was going to be when I got back home and stared down the intimidating blank screen of my computer. No more playing it safe, I vowed. Promising myself I&#8217;d be no less than brilliant, highly sought after and privy to the innermost thoughts of my creative muse, I was going to write my way out of the uninspired rut I&#8217;d been intermittently languishing in since high school.</p>
<p>Then all hell–in the form of my exploding Walmart luggage special–broke loose.</p>
<p>Much to the disbelief of my fellow travelers, and myself, I wound up chasing my crap around the baggage claim carousel trying to discreetly stuff my drawers and journal pages back into my busted disappointment of a suitcase. Thoroughly crestfallen and cursing the mother lode of literary freebies that caused my cheap-o luggage to burst at the seams , I hung my head and avoided all possible eye contact as I pressed, shoved and smashed my belongings back into confinement.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that by the time I got back home, I couldn&#8217;t have cared less about writing, reading, or appearing half as brilliant as the up-and-coming authors I&#8217;d brought home with me. In fact, I privately chided them for my airport debacle as I trashed the publications and the luggage, and shut the lid on my writerly aspirations yet again.</p>
<p>Fast forward from my public shame of 2004 to Valentine&#8217;s Day, 2010 and a conversation I&#8217;m having with my girlfriend Sharon. In the midst of our chat, she tells me she&#8217;s disappointed again this year because her partner didn&#8217;t do anything special for her that day or for her birthday, she adds. And not on their anniversary, either. I felt for her and said as much before we hung up. Little did I know how just <em>much</em> I was feeling for her.</p>
<p>Shortly after our conversation, my mood took a nosedive for no good reason, and I wanted little more than to fling myself across the bed and burst into a crying fit. It didn&#8217;t take long to figure out I was experiencing some of my friend&#8217;s disappointment in a way that felt as real to me as if her sadness was my own.</p>
<p>Granted, Sharon and I are close, and have been for more than twenty years. Add to that the fact that recent years of energy work have rendered me way more receptive to what&#8217;s going on around me, especially when I&#8217;m paying attention, and I knew something was up: baggage.</p>
<p>What happened next surprised both Sharon and me. I called her back and told her how sad I got after we&#8217;d hung up earlier that day, and urged her to deal with her feelings honestly. Otherwise, I said, they&#8217;d only be hanging out in her space–circling like unclaimed baggage on a carousel!–unless she finally faced them.</p>
<p>I also told her if she didn&#8217;t want to process her feelings for her own sake, then she should at least do it for her kids. Because, just like me, they&#8217;d pick up on her unclaimed emotional baggage, too. Only, they wouldn&#8217;t necessarily know what was causing their moods to change so dramatically. Maybe they&#8217;d act out, shut down or just be weird. But one thing&#8217;s for sure, they&#8217;d compound their mom&#8217;s misery by unwittingly reflecting her own mopey feelings back to her like an energetic boomerang. See how this works, people?</p>
<p>I have to say, it&#8217;s not everyone who&#8217;d be receptive to an unsolicited call from a well-intentioned friend telling them to claim their baggage, so to speak. And just because I&#8217;m all about the vibrational-chakra-energy business and spiritual growth, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make this scenario so special. In fact, it&#8217;s a pretty common example of how we pick up other people&#8217;s stuff every day. Ever walked into a crowd and felt overcome? And when&#8217;s the last time you suffered through a visit with an uptight or worrisome person and wound up nursing a massive headache until the wee hours? If we&#8217;re not careful, we walk around with funkiness that never belonged to us in the first place, lingering until it eventually dissipates, til we figure out how to handle and clear it out, or until the original owner comes back to claim it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong–I know how very difficult it can be to face feelings that make me feel uncomfortable, weak, or in any way insecure. But, if we&#8217;re here to learn and grow (and I believe we are), a good chunk of our work comes in taking full ownership of our baggage. How else are we to experience the full gamut of our emotions? And, even though lots of folks will have ready answers for me on this, I&#8217;ll still ask: Who says life is supposed to be about feeling good or being perfect all the time anyway?</p>
<p>When my baggage exploded unexpectedly in the airport, I honestly had no one to blame but myself for packing it so tight. And for scrimping on cheap luggage in the first place.* Same goes for the emotional equivalent of stuffing feelings down without sufficiently dealing with them—when those emotions resurface, you might not be able to contain them, and things could get messy as a result. And even if your baggage doesn&#8217;t blow up in your face, honey, there&#8217;s a whole lot to be said for traveling light whenever you can.</p>
<p>- &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - &#8211; - -</p>
<p>*And for shopping at WalMart, which is another issue altogether.</p>

I also told her if she didn't want to process her feelings for her own sake,</itunes:summary>

I used to dream of being an Olympic figure skater. Outfitted in an asymmetric one-armed mini-tard, I cut a winning picture in my mind’s eye. Daring, lithe, and perfectly rehearsed, if only you could have seen me! I was in a class by myself—nailing high-altitude back flips, saucy kick splits, executing mesmerizing double triple axles in time to the music. The crowd roared through my performances every time and littered the rink with long-stemmed roses well before my first bow. The thunderous response of my fans said it all: I was the <em>only</em> show on ice.</p>
<p>And then, as the saying goes, “I woke up.”</p>
<p><span id="more-280"></span></p>
<p>In truth, I’ve only been ice skating once in my waking life and it took everything in me to stay upright while making tracks around the rink. Despite my flawless routines and feats in dreamland, my weak ankles wanted no parts of it in ‘real life.’ The dream analyst in me says those repeated scenes were messages from my subconscious telling me I was really good at skating around my issues and that, no matter how good I got at it, I’d eventually have to step out of the act and get on with it if I really wanted to live out loud, which I did. As it was, I was skating on thin ice in more than a few areas of my waking life and I knew it.</p>
<p>I also dreamed of being a professional singer. But, unlike my sleeping prowess as an ice dancer, for a time I actually was living the dream of being paid to entertain audiences in song. I pretty much spent the nineties gigging my way through New York with my jazz band. You name it, we played it—indoors, outdoors, rooftops, basements, weddings, clubs, cabarets, gardens, holes in walls, we were there. I backed up reggae bands, neosoul vocalists, and rock groups when they called. Whether we were playing to packed rooms or to a lonely bartender and tired cocktail waitress slumped over a table in the back, it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>After awhile, in another burst of awakening, I quit.</p>
<p>Tiring of the big city hustle and seeing far too little cash in hand at the end of the night, and fearing I was frittering my life on a love that didn’t seem to love my back, I packed up my P.A. and called the whole thing off.</p>
<p>While I still love to sing and do so on occasion, I don’t hold out hope of making it Big or of making it pay these days. That’s because there’s no more sure way to drain the life out of a love than by trying to wring money out of it. Having learned that, I finally saw I could still hold my music dear without forcing it to be the reason I got out of bed each day. If I’d known the freedom I’d feel from that, I probably would have moved on a lot sooner. But I doubt it.</p>
<p>My point is this: sometimes it’s important, crucial even, to let go of the dream, or to stop clutching it and give it room to breathe and evolve, so that something else more suited and juicy can come through. And because it’s an immensely difficult thing to do, I don’t say that lightly. Letting go of something you&#8217;ve wrapped your heart strings around in a pretty little bow requires lots of introspection and courage. What’s more is you’ll have to call up a heap of fortitude when you’re left with the void created in the release. Not to worry though, because I’ve got just the thing to help you get acclimated to the task.</p>
<p>Here’s great way prepare yourself for the experience of saying goodbye to a beloved dream—or job, or relationship, or living situation, or anything, really—that you suspect is going nowhere, in just three steps:<br />
1. Have a baby.<br />
2. Hand that baby over to a band of lawless marauding bandits.<br />
3. Leave town and never look back.</p>
<p>Because everything is energy, it makes sense that your unrealized, unacted-upon dreams and dusty old getting-around-to goals—or dream jobs, dream relationships, idealized living situations, or you-name-it again—they&#8217;re are running on energy, too…yours. And because we’re human beings with finite physical resources, we’ve only got so much energy at our disposal at any given time, plain and simple.</p>
<p>So, when old desires take up space, flaring up every now and again demanding your attention, they siphon of some of your precious juice, too. I tend to think that if we dropped what wasn’t working in our lives and gave ourselves permission to say goodbye, no, or not now when we needed to, we’d have a lot more energy and wherewithal to make way for the real deal.</p>
<p>My cousin Iris once gave me a silver dollar-shaped coin called a <em>round tuit.</em> Pressing it firmly into my palm, she said, “There. Now you have no more excuses. You’ve finally got a round tuit.” Of course the pun wasn’t lost on me, and neither was the fact that the coin was ultimately useless. Because, without action, sacrifice, and real planning that gives our dreams legs to stand on and eventually run and jump at the moon, they’re just like that coin: shiny, roundabout, and ultimately worthless.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to say <em>get on with it</em>, but I also know from experience how risky it is to take action in the direction of making my dreams real, which may often include a redirection or evaluation of what I really want. Grilling myself with a litany of hard questions, I had to ask myself whether I was prepared to do whatever it took to ‘make it’ in music. Could I see myself schlepping gig equipment across the tri-state area for peanuts in the months and years ahead? Can old bones bear the weight of hoisting 50-pound speakers night after night? And if I walked away, would I be giving up too soon? And the real ball buster: was I even good enough? And so on. So, yeah, I know. Sometimes it’s a hard call to know when to call it off. But doing so has its rewards, too.</p>
<p>Once I was finally able to loosen my grip and eventually let go of the cherished singing fantasy, I realized I’d also released a load of guilt and stress in the process. Because I was able to go inside myself, diving deep for the answers I’d been seeking, I resurfaced with a clear intention—and permission—to go in a direction that, not surprisingly, held the seeds of the old dream within it. Much to my delight, I learned much of what I loved most about singing was alive and well in the dream I’m turning my attention to now: 0penly expressing a deeper side of my creative Self, positively impacting people’s lives, connecting with a new audience, sharing stories by engaging my love of language, and being compensated to do something I love and believe in.</p>
<p>As paradoxical as it may seem, summoning the courage to say goodbye to a dream delivered me swiftly to the one I’m living now. When I sat down to type this entry, I was tickled to recognize a synchronous nod from the universe floating quietly in my mug. Dangling from the end of my Good Earth tea bag was a printed quote from master dream analyst Carl Jung. I had to share it here because these so-called “small” moments are hardly small at all. It read: “Who looks outside dreams; who looks inside, awakes.” How’s that for some serious synchronici-tea?</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might think, this post is actually <em>not</em> about big hair, glory days, fashion disasters of the ’80s, or whatever the male equivalent of a cameltoe is called. This post is about faith. And, whether they know it or not, Journey helped lead me back to mine.</p>
<p><span id="more-195"></span></p>
<p>This story takes place on an ordinary day in Chicago. As I recall, it was summer because people were outdoors in short sleeves and weren’t ducking for cover when the wind kicked up. It’s not a slam on the windy city to say there only seems to be two seasons in Chi-town—winter (8.25 months) and summer (3.5 months). I’ll allow a couple of weeks for that in-between time that some might generously call Spring.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon and I was cruising my neighborhood for a parking space when I spotted a most miserable woman. By all appearances, she seemed okay in the way most mildly disillusioned city women at the outskirts of their prime do: they bear up and hunker down against big city rigors without as much as a backward glance, silently resigned to pay their toll for living where they did.</p>
<p>The woman’s eyes were blank and her feet barely lifted off of the ground as she trudged heavy up the avenue against the midday sun. I say ‘up’ because, even though the street was flat, to my eye, she was trapped in an upright struggle to keep herself going.</p>
<p>I get some of my best insights and motivation from food, and if I had to reach for an edible analogy right now, I’d say the woman was the fallen bittersweet middle of a soufflé left too long to cool. The American grandfather of gourmet cooking, James Beard, once said <em>the only thing that will make a soufflé fall is if it knows you are afraid of it.</em> Make no mistake: living in fear of living will cause your life to sag, droop, and collapse just like that woman who, by the way, could be—and is—every one of us.</p>
<p>If you knew me at all, you’d know I’m a chronic optimist. I’m the one with a generally upbeat take on life, which I’ve been told can be annoying, and even when I feel shitty, I’m simply a natural at finding laughter in virtually any situation. I’m better at it—or should that be <em>worse?</em>—than a pig hunting truffles.</p>
<p>Mind you, I’m no willfully blind Pollyanna who resists bad news, personal upsets, and life’s inevitable disappointments of up bad timing. It’s just that one thing I know is how to navigate my way to the bright side of the street. Here’s another thing I know: we&#8217;re a whole lot more than the meat jackets we walk around in. Like Sting says, <em>We ah spi-rits in the ma-ter-ial wooorld</em>.</p>
<p>And yet. Witnessing that woman dragging her burdens up the sunlit street like she had no inner anchor or place to call home, no place to truly <em>be</em>, stayed with me. She never saw me seeing her, but those few seconds I spent taking her in impacted me in the days and, consequently, years that followed.</p>
<p>I couldn’t shake the heaviness of her. More to the point, what I couldn’t shake was the idea that maybe she was on to something. What if all my happy anecdotes and optimistic observations in the face of &#8216;reality&#8217; were just platitudes void of substance, fuller with hot air and sweetness than any soufflé? Had that woman identified <em>me</em> as the soufflé—puffed up and so delicate that I’d topple at the thought of an unlovely gust? I wondered.</p>
<p>And what if my worldview was just a bunch sugary, regurgitated hand-me-down armchair drivel that just didn’t matter to anyone else but me? What if that woman really <em>was</em> on to the secret of life that had somehow escaped me in all of my happy aspirations? These are the thoughts that turned me inside out for the rest of the day—and night.</p>
<p>The next morning I awoke feeling sluggish and grim. Even while showering, I was  still stuck on the experience, not wanting to believe succumbing to misery and world-weariness was the inevitable conclusion for us all. Because if it was, well, let&#8217;s don&#8217;t go there.</p>
<p>Just like I get lots of motivation from food, I also receive loads of revelation in the shower—or anywhere, really. Let’s face it. So, I’m in the shower trying to work this issue out and find a way to <em>be</em> in the world if it turned out that my own way was dopey and somehow wrong. Only, I couldn’t get into it because there was this insistent music that kept interrupting my deep-shower thinking. Being a singer, I take lyrics very seriously because–you guessed it–I’m also inspired by music! Over and over the chorus played in my head. Until, finally, it overtook my original thought. <em>Alright alright</em>, I yielded.</p>
<p><em>Don’t stop believin! Hold on to that feel-ay-ee-yang</em>…continued batting back and forth between my ears and simply would not stop. So I stopped. And I listened. Louder and louder they sang. So loud you’d have thought they were holding a private concert in my toilet. I laughed to myself when I finally let the message sink in. <em>Hold on-oo-oh-uh-onn!</em> Almost immediately, my clouds lifted and rinsed away with the morning lather.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m just a corny Pollyanana with a potty mouth and spiritual aspirations. Maybe. I&#8217;ve surely been accused of worse. And that&#8217;s fine. But what I&#8217;m certain of is I&#8217;m a hard head who refuses to accept the notion that life is <em>only</em> the tough parts—hard and flat and unforgiving as a big city street and then it&#8217;s curtains. I don&#8217;t buy it. I <em>won&#8217;t</em> buy it. I&#8217;m glad I could be a witness to the lesson that day because that woman reminded me happiness is a habit. And just like living well—and making more appropriate fashion choices for posterity&#8217;s sake (C&#8217;mon Journey. Really?)—it&#8217;s all a matter of choice.</p>
