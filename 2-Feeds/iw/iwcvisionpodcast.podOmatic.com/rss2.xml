      <title>B.I.B.L.E. What We Believe</title>

Do you believe the word of God? Do you know what you believe, and why you believe? This is our study of our Declaration of Faith, Church of God.


2 Pet. 1:20-21- &#8220;But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one&#8217;s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.&#8221;

&quot;1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed... 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with Child&quot; (Luke 2:1, 4-5).

&quot;6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 7 And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn&quot; (Luke 2:6-7).

&quot;8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night... 10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people&quot; (Luke 2:8,10).

&quot;And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger&quot; (Luke 2:12).

&quot;6 For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His Name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince Of Peace. 7 Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with Judgment and with Justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this&quot; (Isaiah 9:6-7).

&quot;Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth peace, good will toward men&quot; (Luke 2:14).
&quot;15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into Heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the LORD hath made known unto us. 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger&quot; (Luke 2:15-16).

Elisha Ministries wants to thank all of our followers and friends for your support of this ministry. This will be our last broadcast of 2011, but we will be back in 2012! Your encouraging words and prayers help us do what we do! It has been a challenging year, but Jesus saw us through. We are excited about what the New Year will bring.  Because this ministry is dedicated to Reaching the Lost, Building the Church &amp; Establishing the Kingdom, we're expecting a great harvest in 2012. So this is not the time to be tired, but the time to get busy for the Lord!

A ritual causes a lack of genuine joy and poor quality sacrifices. When it is a relationship we take great joy in sacrificing. 

God asked Israel a Question:
It seemed that God wasn&#8217;t pleased with either their sacrifices or service, They were giving sacrifices to the Lord, they were attending worship services at the Temple, so what was wrong? It wasn&#8217;t just that, they gave, it was what they gave, sick diseased animals for sacrifices and ritualistic attendance at the Temple without a genuine joy or thanksgiving in their heart toward God! 
They had lost their focus on the purpose of worship. They had lost their focus on WHO GOD IS. God expects the best from us because He always gives His best to us.
