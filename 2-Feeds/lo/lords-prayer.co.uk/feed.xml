        <itunes:summary>The Lord&apos;s Prayer is recorded in the gospels of both Matthew and Luke. In Matthew it is part of the teaching in the Sermon on the Mount concerning godly giving, praying and fasting. In Luke it is a response to the disciples&apos; request to teach them to pray. Jesus would have taught the great matters of faith on several occasions and in different situations, and so there is no great difficulty in making allowance for the differences between the two accounts we have.</itunes:summary>

            <description>The parable of the widow and the judge, the persistent widow.&lt;br /&gt;

            <itunes:summary>There is a similar parable in St. Luke and chapter 11 where our Lord teaches the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ and then tells the parable of the friend in need of bread for his guest. He shamelessly rouses his unwilling neighbour, at midnight, persisting until he gets all he needs. The application the Lord gave is prayer; ‘Ask and it will be given you: seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened to you.’ We are urged to shamelessly pester the Lord God, our heavenly Father, until we have all that we need to live for his glory in this world.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Beginning in this chapter with just the first of these petitions, when we pray, &apos;Hallowed be thy name,&apos; or, &apos;May your name be honoured,&apos; what do we mean? We know the line so well and recite it so easily, and yet do we really appreciate the weight and significance of these simple words?</description>

            <description>Firstly, the kingdom comes here on earth where God the Father and his Son, the Lord Jesus, are honoured. As Jesus came to his own people, he said, &apos;The kingdom of God is among you.&apos; He is the gateway, the door of the kingdom, he is the source of our forgiveness and wholeness. As people came and honoured him, so they became members of the kingdom.</description>

            <description>As we look at this great petition, we must begin and end with personal holiness of living, living a life that is worthy of the gospel. And yet, perhaps, like a guest in a great house, caught and challenged by our reflection in a great mirror we move rapidly out of its range to the comfort of a great window where we can look out on the world. The view is far less personal and far less threatening!</description>

We long to see God&apos;s kingdom come and yet see the fulfillment of our prayers so often frustrated or long delayed.</description>

            <description>Like all these petitions, the prayer for forgiveness is set in the Lord&apos;s Prayer in the plural. Although our heavenly Father chooses to deal with us one by one, we are set in communities. Like a stone thrown into a pond, we begin with personal confession, but the ripples move out to affect the whole surface. As we really begin to pray we will look beyond our own personal standing and walk before God. We will begin to see and acknowledge our collective responsibilities and failings before our heavenly Father.</description>

            <description>&apos;Heavenly Father, lead us not into temptation.&apos; Who or what can tempt us? What are the sources of temptation? From the prayer itself, logically, the first answer must be - God. God our heavenly Father may lead us into temptation. He will not entice us to do wrong.</description>

            <itunes:summary>&apos;Heavenly Father, lead us not into temptation.&apos; Who or what can tempt us? What are the sources of temptation? From the prayer itself, logically, the first answer must be - God. God our heavenly Father may lead us into temptation. He will not entice us to do wrong.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Deliver Us From Evil Part 1</title>
            <description>We live in a world that is at the same time glorious and tragic. It is a wonderful world with so much that is noble, pure and breathtakingly beautiful; but it is also a fallen world, a world shot through with suffering and injustice, malice and evil. God our heavenly Father understands the evil we face as does our Lord who taught us to pray these words.</description>

            <title>Deliver Us From Evil Part 2</title>
            <description>The driving force behind the desire for leadership is the desire for power; power over people, power to influence and change lives, power to rule and direct. Like so many things, such power is two edged, it can be channelled and used for great good or it can be used for great evil. Here is a prayer that our heavenly Father would keep us from using the authority entrusted to us in our homes, at our work or in the wider society for evil.</description>

            <title>The Kingdom, The Power and the Glory</title>
            <description>Our Lord&apos;s pattern is the Hebrew pattern of prayer and worship kept together. The petitions are balanced and strengthened by reminding ourselves of the power and glory of our heavenly Father. Having just looked at the great dangers and evils that surround us, we have every reason to be weighed down. And so how good it is to turn our eyes heavenward and boldly affirm the glorious truth that our heavenly Father is the sovereign Lord; to him belong all power and glory.</description>
