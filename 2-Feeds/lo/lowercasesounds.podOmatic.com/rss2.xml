      <title>drifting 010 with tres johnson(lowercase sounds) 04.15.12</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/5923/600x600_6421006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hello friends! here we are at episode 10 of drifting. i am obviously going to stick with the title drifting for a little while. i think it fits almost better than the title &quot;on a path&quot; did. 

it has been a busy few weeks for me, so i have been falling behind on posting again. even missed playing a set last week(05.06.12), as i had a party saturday night that left me tired and unwilling to set up my gear. the next set i post will be the one i did this week. which is my post bigomaha set. 

so lets get to this one shall we?!?! i have very little recollection about this set. so i don't know what to say about it. i do know it is super deep, and i did do a track list... one issue with the track list though is that i probably spelled some titles or some artists names wrong, so use some searching skills if you want the tune and you will be able to find on any of the digital download sites(legal [please). i guess that is about it.. thanks as always for again taking the time out of your day to download, stream, and listen!

make sure if you haven't yet that you go subscribe to my blog at http://lowercasetres.com i have been posting photos of the street art i came across in san francisco, and trying to find out more about the artists.. i share with you some videos i come across on the web, as well as the photos i took.

track listing might be a little off, as i was a little drunk. thanks as always for taking your time to listen! i love you!

i was really going to try to get this tracklisted for you, but i am to busy making art, and taking care of some other biz... so if there is a tune you need to know what it is hit me with a time, and i can try to figure it out. 

i did listen to the set on the way to san francisco and absolutely loved it! it is 3 hours long too. 

thanks as always for taking the time out of your day to listen to me mix... :)</description>

i am going to keep this post short and let the music speak for me. i am behind in getting sets up, as i usually am. so lets get this out there, so i can get caught up next week. 

check out my site: http://lowercasesounds.com every night of the week for great djs from around the planet doing their thing! i am live most sundays at 6pm cst.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/5923/600x600_5719628.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hello friends! hope this finds you well this week! been a few weeks since i posted a set. for that i apologize... i just wasnt feeling them as much as i would like to... 

that brings us to this set... started out with some chill and ambientish stuff, and then worked into some deep house... at the very beginning of the set is some mic noise that gets sorted out within a few seconds... i was going to try to edit that out, but realized that i would have to turn the mp3 into a wav, and then back into mp3... all good, except that the sound would keep degrading... so in interest of not losing the sound quality we get to deal with that noise. :)

this weeks set i tried out the torq 2.0 for djing with, i used cd decks with the control cds to mix and all that jazz, but wanted to try out the software... overall i liked it, but it annoys me to no end to stare at a computer screen while i am mixing... i will probably use it again, as it runs real smooth on my new macbook pro. was thinking that i need to get some small controller action going so i can do ambient mixes from the couch. we will see if i sort that out in the future! 

also with using torq i was hoping that i could easily do my track list, but torq saves tunes that i even just previewed as part of the track listing, so i have no recollection what i actually played... 

will try to get back on board of the track listings this week. 

i guess that is about it for this time around. hope that you have a wonderful week! check lowercasesounds.com periodically through the week to see who is playing live, and stop by on a sunday night at 6pm cst to catch my show live.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/5923/600x600_5572470.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok so here is drifting 003, i came home after a really hard nye/nyd of working... but i felt like i still needed to play some tunes. i lowered my stand that my gear is on to halfway sit. i also included an old kaoss pad that i hadn't used in quite awhile. i think i was able to add to the set without getting carried away with effects.. i need to work with it more again and remember what each effect is and how it works... since i am playing music that isn't like house mixing, it is nice to add some embellishments... something else to know is that i feel like drifting is taking the place of &quot;on a path&quot; for the time being.  i will still play deep house and work some into these sets here and there, but i am really feeling the direction i have been going.  i hope you are too! some of these tunes are from the era i was going to raves and such, when i listen now as older, it really takes me back to those wonderful moments hearing loud music in warehouse settings... thanks as always for taking the time to download, and listen. :)

i hope you all dont mind this shift into ambient music that i have been doing. i am not tired of deep house, just been needing to explore other avenues of music... speak up and let me know your feelings! 

have a happy new year!
