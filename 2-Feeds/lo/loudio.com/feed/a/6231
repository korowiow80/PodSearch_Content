<![CDATA[Thank you all for your comments. It doesn't seem so bad when there are people that feel the way you do. She lives on in how we share our feelings about her, but we will see her again. Maybe sooner than we think.]]></description>

<![CDATA[I know what you mean, Veronica. She was so young, and she could have done so much. Watching Aaliyah taught me something. We need to be more careful in life. We need to be careful what we do, who we let into our lives, and always pray to stay in touch with God. It don't take that much to take us out of this world. <br />
<br />
Aaliyah looked very tired in the end. She did not want to make that last video. I believe that Aaliyah was meant to do bigger and better things. She was special. If she's in heaven, she's singing for the Lord now. Still, I wish she was here too. ]]></description>
