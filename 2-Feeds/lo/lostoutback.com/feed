This episode, they confront squarely the national crisis that has shaken every Australian household to its very foundation: the Australian banana shortage. Restaurant menus are changing, school children are suffering, monkeys are starving&#8230; <em>think of the monkeys!</em> Before you brave the banana black market (the black banana market?), make sure you have all the facts.
