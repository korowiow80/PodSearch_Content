      <title>Episode 8:This is Halloween</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1148595/600x600_1205365.png&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week on The ABIS, Haunt season is almost over. Halloween is upon us, and wow...we do the worst show ever. It's just Scott and myself as everyone else recupirates from a great show last week, and long drives home. We have a &quot;special&quot; opening as Scott shows you just what Rocky Horror Picture Show is all about. 
We also talk the origins of Halloween, Sea Beans and we have Sharon and Marcia on from Journey Paranormal Society on talking about their event happening on Halloween on a haunted Aircraft carrier, paranormal experiences and shadow people. It's really cool stuff, and a lot of fun. You want to check it out this week as yes it is Awesome, but it is most certainly Bad and its a hell of a lot of fun when you Step into the ABIS.
