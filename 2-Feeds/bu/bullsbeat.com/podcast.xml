<itunes:subtitle>When hopes go up..</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>The Bulls raise your hopes by destroying the Nuggets and then send them crashing back down with a loss to the Pacers.   A quick look at our new players in their debut, and I defend Vinny Del Negro, sort of.  Also, my hot topic of the day is how to keep Ben Gordon a Bull next summer without paying the luxury tax.   It isn't pretty, but there are solutions.   All your email questions answered as well.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>It's the 100th episode of the Bulls beat, and it couldn't have come at a better time.  The trading deadline has passed, and the Bulls are definitely the winners.   Not Amare winners, but winners none the less.   I break down all the trades with a special guest who hasn't appeared on the show in quite some time.   We also discuss the Paxson press conference as well as rumors of his retirement, and the Chris Bosh rumors as well as destroying all your hope for Ben Gordon staying (and then reigniting it just for fun).   </itunes:summary>

<title>Bulls Beat #82</title>
<itunes:author>Doug Thonus</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>And there was much rejoicing.. yay..</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>The Bulls beat up on the Wizards, manage to almost blow the game at the end and continue their pattern of completely ignoring their youth.   The season of development is completely off as the Bulls continue to throw out gimicky lineups in an attempt to get around the fact that their front court is worthless.   Andres Nocioni redeems himself, at least a little bit while Drew Gooden does not.   </itunes:summary>

<title>Bulls Beat #39</title>
<itunes:author>Doug Thonus</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle>D'Antoni....  Not so much.. </itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>How did the Bulls lose D'Antoni and was he their man to lose in the first place?   I break it down based on all the published reports from Reinsdorf, D'Antoni, and our beat writers opinions themselves.   Sometimes, there just is no one to blame.   Who do we go with now?  Tom Thibodeau is my choice of the likely candidates.   I also answer our lone email question not related to how awesome it'd be if D'Antoni comes to coach us, and wonder, how will this effect the Gordon and Deng signings.  All this and more on this edition of the Bulls Beat. </itunes:summary>
