    <title>GI Joe Podcast: Episode 26</title>
    <description>When UnderScoopFire was launched back in August 2011, our goal was to create content for children of the 80s. We never claimed to be a retro site, rather a site for fans who held those memories dear, but live in the now.

We quickly realized that the love for G.I. Joe is as strong now as it ever was, and that passion has help us connect with some great people. With all of the general nonsense that we’ve dedicated many episodes of our show to, it was finally time to get serious. As serious as we can be, that is. It was high time for the All-G.I. Joe edition of the UnderScoopFire Podcast!

This week we are proud to present a roundtable of some of the foremost Joe authorities, and we are humbled to have them join us as we are huge fans of each of their respective sites and podcasts. Let’s introduce the panel:

From The Terrordrome - Jason
Co-Host of Flag Points – Dave
From GeneralsJoes &amp; the What’s on Joe Mind Podcast – Justin Bell
UnderScoopFire’s own G.I. Joe – Joe “Alley Viper” Zicari
If a larger panel was audibly feasible we would have loved to expand the roundtable, as there are so many more respected Joe voices out there. We did our best to encourage participation via the G.I. Joe Questionnaire, and read some of the responses on the show.



In this episode:

We take a look at G.I. Joe past and present, discussing in roundtable format:

The history of G.I. Joe (comics, cartoons, action figures, etc.)
The present Joe community
The upcoming G.I. Joe: Retaliation
The 2012 Joe Con in New Orleans
Favorite characters, figures, episodes, and more!
We were honored to have all of our guests join us via the Nerd Rage Toys hotline! Please feel free to continue the conversation in the comments, adding your personal favorite Joes, Cobras and more. Let us know what other property deserves an episode to itself!

    <title>UnderScoopFire's Cocktail Party Ep. 25</title>
    <description>Some quick math:

 Joe + Tank + Googs + Howie + 30ish beers / 1 sober host trying to keep it all together = 25.

Episode 25, that is.

The UnderScoopFire Cocktail Party.

Not much can be said to try to summarize this one. Sit back and listen to Corey (Sober-One Kenobi) as he tries to wrangle 4 idiots into discussing actual topics with some sort of clarity.

Probably not our best idea.

Warning: As all of our podcasts are labeled EXPLICIT, this one comes out of the gates hot. Do NOT press play anywhere near impressionable ears. You’ve been warned.

Episode 25, that is.

The UnderScoopFire Cocktail Party.

Not much can be said to try to summarize this one. Sit back and listen to Corey (Sober-One Kenobi) as he tries to wrangle 4 idiots into discussing actual topics with some sort of clarity.

Probably not our best idea.

Warning: As all of our podcasts are labeled EXPLICIT, this one comes out of the gates hot. Do NOT press play anywhere near impressionable ears. You’ve been warned.

    <title>Meet The Roundtable Voltron</title>
    <description>What rude hosts we've been! 22 episodes in and we've talked about everything from Clark Griswold to Fireball Island, but we never took the time to properly introduce ourselves.

We've spent hours talking about the Drummonds, the Seavers, the Bluths and the Skywalkers, but no such insight has been given into our backgrounds. That ends now.

Join us as we take an in-depth look at our collective backstory with questions such as:

If your wife gave you a free pass for one night with a celebrity hottie, who would you cash it in on?
What was your most beloved childhood item?
What TV show past/present would you most want to be a cast member of?
If you were a trained killer, what would your finishing move be?
and what fictional character would you go on a Mario-esque quest to rescue?</description>

    <title>Oh How We've Changed: From The 80s Till Now Part 2</title>
    <description>Last week we began our discussion of &quot;From 80s Childhood 'til Now: Oh How Far We've Come&quot; and this week we continue! 

The &quot;Roundtable Voltron&quot; reassembles to examine TV, board games, toys, comics, and wrestling from the 80s until now. Stroll down memory lane with us (but be prepared for detours) as we compare Cheers, Fireball Island, and the Ultimate Warrior to Arrested Development, &quot;Pokemans&quot;, and John Cena.

If you offend easily, or hold Angela Lansbury in high regard - this might not be the episode for you.</description>

    <title>Oh How We've Changed: From 80s Childhood til Now</title>
    <description>Last week our &quot;Roundtable Voltron&quot; discussed what we were looking forward to in 2012. This week the guys from UnderScoopFire got on their “computer phones” again and examined how far we've come since the 1980s and our childhood. We broke our discussion into 5 distinct topics:

Video Games - from Atari 2600/7800 to XBox 360
Movies - from Three Amigos to Anchorman
Inter-personal Communication - from letter writing to texting/tweeting/Facebook
TV - from ALF to Alcatraz
Comics/Toys/Games - from 5 points of articulation to today

To claim that we &quot;kept it classy&quot; is is like saying He-Man's wardrobe was &quot;conservative&quot;.</description>

    <description>This week the guys from UnderScoopFire got on their “computer phones” again and tried to discuss a specific topic. As usual, they were derailed- this time by a failed attempt to woo a corporate sponsor within the first 4 minutes.

Once we righted the ship, we examined all of the things we look forward to most in the first quarter of 2012. Topics covered are new and returning TV shows, video games, comic events, movies, and many more geeky delights. We also extend an invitation for one listener to join the UnderScoopFire family!</description>

    <title>American Horror Story Season One Podcast: UnderScoopFIRE</title>
    <description>Questions and answers need each other. Like Peter Parker and Norman Osborn, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, one is simply not as compelling without the other. We all want that payoff. Were all of your American Horror Story questions answered?

In this episode: we discuss the first season of FX’s American Horror Story. Was it TV’s best new show this fall? What were the best characters, episodes, and scenes of the season? How in the hell did Jordan Catalano make it into our discussion?

We breakdown the season finale, discuss the news regarding season 2, compare &amp; contrast with other shows past &amp; present, and wonder why Gumby made Tate &amp; Hayden stand outside the during the Christmas party.

ESPN’s AJ Mass joined us to discuss the first season of American Horror Story, as well as UnderScoopFire regular Dan Fogarty (Fogsmoviereviews.com) and the ‘Ducer Corey Chapman.

We stayed on track pretty well this time, but as usual we worked in a ton of random pop culture references. A small sample of what you’ll hear about during this episode:

    <title>Christmas Vacation Podcast: UnderScoopFire.com</title>
    <description>Howie, Tank &amp; Googs discuss the best scenes, lines and moments from Christmas vacation. We identify the movie's place in history, and speak about it's place as a holiday tradition. This podcast is in no way a summary or breakdown of the film, but more of a celebration of its legacy.

Who is the best Rusty of all the Vacation movies? Your favorite Audrey? How did we connect Rusty Griswold to Magneto?

We recall a few of our favorite Christmas memories (Knight Rider, Sega Genesis, Nutmeg Shots) and as expected, we go a bit off the rails.</description>

    <title>Thunder Cats/ Shadowlaw Writer Brandon Easton: UnderScoopFire.com Podcast</title>
    <description>Brandon Easton knows a thing or two about patience. He began work on his graphic novel Shadowlaw in 1996. After 15 years of leaving it alone, coming back to it, artist turnover and other obstacles, at long last Shadowlaw was slated for a November 16, 2011 release. That release date has now been moved to November 30, but what’s two weeks when you’ve waited 15+ years? We were fortunate to have Brandon join us on the UnderScoopFIRE Podcast to discuss his work in the comic book industry, working as a writer on WB’s new Thundercats animated series, the “Occupy” movements, and much more! Brandon was refreshingly candid with regard to the politics of the comic book industry and the inner workings of a major animation studio. To help promote Shadowlaw, we are giving away five (5) signed copies of the new graphic novel! Click here to enter, there is no sign up required, and it takes 30 seconds MAX! We will even pay shipping, all you have to do is enjoy the book and recommend it to your friends! If you don’t have a Facebook account, click here to enter via Twitter. Joining us on this episode is “friend of the podcast” Justin Bell, the admin of GeneralsJoes.com and co-host of the What’s on Joe Mind? podcast. Justin came back to talk Thundercats and do a Fantasy Task Force Draft victory lap. Brandon revealed who his ultimate Fantasy Task Force would be if he had participated in the draft (see below for Team Easton)!</description>

    <title>ESPN's AJ Mass Interview UnderScoopFire.com</title>
    <description>A conversation with ESPN’s AJ Mass about fantasy sports can quickly evolve into a chat about The Iron Shiek, MTV in the 80s, monkey clocks and magic tricks. And we'd have it no other way.
What sets AJ apart from most is his wealth of personal experience, and the unique and varied nature of his background. A scan of the table of contents from his book How Fantasy Sports Explains the World: What Pujols and Peyton Can Teach Us About Wookiees and Wall Street is evidence of that.
I invite you to listen to the UnderScoopFire podcast with special guest AJ Mass, and check out the book. Perhaps you could curl up and read it in front of the Yule Log on Christmas Eve.
Follow @AJMass on Twitter and read his fantasy sports columns and advice on ESPN.com.

    <description>In this weeks episode of The UnderScoopFire.com Mad Men podcast, Joe &amp; Corey welcome a NEW co host to the show, Mr. Nate Vitale. After exchanging some pleasantries, the gentlemen get down to business and discuss Season 1 Episode 5, “5G”

Don Draper is shaken when his past life comes back to haunt him. After his picture appears in a local newspaper, Adam Whitman, a man who claims to be his younger brother, approaches him. Don, or Dick as his brother knows him, initially denies everything but in the end admits to having taken on a new name. He refuses however to have anything to do with him and tries to buy his silence. When one of the ad men gets a short story published, Pete Campbell is frustrated that his own stories have yet to see the light of day. When his wife approaches an old beau to see if he will publish the stories, he has an interesting proposition for her.

Joan Holloway teaches Peggy Olsen how to wrangle a free lunch out of some of the ad men.

Joe Zicari &amp; Corey Chapman break down the second episode from Season One, discuss smoking while pregnant and the dangers of wearing plastic bags over their heads. They also comment on the January Jones controversy: Is she a meany? And can she really act?</description>
