<title>Diamond Jubilee celebrations: June 2012</title>

<itunes:author>London Philharmonic Orchestra</itunes:author>

<itunes:subtitle>Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:summary>
The London Philharmonic Orchestra is proud to be taking part in Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June 2012 on board the Symphony, as one of ten music herald barges of the flotilla.

As we move down the river, we will be performing a selection of popular works by great British and Commonwealth composers, related either to monarchy, royal events and ceremonial occasions or to familiar landmarks along the Thames. These include Chariots of Fire theme, James Bond theme, Jupiter from Holst's The Planets, Land of Hope and Glory (Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No 1), ‘Nimrod’ from Enigma Variations. The day culminates in a performance of the National Anthem to Her Majesty the Queen at Tower Bridge. 

We've recorded this repertoire and have released the official Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant CD to commemorate the celebrations.

In this edition of our monthly podcast, music writer Andrew Stewart delves into the history of some of the works we'll be performing, bringing their links to London to the fore. He starts with a quick look at the history of pageants before exploring Elgar's Nimrod, Pomp and Circumstance March, Coates' Dambusters March and Arnold's Padstow Lifeboat, as well as music written for film.

<title>Introducing Tristan Murail: May 2012</title>

<itunes:author>London Philharmonic Orchestra</itunes:author>

<itunes:subtitle>Debut Sounds: Currents of Space</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:summary>
The London Philharmonic Orchestra's Debut Sounds 2012 concert includes music by two established, but underperformed, European composers written in the late 20th century - Tristan Murail's Les Courants de l'espace, last heard over 25 years ago in the UK, and Per Nørgård's Voyage into the Golden Screen. In this podcast Julian Anderson, the LPO's Composer in Residence, introduces a concerto by Tristan Murail for ondes Martenot and ensemble. Murail's music has a rich and shimmering palette, exploring atmospheres and other-worldly sounds. 

The concert is also a chance to hear brand new music by the Orchestra's Leverhulme Young Composers - and we hear from the four composers who have been creating and refining their music through a series of workshops.

<itunes:subtitle>Kalevi Aho percussion concerto</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:summary>
Radiant joy and intense poetry characterise recent works from the pen of Finnish composer Kalevi Aho. His style might continue to adapt and evolve, but he never ceases to make listeners aware of the world in alluring and enlightening ways. Here percussionist Colin Currie unveils the new concerto written for him by Aho in a phone interview with Ben Eshmade.

Currie has described the work as 'a very great masterpiece of the genre and an extremely serious contribution to the symphonic literature.' He goes onto say he believes it is 'destined to be a smash with audiences as the music brims with flare, groove and and colour.'

Kalevi Aho’s Sieidi; Concerto for Solo Percussion and Orchestra is commissioned by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Luosto Classic Festival and Gothenburg Symphony.

The April release on the LPO Label is Beethoven's fervent and masterful Missa Solemnis, recorded live at the Royal Festival Hall in 2008. The podcast ends with a preview of the new CD.

<title>Julian Anderson interview: March 2012</title>

<itunes:author>London Philharmonic Orchestra</itunes:author>

<itunes:subtitle>Anderson's The Discovery of Heaven</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:summary>
Julian Anderson is the London Philharmonic Orchestra's Composer in Residence, and his new, three movement orchestral work 'The Discovery of Heaven' is premiered on 24 March 2012.

The title of the work comes from a 1992 novel by Dutch author Harry Mulisch, and in this interview Anderson explores how a piece of music can reflect a book without having a direct narrative connection. He reveals how his own musical language absorbs the eclectic influences of Japanese Gagaku music, Mongolian overtone chanting, Gregorian chant and the battle between percussion and melody heard at the end of the first movement of Nielsen's Symphony No. 5.

The Discovery of Heaven was jointly commissioned by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and New York Philharmonic.

The March release on the LPO Label is of Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe ballet, recorded in 1979 with Bernard Haitink and taken from the BBC archive. The podcast ends with a preview of the new CD.

<itunes:subtitle>Martinu, Dvorak and Liszt</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:summary>
American conductor Marin Alsop is a frequent guest with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Before one of her recent concerts in London which programmed music of central Europe, she gave a pre-concert talk in conversation with James Jolly. The topics explored include the soundworld of Martinů's Sixth Symphony, Dvořák's struggle to be accepted as a composer, and the orchestral writing in Liszt's Piano Concertos. 

The programme included Liszt's Piano Concertos Nos. 1 and 2, performed by Stephen Hough, and Alsop shared the ways in which conducting concertos is a different kind of music-making to the symphonic repertoire.

<title>Anderson, and introducing The Band: December 2011</title>

<itunes:author>London Philharmonic Orchestra</itunes:author>

<itunes:subtitle>Julian Anderson's Fantasias, and an introduction to The Band</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:summary>
Julian Anderson, the London Philharmonic Orchestra's Composer in Residence, sheds light on how he composed his virtuoso work Fantasias. From the simplicity of the opening brass fanfare via the canopy and birds of the Rain Forest, to Tom and Jerry, he helps us understand some of the challenges of taking risks in composition. As this podcast was being produced, we heard that Fantasias won the orchestral category of the British Composers Awards 2011!

Fantasias has been the inspiration and starting point for this term's work by The Band, run by the Orchestra's Education and Community programme. Led by Tim Steiner, young musicians from South London create and perform their own music, alongside members of the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

If you enjoy finding out about The Band, might you consider making a £5 donation as part of our Annual Appeal? You can give online at www.lpo.org.uk or by text message by sending the text PHIL12 £5 to 70070

<itunes:subtitle>Mahler's arrangements of Bach and Beethoven: pre-concert talk by Jeremy Barham</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:summary>
Gustav Mahler is known today through his music, but in his own time was equally known as a conductor and arranger. In this Mahler Anniversary Season pre-concert talk, Surrey University Lecturer Jeremy Barham looks at the fascination the music of JS Bach held for Mahler throughout his life, and the ways in which he reimagined Bach's music for the early 20th century. Beethoven's String Quartet Op. 95 was also arranged by Mahler, who believed that it needed expanding to work in large concert halls, and the result offers an alternative perspective on the work.
