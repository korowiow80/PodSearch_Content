			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I went to the Phoenix Comic Convention with the intention of bringing back a first hand report of just how nerdy things can get. Over the last ten or fifteen years comic conventions have been expanding to include more than fans of the dying comic medium. Anime and general genre fiction (sci-fi, horror, fantasy) are the main attraction now. With those inclusions the average convention goer has morphed from the stereotypical &#8220;comic book guy&#8221; with messy t-shirt and ponytail to a whole new monster, the hyper-energetic internet nerd found in any high school drama club.</p>
<p>I went and sat through awful sounding discussion panel after discussion panel hoping to bring back tales of just how far down the nerd well goes, I have always been a terrible nerd but the people I see at these conventions are like a YouTube comments section come to life. When the weekend was over last year I returned with a decent amount of notes but no huge takeaway from it all. All I could really muster was &#8220;boy are those kids lame&#8221;, which isn&#8217;t something that really needs to be said. It&#8217;s obvious. I didn&#8217;t feel my time was particularly wasted, there is something to be said for the absurd spectacle of it all, gaggles of the helplessly awkward flipping out multiple times a day because their favorite Anime boygirl just walked past in the flesh.</p>
<p>The panels, the exhibition hall and most of the events are really so mundane and lacking that I found very little interesting to report back with, when it&#8217;s risque it&#8217;s PG-13 at best because nerds and shut-ins make poor exhibitionists, when it&#8217;s comedic it&#8217;s on the level of Full House because the truly witty don&#8217;t attempt to host panels on &#8220;Anime Confessions&#8221; ,  &#8221;How to find a Japanese Boyfriend/Girlfriend&#8221;, or &#8220;Raves 101&#8243;. A quick tip, seeing the socially disabled attempt to give &#8220;Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts&#8221; for raving is sad beyond the point of amusing, I felt like Ned Flanders was telling me how to have fun while not giving into Satan. Although in hindsight, I suppose any host that explained to get maximum enjoyment out of your rave you need to gobble every pill that comes your way while rubbing on every glowstick spinning douche in sight would likely not be asked to return the next year.</p>
<p>Unlike last year a lot of the dumber sounding panels are gone, it&#8217;s a lot of things like &#8220;Building Star Wars Costumes&#8221;, or &#8220;Shit Josh Whedon&#8217;s Done&#8221; I didn&#8217;t attend many panels and spent a lot of time people watching. I saw a guy in a &#8220;Jedis for Jesus&#8221; shirt, there was a &#8220;Gamers for Christ&#8221; booth, these odd attempts to shoehorn religion into some thing &#8220;the kids are into&#8221; always amuse me for some reason, it always seems so cheesy and ill fitting. I had to chuckle to myself when I saw Brent Spiner from Star Trek in the autograph area, &#8220;Oh shit, Data&#8217;s sitting over there and dude is mad old now.&#8221; I&#8217;ve waited in some long ass lines over the years to have cd&#8217;s and posters signed by bands I like. I always thought it was a cool way to give back to the fans, devoting an entire day to shaking hands and signing the random shit they put in front of you. What I will never understand is paying $25-$55 or more to get an 8&#215;10 with some sharpie on it. I&#8217;m not sure where the line is with me, I suppose one is giving back to the fans and the other is being an egotistical dick. It&#8217;s hard to put full blame on the actors, if people weren&#8217;t willing to pay for it, they couldn&#8217;t do it, that whole thing strikes me as really lame and that tends to be a large part of every convention.</p>
<p>The exhibition hall was aisle after of aisle of all things nerd, anime dvds, toys, shirts, posters, costume accessories, and a lot of illustrators. Aside from the people that work on well known titles in comics, I noticed a lot of freelance illustrators selling sketches and posters, misshapen Iron Man poster next to 24&#8242;x36&#8242; sketch of an anime ass looking Wolverine with bad anatomy for the low, low price of $200. I feel that if DeviantArt ever sets up a swap meet, this will be the template.  I saw a zombie parade that had too many not zombies for my taste, and made it to two panels. The first was the aforementioned &#8220;Anime Confessions&#8221;, this was a continuation of a theme I noticed last year, the &#8220;not a panel.&#8221; The not a panel is what happens when someone proposes a panel and is accepted but actually has nothing to say or the inability to hold the attention of 15 people for 60 minutes. You&#8217;ll walk in expecting a panel but will instead find the audience loudly talking among themselves while the host&#8217;s can hardly be heard despite microphones. The &#8220;Anime Confessions&#8221; panel consisted of loud chatter with the hosts throwing out a question answered by a raising of hands, the hosts would then repeat whatever the audience member answered then add nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does anyone have a secret anime crush? You over there in the pink wig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angsty McGirlyHair&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yea, Angsty McGirlyHair from DevilsOmenSwordDemons Ten, yea he&#8217;s pretty cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over and Over and Over for 50ish minutes.</p>
<p>The only thing I do find remotely interesting is the elaborate costumes and what drives a human to do that. I&#8217;m assuming it is a healthy dose of insanity along with a large lack of attention. These are people in absurdly complicated and intricate replicas from every corner of media that often take hours and hours to be constructed and only worn once or twice, a few days a year. Tomorrow I intend to chat these folks up for some insight into why they think it&#8217;s a good idea to be Iron Man for 3 days a year, complete with crazy light up chest piece and gloves.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dig this, where I work I have co-workers that often arrive 20-30 minutes early every day. Now your first thought for them is, &#8220;bravo for being early and ready to work at shift start time&#8221; but let&#8217;s look at this phenomenon on a much larger scale. If our test subject, lets call her Tina Timely, arrives 20 minutes early to work  every day, and there are 5 days in a standard work week. In one week Tina spent 1 hour just sitting and waiting to clock in. 4 hours in a month.  After 6 months Tina has spent 24 hours, an entire day of their life just sitting in the break room waiting to clock in. And of course in a year it goes to just over 2 days of Tina&#8217;s life. A lot can be done in two days, and even if you would have spent that 2 days doing nothing and watching TV, isn&#8217;t that at least preferable to spending 2 days a year sitting in a break room waiting for the clock to hit shift start? From age twenty to fifty if you follow this practice you will have spent around 2 months of your life just waiting to clock in. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to bet we all have better things to do than sit around waiting to clock in, be like me, be a minute late everyday. Using this method you now have an extra 4 hours every year to enjoy your short ass life that is not getting any longer.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading about the &#8220;<a href="http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/arizona/article_ba355a26-30b9-11e0-b1f5-001cc4c03286.html" target="_blank">States Rights</a>&#8221; movement in Arizona a moment ago. Usually I treat any legislation brought forth by the xenophobic rapturist government of Arizona as just a case of nutjobs doing wacky things to garner support from their nutjob brethren. But in this case it&#8217;s an idea that I agree with in principle, being brought forth in a way that would never work in a million years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if a kid with down syndrome wrote a beautiful sonnet, but it was on the inside of a bathroom stall at a Wal-Mart, and he wrote it with his own dung.</p>
<p>States can already reject federal laws, they just have to also reject the federal funding that comes along with &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; upholding them. Such forfeiture can be crippling to public works programs, and is very rarely practiced. It&#8217;s fucked up, but that&#8217;s the law. The legislation being put forth doesn&#8217;t challenge the logic of federal law, it just argues with it like a drunk chick.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the point I&#8217;m trying to make here folks, you see there&#8217;s a question that has bothered me for years.</p>
<p>Is the government controlled by some highly advanced, super conspiratorial Illuminati? Or merely a bunch of fucking idiots?</p>
<p>I found the answer on Facebook.</p>
<p>Take a good hard look at your &#8220;news feed&#8221;. See how incredibly dumb that shit is?</p>
<p>Now think of Facebook for what it really represents, a collective consciousness, the sum of the collective ideas running through the heads of everyone you know at this very moment. Back in the day, when folks dreamed about this type of thing, they imagined a global consciousness as some type of magical thing that would bring global enlightenment. They thought we would be traveling on airships through time and alternate universes, instead we have work out updates and Tool lyrics from a community that doesn&#8217;t understand that almost any thought that can be expressed in 142 characters or less, should probably be kept to ones self.</p>
<p>Not that there&#8217;s anything really wrong with that, I participate and find myself entertained regularly by it. But now I do so knowing why I enjoy it, that would be because I am a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>This realization isn&#8217;t the end of the world for me, and I encourage you not to let it be the end of yours either. Just understand, you are a human being, and like all living beings, you are an animal. Now as an animal you could do a hell of a lot worse. The food chain will typically be kind to you and you can enter and exit water pretty much as you please. However, when you compare the percentage of overall knowledge available in the universe known by you, with the amount known by the average house pet, neither of you really know much of shit.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all a bunch of fucking idiots, and our democratically elected governments are merely a reflection of that fact.</p>
<p>One can make the argument that our leaders are under the influence of powerful corporations with boundless resources, this is probably true, and it&#8217;s because they are idiots.</p>
<p>Anyone with half a mind can see that the ultimate goal of any corporation is one of unlimited growth and endless profit. This simply isn&#8217;t possible. Regardless of how many children you enslave, or governments you control, it has to end somewhere. Profit will eventually hit a wall and have to roll back. Such pursuit isn&#8217;t just evil, it&#8217;s completely unsustainable, and ultimately totally fucking retarded. The only type of person who would take up such a task would be someone who was dumb enough to let their greed run completely unchecked by common sense. The type of person who would spend their life building a ladder to the heavens because they believed there to be gold coins on top of the clouds.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that we&#8217;re all a bunch of idiots, being ordered around by greedy idiots, who are in turn being ordered around by really greedy fucking idiots, and even if there is a shadow government, all evidence supports the idea that its a really, really fucking dumb one.</p>
<p>Next time you observe two people on television or on the radio arguing politics, try to do so without picking a side. If you really listen you&#8217;ll realize that neither party is really making any sense, and even when a good point is made, it&#8217;s usually for the wrong reasons. They are just arguing for arguments sake, because its their job to be right 100 percent of the time. It&#8217;s bullshit noise disguised as discourse. Idea&#8217;s aren&#8217;t being communicated and exchanged, they&#8217;re being shoved up our collective ass by pseudo intellectual bull queers, and a huge percent of the population loves every moment of it. Hell, a lot of these folks even send money, because they&#8217;re all fucking idiots.</p>
<p>So whats to be done? I don&#8217;t know fucker, read a book or something. I&#8217;d also suggest you invest in canned goods and pornography, as from my experience you can really never have enough of either. While you do that, for gods sakes don&#8217;t take your stupid little world and the dumbass agenda you&#8217;ve set forth in it very seriously, its all built on a giant pile of bullshit that if you&#8217;re lucky enough, wont collapse upon you before you hit the grave.</p>
<p>That and try to think for your goddamn self. It&#8217;s not that hard, it just takes the courage to face the idea that you will usually be wrong. This is not such a big deal because everyone else usually is too. The major flaw of our society isn&#8217;t our ignorance, it&#8217;s our refusal to own up to our own severe flaws in logic and work together towards ironing them out together, as opposed to seeing who can manufacture the bumper sticker that best expresses our stupidity. It doesn&#8217;t take intellect to argue with a moron, it just takes time and a low self opinion.</p>
<p>And stop posting about how you&#8217;re about to go to the gym. Nobody gives a fuck and it makes you look like a total douche.</p>
<p>Amen Bitches,</p>
<p>H.M.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the Attitude that  fueled the 90&#8217;s. That was the fatal flaw in Eric Bischoff&#8217;s plan. He  crashed around America selling the NWO without ever giving a thought to  the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people  who took him seriously&#8230; All those pathetically eager wrestling freaks  who thought they could buy Goldberg shirts and NWO posters for fiften  bucks a shot.</p>
<p>But their loss and failure is ours too. What Bischoff took down with him  was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create&#8230;  a generation of permanent cripples, failed jobbers, who never  understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Wrestling Business:  the desperate assumption that somebody&#8230; or at least some phenom -  isn&#8217;t going to go out looking up at the lights.</p>
<p>My central memory of that time seems to hang on one, or five, or maybe  84 consecutive weeks when I left the WWE Headquarters half-crazy and,  instead of going home, took the big personal jet across Connecticut at  two hundred miles an hour wearing a fine suit and doing a strut . . .   but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would  come to a place where people were just as high on Austin and wild for  the product as I was: No doubt at all about that. . .</p>
<p>There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not in the WWE HQ,  then down the Disney-MGM Studios or up in the Hammerstein Ballroom . . .  . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal  sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .</p>
<p>And that, I think, was the handle - that sense of inevitable victory in  the Monday Night War over WCW and ECW. Not in any mean or military  sense; we didn&#8217;t need that. Our finances would simply prevail. We had  all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.  . . .</p>
<p>So now, less than ten years later, you can go up on a steep hill in  Stamford, Connecticut and look Southwest, and with the right kind of  eyes you can almost see the high-water mark that place where the wave  finally broke and rolled back.</p>

Unfortunately I am unable to create subdued music and it never really worked well in the show. Here is a zip file containing the 1st EP of music I put together, it&#8217;s just shy of 20 minutes and would make an excellent wedding or baby shower present.

We posted a video from the game starring Nic, Scott, Hinton and myself, in discussion of the game I had the idea that using one person in all 4 slots would result in some awful, awful film. I guess I&#8217;m too late because the server that allowed you to upload your created films to the internet to share with friends doesn&#8217;t seem to work anymore. Never to be deterred I am braving the path anyway, I&#8217;m too cheap for a capture card that I can plug my xbox into so I&#8217;m sharing this crap bootleg film style. The game you have to play to make these is quite terrible so I don&#8217;t know how many I&#8217;ll do.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a dystopic future, where urban areas have grown into mega-cities that  cover entire coastal regions, the justice system has evolved to a single  person invested with the power of police, judge, jury, and executioner:  the Judge. Among the Judges of Mega-City One, Judge Hinton is one of the  best, and a particular favorite of the Head of the Council, Judge Mozart. But there are evil forces at work in the Justice Dept: block  riots and the escape of Jeremy Rage, a homicidal maniac, are only steps in a  plan that ultimately lead to the sentencing of Hinton for a murder he  didn&#8217;t commit.  Hinton must discover the secrets of his own past and  survive to stop the evildoers.

When the first Newcomer police  officer, Mozart  is assigned his new partner, he is given Hinton , a   mildly racist veteran, the animosity between them soon gives way to   respect as they investigate the Newcomer underworld, and especially   Newcomer leader Nicholas Bewsey.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Luckily I&#8217;m good at predicting the future, HMShow LIVE! Was no more or  less than I expected. What I do expect to see, if we ever decide you  fucks deserve to be graced by our awful presence in the flesh again. is  some asses in chairs enjoying bargain priced booze and delicious food.   Thanks to the attendees who managed to find the front door of their  house to make it outside last Saturday and special thanks to our last  minute guest swap Nic Bewsey and Rage for working our godlike sound  system and dazzling computer effects!</p>
<p>Hinton of course was so rocked to his core by the events of June 26th  2010 he immediately fled the state and will be sending me a cassette  of  the audio of the momentous event by carrier pigeon. I assume one can  expect the digital translation of HMShow LIVE! around Wednesday morning  or so.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the Huppenthal thing was an almost total failure and after it got the site shut down (temporarily) it&#8217;s been permanently removed.</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s the tricky bit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t regret a single sentence of the piece, I think its a strong bit of satire (for me at least) that uses vulgarity as a means to an end. The goal was to create a consequence for a practice that has offended me for about a decade and a half now. John Huppenthal superimposed his family in front of an American flag and slathered every street corner of the state with it in order to give folks the impression that he&#8217;s a family man and a proud patriot. I used the photo to paint him as the cuckold to a family of cock hungry sluts.</p>
<p>But regardless of my intent, I&#8217;m a strong believer in the idea that if you have to explain a joke, then it probably sucks. That seems to be the case here. My only goal in writing this is to clear up this idea that I would create such a monstrosity, slap my name on it, and release it to the audience with the sole intention of offending people. If I wanted to offend people I&#8217;d just post a photo of my ass on the front page and never bother to write or record another word. My goal with all my work is to get folks to recognize the absurdity of everything around them, by being as absurd as I possibly can. Sometimes I go too far, but if I spend a bunch of time worrying about how folks might perceive what I say, then what I&#8217;m saying becomes contrived and should no longer be said. To pull punches would only serve to cheat myself and the audience, and fuck that.</p>
<p>But like I said, joke failed, my fault. I apologize to anyone whose time was wasted with my misguided attempt at satire and hope I haven&#8217;t discouraged further visits to our otherwise generally agreeable site.</p>
<p>-hinton

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had a few days to think about a recent post on the site. I was never a big fan of the idea but I&#8217;m not one to stand in the way of the artistic process, I would rather the post goes up and I disagree with it rather than tell Hinton, &#8216;No you cannot put that shit on our website.&#8221; I am not a person that is easily offended or believes some lines are too taboo to be crossed, I will instead explain why I do not care for the aforementioned post.</p>
<p>I can really sum up my feelings with this old article from the onion <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/marilyn-manson-now-going-doortodoor-trying-to-shoc,459/">here</a>. The starting inspiration for the letter was the idea that using one&#8217;s family in political signs and advertisements was wrong and something that should not happen. I think that the route that was taken was a route of low hanging fruit, depicting the women as whores comes off as simple as, &#8220;your mother&#8221;, I always hoped we we&#8217;re a little more clever than that here at HMShow. How will calling some guy&#8217;s wife and kids whores help further the idea that families do not belong on political signs? It won&#8217;t. What it will do is piss off and offend some people, people&#8217;s buttons are pushed, mission accomplished. Usually it&#8217;s some folks at a bar or in some public spot, but now we have publicly posted sexually explicit stories about the wife, daughter, and underage daughter of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huppenthal">member of the U.S. Senate</a>. All it will accomplish, if anything, is royally pissing off a guy with a fair amount of power and money, I have no problem making enemies out of anyone rich and powerful if there is something to be accomplished, a right to be wronged, a justice served, betterment of the people, all that jazz&#8230; Doing it just to be offensive however seems really shortsighted and unintelligent, qualities I&#8217;d rather not be associated with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mozart you dick, shitting all over someone&#8217;s joke!&#8221; Kinda, I just think there are better ways to go about this, something more clever, something less &#8220;ooooo isn&#8217;t that edgy?&#8221; One can find <a href="http://www.johnhuppenthal.com/contact.aspx">many ways</a> John Huppenthal could have been contacted to appear on HMShow to defend his actions, we have a pocket recorder, he could be confronted with questions of his douchebaggery at random in public. <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/gallery/1778865_nkewo/1/88412873_mrpNb#88412389_SMrrK">This page</a> has an open invitation to call john himself with whatever is on your mind.</p>
<p>I am in no way supporting John Huppenthal, <a href="http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=3092">here</a>, <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/2009/01/18/arizona-legislator-charged-criminally-with-stealing-campaign-signs/">here</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2009/10/senate_education_committee_cha.php">here</a> are reasons this man should be set adrift in a raft, however I also hope in the future we can aim higher than just trying to be as offensive as possible. This isn&#8217;t the kind of thing discussed at the HMShow inception, something about interesting people telling their stories and interviews and video cameras which became microphones, somehow we&#8217;ve gone from that to a re-telling of The Aristocrats.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the day that KFC has chosen to release the &#8220;Double Down&#8221; upon the American public. The &#8220;sandwich&#8221;, comprised of bacon, cheese and &#8220;Colonels Sauce&#8221; between two pieces of fried chicken, is sure to expedite the tailspin of western civilization into a ruined diabetes infected hellscape by the end of the month at the latest. Even sooner perhaps, if folks start dipping it in ranch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the interest of science that I, Hinton McLeod chose to seek out one of these grease soaked doomsday devices. In order to dissect it, and then consume it in its entirety, along with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy and a medium root beer. It is my hope that when this is discovered by the race of mutant cockroaches who are sure to replace man as the keeper of earths dominion, it can stand a stark warning as to how ones hunger is always ultimately their downfall. So it&#8217;s with a heavy heart, and a kinda queasy, kinda burning stomach that I now share my findings with you, the audience, whatever species you might be.</p>
<p><img src="http://hmshow.podbean.com/wp-content/blogs32/141331/uploads/" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p><a title="IMG00130.jpg -  bytes"><img src="../mf/web/4m9jvd/IMG00130.jpg" alt="IMG00130.jpg -  bytes" width="310" height="310" /></a></p>
<p>This is what it looks like out of the box, notice that it appears both creamy and shiny at the same time, I&#8217;ve never seen anything reflect light like that, and I hope to god never to see something like that again.</p>
<p><img src="http://hmshow.podbean.com/wp-content/blogs32/141331/uploads/" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://hmshow.podbean.com/wp-content/blogs32/141331/uploads/" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p><a title="IMG00133.jpg -  bytes"><img src="../mf/web/atftz2/IMG00133.jpg" alt="IMG00133.jpg -  bytes" width="315" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>This if how it appears once you pry it apart. I was actually pretty psyched to try it out before I did this. But it appears to have been man-glazed by far more than just one Colonel, it&#8217;s then I realized that &#8220;Colonel&#8217;s Sauce&#8221; was meant in the plural tense as opposed to the possessive.</p>
<p>As for the taste of this beast? Well of course it was fucking delicious. How could it not be? Crack is spectacular as well, but its all about the drawbacks, and I&#8217;d say the two are roughly equal when it come to reeking havoc on your insides. My roommate had one a few hours before me and hasn&#8217;t been the same since. He&#8217;s now asleep at 8:30 in the evening.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget that ones relationship with their food doesn&#8217;t end in their mouth (tee hee). But once this fuckers inside you, it does all it can to make sure its presence is known. It reminds me of the &#8220;oral enema&#8221;, a concoction of warm water and sea salt that comes rocketing out of your ass roughly 30 minutes after you drink it. Your body doesn&#8217;t know what to do with it, so it screams little alerts from every one of your organs until it can finally rid itself of the horror you&#8217;ve thrust upon it in the only way it knows how. What I&#8217;m trying to say is that I can&#8217;t stop shitting. Human beings shouldn&#8217;t eat this, fucking ever.</p>
<p>I once made a pizza that had brown gravy instead of pizza sauce. It was incredible, but the whole time I was eating it I couldn&#8217;t help but think &#8220;this isn&#8217;t food&#8221;. That&#8217;s what this &#8220;sandwich&#8221; is, it&#8217;s not food in the same way that cigarette smoke isn&#8217;t air and Pepsi doesn&#8217;t really quench thirst. It&#8217;s just a pile of salt masquerading as subsistence, an elaborate hoax played upon your senses. Dirty pool, Colonel Sanders, dirty pool.</p>
<p>May god spare our greasy souls.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the single proudest moment of my life.</p>
<p>Let me start by apologizing for the recent lack of shows, my hope is that this announcement and the attached recordings will more than make up for it.</p>
<p>You see over the past three years or so myself (Hinton/MC Unicorn) and my collaborator (Scott Fish/ DJ Food Stamp) have been secretly recording an album. One that has developed far past our original intentions and become something we think is really special.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long and crazy journey, filled with hard work and seemingly endless setbacks, but as I sit now listening to the final product I can honestly say I&#8217;d do the whole thing over again ten time over.</p>
<p>We do a lot of joking around here on the hmshow but believe me when I say say this. What your about to hear is not just a collection of songs but the sound of two souls, stripped naked of their mortal armor, sent out into the universe to find the source of all it&#8217;s beauty&#8230;&#8230;..and finding it.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s with a heavy heart and thoroughly nourished soul I bring to you,</p>
<p>Strafford Drive</p>
<p>Enjoy

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most likely this week will be another &#8220;show from the vault week.&#8221; Our schedules haven&#8217;t allowed us time to get together for anything productive. On top of that, Hinton and Mozart Show industries acquired a copy of D.J. Hero this past Tuesday. Turns out it&#8217;s a rad time to be had.</p>
<p>There were two occasions this past week our schedules allowed Hinton and I to occupy the same room, once when we tested the two-player guitar/d.j. feature of D.J. Hero, the other was me stopping by Hinton&#8217;s office to berate him about how boring the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas role-playing mod he was playing looked. I would propose a virtual paint drying simulator would be a lot more exciting. Which reminds me, I should text Hinton and check if there is a watching grass grow profession in the game, sounds right up it&#8217;s alley.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be hard but I&#8217;m going to try and convince Hinton and myself to use this space as a sounding board more often, numbers are up so someone out there may have interest in the things we have to say.</p>
<p>Expect a show to hit the site and your ear-holes Monday or Tuesday, I&#8217;m currently attempting to juggle making my girlfriend think she is the only one for me while running off first chance I get to let D.J. Hero know it is the only one for me. In between all the double-agency I&#8217;ll find time to produce 30-60 minutes of entertainment out of the vault of unreleased material. Although I&#8217;ll warn you, Robot Rock and We Will Rock You aren&#8217;t going to mix themselves together.</p>
<p>xoxoxoxo,</p>
<p>Mozart

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hinton here</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t had any new shows for slightly longer than usual and for that I apologize.</p>
<p>Please dont throw that refrigerator you have chained to your leg into the body of water before you. Me and Mozart will be back sooner than later. Our schedules have been in an awful twist. Mainly Mozart has to work and I&#8217;ve had to barely attend class and get way too drunk almost nightly.</p>
<p>A great deal of recording has been done, but mainly its been unlistenable either because of random sound card errors or our asshole friends not being able to use microphones correctly.</p>
<p>Rest assured we&#8217;ll be back by next monday with our regular show, and hopefully Mozarts editing genius (which is so complex I can never hope to understand it) will allow you kids to hear all the absoulutely mindblowing shit Riko and I have recorded in the meantime.</p>
<p>Thanks again for listening to our weekly pile of nonsense. We thoroughly appreciate it and would kiss the tips of all of your penises if only we swung that way.</p>
<p>Have a nice one</p>
<p>H.M.
