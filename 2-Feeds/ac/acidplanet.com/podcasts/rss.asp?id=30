<title>Ziggy Marley Interview on Moe Train&apos;s Tracks - MoeTrainsTracks.com</title>

<description>WEDNESDAY, MAY 02, 2012: How could we possibly describe this interview, but to say that we were truly honored to be able to sit down with Ziggy Marley at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival... It&apos;s not often that one gets to sit down with one of their musical and life inspirations, but fortunately it happened in Manchester, Tennessee. We approach each interview with a different angle, but all preconceived angles were thrown out the window once we stepped onto Ziggy&apos;s tour bus. Earlier on in the day, The Tracks crew was in the pit for Ziggy&apos;s set, and the realization set in that we&apos;d be face to face in less than two hours. I admit that I was a bit nervous before doing the interview, but the nerves went away once Ziggy and I started to connect. In this very exclusive interview, Ziggy and MTT discusses love, his music, and other topics which combine for an amazing interview.

Fortunately, we at Moe Train&#8217;s Tracks got to sit down with him backstage, and picked his brain for an amazing interview... With a very special surprise guest...  Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna! ( Rating: Squeaky Clean (G) / 31.1MB / 312Kbps / 13min 35sec )</description>
