			<title>Money For Blondes.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/finances-for-blondes]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;I came across some interesting information the other day, bizarre information, crazy information, that has led me on a journey of discovery. I was watching one of my sons run during a track meet (1). There were six middle schools all competing in the various track events, and the place was packed. I sat in the middle of the large crowd of parents who had come to cheer on (2) their children. A lady who I knew was talking to me about children growing up, entering high school, and applying for scholarships. &ldquo;My oldest is a few years away from all of that,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But still (3), I should probably start looking into (4) scholarships.&rdquo; She told me that she had already done so, as her son is older than mine. &ldquo;There are all kinds of private scholarship funds out there. You won't believe it. There's even one for being blonde!&rdquo; There was a long pause, as I frowned and thought about what she had said. &ldquo;For being blonde?&rdquo; I asked in disbelief(5). So many questions rushed into my head. &ldquo;How blonde do you have to be?&rdquo; &ldquo;Could I bleach (6) my hair blonde to get a scholarship?&rdquo; &ldquo;And who decides if you qualify? Does a little old lady with a huge Madonna wig come to your house and check-out your hair?&rdquo; This couldn't be true, I decided. How ridiculous. But, my friend told me that lots of rich individuals will leave money for people who have certain qualities. I had to investigate. So, back at home, I did some research on the internet. I came across a website called '45 of the weirdest college scholarships'. Well, I didn't find any scholarships for being blonde, even though there were many searches for 'scholarships for blondes'. But I did find a lot of other bizarre ones: if you are a male over 6' 2'' or a female over 5'10'', you could qualify for $1000 by writing an essay entitled 'What being tall means to me.' If you're a nudist, a vegetarian, if you wish to study fungi, if you enjoy duck calling, or if you like to watch the series 'Star Trek', then you can get money for college! Or if you can predict the future, play the bagpipes, or can design clothes for the prom (7) out of duct tape (sticky tape), then you are also eligible (8) for money. If only I had known about all of this 20 years ago! I could have joined all of those groups, and got a PhD for free! I could have been a duck calling, bagpipe playing, fungi studying, future predicting nudist vegetarian (well, perhaps not the nudist part) who could predict her own shining educational future..... and not even have to change from a brunette to a blonde.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1. 'Track' has several meanings. It can mean a small path created by man or animals. It can mean 'to follow', or it is a noun meaning the sporting events that are running based.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. My son competed in the running long jump and did quite well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b. The mile run was the last event in the track meet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">2. 'To cheer on' can also be expressed as 'to cheer for'. The first expression implies encouraging someone in their event, the second implies supporting an individual or group.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. As the athletes ran, we cheered them on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b. Though he was last, we cheered him on, and tried to encourage him to go faster.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">3. 'But still' is often used like 'however' when you are using 2 slightly contrasting ideas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. They won't arrive until later, but still we should get the house ready now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b. We have plenty of food in the fridge, but still we shouldn't be wasteful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">4. 'To look into' can mean to investigate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. We looked into getting a loan, but we didn't qualify.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b. They looked into scholarships and found one for bald people!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">5. 'Disbelief' means 'not believing' and is usually preceded by 'in' or 'with'.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. I looked at him in disbelief; I couldn't believe what he had just said.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b. He put his hand to his mouth in disbelief when he saw how beautiful she looked.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">6. 'Bleach' is a powerful chemical cleaner that is used to remove color from hair. It can be used as a verb sometimes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. I used some bleach to clean out the garbage can. That should clean it!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b. The sun has bleached our patio chairs; they look so pale now!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">7. The 'Prom' is a very important dance at High School.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. Are you going to ask someone to go to the Prom with you?</p>

			<title>A hanging head.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-hanging-head]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Recently I've had the strangest feeling when I've been alone at home. My husband is at work, and my children are at school, so I should be alone. I don't hear footsteps(1), or anyone moving around in the house. I don't hear talking or breathing in any of the rooms. But I sense that someone else is in the house, or something else. When I'm upstairs, folding laundry in the laundry room, I feel it less. But as I walk downstairs, I become aware(2)of a presence, gradually with each step. As I write this, I'm in the living room, where the feeling is strongest. It reminds(3) me of when I was a girl, and I would stare up at the ceiling at night, in my room, in the darkness. My imagination would make me see all sorts of things up there, or coming out of the walls. Shadows of toys would become people or creatures, fairies and figures. So, here I sit, and it feels as if a pair of (4)eyes is watching me. Something has made its place in here, silently. And, as I sit here writing, I can feel that it is directly above me. Should I turn and look? Am I brave enough to reach out to touch it? Yes, I will. And I do. My fingers immediately feel something very large, cool, and smooth. The more I touch, the bigger it appears. It's body goes up and up. It feels strong, and what's that? It's not skin, but fur(5), and lots of it. In fact, it's completely covered in fur. Up my hand goes to its face. A long snout, and big bulging eyes, those eyes that never close. I feel a small forehead. This creature has a small brain for such a big, strong body. Large, hairy ears are alert at the sides of the head, listening for danger. This creature is wanted. This creature was wanted. Its powerful legs weren't enough for it to get away. It was wanted for its crown; and what a magnificent crown it is, unique, impressive, a crown of battle. It was a guardian(6) of the forest. And now it is here, still a guardian, quiet, watchful, always alert. It was barely seen among the trees, a passing shadow. And here, it's barely noticed, until you are alone. Then, you hear a whisper from the forest, you read its story in its eyes, and you feel the glory of its crown.</p>

			<title>A Time For Parades.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-time-for-parades]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;There is a festival in this town that brings in thousands of visitors, and livens(1) the valley for over a week. It's called Apple Blossom. By the name, you can tell that it coincides with the blossoming of the many apple trees that grow here. The weather is still playing a tug-of-war(2) between cold, windy days, and hot ones, but usually, by Apple Blossom, the sun is winning. For a few weeks leading up to the festival, groups of people are busy building floats that have varying(3) themes. There is always one for the three Apple Blossom princesses who have been elected by the local high schools. Their float is often something to do with Spring, or flowers. They stand and wave and look pretty; it must be a very hard job. And then there are all the floats of schools, sports groups, charities, and some businesses. If you are involved in one of these organizations, you have the opportunity to walk next to the float. My daughter, who does gymnastics, was chosen with her friends to hold the sign of the gymnastics group, while other girls and boys did cartwheels(4) and flips all along the road. I walked with the proud parents and handed out water bottles. It was very exciting. I was tempted to do a flip, just like the children were doing. But then I realized that if I did do one, it would be the very last thing that I ever did. So, I took photographs instead. I waved a little, trying to mimic(5) the princesses (my wave was better than theirs). A few people I knew were standing along the road; they called to me and waved. I began to feel famous. In fact, other people waved enthusiastically and called to me, &ldquo;Oh hi there..&rdquo; but then used a name like Angela, or Rebecca, or Mary. But I was caught up in the enthusiasm, so I waved back and smiled. What lovely confusion! The parade was a big event. There were bands and schools from all over the state, and visitors from Japan. A carnival had been set up down by the river, and a food fare was crammed(6) into one of the down town parks. There are so many people in the center of town for the parade that it's impossible to find parking close by, so you need to park far away on a street in the residential area. Our parade finished, we rested and had icecream, and then Domini and I had a long, hot hike back to the car.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">To liven means to bring a place alive with excitement, movement, or color. It is often followed by the word 'up'.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. The new paint in the kitchen really livens up the place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b. When the DJ gets here, the party will liven up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A tug-of-war is a game played where two people or groups pull on a long rope. The winning group is the one who manages to pull the opposing team over a half-way line.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. We played tug-of-war, but our opponents won; they were much stronger than us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Varying comes from the word 'vary' or the verb 'to vary' meaning to offer variety. It's pronunciation can be a bit tricky, so here's some practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. The artist's pictures were all blue, but varying in subjects.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[&nbsp;There is a festival in this town that brings in thousands of visitors, and livens(1) the valley for over a week. It's called Apple Blossom. By the name, you can tell that it coincides with the blossoming of the many apple trees that grow here. The weather is still playing a tug-of-war(2) between cold, windy days, and hot ones, but usually, by Apple Blossom, the sun is winning. For a few weeks leading up to the festival, groups of people are busy building floats that have varying(3) themes. There is always one for the three Apple Blossom princesses who have been elected by the local high schools. Their float is often something to do with Spring, or flowers. They stand and wave and look pretty; it must be a very hard job. And then there are all the floats of schools, sports groups, charities, and some businesses. If you are involved in one of these organizations, you have the opportunity to walk next to the float. My daughter, who does gymnastics, was chosen with her friends to hold the sign of the gymnastics group, while other girls and boys did cartwheels(4) and flips all along the road. I walked with the proud parents and handed out water bottles. It was very exciting. I was tempted to do a flip, just like the children were doing. But then I realized that if I did do one, it would be the very last thing that I ever did. So, I took photographs instead. I waved a little, trying to mimic(5) the princesses (my wave was better than theirs). A few people I knew were standing along the road; they called to me and waved. I began to feel famous. In fact, other people waved enthusiastically and called to me, &ldquo;Oh hi there..&rdquo; but then used a name like Angela, or Rebecca, or Mary. But I was caught up in the enthusiasm, so I waved back and smiled. What lovely confusion! The parade was a big event. There were bands and schools from all over the state, and visitors from Japan. A carnival had been set up down by the river, and a food fare was crammed(6) into one of the down town parks. There are so many people in the center of town for the parade that it's impossible to find parking close by, so you need to park far away on a street in the residential area. Our parade finished, we rested and had icecream, and then Domini and I had a long, hot hike back to the car.



To liven means to bring a place alive with excitement, movement, or color. It is often followed by the word 'up'.
a. The new paint in the kitchen really livens up the place.
b. When the DJ gets here, the party will liven up.


A tug-of-war is a game played where two people or groups pull on a long rope. The winning group is the one who manages to pull the opposing team over a half-way line.
a. We played tug-of-war, but our opponents won; they were much stronger than us.


Varying comes from the word 'vary' or the verb 'to vary' meaning to offer variety. It's pronunciation can be a bit tricky, so here's some practice.


a. The artist's pictures were all blue, but varying in subjects.
b. I think that everyone enjoyed the comedian, to varying degrees.


To mimic means to copy, usually in action or a facial feature.
a. The monkey mimicked the lady drinking coffee.
b. The boy mimicked his teacher when he wasn't looking.


To be crammed comes from the verb 'to cram' which means to stuff or pack something in tightly (do you remember the phrase 'jam packed'?)
a. He crammed the crackers into his mouth and threw the empty packet in the bin.
b. The pencils are crammed so tightly in the box, that I can't get them out!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; <span style="font-size: small;" size="3">I was fortunate enough (1)the other day to go on a field trip with the school that my son attends. As his school doesn't have a bus, parent volunteers are needed to transport the kids here and there. I am one of them, and, you know, I benefit from volunteering in many ways. That particular day, I learned a lot about the Wenatchi Indians, and the pioneer days of this area. We visited a museum in the town of Cashmere which is about eight miles from here. It's a small building, but jam packed(2) with artifacts and donations. I had been to the museum before, but this time, we had a very knowledgeable (3)guide who happened to be a Native American Indian. As time went on, and he took us from one display area to another, I began to realize that he had deep knowledge and deep personal interest in the museum. He was half Cherokee and half Sioux, and knew not only about those Indian nations, but also a lot about the Wenatchi nation. He told us that the baskets that were made by Wenatchi women are worth thousands of dollars. He went into detail, telling us how they would gather(4) the grasses, chew them, dye them with berry juice, and then weave them. These baskets were made so well, that they could carry water. In fact, the Wenatchis would boil water in the baskets by placing boiling hot stones from a fire inside a basket full of water. That kind of information, and many other things that I learned, gave me new respect for the history of this local area. Then, we moved to the outside area of the museum where there's a collection of original pioneer (5)homes. There was a home, a jail, a hat shop, a print shop, a school, and a hotel. My son's class loved the school. It was obviously very basic, all wood, dark, it had a stove, small chalk boards for the students, and a metal bucket that everyone drank out of. The guide told us that school was only available for a few months a year; during Winter it was too cold, and, as all the children helped to farm, they couldn't go to school during planting or harvest seasons either. My son thought that that (6)was great, &ldquo;Only a few months of school? Awesome!&rdquo; he said. If children could basically learn to read and write, and do a little mathematics, then the main goal was accomplished. Their lives were agricultural and they were hard working, so school was considered a luxury. How different it is today!</span></p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/water-for-africa-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Scientists say the notoriously dry continent of Africa is sitting on(1) a vast reservoir of groundwater. They say that the total volume of water in aquifers underground is 100 times the amount found on the surface. The British Geological Survey and the University College London team has produced the most detailed map yet(2) of the scale and potential of this hidden resource. Across Africa more than 300 million people are said to (3) not have access to safe drinking water, and the demand is growing because of population growth and the need for agriculture. "Where there is the greatest ground water storage is in northern Africa, in Libya, Algeria and Chad," said Helen Bonsor from the BGS. In fact, according to the studies, there are aquifers even across sub-Saharan Africa. Water, over many years, can collect in the spaces between rocks underground, and even in the tiny spaces inside sandstone. This watery, wet stone area is an aquifer.&nbsp;The water found in these reserves(4) is usually cleaner than surface water.&nbsp;These huge bodies of water are equivalent to(5) a quarter of the Mediterranean Sea, or three times the Red Sea. The British experts caution (6) that drilling for water should be done carefully, and with a lot more research. The UK's secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell said, "This is an important discovery which the British Government has funded, and could have a profound effect on some of the world's poorest people, helping them become less vulnerable."(7)</p>
<p>1. 'To sit on' can&nbsp;be used to say "He sits on the chair", but it can also be used figuratively with words like 'a fortune' or 'a time bomb'.</p>
<p>a. That boy comes from an extremely wealthy family; he's sitting on a fortune, and doesn't even know it.</p>
<p>b. That situation is like sitting on a time bomb; any day disaster can strike.</p>
<p>2. 'Yet' can be used in many instances. In this particular case, it means&nbsp;'so far'. Here are 2 similar examples:</p>
<p>a. I have had fifteen job interviews, and the last one was the best one yet.</p>
<p>b. I have tried this new cookie recipe a few times, but this batch (collection of cookies) is the best one yet.</p>
<p>3. 'To be said (to)' can be followed by a positive or negative verb, or the verb 'to be' followed by an adjective.</p>
<p>a. The whole population is said to be musical.</p>

			<title>Ethanol anybody?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/ethanol-anybody-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today's podcast is going to test your knowledge of ethanol. What is it? How is it made? And what are the advantages and disadvantages of using it? I asked myself these questions recently, when I drove past a gas station that had a sign saying 'No ethanol in our gas'. I asked myself why it would be good to <em>not</em> have ethanol in petrol? I remember hearing about large amounts of the stuff being produced in this country, and how some people are for it, and others are against it. So, what exactly is ethanol, and what are the issues surrounding it(1)? Ethanol is a fuel that, for a long time has been produced from corn. In the U.S., the government subsidized (2)corn growers for many years specifically for the production of ethanol. But, &nbsp;why would they do this? First of all, a desire to be self sufficient was at the heart of this project. If you can produce your own energy, then there is no longer any need to rely(3) on other countries. Secondly, some believe that the cost would be less than petrol. Thirdly, ethanol reduces greenhouse gases(4) by 18%-29%. Ethanol is easily mixed with petrol, so all cars can use gas (petrol) that is 10% ethanol. There are some cars that can use 85% ethanol with 15% gas. Continuing research has raised questions(5) about ethanol. If we are using millions of acres of agricultural land to produce corn that nobody eats, surely this will raise food prices globally. Also, farming corn is costly, and uses a lot of gas and gas products when you think of the heavy machinery, the transportation, and the petrol-based chemicals used on the plants. How much cleaner is this biofuel than traditional gas? And, should the government be spending tax payers' money on subsidies for a process that isn't overwhelmingly (6) beneficial? Well, as I continued to research ethanol, I found that globally, research has improved its production, and removed the two major problems: using food for fuel, and only reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a small percentage. Apparently, a new ethanol, called cellulosic ethanol is now produced from nonfood crops, such as bark, corn stalks and leaves, and switchgrass. These are agricultural and industrial leftovers, and switchgrass is a rapidly growing weed that is used to prevent erosion. So, instead of expensively growing corn, we can use by-products. Just think of the savings. The carbon footprint(7) is tiny compared to that of growing, transporting, and processing corn. And, talking about our carbon footprint, cellulosic ethanol reduces greenhouse emissions by 85%. Now, that is substantial. Don't you think that collaborative(8) research is always our best route to good ideas? Globally, this is already believed, because research into improving ethanol and making its production efficient and highly beneficial is continuing. Facilites for production are all over the globe, the biggest one being in Italy. People want a home-based, clean alternative to fossil fuels; it will improve global health and national economies. So, on our list of cleaner energy sources,&nbsp;we can add cellulosic ethanol.</p>
<p>1. 'The issues surrounding ..'&nbsp; means the important questions or problems that are linked to something. The phrase gives a good visual of a central idea or thing being surrounded.</p>
<p>a. There are lots of issues surrounding the government's political agenda.</p>
<p>b. There are a lot of questions surrounding his proposal.</p>
<p>2. 'To subsidize' is when money is given to a project to protect and enourage it.</p>
<p>a. The corn growers of the U.S have been subsidized for many years.</p>
<p>b. Tax payers' money is often used to subsidize projects.</p>
<p>3. 'To rely on' is the same as to depend on.</p>
<p>a. I rely on him to tell me the truth.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Today's podcast is going to test your knowledge of ethanol. What is it? How is it made? And what are the advantages and disadvantages of using it? I asked myself these questions recently, when I drove past a gas station that had a sign saying 'No ethanol in our gas'. I asked myself why it would be good to not have ethanol in petrol? I remember hearing about large amounts of the stuff being produced in this country, and how some people are for it, and others are against it. So, what exactly is ethanol, and what are the issues surrounding it(1)? Ethanol is a fuel that, for a long time has been produced from corn. In the U.S., the government subsidized (2)corn growers for many years specifically for the production of ethanol. But, &nbsp;why would they do this? First of all, a desire to be self sufficient was at the heart of this project. If you can produce your own energy, then there is no longer any need to rely(3) on other countries. Secondly, some believe that the cost would be less than petrol. Thirdly, ethanol reduces greenhouse gases(4) by 18%-29%. Ethanol is easily mixed with petrol, so all cars can use gas (petrol) that is 10% ethanol. There are some cars that can use 85% ethanol with 15% gas. Continuing research has raised questions(5) about ethanol. If we are using millions of acres of agricultural land to produce corn that nobody eats, surely this will raise food prices globally. Also, farming corn is costly, and uses a lot of gas and gas products when you think of the heavy machinery, the transportation, and the petrol-based chemicals used on the plants. How much cleaner is this biofuel than traditional gas? And, should the government be spending tax payers' money on subsidies for a process that isn't overwhelmingly (6) beneficial? Well, as I continued to research ethanol, I found that globally, research has improved its production, and removed the two major problems: using food for fuel, and only reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a small percentage. Apparently, a new ethanol, called cellulosic ethanol is now produced from nonfood crops, such as bark, corn stalks and leaves, and switchgrass. These are agricultural and industrial leftovers, and switchgrass is a rapidly growing weed that is used to prevent erosion. So, instead of expensively growing corn, we can use by-products. Just think of the savings. The carbon footprint(7) is tiny compared to that of growing, transporting, and processing corn. And, talking about our carbon footprint, cellulosic ethanol reduces greenhouse emissions by 85%. Now, that is substantial. Don't you think that collaborative(8) research is always our best route to good ideas? Globally, this is already believed, because research into improving ethanol and making its production efficient and highly beneficial is continuing. Facilites for production are all over the globe, the biggest one being in Italy. People want a home-based, clean alternative to fossil fuels; it will improve global health and national economies. So, on our list of cleaner energy sources,&nbsp;we can add cellulosic ethanol.
1. 'The issues surrounding ..'&nbsp; means the important questions or problems that are linked to something. The phrase gives a good visual of a central idea or thing being surrounded.
a. There are lots of issues surrounding the government's political agenda.
b. There are a lot of questions surrounding his proposal.
2. 'To subsidize' is when money is given to a project to protect and enourage it.
a. The corn growers of the U.S have been subsidized for many years.
b. Tax payers' money is often used to subsidize projects.
3. 'To rely on' is the same as to depend on.
a. I rely on him to tell me the truth.
b. We rely on email to keep in touch with family and friends.
4. 'Greenhouse gases'
a.Greenhouse gases are the gases produced by burning fossil fuels, such as coal or petrol.
b. Greenhouse gases can be reduced by using clean energy sources.
5. 'To raise a question' is slightly different from 'to ask a question'. It is less specific; the question might not have been vocalized yet. It might just be in someone's mind.
a. His actions raised a few questions in my mind: is he fit for the job? Does he need more training?
b. I'm sure questions will be raised when the employees hear about him leaving the company.
6. 'Overwhelmingly' here is used as an adjective, but of course, it comes from the verb to 'to overwhelm'.
a. The votes show that she is overwhelmingly the most popular singer.
b. I was overwhelmed by your act of kindness.
7. 'Carbon footprint' is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions we cause on a personal level.
a. This year, I'm going to do all that I can to reduce my carbon footprint.
b. There are some simple ways to reduce our carbon footprints, like recycling, and turning off lights that don't need to be on.
8. 'Collaborative' comes from the verb to collaberate, meaning to work together and share ideas.
a. The project was a collaborative effort; many experts were involved.
b. If we collaborate, we will probably find the best solutions to our problems.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Waiting, waiting, waiting. It's difficult to do sometimes. I found myself waiting a couple of weeks ago at Seattle International Airport. My sister and my two nephews were coming for a two week visit, so I made the three hour drive over the mountains to pick them up. I don't often go to Seattle, but I love to. It's a gorgeous place, if you like forests, the sea, and modern buildings. So, I take any opportunity I can to drive there. The airport is actually outside of Seattle, half way between Seattle and Tacoma, and is therefore called Sea-tac airport. It is a smart, modern facility that, believe it or not(1), smells of coffee. How wonderful! You might think that I'm joking, but it's true. You know that Seattle is where Starbucks started, and Seattle is known for being the coffee capital of the U.S. In fact,&nbsp;it has more coffee houses per 100,000 residents than the U.S. has overall(2). So, even the airport is fully equipped with coffee all over the place. While I waited for my sister to arrive, I found myself(3)at one of the many coffee shops. I bought my soy latte, and wandered around a magazine shop. The plane had come in on time, there was no delay(4). However, because the flight was an international one, my sister and her boys had to go through immigration(4) and customs(4). That is a time consuming necessity. Also, the flight was full, so the two hundred or so sleepy passengers took extra long to arrive at baggage claim. I kept on returning to the arrivals escalator, to see if anyone from&nbsp;the flight had turned up. Nope(5). It took about an hour and a half for the travelers to arrive. It was interesting to stand back and see the different people step off the escalator. There was a real mix of shapes and sizes, ethnicities, and demeanours(6). Some people were dressed professionally, pulling behind them small, black cases on wheels, and obviously focused on business. Others were more casual, looking for family or friends, and openly emotional. There was a tall, military man returning from service abroad(7), who was greeted by his young wife and three year old daughter. She had stood at the top of the empty escalator and called "Daddy, daddy!" impatiently. When he finally arrived and picked her up, she stared at him for a long time&nbsp;with an unsure, curious expression. Then came the stragglers(8): a very hairy man carrying a large, framed picture, a tall African lady with tons of luggage, and a skinny young man with a huge cello case. What a variety of people! Then, last but not least(9), my sister and her two boys came up the escalator with big smiles. Finally, they were here. We hugged and kissed, and immediately started chatting and giggling about the journey. We picked up the luggage and were in the car before we knew it.</p>
<p>1. 'Believe it or not' is not an essential phrase. It is light hearted and introduces the idea that something interesting or unusual will be mentioned:</p>
<p>a. My daughter has, believe it or not, joined a traveling circus.</p>
<p>b. Believe it or not, that very small shop grossed half a million dollars last year.</p>
<p>2. 'Overall' is another way of saying 'all together' or 'in general' or 'added up':</p>
<p>a. There were some imperfections, but overall the performance was a success.</p>
<p>b. The population, overall, prefers coffee to tea.</p>
<p>3. To find oneself can be used with any person:</p>
<p>a. We found ourselves pennyless, out of petrol, and in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>b. So, you met the prince in the party, and before you knew it, you&nbsp;found yourself &nbsp;in the palace! Unbelievable!</p>
<p>4. 'Delay, immigration, customs' are all useful words to do with international travel.</p>
<p>a. The plane was delayed, I had trouble in immigration, and customs confiscated my Elvis toothbrush!</p>
<p>b. The plane was on time, thank goodness. My visa was still valid, so I got through immigration quickly, and then I had nothing to declare in customs.</p>
<p>5.'Nope' is basically 'no' but with attitude. It is used frequently in the U.S.</p>
<p>a. Do you want to go out tonight?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nope!</p>
<p>b. I've lost the receipt for the bookshelves. Could you look for it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nope!</p>
<p>6. 'Demeanor' means the manner or behavior of someone:</p>
<p>a. She looked elegant and formal, but her demeanor was unsure.</p>
<p>b. I can tell by his demeanor that he is confident.</p>
<p>7. 'Abroad' is often used instead of 'overseas'. The two are interchangeable:</p>
<p>a. She will study abroad for six months to learn a different language.</p>
<p>b. They had studied overseas all year, and had decided to stay longer.</p>
<p>8. 'Straggler' describes the odd, few people who are the last to arrive, either from a journey, trip, or race:</p>
<p>a. At the end of the Tour de France we see the stragglers coming in. Some are well known cyclists who unfortunately fell off their bikes, and others are less known riders.</p>
<p>b. The displaced villagers got to the shelter by nightfall, the stragglers arriving by midnight.</p>
<p>9. 'Last but not least' is a quick way of saying "I'm mentioning this person last (on the list) but he is just as important as anybody else".</p>
<p>a. Ladies and gentlemen, we have Princess Sofia, Prince Filipo, and, last but not least, their little sister Princess Angelica.</p>
<p>b. Here we have to crown your dinner tonight, last but not least, a pineapple chocolate bomb for dessert.</p>

			<title>Exciting science.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/exciting-science-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Science can be so exciting. I was listening to the BBC World Service the other day while I was driving in my car. Their series called Science in Action, which, by the way, comes out in podcast form, is a lively presentation of the most up-to-date science innovations(1). I don't always listen to it, but the other day I was on my way to pick up the kids from school, when I turned on the radio just at the right time. By the time I reached the Middle School, I was bursting to(2) tell my boys the latest scientific news. They were impressed. Since then, I have told everyone I have been around. Well, you shouldn't keep good news to yourself, should you? There were two main points that I managed to catch(3).&nbsp;The first discovery was made by an Australian scientist who has been involved in genetically engineering plants. He and his team have successfully managed to grow and harvest from a salt tolerant(4) wheat plant. It can grow in salty soil, which up until now has been impossible for many kinds of grains. Changing its genetic makeup allows the plant to keep the salt at its roots, so it doesn't get into the plant and affect it at all. Just think what that could mean for global production. That kind of wheat could be grown in many more areas, and perhaps even be watered with sea water! The next discovery is also something to do with salt. An Irish scientist is finding a way to make the leftovers(5) of desalinization(6) profitable and practical. After salt water is processed so it can be used for drinking water, there is a super salty solution left over. He has found that if you add naturally occurring (7)bacteria, plus natural food for them, they begin to give off an electrical charge. When this happens, particles of metals from the salty water stick to the bacteria. The more they eat, the more metal sticks to them, until they get so heavy that they sink(8) to the bottom of the container, and can be easily separated. Metals such as Magnesium which are expensive and really useful, can be&nbsp;gathered in this way. By doing this, scientists will be able to use the waste product of desalinization, and offset(9) the cost of producing clean water by harvesting metals. I was blown away by all of this(10). It seems that, in spite of what the general media tells us, science may be innovating just in time to keep up with our global needs.</p>
<p>1. Innovation means a new idea, method, or device. It is often used in the fields of science and technology. We also use it in its verb form 'to innovate'.</p>
<p>a. These scientific innovations will improve our daily lives.</p>
<p>b. You have to be creative and have a vision to innovate.</p>
<p>2. To be bursting to tell someone something. This means that you are so excited that you can hardly wait to spread the news.</p>
<p>3. Catch is sometimes used when we talk about hearing the <em>remainder </em>of a conversation, perhaps the last part, or something that is hard to hear.</p>
<p>a. Did you catch what he said at the end? I'm not sure if he said that the bank is to the right or to the left.</p>
<p>b. I'm so glad that I caught the news summary when I turned the tv on; I really want to keep up with the daily events.</p>
<p>4. Tolerant means that you put up with, you cope with, you can manage something. You can be tolerant of people, conditions, or elements. We use the word tolerant a lot when we talk about peoples ability to digest food.</p>
<p>a. She is wheat tolerant, but lactose intolerant. She has to be careful with her diet.</p>
<p>b. I planted drought tolerant plants in the area of my garden that I don't water.</p>
<p>c. They are so intolerant of people who are different from themselves.</p>
<p>5. Leftovers are one of my favorite things. They are different foods that are left over, or have not been eaten by the end of a meal. You can also have leftovers of a process, similar to by-products.</p>
<p>a. Thanksgiving leftovers are yummy. There are usually enough to feed us for a whole day.</p>
<p>6. Desalinization, as you probably know, is the process of getting clean, drinking water from sea water. As it's a long word, let's repeat it a few times.</p>
<p>7. Naturally occurring is often used in science or natural history arenas.</p>
<p>a. There are naturally occurring minerals in that water.</p>
<p>b. The naturally occurring process of photosynthesis keeps our planet alive.</p>
<p>8. To sink is to fall down in water, to go down, to do the opposite of float. It is the same word and pronunciation as the kitchen and bathroom sink. The verb has an irregular preterite.</p>
<p>a. The ship crashed on the rocks and sank out of sight.</p>
<p>b. When I woke up at the end of the math exam, I had a terrible sinking feeling when I realized that I had slept through the whole thing.</p>
<p>9. To offset is to make up for, or to counteract.</p>
<p>a. The company's profits this month offset its losses from last month.</p>
<p>b. Planting hundreds of trees on the mountainside will offset the risk of erosion.</p>
<p>10. To be blown away by something means to be completely surprised. It can be used negatively and positively.</p>
<p>a. When he opened his mouth and started to sing, I was blown away.</p>
<p>b. I was shocked at his ignorant comments; infact, I was blown away by them.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yakima is a small city located an hour and a half's drive(1) from Wenatchee. It is a wide valley, famous for its grapes and apples. We were there last weekend for a baseball tournament, the first of the season(2). One interesting fact about Yakima is that its name is taken from the Yakama indians who are from this area. There are actually indian names in many areas of the state. When the baseball tournament was over and we were leaving Yakima, we drove past a barren(3), rocky few miles and crossed over a bridge. Immediately after the bridge, I saw a sign 'Umtanum Canyon'. The name sparked my interest(4). "Now, that must be an indian name," I thought to myself. When I got home, I looked up the name on the internet. I found quite a few pages about Umtanum, but no translation of its name. Reading about the canyon made me even more eager to find out its name, because the land is geographically interesting, and has a wealth(5) of wildlife. Hunters would love it because there are big horn sheep, deer, and coyotes, aswell as pheasants and all kinds of rodents(6). Most of these creatures come to the creek, which is a small river, to drink. The predators obviously take advantage of this being the only water source for all the animals nearby. The canyon walls are steep and rocky, which are perfect for big horn sheep who are expert climbers. The banks of the creek are grassy with wildflowers, a perfect place for ground squirrels, marmots, and rabbits. They have to watch out for the coyotes all year round, and the rattlesnakes in the summer. Infact, it's recommended that hiking parties go during the autumn, winter, and spring, and avoid the snakes in the summer. Umtanum, I would say(7), is typical of eastern Washington. There are many such large expanses of land that look seemingly(8) empty, lifeless, dry, even boring. But, when you get out of the car, and walk deeper into the countryside, you find that it is full of life.</p>

<p>b. The mall is an hour's drive from here. It's an hour and a quarter's wait until the next bus.</p>
<p>Note that it is used mainly with one hour or when 'half' an hour is being used.</p>
<p>2. The first of the season is easily understood. I am emphasizing this because it is a very natural sounding add-on to a sentence that will make you seem more native.</p>

<p>3. Barren is a word often used for being lifeless, bare, or childless. It is quite poetic, and often used for bare landscapes.</p>

			<title>Analysis time, reviving ancient flowers.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/analysis-time-reviving-ancient-flowers-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Because many of you have responded positively to my new series 'Analysis time', we will continue with a particularly interesting one today taken from an article about 'break-through' scientific technology. If you haven't come across the phrase 'break-through', you might be able to imagine its meaning. It is literally the idea of breaking through a wall of ignorance, and arriving at new knowledge and new technology. A break-through is positive and exciting, and it can be used in many different areas: science, medicine, even psychology. Infact, you can even use it on a personal basis</p>
<p>Ex: I had a break-through with my counselor yesterday; I realize that I must forgive my parents.</p>
<p>So, there will be many more examples coming up. Let's here the article.</p>
<p>A plant that was frozen in Siberian permafrost for about 30,000 years has been revived by a team of Russian scientists - and borne (1)fruit, to boot(2). Bacteria and other simple organisms had been known to survive in the ice for thousands of years. But reviving a life as complex(3) as a plant is an entirely different matter(4), scientists said. For this study, the researchers managed to(5) grow a plant without even using a seed. Instead(6), they thawed, washed and disinfected the fruits and took out bits of nutrient-rich fruit flesh known as placental tissue(7). When bathed in the right broth(8) of chemicals, placental tissue acts like the plant version(9)of stem cells. The study is an encouraging sign that it may be possible to revive larger and more complex beings that were preserved in the frozen tundra.</p>
<p>1. Borne comes from the verb 'to bear fruit' . The sentence should have said 'and has borne fruit' to be clear. The plant has produced fruit. It is an irregular past participle that obviously looks nothing like the original verb 'to bear'. It is spelt the same as the predatory animal 'bear', is pronounced the same, but has nothing to do with it.&nbsp;It is also often used with other meanings, such as 'to accept' or 'to carry'. There are other meanings, but these are the most common.</p>
<p>Exs: a. He bore all the criticism, even though other people were guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. I can't bear the pain anymore; I'll take a headache pill.</p>
<p>2. To boot is a funny little phrase that means 'also'. or 'besides'. It carries (or bears) more of a sense of surprise or significance than 'also'.</p>
<p>Exs: a. &nbsp;He not only sailed the Atlantic, but he wrote a novel at the same time, to boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. I returned the dress to the shop and got my money back, and a gift certificate to boot.</p>
<p>3. Complex is a straight forward word meaning complicated or difficult. It is used in any arena.</p>
<p>Exs: a. She is a complex individual. Just when you think you know her, she says something very unexpected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The math that my son is doing in school is too complex for me!</p>
<p>4. 'An entirely different matter' is a very useful phrase that adds seriousness to a second idea.</p>
<p>Exs: a. Why they argued&nbsp;is one thing. The state of their marriage is an entirely different matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Making austerity cuts&nbsp;might be necessary, but creating economic growth is an entirely different matter.</p>
<p>5. 'To manage to + verb' is a very useful and common phrase implying that some effort has been used to achieve an outcome.</p>
<p>Exs a. I managed to find my wedding ring; it had been missing for two months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. I don't know how he did it, but he managed to pull himself out of the hospital bed and walk out of the building.</p>
<p>It is also used when asking questions in an accusatory way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. How on earth did you manage to crash the car into the mailbox?</p>
<p>6. 'Instead' means 'as a substitute for' or 'as an alternative':</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. I was going to call you, but I decided to walk to your house instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. I told him to study, but he played outside instead.</p>
<p>7. Tissue is the soft paper we use to wipe our noses. It is, however, also used&nbsp;as 'material' or 'substance' when talking about animal or plant life.</p>
<p>Exs: a. They took some brain tissue to do a biopsy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Some of the inside tissue of the leaf was studied.</p>
<p>8. Broth means a thin, watery soup that usually has meat or fish extract in it. It can be used, as in this case, in science when talking about a mixture.</p>
<p>Ex: To make the best chicken broth, boil the bones for at least half an hour, then add vegetables and seasoning.</p>
<p>9. The ... version of indicates that something is similar to something else in function or essence, but different in a fundamental way.</p>
<p>Exs: a. That boy is the young version of Elvis Presley!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. 'Lovesong' by Adele, is a slow jazz version of a song by The Cure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. I met Mary's mother the other day. She is an older version of her daughter; they are so similar.</p>

			<title>Analysis time, a Chinese revolt.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/analysis-time-a-chinese-revolt-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today we will analyze part of a newspaper article in depth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Wukan, China - The Chinese fishing village that went into open revolt(1) against government control last year held elections on Saturday, an event that(2) some local people said was the first time they'd been able to elect their leaders. After years of resentment(3) about real estate(4) deals (5)between local leaders and businessmen, villagers staged a series of demonstrations. "We will solve the land issue (6)step-by-step," said Lin, the newly elected chief of the village. If those efforts to reclaim land come up short(8), then the experience will have been an empty one, many said.</p>
<p>1. Open revolt is when people demonstrate, express disagreement, rally together, and do so in a very public and obvious way.</p>
<p>Ex: After the votes were counted, the people went to the town hall in open revolt at the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been open revolt in Greece over the government's plans to raise taxes and cut public spending.</p>
<p>2. The arrangement of (2) 'the event that' is a good stylistic way of adding more information about the elections. Many nouns that describe times or events can be reviewed and have more detail added to them. The arrangement of words, reflecting on the event, avoids having to make two sentences out of one, or one that doesn't sound as well crafted:</p>
<p>The Chinese fishing village ..........held elections on Saturday, which some local&nbsp;people said was the first time..... .</p>
<p>Or it could have been written:</p>
<p>The Chinese fishing village........held elections on Saturday. Some local people said that this was the first time...... .</p>
<p>The sentence structure in the article is much better than these two:</p>
<p>The Chinese fishing village ........held elections on Saturday, an event that some local people said was the first time ...... .</p>
<p>Let's see some other examples of this structure, and how it improves the flow of a sentence:</p>
<p>Exs: The ball was a magical occasion, a special moment in time that Cinderella would never forget.</p>
<p>This sentence flows nicely because of its second part. It could have been split into 2 sentences:</p>
<p>Either: The ball was a magical occasion. It was a special moment in time that Cinderella would never forget.</p>
<p>Or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ball was a magical occasion, and was a special moment in time that Cinderella would never forget.</p>
<p>Let me give you a few more examples of sentences using the more successful format:</p>
<p>a. They bought the company in 1902, a decision that changed their lives completely.</p>
<p>b. She sang "We'll meet again", a rendition that had everyone standing and applauding.</p>
<p>c. He will analyse the book for a class, a job that most people would hate.</p>
<p>d. We left town in winter of 1988, a season no one will ever forget because of the record snowfall.</p>
<p>e. Their private conversation was not quiet enough, a mistake that caused a lot of embarrassment.</p>
<p>3. Resentment is similar to anger, or holding a grudge, or not letting an offense be forgiven or forgotten.</p>
<p>Exs: He didn't get the promotion, so he was full of resentment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher was unfair, and that caused resentment among the students.</p>
<p>4. Real estate is property in the form of land or buildings</p>
<p>Exs: She bought good real estate at just the right time; now it is worth ten times as much money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real estate market is slow at the moment, a sign that the economy isn't healthy yet.</p>
<p>5. Deal is both a verb and a noun. To deal is to hand out cards in a card game. You can also 'deal a blow' which basically means to punch. That expression is used figuratively as in this example:</p>
<p>The financial crisis dealt a blow to the car companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds old fashioned to use this expression when talking about punching someone; it's best to use 'punch'.</p>
<p>A deal is a business or personal arrangement, some kind of agreement:</p>
<p>Exs: The banks made a deal.&nbsp; The buyers made a successful deal with the sellers.</p>
<p>Note that the word 'dealings' has a sense of something illegal or secret, or unpleasant:</p>
<p>Exs: The govenor's dealings with oil companies were exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to talk about his dealings with the mafia.</p>
<p>6. Issue is an emotional or psychological problem. It can also be an important topic, or a disagreement with something.</p>
<p>Exs: The issue of raising taxes always causes a lot of discussion and emotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He disrupts the class, is rude, and doesn't do any work. I think that he has serious issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an issue with the way he talks to people. I don't like it, and I think he needs a different approach.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Today we will analyze part of a newspaper article in depth.
&nbsp;Wukan, China - The Chinese fishing village that went into open revolt(1) against government control last year held elections on Saturday, an event that(2) some local people said was the first time they'd been able to elect their leaders. After years of resentment(3) about real estate(4) deals (5)between local leaders and businessmen, villagers staged a series of demonstrations. "We will solve the land issue (6)step-by-step," said Lin, the newly elected chief of the village. If those efforts to reclaim land come up short(8), then the experience will have been an empty one, many said.
1. Open revolt is when people demonstrate, express disagreement, rally together, and do so in a very public and obvious way.
Ex: After the votes were counted, the people went to the town hall in open revolt at the result.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been open revolt in Greece over the government's plans to raise taxes and cut public spending.
2. The arrangement of (2) 'the event that' is a good stylistic way of adding more information about the elections. Many nouns that describe times or events can be reviewed and have more detail added to them. The arrangement of words, reflecting on the event, avoids having to make two sentences out of one, or one that doesn't sound as well crafted:
The Chinese fishing village ..........held elections on Saturday, which some local&nbsp;people said was the first time..... .
Or it could have been written:
The Chinese fishing village........held elections on Saturday. Some local people said that this was the first time...... .
The sentence structure in the article is much better than these two:
The Chinese fishing village ........held elections on Saturday, an event that some local people said was the first time ...... .
Let's see some other examples of this structure, and how it improves the flow of a sentence:
Exs: The ball was a magical occasion, a special moment in time that Cinderella would never forget.
This sentence flows nicely because of its second part. It could have been split into 2 sentences:
Either: The ball was a magical occasion. It was a special moment in time that Cinderella would never forget.
Or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ball was a magical occasion, and was a special moment in time that Cinderella would never forget.
Let me give you a few more examples of sentences using the more successful format:
a. They bought the company in 1902, a decision that changed their lives completely.
b. She sang "We'll meet again", a rendition that had everyone standing and applauding.
c. He will analyse the book for a class, a job that most people would hate.
d. We left town in winter of 1988, a season no one will ever forget because of the record snowfall.
e. Their private conversation was not quiet enough, a mistake that caused a lot of embarrassment.
3. Resentment is similar to anger, or holding a grudge, or not letting an offense be forgiven or forgotten.
Exs: He didn't get the promotion, so he was full of resentment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teacher was unfair, and that caused resentment among the students.
4. Real estate is property in the form of land or buildings
Exs: She bought good real estate at just the right time; now it is worth ten times as much money.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real estate market is slow at the moment, a sign that the economy isn't healthy yet.
5. Deal is both a verb and a noun. To deal is to hand out cards in a card game. You can also 'deal a blow' which basically means to punch. That expression is used figuratively as in this example:
The financial crisis dealt a blow to the car companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds old fashioned to use this expression when talking about punching someone; it's best to use 'punch'.
A deal is a business or personal arrangement, some kind of agreement:
Exs: The banks made a deal.&nbsp; The buyers made a successful deal with the sellers.
Note that the word 'dealings' has a sense of something illegal or secret, or unpleasant:
Exs: The govenor's dealings with oil companies were exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to talk about his dealings with the mafia.
6. Issue is an emotional or psychological problem. It can also be an important topic, or a disagreement with something.
Exs: The issue of raising taxes always causes a lot of discussion and emotion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He disrupts the class, is rude, and doesn't do any work. I think that he has serious issues.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an issue with the way he talks to people. I don't like it, and I think he needs a different approach.

			<title>An intimidating meeting.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/an-intimidating-meeting-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, as some of you know, I met with the Superintendent of Wenatchee Schools. I was very nervous, for some reason. I had never met him before, though I had seen him a couple of times in School Board meetings. My intention was to encourage changes in the school district, changes that have been wanted and recommended for a long time but haven't taken place. But, as I stepped into the office, and sat down in the waiting area, I began to feel very small. For some reason, I started to doubt my right to be there. Was I informed enough to have a pertinent conversation with this very busy man, a man who obviously knows more about the school district than me? Would I forget what I had planned on saying half way through a sentence? Would I stutter, or burp, or trip and fall and smash something important, like his laptop? "Okay Anna, what's your problem? Are you losing your edge?" (1)I said to myself, "Whatever happened to the girl who did public speaking, or the rock climber, or the hitchhiker? Pull yourself together!" (2)I talked reasonably to myself in order to calm down my thumping heart, and my sweating armpits. I did some deep breathing exercises, and focused on the meeting being over, rather than the meeting itself. "Hello Anna," a voice interrupted my thoughts. I looked up, and standing there was a smiling man, reaching out his hand to shake mine. I quickly got up and shook his hand, "Hello Mr Flones, how are you?" The Superintendent had just got back from lunch, and had approached me while I was in the middle of my deep breathing exercises. He led me to his office, which was moderate, and practical, and not intimidating at all, plus there was nothing that I could easily break, so I started to relax. "I appreciate you meeting with me, Mr. Flones. I will be brief, I won't take up much of your time." "That's fine," he replied, looking at the clock, "I'm good."(3) I realized that I could stop being apologetic, and could just get on with what I wanted to say and ask. It turned out, actually, to be the opposite of what I had expected. He was not only very open, but he was very candid about the state of schools, and changes that needed to be made. What a relief! We agreed on many things, and towards the end, I said, "Really, I want to offer my hand of friendship, and to help in this transition to an upgraded school&nbsp;district." I said this because I have felt in the past that there were two separate and conflicting groups: parents and the school district. Of course, it doesn't have to be that way. If we work together, we can get twice as much done in half the time, as long as we really listen to eachother. I left the meeting feeling very satisfied, and stood outside for while, taking in the early Spring sun. As I walked to my car, I pondered why I had been so nervous. Well, if you've recently raised four children, and not worked, then you've been out of the loop(4): no office meetings, no business lunches, no professional decisions etc. It can be intimidating to step back into that arena when my world has been diapers, a-b-c's, and the price of milk. But, the impression that I got from the Superintendent was that, as a teacher and a parent, I have very valuable things to say. It didn't take long to adjust back to the school-decision making world. So, I've planned for another meeting in a few weeks, to check on progress, but this time, I won't need the breathing exercises.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related expressions</span>: to lose your edge, pull yourself together, I'm good, to be out of the loop.</p>
<p>1. To lose your edge means to lose the quality of a skill through lack of use or fear.</p>
<p>Exs: I used to tell jokes at parties, but I haven't done that for years. I've lost my edge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't possibly skydive anymore; I've lost my edge.</p>
<p>2. To pull yourself together means to become brave by effort. You can use this as a command, even for yourself.</p>
<p>Exs: Pull yourself together, man, you only need one filling. Your other teeth are fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to speak to him right now, but I really don't want to. "Pull yourself together Anna! Just do it!"</p>
<p>3. I'm good is used in the U.S. It's an expression that means "That's okay, I'm fine" or "I don't need anymore". It is used when people are asked if they want some more to eat, or if they want to communicate that they have plenty of time.</p>
<p>Exs: Do you want some more cake?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No thanks, I'm good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here it means that he is satisfied and has had enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't take up much of your time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm good. I've got plenty of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be used by itself without specifying 'I've got plenty of time' afterwards.</p>
<p>4. To be out of the loop means that you have been away from a certain arena, perhaps work, or a circle of friends, or an activity.</p>
<p>Exs: I haven't sung in the choir for a few months; I'm out of the loop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to meet with the ladies from my dance class, but I haven't been to it for two years. I'm out of the loop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, 'I'm out of the loop' is used because she hasn't been to class, and she hasn't had connection with her social group.</p>

			<title>Analysis time - community colleges.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/analysis-time-community-colleges-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Community colleges still don't get the dollars of their four-year counterparts(1), but they're standing very much in the spotlight(2) these days. President Barack Obama made them the focus last week when he unveiled(3) his proposed budget. Why all the attention? One reason is that so-called(4) 'middle skill' jobs - requiring more than high school but less than a full college degree - look like the most promising source of fuel(5) for quickly revving(6) up an economic recovery. Federal data show they account for roughly(7) half of all jobs, and even when unemployment was over 10 percent, companies reported shortages(8) of qualified workers.</p>
<p>1. Counterpart is a very effective word for referring to a related item, especially if you want to avoid repetition. So, instead of saying : Community colleges still don't get the dollars of four-year colleges, you substitute in 'their four-year counterparts. We usually use a possessive adjective with counterpart(s) because it relates to the subject. Also, often an adjective or two about the counterpart are often given in order to make it clear what the counterpart actually is. In the paragraph 'four-year' obviously relates to larger, full-time universities.</p>
<p>Ex: He was much faster than his stronger, heavier counterparts on theteam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ex: The country dental clinics are more personable than their larger, urban counterparts.</p>
<p>2. To be in the spotlight, or to stand in the spotlight means to have a lot of attention. It's a great visual description of someone or something having all eyes on them.</p>
<p>Ex: Senator Brown is very much in the spotlight after his comments on the new tax bill.</p>
<p>Ex: The financial difficulties of Greece are still very much in the global spotlight.</p>
<p>3. To unveil is to show something for the first time, or to show something that has been hidden.</p>
<p>Ex: The sculptor unveiled his latest statue that has been donated to the city.</p>
<p>Ex: The city has just unveiled plans for a new park.</p>
<p>4. So-called is used to qualify a description that might not be accurate.</p>
<p>Ex: He's the so-called 'King of Pop'. So-called here shows that perhaps not everyone agreed with the title. There is no way of measuring if he really is the king of pop.</p>
<p>Ex: The so-called free medical care has proven to be quite expensive.</p>
<p>5. Fuel, in this instance, doesn't mean actual combustible fuel. It is used to show the idea that the President wants to stimulate or ignite the economy. It is implied that he wants the economy to grow like a fire gets bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Ex: I wouldn't argue with him. You'll just add fuel to his argument (fire).</p>
<p>6. To rev up is similar to the word fuel. It is short for revolutions. To rev is usually used with engines, when you push the accelerator in and out and make the engine noise increase and decrease. It is often used figuratively.</p>
<p>Ex: Wake up, have your coffee, let's get revved up for the meeting.</p>
<p>Ex: My neighbor likes to rev his engine, even though his car is tiny.</p>
<p>7. Roughly is often used instead of approximately or nearly.</p>
<p>Ex: The company has increased production by roughly 50 percent.</p>
<p>Ex: Roughly a third of elementary school children are obese.</p>
<p>8. Shortage(s) is often used for a lack of. We see it a lot when talking about employment or produce of some kind.</p>
<p>Ex: There is always a shortage of laborers and nurses.</p>
<p>Ex: There will be a global shortage of wheat this year.</p>

			<title>Xephos and Honeydew, in Minecraft.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/xephos-and-honeydew-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This title is the kind that gets attention, isn't it? I first heard about these two characters a few days ago. My three boys play an on-line game called Minecraft. It's actually quite fabulous. It is an unending arena, where you can discover and create different worlds made out of blocks. My sons' favorites are the survival worlds, where you have to find raw materials* such as wood, edible plants, animals, tools, and fire. In order to survive and prosper, you must build yourself a house, and be in it by nightfall*. The reason is that zombies, or 'creepers', come out at night and attack you if you are not safely hidden in your house. Every day, I hear of their new discoveries such as exotic animals, or useful tools of some kind, diamonds, gold, enemies, friends, and even lava. It is hugely popular and globally played and loved. I can see why. If you have a look at Minecraft, you will see that it is a perfect combination of computer game, interaction, creativity, and adventure.

And, you know, compared to a lot of the mindless, destructive video games out there, Minecraft is superior because a player not only has to be creative and curious, but he can add his own personal touch in a world of his choice. As with many on-line games, you have the ability to chat with other players. Mind you, you have to be careful what you say. If you accidentally offend a person who has created the world that you are in, you get banned. There are rules. Two people who know these rules very well, are Xephos and Honeydew. They are gurus of the Minecraft world. Infact, they have made their knowledge and practice of this game into profit. They have a website with up-to-date* video blogs of their Minecraft activity and discoveries. They are two, young English gentlemen, who are friends, and devoted gamers. They give regular commentaries while they game together in the same world in Minecraft. They have, what we call in England, 'the gift of the gab', which means an ability to talk and entertain. They are funny, expressive, and energetic, and other gamers, like my boys, love to follow their progress and listen to their advice. They battle evil characters, build detailed and unusual homes, and even search other people's homes and 'borrow' items that they find. The accumulation of riches is an important theme in Minecraft, and Xephos and Honeydew are expert miners who manage to collect all kinds of precious metals and gems* from the ground. I have come to terms with the fact that* my boys are addicted to this game, as are millions of others. And, thanks to Xephos and Honeydew, they will be encouraged to continue for a long time.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This title is the kind that gets attention, isn't it? I first heard about these two characters a few days ago. My three boys play an on-line game called Minecraft. It's actually quite fabulous. It is an unending arena, where you can discover and create different worlds made out of blocks. My sons' favorites are the survival worlds, where you have to find raw materials* such as wood, edible plants, animals, tools, and fire. In order to survive and prosper, you must build yourself a house, and be in it by nightfall*. The reason is that zombies, or 'creepers', come out at night and attack you if you are not safely hidden in your house. Every day, I hear of their new discoveries such as exotic animals, or useful tools of some kind, diamonds, gold, enemies, friends, and even lava. It is hugely popular and globally played and loved. I can see why. If you have a look at Minecraft, you will see that it is a perfect combination of computer game, interaction, creativity, and adventure. My boys tell me all the time how educational it is, "Mum, you have to read a little, and even type!" And, you know, compared to a lot of the mindless, destructive video games out there, Minecraft is superior because a player not only has to be creative and curious, but he can add his own personal touch in a world of his choice.

			<title>A swimming lesson.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-swimming-lesson-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Every Tuesday, I volunteer to drive several kids from school to the local swimming pool. They go once a week* for six weeks for a full hour*. It's actually a new experience for my&nbsp; children to be able to swim during school hours; usually, P.E., or Physical Education, doesn't involve getting wet. So, this is a real treat. The first week, the children were separated into swimmers and non-swimmers. Since then, the swimmers can spend half of their swimming session playing with beach balls on teams. They also are allowed to use various diving boards, while the non-swimmers have an intensive swimming lesson. You could call this their 'immersion' session, ha, ha, do you get the pun?* Anyway, for us, it's an unusual and exciting morning. Thankfully, at the swimming pool, there are comfortable seats near the pool, and even internet connection. Infact, I'm writing this as I watch the children swim. The pool is divided into three sections, so three different activities can take place at the same time.* Closest to the edge where I'm sitting is one lane for elderly* people. They usually do gentle exercises, in groups, often with floatation devices. From what I can see, it's more like a social get-together. Next to them are two lanes dedicated to adults who just want to swim laps. A lap is a length of the pool. They go back and forth at their own pace, and have about one hour to get their exercise done. They are the most serious swimmers out of everyone here. Perhaps they have a background in* swimming, or simply enjoy the sport, and wish to include it as part of their healthy routine. So, as you can imagine, I sit here on Tuesday mornings, looking out over the pool, and observe all sorts of interesting activity. This pool is well equipped as far as safety is concerned*. There are two lifeguards on duty at all times, who constantly scan* the pool. They wear red t-shirts and carry red floatation devices, and are ready at any second to either blow a whistle, or to jump in and rescue someone. As I look around the room, I see more safety devices: rubber rings, stretchers for enabling disabled people to float on and enjoy the water, and even a fire extinguisher! You would have thought that <em>that</em> wouldn't&nbsp;be necessary. The swimming teacher is explaining to the kids at the moment the importance of timing in swimming, how you have to use your arms and legs at different times in order to get fast movement through the water. She explains this with the help of a swimmer volunteer, and now the children are taking&nbsp;turns swimming a lap using her advice. And guess what? I see improvement already! She is a devoted swimming teacher. I've never seen her out of the water; it's as if she's a part of the pool. They've got ten minutes left to swim; the kids never want to get out of the pool. They would rather stay here than go back to school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related vocabulary and expressions</span>: once a week, a full hour, a pun, at the same time.</p>
<p>1. She has a piano lesson once a week, and a painting class once a month.</p>
<p>2. I wish this class was longer. It's only 45 minutes. I would prefer to have it for a full hour.</p>
<p>3. 'Immersion' is a pun when talking about swimming. A pun is a joke created by words that reflect the situation you're talking about. In this example, immersion is exactly what you have in water when you are swimming. An intensive lesson is also immersion. So, when I say that the children's swimming lesson is like an 'immersion course', I pun.</p>
<p>4. He is a multi-tasker. He can do several things at the same time. Yesterday evening, he was making dinner, practicing Russian while listening to a podcast, and helping his son with his math homework!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>What's one of the best ways to get refreshed? Exercise. I find, that I am a different person after I've exercised. What I mean by this is that I feel very positive, focused, and inspired when I have pushed myself physically. Mind you, it isn't just going to the gym that does it. Walks in the country are the very best for me. I think it's because, not only do I get all the physical benefits of exercise, but being in nature reminds me deeply of what's real and what's good. You could say that it's a scientifically proven huge dose of medicine. However, when I don't have the time to walk in the country, I'll go to the gym. The one I go to is just a few blocks away. It's one of those places that you can go to any time of the day or night. Each member has his or her own entry card that opens the locked doors automatically. This sounds very fancy, but it's actually just&nbsp;a safety precaution, so only members enter the gym at night. And because there are no staff members in the gym, the cards guarantee that members can work out safely, and alone. I've only worked out at night once, as I prefer to do so during the day. I usually go there mid-morning. Generally, there are elderly people working out when I get there, and an occasional younger person. I often wonder what the non-retired people are doing there in the morning. Do they work a night shift*? Are they unemployed? Perhaps they are in college. Or maybe, like me, they are a stay-at-home-parent-blogger. But my imagination isn't enough to keep me walking uphill on the treadmill*, or lifting weights. I need something to help me. Music works best for me, dance music, in particular. My problem is that I'm fussy about what I listen to. I like a huge variety of modern hits, music from the eighties, jazz, and Motown. However, because I really pay attention to words, I get tired of songs if I have heard them ten or twenty times. The music and the beat* really keep me going in my workout, but the words, often, put me off*. Some modern songs have great beats, but the words are either appalling or cliches. "Baby, it'll be alright in the night, hold me tight, our love is right, let's fly a kite, here's my sandwich, take a bite...." you know what I mean; a good piece of music can very quickly become annoying because of the childish* lyrics*. If only my ears didn't care about words. But that's how I am; I'm into* words, and I listen to everything. So, recently, after seeing the movie Tron, I bought the soundtrack. No words. Just a lot of great techo beats and rhythmns. For now, that is doing the trick*. I hope I don't get tired of it. I need to go to a music shop and look for instrumental versions of dance hits. Hopefully, I'll find some good music with no words, if not, I'll have to develop a sense of humor about modern music's silly lyrics.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related vocabulary</span>: night shift, treadmill, the beat, to put someone off.</p>
<p>1. He prefers to work at night, so he has the night shift in the hospital.</p>
<p>2. A treadmill is the walking machine that can vary speed and gradient. It offers a really good, custom workout.</p>
<p>3. The rhythm of a piece of music is what we call the beat.</p>
<p>4. While I was eating lunch, he blew his nose really hard. It totally put me off my food. I couldn't eat anything after that because I was so disgusted.</p>

			<title>Analysis time.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/analysis-time-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of my listeners have asked me to examine and explain English phrases and vocabulary in depth. I think that that is a great idea. In order to do this, I have selected a small paragraph from a magazine that is about wasting money. This will be the first in a series of 'Analysis time' that will, hopefully give you deeper understanding of certain, common vocabulary and phrases, so you will find them easier to use.</p>
<p>Stop wasting(1) food! With a little creativity(2), you can use commonly(3) trashed(4) items and save yourself some major(5) dough(6). Did you know that, on average, Americans throw out 25 percent of the food they bring home, worth(7) an astonishing(8) $2,200 per year. Think of what you could(9) do with that cash(10)!</p>
<p>1. Stop wasting...! It's a command. You could add various words at the end, such as, money, time, my time, the milk.</p>
<p>2. With a little creativity, a little thought, a little care, a little attention to detail. You're using your brain to think carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ex: With a little effort, you could finish this project in an hour.</p>
<p>3. Commonly: normally, regularly, daily. It is used to describe the items that are 'trashed'. How often are they trashed? Answer is very often, normally, daily, commonly. This action is committed by most people; it is common.</p>
<p>4. Trashed, comes from the noun trash which means rubbish or garbage. It has become a verb, 'to trash'.&nbsp;Ex: We trashed the old car. This means that we threw it in the rubbish, or that we smashed it&nbsp;up first, and then threw it away. It is an Americanism. It essentially means the same as&nbsp;'to waste'. Garbage and rubbish are&nbsp;only found in noun form; they are not verbs.</p>
<p>5. Major is also an Americanism. It means 'a lot of'. It implies an important amount, or an important position. Ex: I have major bills to pay. This could mean big bills, or a lot of bills.</p>
<p>6. Dough, is taken from bread dough, the uncooked bread. It&nbsp;means money, again slang.&nbsp;* A note about using slang. If you are going to use it, make it consistent. For example, in this paragraph, both 'major' and 'dough' go together well because they are BOTH slang. It sounds like a good fit. If you mix formal language with slang, it doesn't sound so good.</p>
<p>Ex: Save yourself quite a lot of dough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Quite a lot of' sounds more English, precise, and from England. Whereas 'dough' is definitely slang, street language, and very informal.</p>
<p>7. Worth means 'has the value of'. Ex: This coat is worth a lot more than $100.</p>
<p>8. Astonishing here means surprising and shocking. To be astonished. Ex: I am astonished by his progress! Ex: The opulence of the palace was astonishing.</p>
<p>9. Think of what you could..... is a very useful phrase to which you can add a variety of verbs:</p>
<p>Think of what you could eat at the buffet. Think of what you could learn if you went to that university. Think of what you could paint if you had the right equipment. Think of what you could achieve if you were President.</p>
<p>10. Cash, as you probably know is money. It's not as slang as 'dough', it can be used even in formal situations with more formal language.</p>
<p>So, let's hear the paragraph again, first slowly, and then at normal speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

2. With a little creativity, a little thought, a little care, a little attention to detail. You're using your brain to think carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ex: With a little effort, you could finish this project in an hour.
3. Commonly: normally, regularly, daily. It is used to describe the items that are 'trashed'. How often are they trashed? Answer is very often, normally, daily, commonly. This action is committed by most people; it is common.
4. Trashed, comes from the noun trash which means rubbish or garbage. It has become a verb, 'to trash'.&nbsp;Ex: We trashed the old car. This means that we threw it in the rubbish, or that we smashed it&nbsp;up first, and then threw it away. It is an Americanism. It essentially means the same as&nbsp;'to waste'. Garbage and rubbish are&nbsp;only found in noun form; they are not verbs.
5. Major is also an Americanism. It means 'a lot of'. It implies an important amount, or an important position. Ex: I have major bills to pay. This could mean big bills, or a lot of bills.
6. Dough, is taken from bread dough, the uncooked bread. It&nbsp;means money, again slang.&nbsp;* A note about using slang. If you are going to use it, make it consistent. For example, in this paragraph, both 'major' and 'dough' go together well because they are BOTH slang. It sounds like a good fit. If you mix formal language with slang, it doesn't sound so good.
Ex: Save yourself quite a lot of dough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Quite a lot of' sounds more English, precise, and from England. Whereas 'dough' is definitely slang, street language, and very informal.
7. Worth means 'has the value of'. Ex: This coat is worth a lot more than $100.
8. Astonishing here means surprising and shocking. To be astonished. Ex: I am astonished by his progress! Ex: The opulence of the palace was astonishing.
9. Think of what you could..... is a very useful phrase to which you can add a variety of verbs:
Think of what you could eat at the buffet. Think of what you could learn if you went to that university. Think of what you could paint if you had the right equipment. Think of what you could achieve if you were President.
10. Cash, as you probably know is money. It's not as slang as 'dough', it can be used even in formal situations with more formal language.
So, let's hear the paragraph again, first slowly, and then at normal speed.

			<title>Ivar's of Seattle.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/ivar-s-of-seattle-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>During Christmas vacation, we took a trip to Seattle to see the Nutcracker ballet, and to enjoy some time in the city. You might not know a lot about Seattle, but if you google it, you will see that it is a stunningly beautiful area, and a very cosmopolitan city. We stayed in a hotel, right downtown, and fortunately were on the thirtieth floor, so we had an impressive view of the city. After leaving our luggage in the hotel room, we decided to go for a walk around the center of town, and find a place to have lunch. We ended up choosing Ivar's restaurant, which is right on the water. It has been around for a long time, and is famous for its chowder. Chowder is a thick, creamy soup that has clams in it, though sometimes it can just have potatoes. Ivar's chowder is so popular, that it can be bought all over the Northwest in supermarkets. As Seattle is a prime spot* for seafood, we all had fish. While we were eating, our waiter gave the kids a mask each, called Ivar's diver. It goes with the sea theme, and has been Ivar's mascot since the 1960's. It was a sunny, Winter day, and we enjoyed sitting by the windows and watching the boats come and go. On such a day, this is the place to be. There is the view of the water, and also of the islands on the Puget sound, with ferries making their regular trips. We had over an hour before we had to be at the theater, so, when we finished our meal, we walked out onto the deck to have a look around. There were tables with people having lunch. They had company. There was a huge gathering of seagulls that were making a tremendous racket* begging for crumbs and leftovers. I was impressed at their size; they're much bigger than I realised. And they were quite aggressive as well. We had deliberately taken some leftover fries with us to feed them. My children threw them up into the air, over the water. These strong, hungry birds whipped* through the air, and ate most of the food before it even landed on the water. It was like watching an acrobatic display. And these birds are on to a good thing*. They are a permanent part of Ivar's because they know that there is a constant supply of food coming from the restaurant.&nbsp;Some people visit Ivar's just to feed the seagulls. Infact, I think that they would be a better mascot than Ivar's diver.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related vocabulary:&nbsp;</span> a prime spot/ location, a racket, to whip (through).</p>
<p>1. That place is a prime spot for a restaurant. It will be visible and accessible to pedestrians and drivers. We should get lots of business if we have it in that location.</p>
<p>2. What a racket! What a horrible noise! You don't call that music do you? It's awful!</p>
<p>3. The wind whipped through the building. It was so cold and uncomfortable. * Whip is both a noun and a verb. A whip is a nasty, long, leather device to control and subdue animal, and, in the past, slaves. So, here it describes the 'sting' of the wind,&nbsp;as if it is punishment.</p>

			<title>Loaded nachos.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/loaded-nachos-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Studies show that the favorite food in the U.S is Mexican. The traditional hot dog and hamburger have to take second and third places, because the tasty and sometimes spicy food found south of the U.S takes first place. When I first came to the U.S., I had very little idea of how much influence Mexico has, in general, on this country. As I am English, and England is very far away from Mexico, I had only ever been to one Mexican restaurant that was in London. I didn't know much about Mexico either. &nbsp;Now, twenty years on*, I'm sure that there are many more, up and down the country, especially the popular food chains like Taco Bell and Taco Time. So, during my first visit here, I ended up eating more Mexican food than I had expected. You could say that while I have lived here, I have learned not only about the U.S way of life, but also about Mexico, its food, its culture, and its people. I've been fortunate enough to* go to Mexico a few times, see its capital, explore some of its major historical buildings, and experience some of its traditions. And Wenatchee, believe it or not, is very influenced by the Mexican culture. Although it is a small town, of about 40,000, a large percentage of the population is from Mexico. Their culture is attractive and lively, and very proactive*. There are more and more restaurants, bakeries, dance clubs, travel agencies, and daycares that are Hispanic and Spanish speaking. A healthy bicultural nature is emerging in this town. Because of this, even the traditional supermarkets are offering products that Hispanics like to buy. It's good business. And one of the prefered dishes is nachos. It is based on corn or flour tortillas, which are flat and round. These can be fried to become crispy, toasted slightly in a frying pan with no oil, or simply warmed in the microwave. Nachos typically are crunchy. Bags of tortilla 'chips' are purchasable anywhere, so it's easy and convenient. Some people make a simple nacho dish of tortilla chips with tomato salsa and shredded cheese on top. However, 'loaded nachos' is a much more substantial dish that is varied and filling enough to be a full meal. The word 'loaded' is used to mean that it is a full, and quite heavy dish. A loaded gun comes to mind; it's ready to do some serious firing, and the nachos are ready to deliver some serious taste. So, we have the tortilla chips, and on top, fried , seasoned, minced beef, salsa, sour cream, advocado slices, black olives, shredded cheese, and sliced chili peppers. Wow! Beat that! It is full flavored, as you can imagine. This dish is perfect for parties and get-togethers. Recently, the Superbowl was on, and it is a tradition to have loaded nachos available as one of the dishes to enjoy while watching the football on television. The supermarkets stock up with all the ingredients, so you can easily throw them all together to make this easy but satisfying dish.</p>

			<title>The wrong shoes.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-visit-to-the-foot-doctor-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I haven't ever had a reason to visit a podiatrist (which is what we call a foot doctor), until recently. I don't have any problem with my feet, thankfully. I suppose, over the years, the shoes that I have worn have been good enough to keep me out of the clinics. My feet rarely complain, so I ignore them most of the time. However, my son Cass, who is twelve, has been complaining for a while of heel, ankle, and arch pain. I reasoned that he is growing fast at this stage, and that growing pains of all sorts are quite common. He does play a lot of sports, and so, any problem or tenderness* can get worse. As he practices basketball twice a week, and has to do lots of running, I researched a little on the internet the ways I could ease his pains. You know I love to Google; well, I also love to find tutorials on You-tube. It's a wealth of information! In an instant, I found a video clip that demonstrates how to wrap your feet before you take part in any sporting activity. It was surprisingly simple, and really made sense. It started by showing a 3-D image of the inside of a foot. I thought it looked freaky!* The visual* made it very clear how the foot works, and why a person might experience pain. So, I wrapped Cass's feet, and he told me after practice that it had really helped. I also made an appointment for him to see a podiatrist. It was just a few days later that we went to see Dr. Hoover, a softly spoken, straightforward man. After looking at Cass' feet and his shoes, he came to the conclusion that stress from sports, and the wrong shoes, have brought about the problem. Cass normally wears Adidas shoes. They are fine for walking, but they don't provide a lot of arch support, and the basketball shoes bend in the wrong place. Apparently, a good sports shoe bends where your foot does, basically at the toe area. If it bends in the middle, it puts stress on the joint that we have in the middle of our foot, because this joint is very limited, and is not supposed to move much at all. So, after he gave us a brief lesson on how the foot works, and a list of recommended* shoes and shoe inserts*, Cass had an xray. It turns out that he has normal feet, and just needs some good support during sports. That was a relief for me; I didn't have to worry about anything serious. The next day I bought him two kinds of inserts, and different basketball shoes. These things have made all the difference. He's much happier now after practice, and no longer has stiff, tender feet in the morning. How wonderful that we have such quick access to information that can educate us, and help us avoid making mistakes with our health.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related vocabulary</span>:tenderness, freaky, a visual, recommended:</p>
<p>1. When a part of your body is injured, the area around the injury can feel tender, sensitive to pain.</p>
<p>2. That Halloween costume is freaky! It's one of the wierdest and scariest I've seen.</p>
<p>3. It's much easier to study if you have a visual, because, as Shakespeare said, "A picture paints a thousand words."</p>
<p>4. That hotel is recommended; it has everything we need. However, the one next door isn't recommended at all.</p>

			<title>Dirt bike night.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/motorbike-night-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was Friday night, and we had tickets for a special event. Our local Town Toyota Center was going to host a dirtbike show. We had six tickets, so there were enough for me, the kids, and my brother. I had never been to a dirt bike night at the arena, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I do like motorbikes; I took a riding course many years ago, and my husband had several, so they are an area of interest for me. We had been told that a company in town had been asked to bring in ton(nes) of earth (soil) to make a course for the bikes. "That must mean that there are some jumps!" I said to my kids, who got very excited at the thought of it. And there certainly was a lot of earth.&nbsp;The view from our box showed a racing course that was made entirely of soil, with about seven hills for jumping. The arena slowly filled with spectators, while a giant monster truck revved* its engine, and gave people a short ride, forwards and backwards along the length of the course. It was an enormous vehicle that was perfect for the show, but I can't imagine using it in day to day life; it wouldn't fit anywhere. The announcer stepped forward, introduced himself and the sponsors of the show, and then called forward the first set of *bikers. They were semi-professional, looked like they were in their mid twenties, and they were all riding three to four hundred cc bikes.&nbsp;Ten of them&nbsp;lined up and revved their engines. There would be money for the winner, and you could tell that they were eager.*The flag signalled go, the line dropped, and they were off with a loud, drilling machine noise from their engines, and soil flying from their back tires. They rounded the corner, and came up to the a set of bumps in the course. They had to slow down substantially to get over them without falling off. Then there was another sharper bend, and two large jumps. One by one, they flew through the air, their colors blurring* with their speed. Two more lengths of the course and they were finished with the first round. Five rounds in total and they finished. One lucky one received five hundred dollars,&nbsp;but the rest went home empty-handed. There followed about nine more performances from different age groups and categories, ranging from five year olds (believe it or not), to professionals. Funnily enough, the shortest session, was that of the over fourties category. They looked heavier than the first lot, but just as enthusiastic. However, when they rounded the first corner, three of them fell over, two quite badly, and that was the end of that! Two of them limped off, injured, and none of the others completed the course. My brother and I looked at eachother and shook our heads. We're both in our fourties, and we both understand that people our age don't bounce like rubber anymore. Well, by the time each category had run the course, the arena was full of exhaust fumes, and we were more than ready to go home. It had been entertaining, though quite noisy. Actually, the noisiest part was the announcer, who felt like he had to shout through the entire evening for some reason. I was glad to get in my car, in the relative quiet, and drive easily and safely home, no bumps, and no falls.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related vocabulary and expressions</span>: a set of, eager, blurry, to rev the engine.</p>
<p>1. I bought a set of storage boxes and a set of flower pots that were on sale.</p>
<p>2. After swimming in the sea, my eyes were all blurry; I couldn't see clearly at all.</p>
<p>3. My neighbor was making such a noise revving his engine; does he think that he's a race car driver?</p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[It was Friday night, and we had tickets for a special event. Our local Town Toyota Center was going to host a dirtbike show. We had six tickets, so there were enough for me, the kids, and my brother. I had never been to a dirt bike night at the arena, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I do like motorbikes; I took a riding course many years ago, and my husband had several, so they are an area of interest for me. We had been told that a company in town had been asked to bring in ton(nes) of earth (soil) to make a course for the bikes. "That must mean that there are some jumps!" I said to my kids, who got very excited at the thought of it. And there certainly was a lot of earth.&nbsp;The view from our box showed a racing course that was made entirely of soil, with about seven hills for jumping. The arena slowly filled with spectators, while a giant monster truck revved* its engine, and gave people a short ride, forwards and backwards along the length of the course. It was an enormous vehicle that was perfect for the show, but I can't imagine using it in day to day life; it wouldn't fit anywhere. The announcer stepped forward, introduced himself and the sponsors of the show, and then called forward the first set of *bikers. They were semi-professional, looked like they were in their mid twenties, and they were all riding three to four hundred cc bikes.&nbsp;Ten of them&nbsp;lined up and revved their engines. There would be money for the winner, and you could tell that they were eager.*The flag signalled go, the line dropped, and they were off with a loud, drilling machine noise from their engines, and soil flying from their back tires. They rounded the corner, and came up to the a set of bumps in the course. They had to slow down substantially to get over them without falling off. Then there was another sharper bend, and two large jumps. One by one, they flew through the air, their colors blurring* with their speed. Two more lengths of the course and they were finished with the first round. Five rounds in total and they finished. One lucky one received five hundred dollars,&nbsp;but the rest went home empty-handed. There followed about nine more performances from different age groups and categories, ranging from five year olds (believe it or not), to professionals. Funnily enough, the shortest session, was that of the over fourties category. They looked heavier than the first lot, but just as enthusiastic. However, when they rounded the first corner, three of them fell over, two quite badly, and that was the end of that! Two of them limped off, injured, and none of the others completed the course. My brother and I looked at eachother and shook our heads. We're both in our fourties, and we both understand that people our age don't bounce like rubber anymore. Well, by the time each category had run the course, the arena was full of exhaust fumes, and we were more than ready to go home. It had been entertaining, though quite noisy. Actually, the noisiest part was the announcer, who felt like he had to shout through the entire evening for some reason. I was glad to get in my car, in the relative quiet, and drive easily and safely home, no bumps, and no falls.
Related vocabulary and expressions: a set of, eager, blurry, to rev the engine.
1. I bought a set of storage boxes and a set of flower pots that were on sale.
2. After swimming in the sea, my eyes were all blurry; I couldn't see clearly at all.
3. My neighbor was making such a noise revving his engine; does he think that he's a race car driver?]]></itunes:subtitle>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There has been a scraping sound in Wenatchee for about a week. It's the sound of snow shovels. Finally, the snow is here. And there isn't just a little of it. Out of the blue*, a storm moved in, just as we were getting used to a snowless Winter. It took us all by surprise*, and it has had its usual impact on everything. Our lives have adjusted by becoming slower. You can't rush around if you are walking or driving on snow and ice. You can't afford* to be a little late, because by the time you get to where you planned on going, you will be very, very late. One of my kids told me yesterday, that one of her classmates was late for school because her front and back doors were frozen shut! There are inconveniences everywhere, and you just have to get used to them. On my way to the grocery store, there was a hold up* in the traffic. One car had slid into the snow bank that was in the middle of the road. It was stuck, and sticking out*, right in the way of the traffic. People were looking out of their windows, honking their horns, and generally looking impatient. Finally, a hero turned up to rescue the stranded person. It was a policeman. He walked slowly over to the stranded driver who was desperately spinning his wheels, assessed the situation*, got back in his car, and literally pushed the car out of the way with his police car. It worked; problem solved. One thing about living in this area is that you become more flexible in the Winter. I think you become more understanding. Everyone has things to do; we are all in a hurry, but there is a white obstacle out there, in the streets and driveways, that slows us all down, and sometimes causes accidents. So what does all of this mean? It means we have to be more thoughtful. One of our neighbor's boys cleared the snow from my friend's driveway because she's in her late seventies, and lives alone. You'll often see people snow blow their own driveways and walkways, and then continue on to the neighbor's. I'll be going over to my mother's house today to clear her walkway while she's at work because she's terrified of slipping and falling. To avoid an accident, she wears attachable*, rubber crampons, believe it or not. They keep her stable and safe. Whoever sells those should be making some good money this time of year.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/amaryllis-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Something has grown in my mother's kitchen this Winter. It is tall, beautiful, and bright red. If you're in the room, you can't help but * look at it. It's an amaryllis. It was given to her as a Christmas present, and she has been growing it from a bulb since then. They are originally from South Africa, a member of the lily family. As there are no plants growing here in the Winter, it is common to give the gift of an amaryllis bulb in a pretty pot, as a plant to be grown inside the house. Once planted, it will quickly grow tall, and produce a stunning flower. It's the kind of plant that you want to photograph up close. Its stamen are a contrasting yellow, and hold a lot of pollen. It's similar to some of the orchids that my mother has grown through the years; they also have a very fleshy*, waxy feel to them, and have very rich colors. The other day when I visited her, I was reminded that I also have bulbs at home that need to be planted. Actually, in the Autumn, I bought three bags of bulbs, to be planted that season in the garden. Let's just say that I put them 'out of sight'*, and they are still in the bags. They have actually started to sprout, even though they are not in soil. Apparently, even though I missed the season, I can still plant them in pots and keep them in the house where they will slowly grow. Then, in the Spring, I can transplant them outside. It's a bit like the potatoes that I buy for making chips, baked potatoes or mashed potatoes. If don't use them in time, they will have sprouted all sorts of roots and become inedible. Plants are programmed to grow, and they will do it, whether or not we are taking care of them. A friend of mine told me that one year she planted too many zucchini plants (they are also called courgets). They had a car parked next to the vegetable patch that was not used much. Before anyone knew it*, the zucchini vine had grown all over and inside the car! All this talk of plants is making me yearn* for the Spring. First things first though; I need to find those bags of bulbs and get them planted!</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: you can't help but..., fleshy, out of sight, before you know it.</p>
<p>1. You can't help but admire him. Everybody thinks he is brilliant.</p>
<p>2. These apricots are so fleshy. They have a lot of body, and are filling.</p>
<p>3. He didn't really clean the houe. He just put everything away, out of sight, in the cupboard.</p>
<p>4. You'll have a child, and, before you know it, he will have grown, and will be leaving for college.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Cave spotting.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/cave-spotting-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been such a mild Winter. There has been no sign of snow for weeks and weeks, which is very odd. Christmas didn't feel very Christmasy because of it. But there is an up side* to this strange weather. Everyone has been able to go for walks. Normally, when there is so much snow and ice around, you don't see people walking on the street at all. They stay in their cars, nice and warm, if they want to go anywhere. But this year, people are still walking and jogging on the streets. The parks are almost as busy with people as they are in the Spring or Autumn. Walking in the countryside is something that I love to do. It gets the heart pumping, the circulation going*, and clears the mind. So, a couple of days ago, my brother and I went up into the hills that are nearby. We followed a road called Horselake, up to a rough, primitive road, that took us winding up, away from the town. It was a cold day, with mist sitting on the tops of the hills. The grasses and bushes up there were all different hues* of brown, blonde, and pale greens, - very gentle on the eyes. We were hoping to see some wildlife: perhaps a coyote, or a deer. My brother noticed all kinds of foot prints in the mud. Some were definitely those of dogs, but a few looked as though they could have been cougar prints. We do have them in the area; we've even had a couple in town in recent years. Yikes!* I don't like the sound of that! Well, we walked upwards, following a ridge. On one side of it we could see a valley with the Wenatchee river cutting through it, and on the other side, a steep slope down into a ravine*. It was hard work, but worth it. The view was great. We ended up walking down onto the road because from there, we could access some sandstone caves. I had been up this way before, but had never seen the caves. They blend into the side of the hill, so they are very hard to see. We scrambled* down to reach them, and then spent some time exploring. It was fun. It reminded me of rock climbing in England when I was young, though I'm not as brave now as I was then. We crawled up to the biggest ones, and took photos, and looked for signs of animals. The wind and water had carved out fascinating shapes, mini bridges and arches, and little places that would be perfect for small animals. There was evidence of birds staying there: droppings*. After taking photos and having a good look around, we headed back to the car. There was still no sign of coyotes, but, then again, they are very smart animals, and had probably been observing us the whole time.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: an up side to something, get the circulation going, a hue, yikes.</p>
<p>1. This weather is terribly wet. Mind you, the up side is that the garden is getting plenty of water.</p>
<p>2. That aerobics class is hard. It really gets the circulation in the body going.</p>
<p>3. She painted her whole house in different hues of yellow.</p>
<p>4. Yikes! I wouldn't want to hold that rattlesnake!</p>]]></description>

			<title>Graduation day.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/graduation-day-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>There was a special day to celebrate, back in November. A friend of mine was graduating from a nursing program(me) which she had been in for two years. Normally, as a young student, two years of study isn't that much. However, she is in her forties, married, and has two boys, so it was quite a challenge. Mijung, is my very good friend from Korea. We have known eachother for about seven years. Infact, our boys went to the same preschool, and it was there that we met eachother. We got together once after preschool and had lunch while the children played, and our friendship took off* from there. Mijung is both compassionate and intelligent, so I think that she has the right qualities to make an effective nurse. I actually haven't seen her much for the past two years because of her busy schedule*. Knowing how much effort she had put into her studies, and how difficult it had been to maintain a balance between studying full time, and also having a family, I was determined to go to her graduation ceremony to show my support. It took place in the gymnasium of the college that she studied at, here in Wenatchee. By the time I found a parking spot and ran into the building, it was packed with people, and the teachers were giving their speeches. It was warm in the gym. Families, dressed elegantly, were sitting in groups, holding flowers, and looking very proud. There was a surprisingly large number of children running around (girls in pretty dresses, boys in smart suits) unaware of the formality* of the occasion. They must have enjoyed the spacious feel of the room, and the shiny floors. A few mothers got up and told their kids not to roll around on the floor, and they did their best to wipe off their children's now not-so-clean clothes. Finally, the time came to give out the graduation badges. I took off my coat, got out my camera, and squeezed past* a few people so I could see my friend clearly enough to take a good photo. "We will hand out the badges in alphabetical order," announced the speaker. "Oh, great! Mijung's last name begins with 'W'; I'm going to be waiting for a while," I thought to myself. It was a school day, and I had just over an hour before having to pick the kids up. The graduates approached the podium* to say a few words and receive their badges. Most of them were tearful and happy; they thanked their family members for supporting them, and those with&nbsp;children said a big thankyou for everyone's patience. I actually grew impatient, listening to all of the mini-speeches. I didn't want to leave without seeing Mijung. I couldn't quite get to the perfect spot to photograph her: if I moved to the left, a flower arrangement blocked her face. If I moved to the right the podium was in the way. Finally, a little frustrated, I just walked out in front of the first row of seats and started to take pictures. Her name was called. She got up quickly and joined her family at the podium. She hugged her family and everyone applauded. She was one of the few students who received the extra honor of graduating with straight 'A's': Magna cum laude, I think it's called.&nbsp; During the applause, I managed to catch Mijung's eye, and I waved and blew her a kiss. What an accomplishment! She deserves to feel proud. I'm sure she'll make a positive impact on people who need physical help. It was such a happy moment for so many students. Even the very young children who were running around and sliding on the floor, clapped as if they knew what was going on. I checked my watch, and I was glad that I did, because I only had five minutes left before I had to leave. I fumbled* to get my camera back in the bag, I quickly handed a present for Mijung to her husband, and waved goodbye.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary:to take off, busy schedule, formality, to squeeze (past)</p>
<p>1. The business took off as soon as it opened. It has done really well since then.</p>
<p>2. I have to change my busy schedule; it's too much. I'm so busy that it's not even practical!</p>
<p>3. You must understand the formality of the occasion; the correct dress and etiquette should be used.</p>
<p>4. She squeezed through the crowd to get a better look at the pop singer.</p>]]></description>

By the time I found a parking spot and ran into the building, it was packed with people, and the teachers were giving their speeches. It was warm in the gym. Families, dressed elegantly, were sitting in groups, holding flowers, and looking very proud. There was a surprisingly large number of children running around (girls in pretty dresses, boys in smart suits) unaware of the formality* of the occasion. They must have enjoyed the spacious feel of the room, and the shiny floors. A few mothers got up and told their kids not to roll around on the floor, and they did their best to wipe off their children's now not-so-clean clothes. Finally, the time came to give out the graduation badges. I took off my coat, got out my camera, and squeezed past* a few people so I could see my friend clearly enough to take a good photo. "We will hand out the badges in alphabetical order," announced the speaker. "Oh, great! Mijung's last name begins with 'W'; I'm going to be waiting for a while," I thought to myself. It was a school day, and I had just over an hour before having to pick the kids up. The graduates approached the podium* to say a few words and receive their badges. Most of them were tearful and happy; they thanked their family members for supporting them, and those with&nbsp;children said a big thankyou for everyone's patience. I actually grew impatient, listening to all of the mini-speeches. I didn't want to leave without seeing Mijung. I couldn't quite get to the perfect spot to photograph her: if I moved to the left, a flower arrangement blocked her face. If I moved to the right the podium was in the way. Finally, a little frustrated, I just walked out in front of the first row of seats and started to take pictures. Her name was called. She got up quickly and joined her family at the podium. She hugged her family and everyone applauded. She was one of the few students who received the extra honor of graduating with straight 'A's': Magna cum laude, I think it's called.&nbsp; During the applause, I managed to catch Mijung's eye, and I waved and blew her a kiss. What an accomplishment! She deserves to feel proud. I'm sure she'll make a positive impact on people who need physical help. It was such a happy moment for so many students. Even the very young children who were running around and sliding on the floor, clapped as if they knew what was going on. I checked my watch, and I was glad that I did, because I only had five minutes left before I had to leave. I fumbled* to get my camera back in the bag, I quickly handed a present for Mijung to her husband, and waved goodbye.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's that time of year when a lot of people are waiting to go South. Normally, by now, we would have snow, lots of it, and icy roads. This year, however, has been very strange. We experience hard frosts at night, but sunny days. Everyone is talking about how strange the weather is. Children have their winter boots, gloves, and hats at the ready*. At the first sign of snow, they will frantically get dressed, and run outside to play in the glorious white stuff. But, it's just not happening. By now, also, most migrating birds have left to go to either California, Florida, Mexico, or some other sunny destination. But, even some of <em>them</em> are hanging around* the town still, waiting for the snow to come. I was coming out of Walmart the other day, when I saw a cloud of birds swirling around in the sky, 'practicing' moving as a group. They looked playful, and amazingly skilled*. They moved to and fro* effortlessly like hundreds of acrobats working in unison*. As I got closer to my car, I saw that they had settled on a radio tower across the highway. I took out my new camera to zoom in and get a closer look. There were hundreds of them sitting on the metal poles. It was like a chatty, nervous group of people, waiting excitedly for something. I'm not surprised that they were excited. The thought of going somewhere sunny is very appealing right now. Many people I know have already made plans to spend a month or two in Arizona. They are usually retired, and therefore can afford to take off* for a long time. Younger people can usually only go for a couple of weeks because they have to come back and work, of course. Golf or tennis are usually the planned activities for those Winter vacations. And, when the travelers come back, they show off their tans to the rest of us. I'm sure, even though the weather is strange this year, the migrating birds will soon be gone, and our retired family members and friends will have packed their bags and left too. Perhaps a heavy fall of snow will come a month late, so we can enjoy a little more sun for a little longer. Either way, we'll cheer up our long, dark nights with Christmas lights, and stay cozy by the fire.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>My morning routine has ups and downs*. First thing in the morning, I find myself rushing around like a frantic woman, trying to get my children up out of bed, and off to school. I'm usually still in my pajamas (pyjamas)* when I drop the kids off, and I drive off quickly before anyone sees me. But, when I get home, I can slow down a little before I start the chores of the day, or run errands. I take my time over my morning coffee, stretch, pet the dogs, check my emails and Facebook, have a bit more coffee, and then plan my day. I was doing that this morning, when there was a knock at the door.&nbsp;A Federal Express delivery man handed me a package, a large box. I had to sign in order to receive it, and then he went on his way. I assumed that the package was for my husband, who buys a lot of cycling and hunting equipment on-line*. However, it was addressed to me! I was instantly awake, and opened the box quickly. The side of the box said 'Greenvale Scottish baby potatoes'. I knew that I hadn't ordered any potatoes; why would I? But the word Scottish gave me a clue as to what was inside, and who it was from. My father lives in Scotland, on the West coast. And, yes, it was from him. Thankfully, the box wasn't full of potatoes, but rather, it was brimming with Christmas presents. I was so surprised! He and his wife had wrapped up all of the gifts in traditional wrapping paper, with colors of red, green, gold, and white. I took&nbsp;them out of the box, and tried to guess what they were. " The children will be so excited to see them under the Christmas tree when they get home," I thought to myself. This is their last week of school, and they are beginning to anticipate# the holidays. I noticed that one of the wrapping papers had one of my favorite English Christmas carols on it: The Holly and the Ivy. The first two lines were visible under the bow. It says: 'The Holly and the ivy, when they are both full grown, of all the trees that are in the wood, the holly bears the crown. And the rising of the sun, and the running of the deer, the playing of the merry organ, sweet singing in the choir.' It really sets the scene for Christmas.&nbsp;I must rush out and send off a package as soon as possible to Scotland. I hope it gets there on time!</p>

			<title>An unusual way to advertise.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/an-unusual-way-to-advertise-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever watch the programs (programmes) on television that show the funniest international advertisements? They generally come out about Christmas time, and provide an hour of side-splitting* entertainment. Advertising is to be scrutinized*. Even my children will comment on whether or not an advertisement is any good. Some are very clever, some are downright* annoying, and some are confusing. I've found that as my children's critical thinking develops, so do their comments about anything in the media. "That advertisement sucks," one of them will say. Obviously 'sucks' is slang for something being awful or of very poor quality. I will ask why it 'sucks', and the answer will be something like, "It's not convincing," or "there's no point to it," or perhaps even, "they're trying to be funny, but they're not." I suppose the whole point of advertising is to catch the attention of the public, and to convince us to buy something. So, everyone should be a critic, and we should use our own brains to decide how good an advertisement is, and if the product is really worth buying. Sometimes the simplest advertisements are the best. I remember a series of Australian beer commercials for Foster's, that were really funny. They were very basic, showing how rugged* Australia is, and then indicating that Foster's beer is also rugged. The commercials used exaggeration to get their message across, and they did a good job. The other day I came across an unusual form of advertising: a large pretzel hanging in a tree. It sounds a little strange, doesn't it? It was outside a bakery, in the town of Leavenworth. Several pretzels were hanging on several trees along the street, and they had obviously come from the bakery which displayed pretzels. I thought that this was a genius idea. I went inside and asked a lady who was arranging cakes if there was a story or tradition around# the pretzel hanging in the tree. "Oh no," she said, "it's just for advertising." It had certainly sparked by interest. Infact, whether they intended it or not, that bakery had&nbsp;established &nbsp;its own tradition&nbsp; through advertising.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary and expressions: side-splitting, to scrutinize, downright, rugged (a story/ tradition around&nbsp; on Facebook at Anna Fromacupofenglish)</p>
<p>1. The comedy night at the local club was side-splittingly funny. When I got home, my stomach and my sides hurt from laughing.</p>
<p>2. My neighbors scrutinize everything that I do: how I park my car, when I mow the lawn, even how often I walk the dog.</p>
<p>3. She is downright lazy! She sits around, watching tv, and expects everyone else to work!</p>
<p>4. The men who live in this area are rugged; they are tough, hard working, and basic.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>What kind of characteristics or behavior can get you the title of Student of the Month? What would you imagine them to be? Intelligent? Avid* reader? High scorer? Or, are there other qualities that can get you noticed by teachers and rewarded. It looks as if there are many traits* and behaviors that can get a student both noticed and appreciated. Recently, in my childrens' middle school, there was an awards ceremony for a group of students who had 'stood out'* as community builders. By community, I mean the student body*, and the overall atmosphere that it carries. When I received the letter from the school, that my son Cass, had been nominated by his teachers for a community award, I was intrigued. I assumed that he had done something for the community of Wenatchee, perhaps for a charity. When I asked him what it meant, he told me that he didn't really know. Knowing that the principal would give some kind of speech about the award, I decided to wait and see what he had to say. The ceremony took place at ten in the morning, during school. The students who were nominated were excused from their various classes, and joined the parents in the assembly hall. The principal introduced himself, and then started to talk about what 'community' actually means within the school, and why it is so important. He talked about students having a positive and caring attitude, and being the 'glue' that holds the student community together, and helps to create a generally positive environment. As I listened to what he was saying, I realised that, yes, community is essential in school. If the student environment is safe and friendly, the young people can learn so much more, and feel free to be themselves, and perhaps even enjoy their school days. The last thing that&nbsp;students need is stress, so if&nbsp;the school system rewards community, I suppose it elevates the comfort level of all members.&nbsp;I took lots of photos of Cass and the other students, who had all been nominated by various teachers. They stood on stage in a group, holding their certificates proudly. After the ceremony, there was time for refreshments#, and mingling# with the other families. I read Cass' award which said, "His maturity, friendliness, and willingness to accept all kids makes him a wonderful member of any group." I felt very proud. I have his award on my desk now, and plan to frame it and put it in a place where everyone can see it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Those of you who have been listening to my podcast for the past three years, will know that I have complained about my camera on quite a few occasions. Though it has been both useful and practical for my podcasts, and small enough to fit in my handbag, I have been frustrated with it most of the time. I've described it as a 'dinosaur' more than once.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Those of you who have been listening to my podcast for the past three years, will know that I have complained about my camera on quite a few occasions.

			<title>Do you Skyrim?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/do-you-skyrim-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The tenth of November was a day of great excitement for my son, Hudson. He had been waiting for months for a new video game to be released. Skyrim is a game of battling dragons, strange worlds lost in time, heroes, enemies, and lots of gore*! It was going to be released at midnight, so the very beginning of 11, 11, of 2011. Skyrim is one of a series of games called the Elder Scrolls, made by Bethesda. It's appeal is basically a concoction of everything that teenagers, and some adults, like in a game: knights, weapons, spells, fights, castles, and graphics guided by endless imagination. The music is awesome as well. You could say that it is epic and mythological. I'm actually a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, so perhaps my son gets the love of such things from me. Well, it just so happened that all the schools in our area were going to be closed on Friday 12th because of Veterans Day. Perfect timing! Hudson could look forward to not only the whole weekend of playing his game, but Friday as well. However, someone had to go with him to the store, and wait in line. Now, who would that be? I can only think of one person: me. Of course I would do anything for my kids: climb the highest mountain, fight the fiercest dragon (or neighborhood dog), or even jump infront of the school bus if I had to. But lining up at midnight, in freezing weather, outside a video game shop didn't seem as heroic or appealing. But I did it. Infact, I did it twice. You actually had to turn up at ten o'clock and line up to get a ticket with a number on it. Then you had to come back at midnight, line up in numerical order*, hand in your ticket, and get the game. Well, it just so happens that Hudson had fallen asleep at about 9:30, so I had to drive over by myself to make sure that we got a ticket. Now, we did also have the option* of having a normal night's sleep, and just buying the game first thing in the morning* on Friday 11th. But where's the fun in that? This was special, so we had to do it the exciting way. Seeing that Hudson was asleep, I got in the car and drove to the video game store as quickly as possible, too quickly actually, because I forgot my coat. As I parked, I realised that there was already a long line of customers waiting, and they were all bundled up in warm clothes. I looked around the car in a panic, hoping to find an extra coat. There was one, belonging to my eight year old son. I took it and quickly lined up. Time went by really slowly; I stamped my feet and wrapped the small coat around my shoulders, finally squeezing the little hood onto my head. Of course, I looked ridiculous, but I just wanted to stay warm. An hour and a half later, I was handed my ticket: number eighty two. Phew! What a relief! I felt sorry for the other one hundred people behind me, but I was mainly thinking about getting back into my warm car. I drove home, picked up Hudson, and back we went. When we arrived, there were even more people there, still waiting for their tickets. Thankfully, we were able to walk straight into the store and get the Collector's Edition of Skyrim; I even took a photo of the occasion. Mission accomplished. I had proven my love for my son by braving freezing weather, and battling lines of evil customers. Now, it was time to kill some dragons.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: gore, numerical order, to have the option, first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>1. I dont' like all that gore in the movies. There is far too much blood and guts!</p>
<p>2. We will announce the winners in reverse numerical order, from fourth place to the overall winner.</p>
<p>3. You know, you have the option of flying instead of driving; it's more expensive, but it will save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>4. The best light is early in the day, so we'll get up first thing in the morning and set up the camera.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Please don't shoot!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/at-the-shooting-range-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Those of you have been following my podcasts over the past few months, will know that my husband has recently 'got into'*hunting. He is now fully licensed, fully equipped, and on his way to becoming an experienced hunter. Today, instead of leaving at six in the morning, as he usually does, to go to work, he spent the morning with me. He has taken a few days off to go with a friend to Minnesotta to hunt White Tail deer. He deserves a small vacation, so I have enthusiastically watched him pack all of his gear*, and listen to his plans for a successful hunt. Because he was ready ahead of time, he had a couple of hours to kill*, so we went up to the local shooting range to try out a couple of his rifles. I am a novice*, so I was quite happy to watch as he shot at the targets. It was freezing cold, and I had bundled myself up in three coats, a scarf, and a bobble hat: not exactly the right fashion sense for a tough shooter. The first rifle that Tom used was extremely loud; thankfully we both had heavy duty* ear protection on. The funny thing was, each time we said something to eachother, we couldn't hear; we spent the whole time saying,"What?" and having to repeat everything in loud voices. As Tom tested his rifles, I had a good look around. There wasn't that much to look at. The range is basically a long roof that shelters the marksmen. There are a few chairs here and there, but no houses around (who would want to live next to a shooting range?). There was nobody but us there; the hills surrounding us were bare, and there was no wind, not even a sound. Well, the only sound was the horrendously loud noise of the rifle, but other than that, it all felt desolate. I imagined someone whistling the theme tune from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but then I realized that with my woolly bobble hat, I had destroyed any image of cowboys. I did notice, however, some very interesting signs, three to be precise. Obviously, from the looks of them*, some people who come to practice get silly with the guns, and do dangerous things. I read the word "don't" over and over. Apparently, some people shoot beyond the shooting range on to private property, or they shoot at the ground (which is dangerous), or at objects that they shouldn't. T-t-t-t-t-t, very naughty. Someone needs to have his gun taken away, doesn't he? And someone needs to be put in time-out*. I'm glad that I'm not at the shooting range when other people are there; it's potentially very dangerous, and I wouldn't trust other people's sense of safety. Anyway, before we left, I had a go shooting a lighter rifle, one that would be good for hunting birds or rabbits. I found it hard at first to look through the scope, but I go the hang of it. I calmed my breathing, and tried not to move. The cross was over the bullseye, and POW! What a shot! Not bad at all; almost right on the bullseye!. That felt good. I continued, each time thinking carefully about keeping still and controlling my breathing. POW! POW! BANG! WHAMMO! And another BANG! Hey, I'm not a bad shot at all. I even brought the target home to prove it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related expressions</span>: to get into something, gear, heavy duty, a novice.</p>

			<title>A Round Robin Tea Party.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-round-robin-tea-party-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I had never heard of a Round Robin, until this past Sunday. My friend, Jody, invited me to a ladies' round robin in the town of Issaquah which is on the outskirts of Seattle. We left at about eight o'clock, stopped for coffee on the way, and reached the town of North Bend at about ten thirty. Jody had decided to expand our day trip to include an hour of shopping, and North Bend is a great place to do that. There is an open mall area that has many discount, name brand stores; we call them 'outlet'* shops. The items are new, but very reduced in price, possibly because they are a season or two old.&nbsp;I rarely* go there, but I know many women will make the two hour trip, just to get some bargains. My mind wasn't set on shopping; I was intrigued about the round robin coming up. I was also distracted by the beautiful countryside. Going over the Cascades towards Seattle from Wenatchee is awesome, if you love miles of dense forest, and high mountains. Of course, as you approach Seattle, there is a drastic climate change; the area obviously gets lots of rain. There is nothing but green, and trees everywhere. Overlooking North Bend is the impressive Mount Si, a huge mountain that seems to appear out of nowhere. We got back on the road*at about eleven thirty, and reached our destination just before twelve. Walking into the house was quite surprising. The place was packed with ladies, all wearing different hats (everyone was told to wear a hat as a conversation starter). The house itself was intensely decorated, and filled from floor to ceiling with memorabilia, ornaments, photos, and collectibles. I have never seen anything like it in a private home. I have been to a few antique and collectible stores that were chock-a-block* with items. After being introduced to the host and several other ladies, I turned to Jody and said, "This place must be a nightmare to dust!" Every piece of wall was covered with something, and shelves were full to overflowing with <em>things. </em>We were all called to sit down in the main lounge, have vodka and orange, and introduce ourselves. The point of a round robin tea party is to get to know everyone in the room, at least for a few minutes. So, a five course meal was served by the host's husband, and with each course we were to sit in a different room with a different group of ladies. Each course took about half an hour, and during that time we ate, drank far too much tea, and chatted. Some of the ladies had done this for years, and others like myself, were experiencing it for the first time. And, you know, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I had the opportunity to briefly get to know some fascinating ladies. One of the most fascinating was the host, Mary. She had started having parties at the age of seven, and had arranged them ever since. She fills her calendar with gettogethers, parties and trips, for the whole year, and organizes who will be there, and when the invitations go out. It's amazing. Her husband is as amazing as she is. Most men I know would want to live in a house that is like a 'living scrapbook', and certainly wouldn't be interested in serving lunch to a large group of chatty ladies. But, thankfully, it takes all sorts*.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Related vocabulary:</span> outlet shops, rarely, to get on the road, chock-a-block (chock-full), it takes all sorts (to make a world).</p>
<p>1. There's no point buying a coat for full price at a regular shop. Go to the outlet shop instead, and save money.</p>
<p>2. "Do you drink?" "Rarely." "How often?" "Once a year."</p>
<p>3. We need to get on the road (be on the road) by&nbsp;six, so we'll get to the office on time.</p>
<p>4. His room is chock-a-block with books and magazines; you can hardly walk in the room, it's so full.</p>
<p>5. That man goes everywhere on a unicycle. Oh well! It takes all sorts!</p>]]></description>

I have been to a few antique and collectible stores that were chock-a-block* with items. After being introduced to the host and several other ladies, I turned to Jody and said, "This place must be a nightmare to dust!" Every piece of wall was covered with something, and shelves were full to overflowing with things. We were all called to sit down in the main lounge, have vodka and orange, and introduce ourselves. The point of a round robin tea party is to get to know everyone in the room, at least for a few minutes. So, a five course meal was served by the host's husband, and with each course we were to sit in a different room with a different group of ladies. Each course took about half an hour, and during that time we ate, drank far too much tea, and chatted. Some of the ladies had done this for years, and others like myself, were experiencing it for the first time. And, you know, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I had the opportunity to briefly get to know some fascinating ladies. One of the most fascinating was the host, Mary. She had started having parties at the age of seven, and had arranged them ever since. She fills her calendar with gettogethers, parties and trips, for the whole year, and organizes who will be there, and when the invitations go out. It's amazing. Her husband is as amazing as she is. Most men I know would want to live in a house that is like a 'living scrapbook', and certainly wouldn't be interested in serving lunch to a large group of chatty ladies. But, thankfully, it takes all sorts*.
Related vocabulary: outlet shops, rarely, to get on the road, chock-a-block (chock-full), it takes all sorts (to make a world).
1. There's no point buying a coat for full price at a regular shop. Go to the outlet shop instead, and save money.
2. "Do you drink?" "Rarely." "How often?" "Once a year."
3. We need to get on the road (be on the road) by&nbsp;six, so we'll get to the office on time.
4. His room is chock-a-block with books and magazines; you can hardly walk in the room, it's so full.
5. That man goes everywhere on a unicycle. Oh well! It takes all sorts!]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Suspicious bills.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/suspicious-bills-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Paying bills can be such a pain. It's a necessary evil. It's also something that keeps us honest: when we have to look at our true expenses in the face*, it makes us consider our life styles, and whether or not we are being responsible. But still, it's a pain. I have to have peace and quiet to do it properly: no one around, no music, no tv. Like other people, I have a system that helps me. Daily, I sort out the bills from the junk mail. The junk goes into the recycling bin, and the bills go in a neat pile on my desk. Then, later on, I'll open the bills and sort them out chronologically, so the ones that need to be paid soonest go on top of the pile. The system cuts down on paperwork, and it makes me feel as if the job is already half done. So, when I eventually sit down to pay the bills, I'm organised: I have stamps, stickers with my name and address, extra envelopes, and the bills. What else do I need*? Enthusiasm.... The bills that take up most of my time are from the credit card companies that we use. Why? Well, it's because I pay a lot of my bills automatically with my credit card. It saves me* getting a late fee because I've forgotten to pay, let's say, my electricity bill, or my phone bill on time. It's convenient, and nowadays, most credit card companies have security arrangements, so you only pay what you really owe. If there is a charge to your credit card that you're unfamiliar with, you can always question it, or even stop it. Suspicious charges do crop up every now and then, and so it's important to check all of the charges on your monthly statement. That has been my experience. Even today, as I looked over the list of figures, I saw a substantial charge from a company that I know I owe nothing. I had previously bought a product from them, but had paid 50% of the total cost when I placed the order, and the remaining 50% when I received the product. "Gosh!" I said to myself. "They're charging me a third time!" I got on the phone, and told one of their billing specialists. Surprisingly, she was not apologetic at all, quite the opposite; she was abrupt and impatient. Perhaps she'd been hearing from lots of people about the same issue. She asked for my credit card number in order to reimburse* me, and we said goodbye. I wasn't satisfied, however. So, I called the credit card company and asked them to make a note that I don't owe anything else to this particular company. The lady said that customers, like myself, need to be vigilant. It is our responsibility to keep checking to see if the reimbursement has taken place. "It can take three days, or even up to 28 days, depending on the company." I was glad that she told me that, and have decided to check every few days to make sure that these suspicious bills don't crop up again.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary and expressions: to look something in the face, what else, it saves (a person) or (a continuous verb), to reimburse</p>
<p>1. He looked his laziness in the face, and decided to take action and do his laundry.</p>
<p>2. We've got everything for the trip: passports, money, credit cards, hotel reservations....what else do we need? Oh, luggage!</p>
<p>3. Pin the socks together before they go in the washing machine. It saves searching for the other sock afterwards. OR It saves your mother time!</p>
<p>4. I was overcharged when I bought the sofa, but after telling the company, they reimbursed me.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Potato Power.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/potato-power-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Skagit Valley is a beautifully dreamy green valley located between the Cascade Mountains and the Puget Sound. It is very close to the border with Canada, and right next to the West Coast. I went there a few months ago with my husband, as he had a business meeting with some potato growers. We drove along miles of tree-lined coastal roads, and finally came to a large, flat, lush valley that is farmland. It was cooler and more moist than Wenatchee. There was a consistent breeze coming from the ocean, and everywhere you looked was green. As we drove along, I tried my best* to take photos of the shady lanes and coastal views with my cell phone, but as with many photos, they do not do the beauty of the landscape justice*. We finally arrived at Wallace Farms. It is located in a fairly remote part of the valley: there's not much else around other than potatoes and more potatoes. As this was a business meeting, I decided not to sit in with my husband and his fellow company workers, as I would certainly be the odd one out*. So, I hung out* in the vestibule, and read all about the Wallaces. The family originally came from Scotland. They settled in Ireland, where they grew potatoes on the rolling hills of the far West coast, overlooking the Atlantic. In the 1800's they immigrated to Skagit Valley, and put their farming experience into practice. This particular area of the country is one of the best in the world for raising potatoes. The climate is mild and moist; the land is rich, and there is no lack of water. These happen to be the best conditions for growing this root vegetable. And they do it well. Their farm produces rich, healthy varieties with very smooth skins. The colors range anywhere from very white, to bright red, and to deep purple. They grow conventionally and also organically. I browsed through the well-known Cosco recipe magazine, and Wallace potatoes were recommended for several recipes. Having a mention from Cosco is like having a stamp of approval put on their product. As I waited for the meeting to finish, I thought about how popular potatoes are. Let's face it, everybody loves them. Have you ever met anyone who doesn't? And think how their use has spread from central America to the rest of the world. The simple potato is quite grand, if you think about it. And the high quality ones produce a lot of business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Related vocabulary and expressions:to try one's best, to do something justice, to be the odd one out, to hang out.</p>
<p>1. He tried his best to fix the car, but it was too worn out to be repaired.</p>
<p>2. That photo doesn't do her justice; she's far more beautiful in person.</p>
<p>3. They all knew about knitting, and I don't know anything about it; I really felt like the odd one out.</p>
<p>4. While I see the dentist, you can hang out in the waiting room.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Halloween has become a bigger and more celebrated holiday over the past few years. I suspected that it would. There is something innately fun about being scared, and telling scary stories. Parties and dressing up appeal to the child in all of us, of course. But I've noticed just how the machine of materialism is driving these occasions. There are Halloween cards now in the shops, so the expectation will soon be that you must give your friends and family a 'Happy Halloween' card. The decorations for Halloween have also increased and become extremely varied. It's not just a pumpkin and a skeleton anymore. People are beginning to put up lights, as they do for Christmas. It's not a bad thing in itself; it does get dark early this time of year, so lights are a good thing. It's just that our actions tend to be driven by what is sold in the shops and what is seen on television. For example, if a large shop like Walmart advertises a cute Halloween scene on television in which we see lots of purple and orange lights, children happily dressed up, plastic pumpkins, skeletons, witches, people giving eachother cards and presents, then the expectation becomes that of doing the same thing. In a way, we are dictated to. Or you could say that we follow like sheep. Now, don't get me wrong, I love to decorate my house, and to have special occasions to look forward to. However, where does the materialism end? Even Martha Stewart, who is the American guru for home decorating and cooking, has a line of elegant Halloween decorations for the home. I was curious to see what exactly they were when I found them on sale in a craft shop. So, I bought a couple of packets. They are pre-cut shapes of rats, crows, and spiders that you stick around your house. It's actually a good idea if you want to add a little spookiness to your home without overdoing it. The shapes are simple but artistic, they catch the eye, but they aren't overpowering like some other Halloween decorations. So, am I a sheep? Was I dictated to by a big, money making corporation? Maybe. Ah, but these decorations were on sale. Plus, they satisfy my need to decorate the house. And I haven't given in* to the whole* card thing. That's where I draw the line: I won't buy 'Happy Halloween' cards, so there! And you know what's coming next, don't you? Thanksgiving. One of my favorite holidays. It's all about being thankful, and spending time with friends and family. Perfect. No presents, no cards, no stress. My&nbsp;prediction is, however, &nbsp;that that is changing. Last year was the first time that I have ever&nbsp;seen Thanksgiving cards in the shops. I believe the manufacturers' angle* to encourage sales is thankfulness! "I'm thankful for you on this Thanksgiving day," say some of the cards. Mark my words*, next it will be presents. So what's next? Gifts and cards for Bank holidays?</p>
<p>Related vocabulary and expressions: to have an 'angle', mark my words, to give in to, the whole .... thing.</p>
<p>1. The angle of his argument is that businesses should have more freedom.</p>
<p>2. I know you don't often listen to me, but I was right about him, wasn't I? Mark my words: he's trouble!</p>
<p>3. She gave in to the pressure to shave her head with her friends. The next day she regretted the decision, and wore a paper bag over her head.</p>
<p>4. I just don't have time for the whole "look at my expensive car, aren't I great" attitude. Who cares what kind of car you drive?</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/old-man-rattlesnake-and-the-salmon-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>During my visit to the Leavenworth Fish Hatchery, there were several Native American displays. One was a story telling session, inside a large, colorful, inflated salmon. Two ladies from the Yakima Indian tribe sang songs and told a couple of stories. One was about salmon. As with many Native American stories, the main characters are animals with superpowers and human characteristics. It was an emotional story, told well by the ladies, wearing long skirts, and braided hair. It begins with the Creator giving humans the gift of salmon, along with instructions as to how to take care of them. They were never to be greedy or wasteful, only taking the amount of salmon that they needed to eat. For the first few generations, the people were obedient. However, their attitude changed and they became wasteful. Before long, there were no salmon left, and the people started to go hungry. Seeing that they had been disobedient, they were desperate to find a way to bring back the salmon to their rivers. One day, the story says, some of them found a dead salmon on the side of the river. "If we can bring it back to life, other salmon will return." They tried jumping over the fish five times, as legend said that&nbsp;that would revive the creature. Nothing happened. "Let's call on Old Man Rattlesnake. He is wise and has great powers." He lived away from the people, and was so old that he took a long time to walk. As he was on his way, Coyote, the shrewd and sneaky one, tried to trick the people into believing that he had great powers. He wanted to be famous. He quickly jumped over the fish, and at the fifth jump, knocked it with his stick, claiming that he had made it move. However, the people knew not to trust him. Then Old Man Rattlesnake arrived, and with great effort jumped four times. At the fifth jump, he suddenly disappeared into the fish which sprang to life. The salmon then returned to the rivers, swimming upstream. The people had learned their lesson about being greedy and wasteful. To this day, if you cut open a salmon, and look at its spine, you can see a long, white line of flesh which is the mark of Old Man Rattlesnake, and how he revived the salmon.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: braids, wasteful, shrewd, sneaky.</p>
<p>1. Her mother braided her hair every morning. She would part the hair into three sections and fold them over expertly.</p>
<p>2. The Yakima Indians learned not to be wasteful with the Creator's gift of salmon.</p>
<p>3. She is a shrewd business woman. She thinks and plans carefully, making the most of every opportunity.</p>
<p>4. Watch out for him. He's like a sneaky fox. He'll know your private information without you realising.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Delivering the Bobcat.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/delivering-the-bobcat-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I had the most unusual thing to do. If you had asked me a couple of years ago if I could see myself doing what I did yesterday, I would have told you that you're insane. I delivered a Bobcat to a taxidermist. Take a while to chew on that sentence*. I will explain. My husband recently developed the hobby of shooting. He started by acquiring a rifle, a shot gun, and a pistol. Fine, I thought. Then, the passion took hold* more substantially. His gun safe became quite full, he learned the hobby of loading his own bullets (that will be a whole other podcast), and several full length camouflage suits can now be found hanging in his closet. His obsession has grown. I'll give you some background to this situation, so you can get a clear picture. First of all, in this area, hunting is a major sport. There is a wide variety of wild animals, including predatory animals, that you can legally hunt. This activity is controlled and monitored by the Fish and Wildlife department of Washington State, which is responsible for preserving all of the native animals, and controlling their populations. Some years, the deer population explodes, which in turn, leads to&nbsp;a huge increase of cougars over the next few years. Crops and gardens can suffer because of too many deer, and farmers' livestock disappear with the increase of cougars. So, in a relatively short space of time, the situation can get out of control. It's great to know that there are plenty of the native animals in this state, but a safe and healthy balance needs to be maintained. Another reason for my husband's new love of hunting, is that all of his cousins (who live in a small, rural town about an hour away) are hunters. They are the type that always have hunting permits ready, and carry guns in their trucks, on the off chance* of running into a wild beastie. One of Tom's cousins is a cattle rancher. He and his hired cowboys take the cows up into the hills to pasture*. "The place is crawling with cougars," he has said to Tom. And he has often lost cattle to the cougars because they are so healthy and well-fed. There are no predators of cougars, so they need to be controlled through hunting. Anyway, my husband so far has managed to get a coyote, and a bobcat. I knew that it would be up to me to take the bobcat to the taxidermist because my husband leaves early for work,&nbsp;and comes back late. So, with mixed feelings, I took this beautiful cat to Tubb's taxidermy to be turned into a rug. How bizzare. The first thing that I saw when I walked into the building was a huge cylindrical machine that was humming, and inside were a couple of dogs. "Are those dogs?" I asked the owner. "Yes," he replied, and explained that they were beloved pets that were being freeze-dried for&nbsp;their owners....As I looked around the room, I felt, actually, as if I was the one being observed. There were animal heads and skins everywhere, and all eyes were on me. Even the massive moose head on the wall seemed to say, "What are you doing here, you silly woman?"Well, I went over the details of the kind of rug we want, made a deposit, and had a quick, last look at the stretched out skins, the hanging furs, the skull molds, and the freeze drying Foofy and Bingo. I made a quick exit. I've come to the conclusion, that being a helpful wife can often open the door to strange experiences, and good material to write about.</p>

			<title>Voices of the Colville Indians.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/voices-of-the-colville-indians-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On my recent trip to Leavenworth, I had an unexpected opportunity to see a song and dance performance by the Colville Native American Indian tribe. As the salmon festival has expanded over the years, it now includes historical and cultural displays that are related to the salmon and wildlife of the Northwest. The Colville Indians, whose real name is the Shipwoyelpi, have a culture that is strongly tied* to salmon fishing. When European settlers came to this area, they gave the tribe the name of the river they were based by, the Colville. Salmon has always been an important part of their diet, and therefore, has deep cultural significance for them. I wasn't aware that any Indians at all would be at the festival. I walked around to see the different displays, taking with me a small group of children from the school that my son goes to. As we made our way* from one booth to another, we suddenly heard drums. We followed the sound until we came to a circular, sheltered area that was covered with pine tree branches. Underneath were displays of animal skins, antlers, bead work, and cultural posters. Inside the sheltered area was a large circle of earth where young men and women were dancing. They were very colorfully dressed, and had all sorts of bells and feathers on their costumes. One performance was just coming to an end as we sat down, so we settled down, and waited for the next. A different set of dancers from the troupe came into the circular area, and when the two singers started banging the drums &nbsp;rhythmically and singing, they started to dance. One young man in particular caught my eye; he was dressed as some kind of bird. He danced slightly crouched over, with jerky, pecking movements. I couldn't take pictures fast enough. The singing was also impressive; the two male singers sang in a very soulful, high pitched manner that certainly kept my attention. I only wish that I knew <em>what </em>they were singing. One of them stood up afterwards and explained that he and his friend inherited their love of singing these cultural and historical songs, and had learned how to do so by listening to others, and with the help of* tapes. More school children started arriving, and filling up the seating area. But soon we had to leave because our bus was going to take us back to Wenatchee. I was anxious to hear and see another performance, and disappointed that we had to leave. However, the images and sounds of the Colville were, for me, the best part of the day, and, at the very least*, worthy of a podcast.</p>

			<title>Raptors at the Salmon Festival.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/raptors-at-the-salmon-festival-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was field trip day last week for Robert who is in third grade. He was particularly excited because it wasn't going to be the ordinary kind of field trip that schools make, you know, to a park, or the fire station, or a bakery. It was to the town of Leavenworth which is about a half hours drive. Each year, among other celebrations, there is The Salmon Festival. On the outskirts of town, there is a salmon hatchery which opens its doors to the public. The salmon have returned from their long, long trip around the ocean, and have come back to spawn. It is an important part of the Northwest culture because the salmon are plentiful here, and huge. Because the Salmon Festival has been held for many years, it has expanded substantially. Now there are different sections that teach about other wildlife, and even Native American Indian history and tradition. Well, after our short trip on the bus, we got off, and walked to the Raptor section of the Festival. We sat in the shade of a pine tree, and listened to an expert on birds of prey. She had a display of four stuffed birds: a golden ealge, a bald eagle, an ospray, and an eagle owl. Though they weren't alive, the creatures were very impressive. We learned all sorts of facts about them. There are only two types of eagles in North America. That really surprised me, because there are 48 species in total. The golden eagle is larger than the bald eagle, which, you may remember, is the symbol of the United States. Unlike many predatory animals, the females are larger than the males. The lady who spoke to us really kept our attention. She had obviously spoken to children for many years, because she knew how to keep the flow of information fast and fun. At one point, she was talking about the wingspan of the birds. Two students held up a large banner that showed the 7ft wingspan of a bald eagle. One by one, children and adults stood with their backs to it, to see if their arm span was equivalent. Of course, nobody's was. Then she talked about the sound of wings, and how different shaped wings sound different as the bird flies. Eagles have feathers sticking out of the ends of their wings, so they make a swooshing noise. Owls, on the other hand are silent fliers; their wings are rounded and smooth, so they can sneak up on their prey. The children were very impressed with the talk. I could hear some of them telling eachother their own stories of seeing birds of prey in our area. We had a few free minutes to walk around afterwards, and I was really pleasantly surprised to find a live display of birds of prey. A shy looking golden eagle was held by a bird trainer, and several other birds were on perches observing the people as we observed them. The bald eagle stared with its well known piercing frown, and the osprey and owls just looked out with little expression; their minds must have been elsewhere, up in the clouds, I'm sure.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/fig-pickles-toy-emporium-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;It was during this Summer vacation that my family and I came across the best toy shop that I have ever been to. It was in the town of Coeur d'Alene, in Idaho, the state that is to the east of Washington State, and next to Montana. As we were only on vacation for a few days, we had a very short time in this particular town, a few hours in fact. The town itself is very clean and organized, with lots of greenery, and right on a lake. It's a tourist attraction, and has a seaside feel to it. It's main street is called Sherman Avenue and is a quaint mix of cafes, restaurants, and specialty shops. It was a hot day, so we stayed on the shady side of the street. You could tell that it was Summer; there were people everywhere, especially in the outside seating areas of the cafes and restaurants. As we walked down towards the lake, I noticed several children a little further down, getting excited, pointing at one of the shops, and going in. My kids soon picked up on this*, and before I knew it, we were inside 'Figpickles Toy Emporium'.It wasn't my intention to buy anything, &ldquo;We're only going to look,&rdquo; I said. Well, you know how that goes*, don't you? It was an impressive place, not because of its size (it was a fairly small shop, but long, and divided into different sections). There were ornate, wooden decorations attached to various parts of the ceiling, creating the theme of a magical ship. The shelves that were on every wall, reached to the ceiling, and were completely full of modern, classic, and old fashioned toys. I assumed that they would have the typical toys that you find in big department stores, but they didn't. This was definitely a specialty shop. There were books, puzzles, and building kits about ancient civilizations, pirates, and major battles. I think that my children became so engrossed*, that they forgot about their parents completely. I stood back and watched. The 'girls' toys were tasteful: detailed wooden houses, paper doll kits, dressing up clothes. And actually, most of the toys were unisex*. We must have spent about an hour there. We couldn't leave because the young man who was working there that day was playing with the toys himself. He was using a rubber bow and arrow, firing it from one end of the room to the other, over the heads of the customers! He was having a whale of a time*! So, how could you not get involved when the employee was having so much fun. Thankfully, my kids got hungry after a while, so they were willing to leave. We did buy a couple of things, not because we needed any toys, but more to commemorate our visit.</p>

We told the kids not to get up too early on Christmas day to open the presents, but you know how that goes (i.e. they did get up early).


The two men argued in a civilized manner, but I picked up on their mutual loathing.

			<title>Friends From Estonia.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/estonian-friends-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend was very special. We had friends to stay. What made the weekend special was that, at the beginning of their stay, we actually didn't even know them. This unusual situation started back in June. There was a knock at the door, and when I opened it I found a blonde, young man, with a shy smile, and an armful* of books. "Hello," he said in an accent that I couldn't exactly place. "My name is Mikhail. I wonder if you have five minutes for me to show you these books that I'm selling." I didn't want to buy any books, but neither was I in a hurry to do anything else, so I asked him to come in. It turns out that he is from Estonia, and has spent the Summer going from door to door, selling educational books made by a company called South Western. Mikhail was charming and friendly, and immediately attracted the attention of my children, who proceeded* to crowd around him and ask all kinds of questions. Well, he showed me the benefits of using these books during my children's school years, and how they help to prepare them for exams, including college entrance exams. I decided to take the plunge* and buy them. He told me that they couldn't be delivered until the beginning of September, and that he would personally bring them to us. Fine. Well, Summer came and went, and the last thing on my mind at the&nbsp;beginning of term were books. I received a reminder card from him about his return, but because baseball season is here, and we are up to our eyeballs* in practices and games, I forgot all about Mikhail and the books. Then, a few days ago, he turns up as he had promised, with our set of books and DVDs. He looked tired. He still had a car load of books to deliver, and time was running out. It was 100 degrees that day, some of his customers hadn't paid yet, and he didn't even have a place to spend the night. My husband and I agreed that they could stay with us. We have a roomy, spare lounge which the kids use as a playroom. It would be cool, comfortable, and if they got bored at night, they could always play with the kids action figures.... They quickly became part of the family, infact, we were all disappointed to see them go. We talked about our countries and cultures, about work and families. In a week, they will go to New York, as a reward for their hard work. They also have the chance to win a trip to another country; those who sell the most books get to go. Mikhail's friend, Olev, who stayed an extra day with us, told us that this kind of Summer work is very hard. It forces you to grow up, become industrious, to persist even when you get a lot of negative responses from people, and to learn self control. These are qualities that he hopes to use in his career back in Estonia. They told us that their Summer&nbsp;experiences were completely varied. "I have been bitten by dogs, and had a&nbsp;gun pointed at me," said Mikhail. I laughed in shock when he told me that. "But in contrast to that," he continued, "we've stayed with some really kind host families." I hope they experience kindness for the rest of their trip, and perhaps, one day, they can show us around their home towns in Estonia.</p>

			<title>Goodbye Summer!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/goodbye-summer-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Summer has been and gone, can you believe it? For me, it has flown*. I suppose you have been wondering, "Where on earth is Anna? Has she fallen off the planet? Has she given it all up*, moved to Nepal, and become a monk? Or is she just enjoying her Summer too much?" The latter is the correct answer. Yes, I have enjoyed my Summer. I've taken long breaks from the computer. But, you know, to tell you the truth, I have felt the pull back to podcasting. Something in me has missed doing it. I must admit, sometimes it's therapy for me! And the best part of all, is when I make connections with you listeners. One young man called Denis, emailed me from Russia recently. His English is very good, and he uses my podcasts for a little extra practice. Great! That's exactly what they're for. Good luck in Boston, Denis! Well, I have lots to tell about the Summer, but I'll start by telling you what I'm doing right now. I'm sitting in my favorite spot, which is the front door step. It's quiet and fresh; there's nobody around, so I'm admiring the plants and trees, sipping coffee, and writing for you. It's still warm enough to sit outside without a jacket, thankfully, though that will change soon, I'm sure. I don't know what the weather is going to do, come to think about it*. It has been a very unusual year. The heat of Summer came very late this year. Even the bees were late out of their hives. I have loads of green tomatoes hanging on their vines, which usually, by now, would have ripened and been eaten. Fingers crossed* that the frost doesn't come too soon. I've been hoping to show you photos of my spectacular anemones, but they haven't even budded yet. "It's the coolest Summer in twenty years," I heard someone say the other day. I will certainly enjoy this Autumn season, as it's my favorite. Apart from the garden, which you know is an obsession of mine, it's the routine that I appreciate. Summer, with the kids at home, is a wonderful time, but a bit random. It's hard to feel as though you are achieving very much. But today, all the little monkeys are back at school, I have their baseball practice schedules on the calendar, and I'm feeling pretty organized. I also have signed up for substitute teaching again, as I am no longer homeschooling, and I've already had a week's work, with promise of more. So, the lazy days of Summer are gone, but Autumn will be a time for achievements.</p>

			<title>Chore time.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/chore-time-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>There is a simple principle that can be applied to all homes: if you don't do the chores, the place becomes like a pig pen. But, if you're wise, you can train the little pigs to do the chores. That is something that I have discovered recently. My four little piggies are starting to really help around the house. Now, when I refer to my children as piglets or piggies, it's not meant insultingly at all, though I am aware that in some cultures it may be so. The diminuitive form of the noun shows affection and endearment. However, if you call someone a big pig, or a big fat pig, that is completely different, and quite insulting. So, my little piggies are put to work every now and then. They only do what they are capable of, and actually not very much work. But, because there are four of them, their efforts add up to a substantial amount of help. My son Cass is big and strong, so I have him take out the garbage to the dumpster that is at the end of our driveway. My oldest son, Hudson, mows the lawn. My husband is thrilled about that. And you know, it's not a boring chore either. He gets to use the riding lawn mower, so he has fun driving around. The two little ones help to pick berries and vegetables from the garden, lay the table for dinner and clear it, and occasionally pick up their toys. Phew! It takes a lot of training on the part of the parents. In the past, people would have large families to help run a farm. Well, there are less farms now. We don't live on one, though my house resembles a farmyard sometimes. Anyway, the children are all proud of doing their chores, and my husband and I make sure to praise them for their work. I have a plan to introduce them to the laundry this Autumn. I will open the doors of the laundry room, and let them step in and experience the mystery. It's not my favorite thing to do, at all. So, if, little by little, the children can learn to sort the clothes into color piles, learn about the machine settings, and practice folding the clean clothes, the laundry can become a shared experienced. Now that would be nice! The trick is to develop a routine, so certain chores are done consistently. That's the hard part. Sometimes it seems that it's easier to do the work yourself, instead of supervising other people while they are doing the chores. Ah, but the benefits come later, don't they. I can see myself in the future, with my feet up, eating bonbons, and my medium sized piggies doing their chores, perhaps.</p>

			<title>All the tents in the backyard.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/all-the-tents-in-the-backyard-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>"We've got a bunch of poles missing," said my husband *in a huff, as he got in his car to go to a meeting. He had been looking in the storage area above our garage for tents, and all that goes with them. We needed the tents because nine boys had come over for a Summer party, and the expectation was, that they would camp out in the back yard. The weather&nbsp;was perfect for camping out, plus the thought of having an extra nine, *rowdy boys in my house at night, didn't appeal to me at all. So, camping it was. But you can't do any camping if you're missing any of the tent poles. Now, knowing that men aren't very good at finding things, (I know, that's a huge generalization, but *I'm sticking with it), I decided to go up to the storage room and look for the poles myself. The worst thing about our storage room, is that it isn't insulated, so this time of year it's boiling. We do have a couple of vents and a little fan, but when the temperature reaches over 100, they don't make much of a difference. When it isn't too hot, the storage room is an interesting place to poke around in. A few antiques, Christmas decorations, boxes of painting equipment, snow suits, jack-o-lanterns, memorabilia from trips, and piles of camping equipment fill the room. The missing poles were right where they should have been, next to the tents, not missing at all, you get my point. Well I was glad that I found them. While I was in the storage room, I decided to get all of the tents that we have accumulated *over the years, and set them up. Firstly, it would give me an opportunity to see which poles and pegs fit which tent, and secondly, the tents would get *aired out. I layed out each tent and its fly sheet on the lawn, counted out the pegs, and put the poles together. I layed the poles side by side to compare their lengths so I could avoid wasting time using poles that were either too long or too short. It took some time, but I was happy to do it by myself while the kids all played their noisy army game. When I finished, I looked at the tents and realised that I had erected them in a huddled group, like a little community. The kids would love that. There was ample room for everyone, plus the two dogs. It was about midnight when we went to bed. The dogs and the boys had piled into the biggest tent, and there were whispers, giggles, and flashes of torches here and there. The party had been a success, and everyone was exhausted. The next day, the friends stayed until about midday. Parents turned up here and there to pick up their boys, and slowly the group of kids got smaller and smaller. Everything was cleared away, and I took down the tents. And, do you know what? I found that we had extra poles....</p>

			<title>4000,000 boxes of cherries.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/4000-000-boxes-of-cherries-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I learned a few things this past weekend about the fruit industry. My husband has been involved in national and international export of fruit for over twenty years, and right now, he is *up to his neck in this season's fruit: the cherry. Washington state is one of the major cherry producers, and July and August are the two months for harvesting and shipping. We happened to be in a town called Brewster which is about an hour and a half north of Wenatchee. As you head north, the landscape becomes dryer, and fascinatingly *moon-like. You travel right along the Columbia river all the way up North. At either side of the river are high, dry hills, that continue off into the distance for miles. There are countless *gullies and tucked-away areas where wildlife live, such as coyotes, deer, and even big horn sheep. Down at the river's edge is a different story. Because of the available water, communities have sprung up, including many lush parks, and, of course, the orchards. Ironically, the dryness of the area and the heat suit many of the kinds of fruit that are grown. The water that they need is simply supplied through irrigation. So, you have a contrast between the dry, earthy, barren hills, and lush green areas all the way up the river. Brewster is a small town right on the Columbia that is in the heart of orchard country. My husband works with people who have hundreds of thousands of acres of orchards. And when it comes to cherries, there is a short window of opportunity to get them picked, packed, and shipped off. It is a very perishable fruit, and a lot of care and attention are required in bringing fruit to the customers that is in excellent condition. My visit to Brewster was actually not to visit orchards. The cherries had already been picked. There is a huge packing plant there, and that was our destination. As we approached the packing house, I could see that it was a busy season for them. The parking lot was full, and workers were coming and going, starting new shifts, and getting off of&nbsp; completed shifts. Hundreds of people are employed, in many different capacities. My children and I were all wide-eyed as we were shown around. We went into the cold storage room, where thousands of boxes that were already ready, were waiting to be shipped to supermarkets around the world. There were fork-lift trucks zooming forwards and backwards, busily stacking boxes up high. And then, we went to a sorting and packing line, where people sorted through a conveyor belt of cherries. They had to take out unwanted cherries, and let the others fill up various containers of different sizes. It was a fast job. There were also lines of clean water flowing past much of the machinery; a lot of washing takes place. As we left the plant, I noticed a man-made lake infront of the building. I was told that they are planning on recycling their water, and also using it for both the heating and cooling of&nbsp;water inside the plant. It's incredible to think that about four million boxes get packed in the region, this particular plant doing at least one million. To say that it is a remote area, there is a lot *more going on than meets the eye.</p>

			<title>Tyler Farrar from Wenatchee.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/tyler-farrar-and-the-tour-de-france-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who are following the Tour de France, you will recognize the name Tyler Farrar. He is from the town where I live, Wenatchee. The fact that he is not only in the Tour, but also doing well, has really created a buzz of excitement here. The local newspaper, The Wenatchee World, has a daily spot about the race so we can all keep up to date with how Tyler is doing. What we are holding our breath for, is the sprint into Paris. He will be against Mark Cavendish, the English missile, and other sprinters such as Thor Hushov and Alessandro Petacchi. My husband and I are amazingly addicted to the tour; we have it taped, and so, in the evenings, that's what we watch. Sorry kids, no cartoons. Tyler's father lives and works in Wenatchee; he is a surgeon, and is often seen biking in the local parks. Tyler must have been an unusual child for this area of the States. Most boys become deeply involved in baseball, basketball, or football. Now, soccer and hockey are also popular. However, Tyler started competitive biking when he was only thirteen years old. His father said that from then on, he knew that cycling was what he wanted to do. He is still young, only twenty-seven, so he has many years of cycling ahead of him. As far as his training is concerned, he lives in Ghent, in Belgium. His upbringing here in Wenatchee served him well for building strength and stamina for cycling. There are many, ideal roads for cycling in the hills here, as well as trails for mountain biking. I suppose the four very distinct seasons that we have here can also prepare a cyclist for hot and cold extremes while biking. Now that he lives in Ghent, however, he has all-year-long cycling because the climate is much milder, with less extremes. Being a sprinter means that he has explosive power towards the end of the race. He, like the other sprinters,&nbsp;tends to stay anywhere in the peloton until the end, when he makes his way to the front, and suddenly speeds towards the finish line. He has already won a stage in the Tour de France, and also in the Vuelta a Espana, and the Giro d'Italia, and others in less known races, so he has plenty of experience. So, when we spot him in the peloton, on the television screen, we get excited and hope to see a successful performance. Even though Mark Cavendish is one of my favorite cyclists, if Tyler beats him and wins the grand, final stage of the race, Wenatchee should commemorate his achievement with a statue in his honor.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>*It's no secret that boys of a certain age like guns, even if they are *make-believe. I remember that before my boys ever had any plastic weapons, they would use other toys, or even sticks, and pretend that they were guns. Perhaps they were influenced by something that they had seen on television, or maybe in a book. Who knows? Even at snack time, they would hold up their carrots at eachother and pretend to shoot. Well, now that my boys are older, we have found a happy medium between play and reality. Air soft. These guns are fashioned to look exactly like the real thing, but often smaller in size. And what they shoot is harmless: bb's. These are small, plastic balls that come in various colors. We have white, orange, and fluorescent yellow ones. The boys *take their weapons quite seriously. They have already had a proper air soft battle with friends up in the forest where they camped out for the night. It was supervised, of course, by parents. Eye protection is a must, and nobody is allowed to play unless their eyes are covered. The extent to which you cover yourself in clothing is up to you. Some people don't want to risk getting hit with a bb because it stings a little. As long as you wear long sleeves, long pants, and cover your face and neck, you are completely sting-free. Airsoft is the sort of hobby that grows on you. Some adults are devoted to it. You-tube is full of video clips about the air soft weapons, and battles among friends in lots of different countries. When my two sons had their air soft camp-out, they came back with stories of all the cool stuff that people had. There are heavy duty combat suits that you can use that not only completely cover you, but also are camouflaged. Some of the air soft guns are CO2 powered (carbon dioxide), so the bb'ss fly hard and fast at their target. What's really fun, is having a make-believe battle in our back garden as the sun is going down. We use the glow-in-the-dark bb's, so&nbsp;we can see when someone is&nbsp;shooting at us, and duck. Our kids absolutely love it; it's intense and exciting. The only trouble is, there are bb's everywhere. If you pick any room in my house, even after it's been cleaned, you will find bb's somewhere. Even the driveway has bright yellow bb's glowing against the black asphalt, and from underneath bushes and plants.&nbsp;Those little plastic balls started out in a factory in China, made their way by boat to the U.S., were transported by train to Washington, and then&nbsp;by truck to our local store. And now, those tiny things will be turning up for months in my house and entryway.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Oh, I haven't been getting much sleep recently. It seems as though* the whole world is noisy. It's summer, and every living thing is feeling fully alive, and therefore, making lots of noise. I often have to put our two dogs in the garage in the early hours of the morning because they have a barking fit* at who knows what*. There are racoon families in our neighborhood. At night they scurry* around, looking for food in the garbage cans. They need to feed their babies, so they are busy. And, of course, when the dogs pick up their scent in the air, it's barking time. Also, the birds are busy feeding their chicks. We have a bird house next to&nbsp; our deck, in our back yard, with three chicks in it. Very early in the morning you'll hear the chirp, chirp, peep, peep. It's adorable, even if it is at five in the morning. My children have asked me if we can feed them, but of course I told them "no", because who knows what they would give them to eat when I'm not looking..... I would probably find remnants of Oreo cookies in the nest, and some very sick birds. A couple of other birds have nested in our garden recently which I call my angels. They are wood pigeons; over here they call them doves. They make a very soothing ooo-ooo-ooo sound. When I was growing up in the English countryside, that's a sound that I heard all the time. It takes me back to my childhood, and makes me feel very comfortable. I decided to take a photo of the nearest nest the other day. It's higher up than my head, so I can't see into it without standing on something. So,&nbsp;I took the chance of just lifting the camera over my head, clicking, and hoping to get a good shot. It worked. I had obviously made enough noise to disturb the chicks, and, not being able to see whether I was their parent or not, they leaned towards the opening of the birdhouse, and opened their mouths. It's amazing to think that in a few short weeks, these totally vulnerable babies will be flying around, catching insects. There will be a lot less chirping, and a lot more flying.</p>

			<title>Preparation for a barbecue.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/preparation-for-a-barbecue-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparations for a barbecue.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">One of the things I like most about Summer is barbecuing. As a person who cooks all the time, it's so nice to have a break from the kitchen, and to do some rapid, easy clean-up cooking on the barby. Over here, it's often the men who are in charge of barbecuing the meat; it's like a tradition. However, because of its convenience, I take over often, and get everything prepared before anyone else turns up. The other day, when I went grocery shopping, I stocked up* on sauces that I can use for marinading different meats and fish to keep my barbecues interesting. I bought an Asian ginger sauce, a Teriaki, a smoky barbecue sauce, and an Indian marinade. That should keep meals interesting for a while. I also bought a packet of wooden skewers onto which I can put all sorts of vegetables. So, now I'm prepared, with a fridge full of meat and vegetables, and also the freezer. &ldquo;What's for dinner?&rdquo; no longer has to be an annoying question.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[&nbsp;Preparations for a barbecue.

One of the things I like most about Summer is barbecuing. As a person who cooks all the time, it's so nice to have a break from the kitchen, and to do some rapid, easy clean-up cooking on the barby. Over here, it's often the men who are in charge of barbecuing the meat; it's like a tradition. However, because of its convenience, I take over often, and get everything prepared before anyone else turns up. The other day, when I went grocery shopping, I stocked up* on sauces that I can use for marinading different meats and fish to keep my barbecues interesting. I bought an Asian ginger sauce, a Teriaki, a smoky barbecue sauce, and an Indian marinade. That should keep meals interesting for a while. I also bought a packet of wooden skewers onto which I can put all sorts of vegetables. So, now I'm prepared, with a fridge full of meat and vegetables, and also the freezer. &ldquo;What's for dinner?&rdquo; no longer has to be an annoying question. Part of getting prepared is making sure that there is enough propane in the gas canister. If that is empty, then dinner is not going to happen. So, I took a trip to the local DIY store (which is short for do-it-yourself). In its gardening department, it has an area that is reserved for propane. And, what makes it interesting is that you serve yourself. First, there is a machine which accepts your credit card for payment. You swipe* your card, as you do in shops nowadays. Then, an automated* voice talks to you, giving you instructions on how to retrieve your propane. From a large set of cages, one of them opens automatically, and the voice says, &ldquo;Place your empty canister in cage number 23.&rdquo; So, you follow directions. Then, once you shut the cage door, the voice says, &ldquo;Retrieve your new canister from cage number 42,&rdquo; and so you do. And there you have it, an easy, human-free transaction. I felt a little strange photographing the cages afterwards, as if the automated machine would suddenly say to me, &ldquo;Hey, what do you think you're doing, lady?&rdquo; So I took the picture, took my propane, and left quickly.

			<title>A Morning Routine.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-morning-routine-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A routine is a habit, often one that gives us comfort, or some sort of benefit. We say in English that we are 'creatures of habit'. Humans like to have a routine, a familiar way of living. I've noticed that even my children have developed their own routines: how they dress and take care of themselves, what they like to eat and when, and even how they play. A routine that I have in the morning that makes a positive impact on my day, is my coffee routine. A few years ago, my husband and I decided that it was time to get a decent coffee maker: an espresso machine. Espresso, and the whole mediterranean style cafes that are enjoyed so much here, have only really taken off over the past fifteen to twenty years. When I first came over here, Starbucks was very new indeed. They were the first company that brought the laid back, sit and have a coffee, culture to the states. And now there are many other such companies. So, when we decided to buy an espresso machine, Starbucks was the obvious choice for us. If you've ever been in a Starbucks, you'll find that they don't just serve espresso. They have a huge variety of coffee, tea, and juice drinks, as well as pastries, and some savory food. Also, they sell coffee by the pound, either ground or whole bean. And then, you'll also find shelves of cups, tea and coffee pots, and espresso machines. So, Starbucks seemed to be the obvious choice when it came to buying our espresso machine. We ended up with one called a Barista, which is medium sized, and perfect for two people to use. It has a spout which can be used to heat and froth-up the milk, and of course the coffee brewing section. Using an espresso machine was not new to me. I had worked at an espresso stand for a year when I first go married. Before that, I worked in a restaurant in Leicester Square, London, where we had a huge, Italian, copper espresso machine. It could make several drinks at once. It was so&nbsp;big and gorgeous, that we would polish it every day to make it really shine. When it comes to my coffee routine, it's quite simple really. I turn it on, add fresh water, and flush out some of the day-old water. While it is heating up, I put about a tablespoon full of ground espresso into what is called the coffee basket. This is the metal cup with holes in it that is part of the arm that attaches to the machine. When the light comes on that indicates available hot water, I press the 'brew' button, and the hot water flows through the coffee and the filter, and out into the shot glass. It's hot, fresh, and frothy. When it comes to the milk, I cheat a little. I don't bother heating and frothing it in the traditional way. I just warm up some soy milk in the microwave while I'm making the espresso. I add the coffee to the milk, and that's it. Perfect! It's the best part of my breakfast.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes.</span></p>
<p>Related vocabulary: froth, filter, impact, the obvious choice.</p>
<p>1. I like my latte as plain as possible: milk, espresso, no flavoring, no froth.</p>
<p>2. The irrigation system needs a filter so seeds and organic matter don't clog up the pipes.</p>
<p>3. The chemical factory hasn't had any impact on our environment because they have strict safety laws.</p>
<p>4. A German chocolate cake was the obvious choice for the anniversary party; everbody likes it, and it is the baker's specialty.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Watermelon eating competition.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/watermelon-eating-competition-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you enjoying your Summer? It is in full swing now. The clothes shops are full of swimming suits, bikinis, and&nbsp;barbecue equipment. Flowers are out, and most families find a swimming pool to enjoy. There were end of year celebrations for schools, held in parks around the area. We went to the end of year barbecue for the alternative school that two of my sons have been going to for about six months. It took place in a well manicured park that is next to our nearest dam, Rocky Reach Dam. There are covered seating areas with sinks, tables, and chairs, for picnickers. There is also a large playing area for younger children, to keep them occupied. Each family was asked to bring a plate or two of food to share, and if possible, watermelon. It was hot when we got there, and there were already lots of young people running around in swimming suits, having water fights. The atmosphere was generally laid back, with most people eventually sitting on the grass in groups, eating, and chatting. When most of the food had been eaten, a whistle was blown, and there was a call for all participants of the watermelon eating competition to sit down and get ready. Several ladies had been busily slicing up the melons for quite a while. They piled all of the slices and pieces into plates, and servers gave each of the children a slice. The rule was, nobody could use hands; they had to be behind your back. Three, two, one, and off they went, *chomping away on the juicy stuff. As soon as a person finished one slice, he would call for another, and keep score of how many he had eaten. It was the only time in the get-together that it was actually quiet! And then, when all the watermelon was gone, there was a quick *tally of those who had eated the most. And the prize? A watermelon! No, I'm only kidding. I don't actually know what the prize was, but it must have been something good, because the winner and both *runners up were very excited about it. As you can imagine, there was a huge, sticky mess to clean up afterwards. Luckily, with concrete floors, you can just hose the place with water. When we finally left, the kids were *worn out. It had been an exciting day, and a hot one too. I could hear people saying goodbye as we pulled out of the parking lot. Some of the kids won't see eachother for a while because they will be travelling. They'll be excited to see eachother in September, and have stories of the Summer to share.</p>

			<title>Summer Camps Are Here.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/summer-camps-are-here-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the first week of Summer vacation. The first couple of days seemed a bit unreal; my two youngest kept on asking if they had school the next day. "Nope," I would reply,"it's the Summer, remember?" Thankfully, we are getting used to a slower pace. I don't have to drive as much, which is a relief. There are a few things that I have arranged for the children this Summer to keep them occupied and learning new things. My first and third sons have been attending a basketball Summer camp. It is only for three days, and is taught by seasoned coaches. It is held in the High School, which is exciting for them, because that is where the 'big boys' go. It's a place they don't go to very much, so there is a certain appeal about it. The turn out for the camp has been quite substantial. The morning session, for the younger kids, has about thirty five all together. They turn up at eight thirty, and finish at noon. Then it's home, lunch, and dropping off Hudson for his four and&nbsp;a half hours. The afternoon session has even more participants. There are High School students helping the coaches, and giving demonstrations, so the little ones can get a clear idea of what they need to do. The aim is to teach fundamentals in a fun, mixed age environment. My children know some of the kids there from school, and from having played with them on basketball teams. It's a good opportunity to 'mix it up' as they say here. That means, to mix with people of different ages and abilities, and to do something that is either interesting, or that stretches you. The verb 'to stretch' is used to mean that the people involved have to grow, or learn, apply effort, and improve. It's a good visual image for what it means. The last day of the Summer camp is today; they will be finishing their time together with an awards ceremony. They'll be given some sort of momento so they remember the camp, and hopefully what they have learned. In a couple of weeks, my children will be going to other camps in the mornings. There is a mathematics camp planned for the older boys, and cooking and art for the youngest. What with the camps, swimming, a <em>little</em> bit of school work at home, and lots of play dates, the Summer will probably fly by.</p>

			<title>A Project of Renovation.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-project-of-renovation-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have an excuse for not updating my podcast for a few days, honestly....I dove into a renovation project in my house. It's something that I have wanted to do for a long time, but something always seems to come up*, so the project gets put off. The powder room on the first floor of the house has had a face-lift. It was a sweet, little, room, but really quite out of date. Getting involved in this kind of project is tempting, but also dangerous. What you plan on taking a few days to do, can easily spread out to a week or two. And, wouldn't you know, that once I bought the paint, and made a mental note of my great plan, I suddenly needed to do other things. My daughter had to go to the hospital for an exploratory examination. Thankfully, that turned out fine, but it took the best part of the day, and all of my energy. Then, the car had to be taken in to be looked at because its front end has been making a sort of whining, yawning noise. So, that&nbsp;was another two hours spent in a waiting room. And with dropping kids off, picking them up, taking them to practices, meals, laundry etc etc, it began to seem as if I would never get my project even started, let alone* finished. But, Tuesday's are my glory days: all the kids are at school. So, I did as much as I could this Tuesday. I tore off the wallpaper, turned off the water and took out the sink. I peeled off the old counter top. I turned off the main electric breaker to the house, and took off the light. And finally, I took off the wooden trim from around the door. Then, when I finished all of that, I realized how much my back ached. So, a cup of tea to the rescue; that soothes most aches and pains. Then I stood back and planned the painting part of it. I had chosen a cappuccino color for the walls, but they had to be prepped first. That is short for prepared. I had to buy and apply a couple of cans of stuff called 'spackle' which, when you spray it on the walls, creates an orange peel texture which helps to disguise imperfections. This was very strong smelling, so I would hold my breath, spray for a minute or so, and then run outside and breathe. Phew! I was glad when that part was over. Then, I painted three coats on the walls, sanded the vanity*, and painted it with four coats of black paint. Finally, the hardest part is over. I am very pleased with the result. My husband has to help me put on the new, one piece&nbsp;counter top and sink, as it weighs 97 lbs. Then, we will choose a light fixture, and that should be about it*. Well done Anna. The update to the house was a pleasant, creative diversion.</p>
<p>Grammar notes.</p>
<p>Expressions: something comes up, that's it, the vanity, let alone.</p>
<p>1. When I'm busy, something else always seems to come up.</p>
<p>OR "I know your dog has been missing for a few days, but don't worry. I'm sure something will come up."</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[I have an excuse for not updating my podcast for a few days, honestly....I dove into a renovation project in my house. It's something that I have wanted to do for a long time, but something always seems to come up*, so the project gets put off. The powder room on the first floor of the house has had a face-lift. It was a sweet, little, room, but really quite out of date. Getting involved in this kind of project is tempting, but also dangerous. What you plan on taking a few days to do, can easily spread out to a week or two. And, wouldn't you know, that once I bought the paint, and made a mental note of my great plan, I suddenly needed to do other things. My daughter had to go to the hospital for an exploratory examination. Thankfully, that turned out fine, but it took the best part of the day, and all of my energy. Then, the car had to be taken in to be looked at because its front end has been making a sort of whining, yawning noise. So, that&nbsp;was another two hours spent in a waiting room. And with dropping kids off, picking them up, taking them to practices, meals, laundry etc etc, it began to seem as if I would never get my project even started, let alone* finished. But, Tuesday's are my glory days: all the kids are at school. So, I did as much as I could this Tuesday. I tore off the wallpaper, turned off the water and took out the sink. I peeled off the old counter top. I turned off the main electric breaker to the house, and took off the light. And finally, I took off the wooden trim from around the door. Then, when I finished all of that, I realized how much my back ached. So, a cup of tea to the rescue; that soothes most aches and pains. Then I stood back and planned the painting part of it. I had chosen a cappuccino color for the walls, but they had to be prepped first. That is short for prepared. I had to buy and apply a couple of cans of stuff called 'spackle' which, when you spray it on the walls, creates an orange peel texture which helps to disguise imperfections. This was very strong smelling, so I would hold my breath, spray for a minute or so, and then run outside and breathe. Phew! I was glad when that part was over. Then, I painted three coats on the walls, sanded the vanity*, and painted it with four coats of black paint. Finally, the hardest part is over. I am very pleased with the result. My husband has to help me put on the new, one piece&nbsp;counter top and sink, as it weighs 97 lbs. Then, we will choose a light fixture, and that should be about it*. Well done Anna. The update to the house was a pleasant, creative diversion.
Grammar notes.
Expressions: something comes up, that's it, the vanity, let alone.
1. When I'm busy, something else always seems to come up.
OR "I know your dog has been missing for a few days, but don't worry. I'm sure something will come up."
2. All you have to do to the cake is put the frosting on, the candles, and the sprinkles; and that's it!
3. I don't know why they call the vanity by its name. Perhaps it's because often people will look in the mirror while they wash their hands, and that might be considered vain.
4. I'm sure the hotel will be very expensive, what with room service, parking the car, and let alone the price of the room.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I bet if you have downloaded this podcast, you are wondering what on earth&nbsp;it&nbsp;is about. I know, the title is curious. Well, let me tell you. I'm in the city of Yakima at the moment, writing for you from a lounge chair, next to a pool, at the Oxford Inn hotel. It is situated right next to the river, in a lovely tree-lined area, quite close to the baseball park. And that is why we're here. Yes, you've heard about our involvement in this sport before. This summer, we have weekend tournaments just about every other week, and most are out of town. So, right now, we're relaxing after a long morning of driving here, and then sitting through two games. Our team, called the River Cats, actually won both games. We have more games tomorrow, and then drive home. In between games, I walked around the nearby area with my children, and took them to a play area of the Kiwanis park. Over a little shady hill, we discovered a large skateboarding park. Boys and young men were busily whooshing by on their skateboards, making jumps and turns, and doing all sorts of acrobatics. Unfortunately, my camera's battery was completely flat, so I had to use my phone to take photos. You could definitely see a hierarchy of talent out there. The most talented was an older boy who had obviously skated for years. He and I chatted for a while. It turns out that he has backpacked around England, and builds muscle cars. Who knew? You never know who you'll meet unless you start a conversation....Anyway, as I was taking photos, a boy called Eloy came up to me and asked if I would take his photo. "Of course," I said. He excitedly chose a few routes to show off his talents, and I snapped away. After a while, I realised that the next baseball game was about to start, so we would have to leave. I asked Eloy which school he goes to, and I also wrote down acupofenglish.com on a piece of paper, "Give this to your English teacher, and you will see yourself on my blog," I told him. I hope he has a chance to read this blog, and see his photo. These talented young people need to be celebrated.</p>
<p>Grammar notes.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: involvement, to make/ do a jump/ turn, hierarchy.</p>
<p>1. His involvement in the project was unexpected but useful; he really helped us.</p>
<p>2. The skateboard champion made lots of jumps and turns, and impressed the crowd.</p>
<p>3. The hierarchy of power in the government is seen in the different responsibilities that each has.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Stetson Hats.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/stetson-hats-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I know a few people who have Stetsons. Infact, when my brother was visiting a few months ago, he bought himself a couple. They are good quality, and last for a long time. Where he lives is very sunny, so they are a charming, and unusual way to get shade in New Zealand. Stetson is an icon of American society. It's typically American, like baseball, and Elvis Presley. Close to the end of the 19th century, the Stetson Hat Company was the&nbsp;biggest in the world, producing over three million hats a year. Even in our little, downtown museum, we have a glass case that is dedicated to the Stetson company. I had no idea that women's hats were also made. John B. Stetson started his company in 1865. Initially, only men's hats were made. It wasn't until the 1930's that ladies hats were also made. The company is based in Garland, Texas, and is now one of the largest in the country. This success story is said to have started when John Stetson went to Colorado to prospect for gold. While he was there, the story goes, he made a hat out of the untreated leather taken from furs that he had collected on his journey. Because his father was a hatter, he had experience with materials and design. He wanted to show off what he could do to his friends. The resulting hat was soft, and protected him from the elements. What started out as a joke, proved to be the first stepping stone to a business. This hat had a wide brim, a large crown (or head piece), and could even be used to carry water. Apparently, later on, John's group met a cowboy who paid him five dollars in gold for the hat. It was this experience that encouraged him to create his signature hat, 'The Boss of the Plains'. He replicated the fashionable hats, but when he launched his own design, it was then that he became successful. The original company was sold in the 1970's to another company, but it, to this day, retains the Stetson logo for those particular hats. I have noticed around town, that some men, especially of Hispanic origin, or older caucasian men, will wear a Stetson for an elegant occasion. When it's time to dress up, the Stetson hat comes out of its box, to put the finishing touches in a formal situation.</p>

			<title>The First Transpacific Flight.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/the-first-transpacific-flight-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Clyde Edward Pangborn, a stunt pilot, and flight instructor during the First World War, arrived in Wenatchee on October 5th, 1931, after 41 hours and 15 minutes of flighing. He and his partner, Hugh Herndon Jr., had just made a historic flight from Shabishiro, Japan, the first time the pacific had been flown across. What's exciting about that historical trip, is that they completed it in Wenatchee. They had been scheduled to land in Seattle, but couldn't do so because of bad weather. I had heard about this flight a long time ago when I first came here, but I didn't really think much about it until I went to the museum the other day. There was a free day for the public on Friday, so I took my children and another friend to explore. The children ran around like rats, going into all of the different rooms, the art display, the electric miniature railway room, and a real apple sorter from the last century. I followed them into the room that was dedicated to the transpacific flight, and read them a few of the details that were written on the walls. The plane that they used was called the Miss Veedol. There is a model of it hanging from the ceiling. There are also maps, signatures, and details about the lives of both pilots. I was amazed to find out that before leaving Shabishiro, they were both imprisoned, and nearly lost their maps. Then, when they actually took off, the landing gear of the plane (the wheels) were supposed to fall off to decrease the weight that they would carry. Well, they didn't. So what did they do? Pangborn got out of the plane, and at 14,000 feet, got onto a wing, barefoot, and detatched the landing gear himself. What a brave man! Being a stunt pilot, he was used to taking risks, so he was the right man for the job. I can't even imagine climbing out onto one of the wings while the plane is in flight. That's crazy! But they did it, and they managed to land in Wenatchee safely almost two days later. An airport was built later on in Wenatchee at the place where they landed; it's called Pangborn airport. It's very much celebrated here in Wenatchee; there is even a sister-city connection in Japan. Most years during the Apple Blossom Festival, representatives from Japan ride in the parade. It's great to think that, even though Wenatchee seems far away from most places, there is a historic international connection that keeps this place on the map.</p>
<p>Grammar notes.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: to detatch, celebrated (as an adjective), to be on the map.</p>
<p>1. You have to detatch the safety brake before the remote control car will work.</p>
<p>2. He is a very celebrated artist; his work is on display in the National Gallery.</p>
<p>3. That amusement park really put this town on the map.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Squirt Guns.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/water-jets-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have noticed recently in the shops, a new season of toys on the shelves. When I say a season of toys, what I mean is a new set of toys for this warmer season. The Summer toys are here, and they have a very outdoorsy and watery theme. As you browse the aisles, you will find goggles and snorkeling gear, noodles which are made of styrofoam (also for swimming), buckets, spades, parasols, and slip 'n' slides. Let me explain what some of these are. A noodle is a piece of cheap styrofoam that looks like a giant noodle, but is usually a bright, primary color. It is perfect for hanging on to, or wrapping around oneself. You can even bash a friend on the head with it, without hurting anyone at all. It's a floatation device, of sorts. A slip 'n' slide, on the other hand, is a very long, and wide, sheet of plastic that sometimes has perforated hoses running down its length. The hoses wet the sheet, and you and your friends run as fast as you can, and jump stomach first onto the plastic sheet. You then slip and slide all the way to the end. Now, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the simple sheets that you have to wet yourselves, to the cave-like slip 'n' slides that have inflatable sides, moving hoses, door flaps, and other features that increase the fun, and the speed at which you slide. One other Summer toy that kids love is the squirt gun. And you know that there are many different kinds. This past weekend, during the baseball tournament that we went to, there was a birthday party for one of the players. Squirt guns were some of his presents; and there was a swimming pool in the hotel. Well, it was like a war scene in the pool. We parents, sitting at the side to supervise and keep our kids safe, were sitting ducks. That means that we were prime targets. Even giving our children serious looks didn't make any diffference. The coach even got a good squirt right at his head. Boys with squirt guns just have to be left to squirt until they are tired. They had a blast, and made new friends, and I'm sure some new enemies. The streams of water were hitting people in the side of the head, on the chest, and in the ears. You couldn't help but laugh. It's a good job that we don't have a pool; I don't fancy being a sitting duck again any time soon.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Yard of Bubblegum.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We had an interesting weekend this past Memorial Day weekend. We went to the town of Monroe which is on the outskirts of Seattle. My son had a baseball tournament. It would have lasted for three days if they had won on both Saturday and Sunday. However, they didn't do so well on Sunday, so we were free to leave. There is a saying in England, 'A change is as good as a rest,' which I think applied to our weekend. We don't often get out of Wenatchee, and although Seattle is only three hours away, it is a totally different environment. The climate is much wetter, so the whole place is green, with trees everywhere. Being from England, it makes me feel quite at home. And it is obviously more populated than our small rural town, so there is a lot more to do. After the last baseball game, we headed into town to have lunch and do some shopping. There is a place that I always try and visit whenever I'm in Seattle. It's called World Plus Imports. The name gives away the theme of the store. It is a very colorful international shop, that has everything from food, to jewelery, to furniture. It's one place where none of my children get bored, so I have enough time to really look at everything. There are also English products that I cannot get in Wenatchee. So, I load up on them whenever I'm there: English style baked beans (the ones over here are really sugary), Digestive biscuits, and Maltesers. Some of you who have been to England, might have tried these. I told my kids, who were scampering everywhere like mice, that they could each choose something. Within a few seconds, one of them was waving a huge, plastic tube of bubblegum in my face, &ldquo;Can I have this, Mum?&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; was my very plain but to the point answer. It was a whole yard of bubblegum. We're talking about three feet. They would never stop chewing if we had bought that! And, I'm sure, the dentist would have plenty to say at their next checkup. What will they think of next?</p>

Grammar notes.

Practice of 'would have', 'could have', and 'should have'.



We could have saved time if we had taken the short cut.


I would have called you if I had known that you were in town.


They should have been here by now; I hope nothing has happened.


I couldn't have driven my car yesterday even if I had wanted to; I dropped my keys down the drain!

			<title>Thanks for the million downloads.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/thanks-for-the-million-downloads-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a very special podcast because I have some thanking to do. Every now and then, I check on the statistics of my podcast, and yesterday I saw that I have had more than a million downloads all together. Thank you, to all of you who have listened to my short ramblings for the past two and a half years. I suppose one million downloads isn't really that much when it comes to the internet, but for me, it's a rare number, and one that I am very excited about. Now, I can tell my friends and family, "Hey, my podcast has been downloaded more than a million times!" It's a great way to show off. A million isn't really a number that I hear very much, apart from the occasional expression. 'One in a million' is a common expression which means something or someone very special. 'A million to one' is obviously a very low chance of something happening. For example, 'The chance of me getting that job is a&nbsp;million to one.' However, there has been a lot of talk recently using the word 'million' because someone in our little town won a million dollars a few days ago. I'll go into the details in another podcast, because it is a story worth telling. But I will tell you that it is a deserving family of seven, both parents are teachers, and three of the five children were adopted. It's the type of story that makes you glad, because they are the kind of people who seem to deserve something special. Anyway, I'm just glad that some of you are still listening to what I have to say, and putting up with my imperfections. I must tell you that what I enjoy more than anything about podcasting, is receiving emails from you, and getting to know you a little. It's like traveling without leaving home. So, I send you all a sincere thanky ou from Wenatchee, and look forward to the next million.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>You can really feel that Summer is on its way. Everyone is coming out of the woodwork. People are actually walking on the streets. You don't often see that; it's usually empty sidewalks and everyone in cars. But now, there is plenty of reason to walk. The air just feels soooo good, and the sun is not yet too hot. As I was driving home the other day, I saw two very sporty men on bicycles. Now, there happen to be a lot of cyclists in this area. It's a cycling paradise actually, because of the nearby hills and trails. But, these men were different. You could tell that they weren't cycling for pleasure. They were policemen. And they were cycling up my road! I felt sorry for them actually; our road is very steep. By the time they got to the top, they would have been exhausted. They looked as if they were in really good shape, not the typical, overweight, doughnut eating policemen in patrol cars. If you love cycling, it would be an ideal job. You'd get paid for riding your bike all day. And I doubt that they have to deal with many hardened criminals. First of all, they wouldn't get very far if they had to chase anyone in a car. And secondly, in a hot, hilly town that doesn't have many people on the streets, who would they arrest anyway? Perhaps they are showing a friendlier, healthier type of policeman to the community. They would be handy in places where people gather, like baseball parks, and community events that are outside. I suppose they could even race through a mall on their bikes, or a huge store like Walmart. Now, that would be useful because a lot of shoplifting goes on in those kinds of places. Seeing policemen on bikes, certainly changes their general image, and though they look friendly, remember that they are armed and dangerous.</p>

			<title>The Instrument Zoo.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/the-instrument-zoo-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's not very often that you get the opportunity to try out many kinds of instruments. Have you ever blown a bassoon? Have you ever strummed an electric guitar, or tried a set of drums? We had the chance to do that on Saturday. The Woodshouse Conservatory of Music was holding what they called&nbsp;an&nbsp;'Instrument Zoo' for the public to come and enjoy. When we walked into the entryway, we were greeted by a face painter (for the kids) and we were given a map showing us which instruments were in which rooms. On the main floor, we walked into the room which is normally used as an office. A young man was there with a clarinet. Cool! My sister used to play one when she was little. I love its cool tones. He played a great piece from Pirates of the Caribbean. We are movie soundtrack buffs in our household, and that is a soundtrack that we are very familiar with. He caught our attention immediately. "Do you want a turn?" he asked. Of course I did, but I wanted to let my kids try it first. They all looked shy, and I could tell what they were thinking, "He's just had that in his mouth; do I have to put it in my mouth?" I thought the same, so I asked if he could clean the mouthpiece. He graciously did more than that; he put a new reed in it for me. Anyway, after my obsessive compulsive disorder was satisfied, we all had a go and loved it. Next, we moved onto the bass saxophone. It's huge. Infact, it's about the same size as my daughter, who did her best to blow it, but couldn't. Upstairs to the second floor we went, following the map, hearing all sorts of lovely sounds coming from the rooms, and walking past signs that said, 'Don't feed the animals.' Yes, very funny. In the next room, something very special happened. The oboe teacher, seeing us walk in, played a track from Star Wars. The mouths of all my kids dropped open. This was the 'bomb' as they say here, which is slang for the very best. The boys lined up to have a turn, germs or no germs they didn't care. But believe me, it's hard to blow. That beautiful, haunting sound of the oboe requires a lot of breath! Suddenly, another lady walked in carrying a very long instrument, a bassoon. She gave us a demonstration of what it can do by playing some Mozart. Again, we all had a go, mixing and spreading germs, which now makes me cringe, but at the time seemed to be&nbsp;irrelevant. We finished off our tour with the electric guitar and the drums. Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones were played by the guitar teachers, and my children just strummed one or two notes to accompany. What a great experience. When would you normally have that kind of an opportunity? Not very often, I think.</p>

			<title>Who invented the Garp?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/who-invented-the-garp-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Like many good things, the Garp started out as an idea. A boy had been told by his Science teacher to make an instrument involving specific measurements and the number eight. Well, the idea moved around in the mind of the boy for a few days, changing its shape a little, becoming more real and more possible each day. A day before he had to produce the instrument, and show it to his teacher, the boy set to work. He sneaked into his father's workshop and looked around. Gosh, look at all those tools. "I can surely create something wonderful here," he thought. First, he picked out a piece of wood from the many that were there. He put it in the vice, and tightened it. Then, he very carefully marked in pencil the measurements that his Science teacher had given him. Then came the screws. He screwed them in at each point where he had marked the measurements. Finally, he chose eight elastic bands, stretched and looped each one around two screws, creating a stringed instrument. "Yes," he thought, "this looks good." But, when he plucked the elastic bands, there was hardly any sound. Even the most stretched band didn't make much of a noise. He scratched his head. "This wasn't supposed to happen," he thought. He paced up and down the room for a few minutes, going over the steps he had taken, wondering what had gone wrong. He sat down with a sigh. Then, he started to think about stringed instruments that he had seen: guitar, cello, harp, violin. "Ah-ha!" a light bulb went on in his head. All of those instruments have a hollow; the strings are not right up against the wood. Perhaps a hollow will help to create a sound. He considered other materials that were lying around that he could use for a stringed instrument. He came up with a cardboard box from the recycling bin. He removed one side, making it into a triangle. Taped it all together, made the measurements, cut little notches at each measurement, and put the elastic bands in each notch. Surely, this would work.....He ran his fingers along the line of elastic bands, and to his delight heard a 'drrriiing!' Yes, he had found a hollow big enough to make it all work. Happily, to complete his creation, he spray painted it gold. He admired it for a while. "It's like a cross between a guitar and a harp. I'll call it, The Garp." So, that is how it came to be, and that is how he got an 'A' in his Science class.</p>

Then, he started to think about stringed instruments that he had seen: guitar, cello, harp, violin. "Ah-ha!" a light bulb went on in his head. All of those instruments have a hollow; the strings are not right up against the wood. Perhaps a hollow will help to create a sound. He considered other materials that were lying around that he could use for a stringed instrument. He came up with a cardboard box from the recycling bin. He removed one side, making it into a triangle. Taped it all together, made the measurements, cut little notches at each measurement, and put the elastic bands in each notch. Surely, this would work.....He ran his fingers along the line of elastic bands, and to his delight heard a 'drrriiing!' Yes, he had found a hollow big enough to make it all work. Happily, to complete his creation, he spray painted it gold. He admired it for a while. "It's like a cross between a guitar and a harp. I'll call it, The Garp." So, that is how it came to be, and that is how he got an 'A' in his Science class.

			<title>A Food Drive?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-food-drive-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>What does a food drive mean? It's nothing to do with driving a car, that's for sure. You could also have a clothes drive, or a drive of something else. It is a call for donations, to put it simply. I received a plastic bag in the mail, placed there by the local postman himself. He, and many others like him, do a yearly food drive to help hungry people in our community. Everybody gets their mail, so everybody will have received the same bag. All the information that you need is written right there on the bag. It tells you what the drive is for, and that the National Association of Letter Carriers and the local Food Bank are working together to collect for the poor. 'Stamp out hunger', it says. To stamp out something is when you finish it, or do away with it completely. You will probably have heard the expression in other contexts such as: 'stamp out violence', 'stamp out bullying', 'stamp out racism'. To stamp out gives you a good visual for the meaning of the expression. I think that this particular food drive was well organized, in that, the information comes straight to everyone's home, in a bag that will be used to carry the food to the mail boxes, where, the next day, the mail man will pick them up. Very smart. If it is easy for everyone, then it is likely to succeed. The only requirement for the donators was that the food be 'non-perishable', which means nothing that can go bad easily. Canned foods, dry food like rice, pasta, dry milk, or dry soups, and boxed food are just those kinds of non-perishables. So, you simply pop whatever appropriate food you have in the bag, take it out to your mail box, and leave it there. The plastic bag will protect the food if it rains, and the postmen or mail men will take it from there. Somehow, there always seems to be something that you can give. A community effort to stamp out hunger. What a good idea!</p>

			<title>An up-to-date Morris Park.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/an-up-to-date-morris-park-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Morris Park is loved by many people in Wenatchee. It is a little league baseball park that has been around for more than forty years. Up until recently, it was in desperate need of repair and renovation. There were electrical problems, no heating or air conditioning, and the toilets were unspeakable...so I won't say anything about them. The parking lot was also a disaster; people would park badly, taking up too much space. Everything needed to be changed and updated. Well, over the past few months, a team of very focused volunteers has managed to raise money, put in many hours of labor, and transform Morris Park. It is barely recognizable as the original little league park that has been used for so many years. But you know how it is; when a place changes completely, for the better, you soon get used to it, and even forget about its former appearance. That is the case now with Morris Park. Now, as you pull up in your car, you see a brand new parking lot, with freshly painted lines for each parking space. Then, you walk through an attractive, brick gateway which leads to a large, area that is roofed. People can shelter from the sun or rain in this area, and it is right next to the concession stand, so the queues of people lining up for food and drinks are also sheltered from the elements. The original building which housed the concession stand, toilets, and storage for equipment was pulled down. Now, in its place, stands a totally new, heated, air conditioned, safe, and larger facility. There is even an upstairs meeting room with an attached deck. Everyone is impressed at what a good job the team of volunteers did. We have all benefitted from it. You know, most of the people who got involved, already had full time jobs, but they donated their time over many weeks, for the sake of keeping little league in the area. Other people donated materials that they no longer needed for the construction. It's encouraging to think of what can be accomplished when people work together for a good cause.</p>

			<title>Native American Sculptures.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/native-american-sculptures-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Art seems to be a very personal thing, as far as what a person does and doesn't like. You must have found that, at some point in time, you have been in a place where all of a sudden you come across a piece of art that you absolutely love. That happened to me on Saturday. When I was hanging around the ball park in Moses Lake, in between games, I noticed what looked like a statue outside one of the many non-descript buildings that were close by. I had nothing else to do, as the next baseball game wasn't going to start for another twenty minutes. So, I decided to walk over to the building and take a look. I'm glad that I brought my camera, and that the battery was charged, because I came across a beautiful work of art. It was a metal statue of a very defeated looking Native American Indian, on an exhausted looking horse. It was large, and very detailed. Partly, the surprise of finding such a soulful work in a really soulless collection of buildings drew me close to the sculpture. "Who on earth made this?" I thought to myself as I walked around the base of the statue, looking carefully for the name of the artist. There was no name, however, nothing on the base or the statue itself. The base of it was surrounded by weeds and gravel. It almost looked as if this piece of art had been thrown away. What a find! I lay down on the floor in various positions, just so I could get some good shots of all the details. Since leaving Moses Lake, I have been searching on the internet for the artist's name. So far, I have not come up with anything. I tried to phone the auto museum, infront of which the statue stood. Surely someone in the building would know something about it. I will keep on looking for the artist's name, and I'll let you know who it is. In this Northwest region there is actually a lot of Native American art of all kinds, from totem poles, to jewelery, to sculpture. If I were part of the council of Moses Lake, I would put the statue in the middle of town and have it lit up. It is a significant find, because Moses Lake is where Chief Moses comes from. He was a well known, very educated chief who advocated for his people and their land. The statue echos the history of this area, it's very identity. It's as beautiful as it is historical, and deserves a place in full view of residents and visitors.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>You know, I'm getting better at learning about technology. I wouldn't say that I am totally ignorant about social media, but neither am I an expert. At least now I have a Twitter button on my blog page, in case anyone likes a blog and wants to send a Tweet about it. I also joined Facebook a while ago. For about a year I enjoyed my personal Facebook page; I reconnected with friends who I hadn't seen for a long time, and I quickly got up to date with what they had been up to over the years. That's the beauty of Facebook. Then, I thought, "Why don't I create a Facebook page for A Cup Of English?" So I did. It had a very positive reception, and many people joined it quickly. Someone then suggested that I create a group especially for my podcast followers. "Good idea!" I thought. That worked too. But then, everything went pear shaped (that's an English expression for things no longer being straight forward). I canceled my A Cup Of English page because some of my personal friends had joined, and I wanted to keep it strictly about the business of English. So, I canceled the page. Little did I know that the group continued, even though I, the administrator, had disappeared. I hope that some of you out there can come up with a suggestion for me. The problem that I have created is the following: the A Cup Of English group is an open group, so I can neither control it, nor become it's administrator again....Mmm, so what do I do? It is impossible to contact anyone from Facebook. I have tried to re-do my Facebook page, but that would mean using my <a href="mailto:acupofenglish@live.com">acupofenglish@live.com</a> email, and that was already used to set up the original page and group which I'm not allowed to do.&nbsp;I wrestled with the situation so much that I got totally frustrated. My only option is to create a different email address that is similar to my usual one, and join the group....I haven't tried that yet. At least it would give me the option of commenting on the page.

			<title>Clouds Over Quincy.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/clouds-over-quincy-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: x-small;" size="2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clouds Over Quincy.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;" size="2">We drove home Saturday evening from a town called Moses Lake after watching baseball games all day. The boys were tired and we were quiet in the car, looking forward to being at home and out of the wind and cold. It had been a great day, with three wins all in a row. We stopped in a town called Quincy because we were starving, and didn't want to wait until we got home to eat. We ordered food in a sandwich shop, ate quickly, and then continued on our journey home. Quincy is an agricultural town, very flat for miles and miles. Farming is the life of the town which, itself, is very small indeed. Because the landscape is flat, the sky seems like a huge expanse. As I gazed out of the window sleepily, I suddenly realized that I was looking straight at the most beautiful cloud. It was enormous, and in the darkening sky it was still lit up by the last rays of sun. There were only patches of cloud around, but for some reason this cloud was huge. Streams of rain were coming from the bottom, and were easy to see. It was awesome! I snapped away with my camera, hoping to get a good shot, but doubting very much that I would. The light was changing quickly, and so was the cloud, so I took as many photos as I could, on the off chance that one of them would come out well. When I got home, I took my SD card out of my camera and put it in my laptop to download the photos. After discarding the ones that were blurry, I found that four of them had come out okay. I immediately opened up my Picasa editing program, and got to work. The first thing that needed to be done, was to crop the photos, so there would be nothing unnecessary in them. Then I used the saturation option to add color. You have to be careful with that, because it is easy to make a photo look unnatural if you use too much color.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[&nbsp;Clouds Over Quincy.
We drove home Saturday evening from a town called Moses Lake after watching baseball games all day. The boys were tired and we were quiet in the car, looking forward to being at home and out of the wind and cold. It had been a great day, with three wins all in a row. We stopped in a town called Quincy because we were starving, and didn't want to wait until we got home to eat. We ordered food in a sandwich shop, ate quickly, and then continued on our journey home. Quincy is an agricultural town, very flat for miles and miles. Farming is the life of the town which, itself, is very small indeed. Because the landscape is flat, the sky seems like a huge expanse. As I gazed out of the window sleepily, I suddenly realized that I was looking straight at the most beautiful cloud. It was enormous, and in the darkening sky it was still lit up by the last rays of sun. There were only patches of cloud around, but for some reason this cloud was huge. Streams of rain were coming from the bottom, and were easy to see. It was awesome! I snapped away with my camera, hoping to get a good shot, but doubting very much that I would. The light was changing quickly, and so was the cloud, so I took as many photos as I could, on the off chance that one of them would come out well. When I got home, I took my SD card out of my camera and put it in my laptop to download the photos. After discarding the ones that were blurry, I found that four of them had come out okay. I immediately opened up my Picasa editing program, and got to work. The first thing that needed to be done, was to crop the photos, so there would be nothing unnecessary in them. Then I used the saturation option to add color. You have to be careful with that, because it is easy to make a photo look unnatural if you use too much color. After fiddling around until I was happy, I finished off by adding more definition. And I was finished. It's breathtaking, although it pales in comparison to the real thing. I love my Picasa photo editing program. Often, a photo won't capture the grandeur of a subject; however, with the right program, you can go a long way to achieving something wonderful.

			<title>A Living Museum.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-living-museum-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I received an email a couple of weeks ago from the part-time school that my oldest son attends. It was a reminder about a special evening presentation that they were going to have, 'a living museum'. At first, I actually ignored the email because I assumed that my son had nothing to do with it. It was a few days later that he asked me to help him get his costume ready for the event. Now, it just happens that we have been studying some ancient history at home: Roman, Greek, and Egyptian. At school, my son's History teacher had asked each student to choose a person from history to study. Hudson chose Emperor Augustus. His first choice was Alexander the Great, but someone else chose him before he had a chance to. So, he settled for his second choice, but someone equally influential and famous. Now, this is the sort of history that kids love to learn. What made this presentation even better was that they had to dress up. You could say that it was going to be a cross between drama and history. The night came. I had to drop Hudson off at the school early so he could help to set&nbsp;up the presentation tables with all of their work. I turned up about an hour earlier with my son, Robert, when everything was ready. We walked into the gymnasium where the event was taking place, and found that it was already packed with people. Everyone was milling around, looking at the presentations, and talking to the students who were all dressed up as different, famous people. There were about twenty students, all loaded with information about the people they were representing, answering questions, and trying to help the parents guess who they were. There were famous inventors, poets, composers, politicians, and royalty. I recognized only about half of the characters; the others I learned about for the first time. It was a great atmosphere, and, I think a great lesson plan for many kinds of classes in school. I can imagine English students doing the same thing, and having to explain who they are. Education doesn't have to be boring after all.</p>

			<title>A Doll's House.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-doll-s-house-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>There's something in my daughter's bedroom that takes center stage when her friends&nbsp;come around to play. It's her doll's house. It's a typical girls' toy, but one of the best and most interesting. She got it as a birthday present a couple of years ago, and squealed with delight when she opened the box. I would have liked to have to got her a wooden one; they seem better designed, more traditional, and the type that you keep as an heirloom. However, the only decent one that was available was the plastic one from Walmart. So, that was the one that was chosen for her. The outside looks ornate, with Victorian style architectural elements. However, the fun starts when you open it. One side of the house is split in two, like a double door fridge. Inside the two parts that open up, are two rooms. A patio folds out, and there are three floors revealed in the main area of the house. Of course, you have to furnish the house. The manufacturers are very smart; they sell sets of furniture separately from the house itself. So, for example, you have a kitchen set that you can buy, or a living room, or a bedroom set. My mother and mother-in-law got several sets of furniture as their presents, so by the end of her birthday, Domini had the house totally furnished, and ready for a doll to move in. It's a toy that really stimulates the imagination. Even her brothers have played with it. I think that that is great, but I can tell that they pretend that they're not interested in it, when they actually are. The doll's house is up in her bedroom, in a corner where it is safe; you know how these plastic toys can get damaged easily. I clean and pick up in her bedroom during the week, and often I find myself in that corner where the house is. I start by picking up furniture that has been left all over the floor, and before I know it, I have spent fifteen minutes arranging everything nicely in the house. It's a brief playtime for me when nobody is around, and it's a lot easier to tidy that house, than to tidy my own! Unlike the doll's house that I used to have, it has an eclectic mix of traditional furniture, and modern appliances. It even has a computer desk with a laptop! Those lucky dolls have the internet at their fingertips, and I'm sure they listen to podcasts whenever they can.....</p>

			<title>A Championship Game.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-championship-game-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was a perfect Sunday. We had two games, one at eleven and one at three. We didn't have to worry about the wind coming down from the mountains today because the weather was calm. Sunscreen would have benefitted a lot of people who, by the end of the day, must have been a bit red and sore. I had brought my broad brimmed black hat and sunglasses because I wanted to focus on the games, and not have to squint and shield my eyes. The first baseball team that we faced was Wenatchee. Our team is called the River Cats. We usually get beaten by this team, but somehow, the River Cats played well as a team and beat them by four points. That was a confidence booster! And, when you go into the finals against a team from Seattle, you need all the confidence you can get. And so, the game began. Seattle quickly got into the lead. The team members were all good hitters. They had obviously practiced hard. Even so, our fielders did a good job of running and catching some of their balls. We cheered loudly whenever that happened. When enough of their team have either been caught out or struck out, the inning changes, and it's our turn to hit. I don't recall us having any home runs, as we had had the previous day. In fact, on Saturday, we had about seven all together; for this age group, that is quite rare, and very exciting when it happens. I've been watching baseball games for a few years now, and have picked up on some of the strategies used. For example, if the bases are loaded (which means: if you have a team member on each base), the next batsman can sacrifice his ability to get to the first base after hitting the ball, in order to allow the team member who is at third base, to run to fourth base. This gets the team a point. Only when you have run to all four bases without being tagged out, does the team get a point. Sometimes, the next hitter will do a 'bunt'. This is when he holds the bat at each end horizontally, and the ball hits the middle of the bat. The ball doesn't go very far, and the pitcher has to run in and get it. The man at third base, therefore, has more time to run to fourth. It sounds complicated, I know, but when you watch the game, it really makes sense. Well, there was bunting, and regular hitting from our team, but it wasn't quite enough to win. We got second place. However, we didn't lose by very much, and the River Cats received an impressive trophy.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;" size="2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Tour of Homes: The Tool Shed.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;" size="2">For the first time in about six months, I creaked open the tool shed that is at the bottom of our garden. Yesterday happened to be a beautiful Spring day, so I couldn't avoid getting into the garden. Everything is green again, and the blossoms on the trees are just about to fully open. I had been at baseball games all morning, until about three in the afternoon, so there was still plenty of daylight left for gardening. When I opened the shed, it was like saying hello to an old friend. I've been in and out of it so many times for years, that it is a very familiar place to be. It was actually too hot to do a lot of work, so I chose to transplant a perennial from one shady area to another. It's the kind of hardy plant that comes back each year, no matter what. It is a low growing&nbsp;plant with delicate leaves and white, spiral-shaped flowers. And it is already out, and almost fully on display. I hacked it in two, and dug up one half which I carried over to a path. I then continued to chop it into sections with a spade, until I had enough clumps to line a little path on each side. I was careful to cover the roots, and gently press it down, and water it, of course. When it recovers from the transplant, and grows a little, it will really compliment the pathway. That's the sort of thing I like to do: use what I have, and either move it around, or change it's look. It's what we call 'pottering around' in the garden, or 'to potter'; it's not heavy work, but rather, it's fiddling around here and there, but still making a small difference. Ah, the tool shed. I needed a spade, but there are many kinds of tools in our shed. Here's a list of them: shovels (basically a big spade), forks, rakes, trowels (a small, hand-held spade), loppers (huge scissors for cutting a hedge), a lawn mower, bags of fertilizer, sprinkler parts to fix ours when they break, stakes (for holding ropes that in turn hold new trees in place), gloves, watering cans, and electric equipment. And there are plenty of mice and spiders as well..... I was happy with my little job, and pleased to make the first step back into the garden this year. I've got a mental list of projects that I have to get done, starting with pruning my roses and raspberries. But, you don't have to be an expert; you can google the 'how to's' of all of your projects, and find out exactly what to do.</span></p>

Here's a list of them: shovels (basically a big spade), forks, rakes, trowels (a small, hand-held spade), loppers (huge scissors for cutting a hedge), a lawn mower, bags of fertilizer, sprinkler parts to fix ours when they break, stakes (for holding ropes that in turn hold new trees in place), gloves, watering cans, and electric equipment. And there are plenty of mice and spiders as well..... I was happy with my little job, and pleased to make the first step back into the garden this year. I've got a mental list of projects that I have to get done, starting with pruning my roses and raspberries. But, you don't have to be an expert; you can google the 'how to's' of all of your projects, and find out exactly what to do.
Grammar notes.
Related vocabulary and expressions: a mental list, to potter, a fork, a rake.
1. Keep your mental list of projects short, so you don't drive yourself crazy trying to get them done.
2. I pottered around in the garden, pulled out some weeds, pruned a bush, and basically tidied up.
3. A garden fork is like a shovel, but it's three prongs help to separate, and break up hard clumps of soil.
4. We use a rake to gather up the leaves from the lawn. It's like a broom for the garden.]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Batting practice.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/batting-practice-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Once a week, as part of his practice schedule, my son Cass has batting practice for baseball. It takes place in a sports complex called Sportsplex. The building actually used to be an ice skating rink, but has been converted into a place where you can play sports that don't involve ice. It is an old building that has a comfortable, used feeling about it. Cass usually has to go on Wednesday's for a an hour and a half. A small corner of the building has been reserved for any team that wishes to book in advance, and perfect the batters' swings. The boys put on their helmets, and face the pitcher. Thankfully, the pitcher is usually the coach, so the pitching is good and accurate. However, because the coach is an adult, there is no mercy when it comes to the speed. The boys have to be ready, with their eyes on the ball. Another piece of protection that the boys wear is the 'cup'. It's to protect their genitals, or as we say, their privates. It's a very necessary piece of equipment that older boys won't play without. In fact, if you can't find your cup, you'd better not play. It could be used as an excuse to get <em>out</em> of playing...</p>
<p>"Your son not playing today, Bill?"</p>
<p>"Nope. The poor boy couldn't find his cup."</p>
<p>"Oh, gees. He'd better not be out there without it. Nope. No way!"</p>
<p>I don't see what all the fuss is about, really. I thought that sportsmen were supposed to be tough. Anyway, I digress. Batting practice is essential. The kids acquire what's called 'muscle memory', when their correct response to the approaching ball is automatic. Practice makes perfect; it's the same with anything, isn't it? Another good thing about batting practice is that it can take place any day of the year. If it is snowing heavily, or blowing a gale, it doesn't matter. You don't have to miss out on your practice time, because you have the Sportsplex. In a town where the longest seasons are cold Winter, and very hot Summer, it's a relief to have a place where the temperature is a consistent seventyish degrees. There is a full weekend of games coming up, and we'll see how the practices pay off. So cameras and cups at the ready!</p>
<p>Grammar notes.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: ...doesn't involve, reserved, the pitcher, converted.</p>
<p>1. I'd like to see a movie that doesn't involve shooting and police for a change!</p>
<p>2. Our table was reserved for six thirty, but we were an hour late, so the table was taken.</p>
<p>3. The pitcher stared fixedly at the catcher, as if the batter wasn't even there.</p>
<p>4. We converted our garage into a playroom, and our basement into a wine cellar.</p>

			<title>A rocket launch.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-rocket-launch-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was a windy, sunny day. You certainly needed to have a jacket on, as the wind was blowing down from the snow-capped hills. The crowd had gathered in the park, as scheduled. Everyone was excited, and waiting for the teacher to appear. A few passersby looked over and wondered why this group of people was standing and waiting for something. Finally, a car pulled up, parked, and out stepped the teacher, with a big box in his arms. There were all sorts of smaller boxes and pointy things protruding from the larger box. Anyone watching would wonder what he was up to. A couple of the kids ran up to him, "Hey, Mr. Mugg. Do you want some help?" After putting the box down, the teacher set up two launch pads, or rather launch sticks, for the morning's event. Some of the younger kids jumped up and down with excitement, and giggled nervously. It was time for the first student to see what he could do. He got his rocket, that he had spent the last few weeks building, from the box, put it on the launch pad, and started the count down, "Five, four, three, two, one, blast off!" And with that, the student pressed the button and there was a sudden, loud, "woosh" noise. Smoke blasted out of the bottom of his rocket, and up it went at great speed, high into the sky. Loud cheers sounded out from the crowd, and even people jogging in the park stopped to take a look at the disappearing and then reappearing rocket. This was the special rocket launching morning that the students had worked hard for. They had spent weeks learning all about how they work, why they work, and building them. Today, it was time to show off their knowledge. Some of the rockets had plastic soldiers with parachutes attached, and others had folded up glider planes tucked inside which out of the rocket and down to earth. There were so many cheers and squeals of excitement from one of the youngest students, that an older classmate said to him, "Hey dude, could you quit yelling!" You couldn't blame the little kid, though. It's not exactly an ordinary day in class.</p>

			<title>A bleating baby.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-bleating-baby-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Those of you who follow my podcast probably remember that I live in a rural area. Our house is located towards the outskirts of a small community. Our neighbors tend to have lots of trees, vegetable gardens, and animals. Across the road from us is a horse. Around the corner are two mules (which are like donkeys), and right next door we have chickens and goats. So, you can imagine that in this neighborhood&nbsp;there are&nbsp;lots of interesting noises and smells. There is a new set of noises and smells now, to add to those that we are used to. A baby goat was born a few weeks ago, right next door. Cheri, the lady who breeds them, invited us over to take&nbsp;a look. She has always kept animals and bred them for shows, and as a general hobby. The goats live in a triangular shelter that has a heat lamp, and they have an area to run around in. They are black and white, plump and playful. We were all very excited to see this newborn. The children desperately wanted to hold it, but it was still a bit too young. It was the size of a very small dog, and bleated beautifully. I was surprised how agile and strong it was for its age. The family next door also has bred doves and wiener dogs. Animal shows take place throughout the spring and summer months, so our neighbors travel a lot to different towns to show off their animals. And we have the advantage of seeing the newborns, as we live so close. Until recently, they also had a miniature pony, but they sold it to someone who has more land. An animal like that needs room to run around. Sometimes I feel like we have a bit of a farmyard here, with our dogs, fish, and bearded dragon. Animal breeding is taken quite seriously around here. I know of many people who have farms of different types. My husbands cousin has a large cattle farm, and requires good quality horses and cattle dogs. Goats, of course, are great waste disposal machines for a large vegetable garden. And, after consuming the waste vegetable matter, they produce wonderful manure. For a gardener like myself, that stuff is priceless. I'm planning on beginning work in my vegetable area, and I could really do with some manure. Once I take out the weeds, and airate the soil, that precious stuff needs to be mixed in. I might just ask my neighbors if they have any that they can spare.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes.</span></p>
<p>Using 'used to' and 'to get used to':</p>
<p>1. We used to go to the beach every weekend; now we only go once a month.</p>

<p>3. I used to have to get up really early. Now, with my new job, I can get up at eight o'clock.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Every now and then, I make a trip to the local library, sometimes by myself, and sometimes with my children. I love the quiet that you can experience there. It also reminds me of the fact that there is always something that you can learn; there is always something to read about. I've heard it said that it's good for children to become 'library rats'. That means that they should get used to going there; it should be familiar to them, as if they were rats who lived in its walls. Our local library has an upstairs children's&nbsp;section that has recently been renovated. It's a good idea to keep the kids separate from the rest of the place, so noise can be controlled. In their area, they have a castle-style entrance, all kinds of floor toys for youngsters, Legos and puzzles, puppets, and a fish tank. It's a really cozy place where kids can explore and do the things they enjoy. I also use another library that is in the part-time school that my two homeschooled children go to. It has some amazing resources. I was there today, and found that I didn't have enough time to see all that they have to offer. You can choose whichever book, video, game, or manipulative, and check it out for the whole year. You don't even have to show your identity card to a librarian. Most of the time there is nobody in charge. Everything works by an 'honor' system. That means, that once your children are registered, you have a right to use the library, and you simply have to write down the number of each item on a piece of paper, and sign. They trust that you will bring everything back when you are supposed to. I left the place with armfuls of items. They even have interactive writing systems that you can borrow, which you would normally have to buy for about fifty dollars. All of this borrowing and returning is great, because I can keep my house full of great educational materials that are specifically targeted to what my children need. As I write this, I have in front of me, a pile of books that need to go back. I've got books in the kitchen, books in the lounge and in the bedrooms. Ahh! There are too many of them, but they're all so good. Another good thing that we are encouraged to do during the summer, is the summer reading program. You sign your kids up, and every two weeks you visit the library, get books for them to read in two weeks, and then keep coming back. The children get a small toy when they have&nbsp;read a month's worth of books. The summer holidays are so long here, that kids need an incentive to keep reading and not fall behind!</p>

			<title>Questions tags.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/questions-tags-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As you study English, you will become familiar with question tags. A tag is a little something that is added on, just like the tag on your shirt that tells you the size and type of material. We use question tags all the time in English to add a brief question to the end of a sentence. Some examples are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn't raining, is it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He works in real estate, doesn't he?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;You're okay, aren't you?</p>
<p>You might have noticed already, that there is a pattern that is followed when using question tags. Usually, when the sentence is positive, the tag is negative. And vice versa. Also, the same auxiliary verb should be used, though there are some exceptions to this rule. Listen to the following that use the verb to be:&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dress is too tight for me, isn't it?</p>
<p>The film is going to start, isn't it?</p>
<p>They're late, aren't they?</p>
<p>We're on time, aren't we?</p>
<p>She's our tour guide, isn't she?</p>
<p>You can see the pattern quite easily here. In the tag, the subject comes at the very end. Before that, you simply put the verb 'to do' or 'to be' in its correct form, and contract it into a negative. So, 'we are' becomes 'aren't we', 'she is' becomes 'isn't she', 'they did' becomes 'didn't they', and 'he does' becomes 'doesn't he' etc. There are a few exceptions to the rule that I will cover at the end of the podcast.</p>
<p>Let's try the opposite way around, negative to positive. When I read these examples, listen closely to the verb form:</p>
<p>It isn't raining, is it?</p>
<p>We're not in a hurry, are we?</p>
<p>I'm not in the wrong building, am I?</p>

<p>Can you see the pattern? Once you get used to it, it's as easy as riding a bicycle, isn't it? Let's go over some of the exceptions. When we are using the verb to be with the 'I' form, we end up using 'are' or 'aren't' as the tag, instead of 'am'. Let's listen to some examples:</p>
<p>I'm picking you up at 3pm, aren't I?</p>
<p>I'm ordering the cake tomorrow, aren't I? * Note, this second sentence is more like a confirmation, rather than a question.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the 'you' form with the verb 'to have to'.</p>
<p>You have to study for your exam, don't you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to cook the fish while it is fresh, don't we?</p>
<p>She had to wash the car, didn't she?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use, as you can see, the verb 'to do' in the tag, after we use 'to have to' in the main part of the sentence. Likewise, with a negative statement using 'to have to', we would use 'to do' in the positive.</p>
<p>You don't have to drive tonight, do you?</p>
<p>They didn't have to pay again, did they?</p>
<p>He didn't have to go to the office for more paper, did he?</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Like most things, it's a question of practice. But, you are all very clever, aren't you? You didn't have much of a problem with regular questions, did you? And, I know that you will practice and learn tags very well, won't you?</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[As you study English, you will become familiar with question tags. A tag is a little something that is added on, just like the tag on your shirt that tells you the size and type of material. We use question tags all the time in English to add a brief question to the end of a sentence. Some examples are:&nbsp;&nbsp;
It isn't raining, is it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He works in real estate, doesn't he?&nbsp;
&nbsp;You're okay, aren't you?
You might have noticed already, that there is a pattern that is followed when using question tags. Usually, when the sentence is positive, the tag is negative. And vice versa. Also, the same auxiliary verb should be used, though there are some exceptions to this rule. Listen to the following that use the verb to be:&nbsp;
This dress is too tight for me, isn't it?
The film is going to start, isn't it?
They're late, aren't they?
We're on time, aren't we?
She's our tour guide, isn't she?
You can see the pattern quite easily here. In the tag, the subject comes at the very end. Before that, you simply put the verb 'to do' or 'to be' in its correct form, and contract it into a negative. So, 'we are' becomes 'aren't we', 'she is' becomes 'isn't she', 'they did' becomes 'didn't they', and 'he does' becomes 'doesn't he' etc. There are a few exceptions to the rule that I will cover at the end of the podcast.
Let's try the opposite way around, negative to positive. When I read these examples, listen closely to the verb form:
It isn't raining, is it?
We're not in a hurry, are we?
I'm not in the wrong building, am I?
He doesn't have any spare change, does he?
They don't sell hot coffee here, do they?
Can you see the pattern? Once you get used to it, it's as easy as riding a bicycle, isn't it? Let's go over some of the exceptions. When we are using the verb to be with the 'I' form, we end up using 'are' or 'aren't' as the tag, instead of 'am'. Let's listen to some examples:
I'm picking you up at 3pm, aren't I?
I'm ordering the cake tomorrow, aren't I? * Note, this second sentence is more like a confirmation, rather than a question.
Now let's look at the 'you' form with the verb 'to have to'.
You have to study for your exam, don't you?&nbsp;
We have to cook the fish while it is fresh, don't we?
She had to wash the car, didn't she?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use, as you can see, the verb 'to do' in the tag, after we use 'to have to' in the main part of the sentence. Likewise, with a negative statement using 'to have to', we would use 'to do' in the positive.
You don't have to drive tonight, do you?
They didn't have to pay again, did they?
He didn't have to go to the office for more paper, did he?
So, there you have it. Like most things, it's a question of practice. But, you are all very clever, aren't you? You didn't have much of a problem with regular questions, did you? And, I know that you will practice and learn tags very well, won't you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>A Cougar in Town!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-cougar-in-town-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The local news the other day was just the kind of news that I don't want to hear. A cougar had wandered down from the nearby mountains and was found in a residential area of town. Now, I know that we live in an area that is close to wilderness. You don't have to travel far from here to encounter bears, cougars, coyotes, and now increasingly, wolves. I remember having a conversation with my brother about the wildernesses around here. He is in love with wild, out of the way places. I, on the other hand, quite like towns and cities, though I do appreciate the beauty of the wild. As he is a photographer, he tries to find a way to wildernesses whenever he can, to have encounters with wild animals, and take photos whenever possible. I, on the other hand, came here to marry my man who is only slightly wild. I have deep respect for all the predatory animals that surround us, and I enjoy the fact that they are up in the hills, and we are down in the towns. I hope it stays that way. But, instances of both worlds colliding are bound to happen. The cougar in question turned out to be a young, starving orphan who had come to the town in desperate search of food. The police managed to find it. They had to scramble to find it. They brought in dogs to help them. They had very little time, as it was early morning, and children from the residential area would soon be walking to school. There was another incidence a year ago in a town nearby, this time with a full grown female. A man had fallen asleep in his lounge, and woke up to the sound of his dogs barking and growling outside. He went out sleepily, and in the half light saw what seemed to be a huge dog attacking one of his dogs. He ran up to it and swung his fist to punch it. When his fist hit the animal's head, he said, it felt like punching steel. It was an immensely strong cougar who, thankfully, was frightened by the man&nbsp;approaching&nbsp;it. It sprang up in the air, like cats do, and ran off. My husband laughed when he told me about the cougar news the other day. He knows that I am quite fearful of cougars, more for my children's sake than mine. He always tells me how it's much easier to have a car accident, or seriously fall down the stairs, than to be attacked by a cougar. I'm still not comforted. Oh well, I'll keep my eyes peeled, and if I see anything bigger than a large dog, I'll certainly let you know!</p>

			<title>Stereotypes.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/stereotypes-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered what a stereotype is, and why we have them? Do you, culturally, have certain stereotypes about certain people? Of course, all countries do. I'm sure that, in the past, I have judged people according to stereotypes I had learned, and been completely wrong about those individuals. One definition of a stereotype is an assumption about someone based on his looks, dress, job, age, and ethnicity. When I first came over to the U.S., everything was quite new to me. I had, up until then, only experienced the U.S. culture through television, and through some American friends who I had met in London. But, as they say, 'there's nothing quite like being there.' One day, while I was visiting for the first time, I walked into the lounge and saw Tom, the man I later married, and his father sitting on the sofa watching baseball on television, both wearing baseball hats. My immediate reaction was to laugh. It seemed, to my ignorant eye, that they had put their hats on out of enthusiasm for the game. To me, because baseball is very much an American game, it seemed typical or stereotypical. Well, now that I live here, I realize that nearly everybody wears baseball hats because it is so sunny. Wenatchee receives about 300 days of sun a year, and a very strong sun at that. I wear baseball hats regularly to protect my eyes and skin. Some people wear cowboy hats for the same, practical purpose, or even because they <em>are</em> cowboys. So, my immediate assumption was wrong, and I had made that assumption by judging how two people looked. It's scary how easily, and quickly we can make an assumption like that. To widthhold judgement I think needs higher thinking skills and some wisdom. And I think the most important part of not living in judgment of others is to see them as absolute equals, so rather than fearing the unknown and forming ill informed judgments, we can perhaps respect and care about the individual, simply because he is our equal. Gosh, I'm getting philosophical! I have experienced a lot of assumptions from people about me because I am from England. They have assumed a lot about my knowledge, likes and dislikes, and even experiences. The U.S. is faced with a huge challenge, at the moment,&nbsp;of how to deal with a stereotype that came up ten years ago on September 11th, when the&nbsp;Twin Towers in New York were bombed. How do you control a stereotype that has developed through something so tragic and violent, so as not to make terrible wrong judgments? What do you think? Are we capable of withholding judgment? There is a saying here that you have to read to understand properly. It says, 'When you <em>ass-u-me, </em>you make an <em>ass</em> out of yo<em>u</em> and <em>me</em>.'</p>

			<title>Oh, so you don't like phonics?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/oh-so-you-don-t-like-phonics-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hands up any of you who don't like English phonics. I can't see your hands, but it certainly sounded like a lot of them went up. Do you think English phonics are a pain? Well, do you know what I think? I agree with you; they are a pain. Believe me, as an English person, learning my own language was not that easy. Of course, speaking it came easily because I'm a native, but the writing part was much more problematic. I'm reminded now of the struggle that it can be to come to understand and remember all the different rules to English phonics. My second grader, who I homeschool, is climbing up the hill of phonics knowledge. He has almost got to the top, but still has a little way to go. It's extremely satisfying, as a mum, to see a child make progress with reading or writing, and to see how, once they know a rule, they can apply it. I'm looking forward to the day when he can read for pleasure. Today, in an effort to help my son get to the top of that reading and writing hill, I went to The Academic Toolbox. It's an amazing shop that supplies teachers and homeschoolers with everything: books, DVDs, games, toys, maps, art supplies. You name it, they have it. I didn't have enough time to really look around, but I did manage to find an interesting series called 'Explode The Code' all about phonics. These books give very clear, simple practices of all the phonetic rules that we use in English: vowel combinations, double consonants, endings, beginnings, irregularities, and comprehension. I like the style of the series; the art is simple but cartoonish at the same time. Kids like that. Many of the sentences are funny, and some of the activities are simply to draw a line or a circle to identify a word or its meaning. I'll have to do a podcast some time on the history of English. I think then we can all understand why it is such a mix of different things. Remember, that England, being a small island, was invaded many times by people of many different languages, my ancestors. So, it makes sense that the language has its complexities. Hopefully, my son will like these books as I do. And I also hope that he will quickly learn from them, reach the top of the hill, and then discover what fun English books can be,</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Confidence, it seems, can get you a long way in life. Confidence around other people can actually make those around you feel comfortable. I'm talking about the kind of confidence that lets you just be yourself; you don't have to prove anything or impress anyone. When I took my daughter with me to the hair dressers so I could get a hair cut, she charmed everyone there and made herself at home. As the hair stylist wet and combed my hair, I heard&nbsp;Domini chatting to a lady in a wheel chair who was waiting to have her hair cut. She openly asked her questions about her lack of mobility, and talked about all sorts of things, until both of them were smiling and&nbsp;laughing. The woman obviously felt at ease. Then Domini moved to someone else and chatted for a while, asking questions, and talking about her school and her friends. Finally, she jumped up on a seat next to me and got the attention of my hair dresser. I had hair in my eyes, so I couldn't see very well. I was concerned that the stylist would lose concentration and chop a chunk of hair that she didn't mean to. Domini swung around in the chair, asked her what she was doing, and what all her equipment was for. I've taught my kids that if they start a conversation with people and are polite, then people will like it. But, while I sat in that chair and listened, I heard my daughter take her 'niceness' one step further. She called each woman in the room "pretty". You can guess what kind of response she got. They all thought that she was a sweet angel. She even told the ugly ladies that they were pretty. Perhaps she'll be interested in politics when she's older.....Well, the compliments came back in her direction. She was given a balloon, and finally, she was allowed to sweep up the hair that was on the floor, press a button that turned on a vacuum that sucked all the hair out through the wall. She thought that was the greatest thing. I thought about our little trip later, and realized that with a bit of initiative and confidence, she had managed to turned a potentially very boring half hour into a fun practice of using charm to get people on your side.</p>

I'm talking about the kind of confidence that lets you just be yourself; you don't have to prove anything or impress anyone. When I took my daughter with me to the hair dressers so I could get a hair cut, she charmed everyone there and made herself at home. As the hair stylist wet and combed my hair, I heard&nbsp;Domini chatting to a lady in a wheel chair who was waiting to have her hair cut. She openly asked her questions about her lack of mobility, and talked about all sorts of things, until both of them were smiling and&nbsp;laughing. The woman obviously felt at ease. Then Domini moved to someone else and chatted for a while, asking questions, and talking about her school and her friends. Finally, she jumped up on a seat next to me and got the attention of my hair dresser. I had hair in my eyes, so I couldn't see very well. I was concerned that the stylist would lose concentration and chop a chunk of hair that she didn't mean to. Domini swung around in the chair, asked her what she was doing, and what all her equipment was for. I've taught my kids that if they start a conversation with people and are polite, then people will like it. But, while I sat in that chair and listened, I heard my daughter take her 'niceness' one step further. She called each woman in the room "pretty". You can guess what kind of response she got. They all thought that she was a sweet angel. She even told the ugly ladies that they were pretty. Perhaps she'll be interested in politics when she's older.....Well, the compliments came back in her direction. She was given a balloon, and finally, she was allowed to sweep up the hair that was on the floor, press a button that turned on a vacuum that sucked all the hair out through the wall. She thought that was the greatest thing. I thought about our little trip later, and realized that with a bit of initiative and confidence, she had managed to turned a potentially very boring half hour into a fun practice of using charm to get people on your side.

			<title>A Manicure Fanatic.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-manicure-fanatic-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>My daughter is obsessed with fashion. She is only six, and it comes as a surprize to me that she is so fashion conscious. She is not so concerned with the seasons' colors or styles, but she does like to know the 'pop' fashion. I think it comes from her being very musical. When she hears a pop song, or sees artists sing on television, she really takes notice of what they are wearing, and their general style. Also, she is influenced by her girl friends at school. If so'n'so has a pretty, new jacket, she will want one that is similar. She won't necessarily get the jacket, but she will certainly talk about it a lot, and try her hardest to get what she wants. So, she started to become interested in makeup. You know, you can find little girls makeup sets that they play with at home, and with their friends. I went along with this, thinking that, as long as she keeps it at home, but washes it off before going out, then it was okay. However, sometimes we would be going out, and without me realizing, she would have eye shadow on, or blusher. Once, she even got into <em>my</em> makeup and put on mascara which looked ghastly. So, I decided that I had to do something about the situation. My thinking was, if I could transfer her attention away from her face, and onto something else, it should help. So, I came up with nails. I bought her a collection of cute nail polishes, and she immediately took the bate! This now has developed into a habit. She'll paint her tiny nails, and go to school and show her friends. We're both happy. So, the other day, I took her to V-tech nail salon for a special, professional manicure. They didn't actually do much. Her nails were short anyway, and clean, so they only had to paint them. Plus, her nails are so small, that they hardly had to use any nail polish. She sat down at the table with the lady and picked out some nail stickers that would go on each nail. Then the lady set to work. She applied one coat of pink, carefully placed the stickers, and then applied a clear coat to keep the stickers on, and to add shine. Domini felt very special and grown up. She had to hold her nails over a dryer, and then place her hands in a UV machine that quickly sets the polish. The salon was packed, with nail technicians working away, beautifying ladies' nails and toe nails. It was warm and colorful, and there was a buzz of conversation from these happy females.</p>

			<title>A Norman Conqueror at the bank.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-norman-conqueror-at-the-bank-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>You see the strangest people in the most unlikely places sometimes. I was at the bank the other day, making a deposit, when I heard a, "Clomp, clomp, clomp" to my side. I turned to look at the person next to me, and standing there was a Norman soldier. Yes, I'm not kidding! He was completely dressed and ready for battle. I recognized him as Norman because of his helmet which was very round, with a long nose piece. From his neck to the floor was a cloak of chain mail. He had a sword, a helmet, and long leather boots. I laughed, and said, "Well, you don't see that every day, do you?" The bank clerk who was serving the man also smiled. "Could I take your photo for my blogpage?" I asked. He was perfectly happy with my request, and even posed for me. "Actually," I said to him,"could you act like your just getting money out at the bank?" I wanted the photo of this Norman conqueror to be amusing. After having his photo taken, he handed me a flier. It was for the Renaissance fair at the local college. It will have historical characters from many different ages. I think calling it 'Renaissance' is a loose name. There will be archery, costumes of different times, knights fighting, and all that sort of thing. It'll be worth a visit. I'll have to take the kids there because they are obsessed with battles between knights. I'm sure the gentleman I met at the bank had no trouble handing out his fliers. He certainly got plenty of attention being dressed like that. I've seen some very interesting people around town. You can always find one or two people who are dressed outlandishly, or who are shouting at the traffic. A fascinating looking individual who I would love to interview was standing at the bus stop the other day. He was dressed like a wizard, exactly like Gandalf from the Lord of the Rings. Someone like that surely has some stories to tell.</p>

			<title>A Commercial for Crunch Pak.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-commercial-for-crunch-pak-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>My sister-in-law called me the other day and asked me if two of my children would be interested in taking part in a commercial. "I think so," I replied. I thought that it would be an exciting, new experience for them. One girl and one boy were needed. They would be brother and sister to my nephew in the commercial. We arranged the date and time. When we turned up at her house, I didn't know what to expect. There was only one camera man, and that was it. He has done work in the past for the company called Crunch Pak, so he was in charge of telling the kids what to do and say. I must say, he handled all of the kids really well. He has four children himself, the youngest of which is only a couple of weeks old, so he is used to lots of movement and distraction. Crunch Pak is a company that sells bags of sliced apples. They also have Mickey Mouse shaped plastic containers that have three sections for different, healthy food, including fruit. The filming started in the kitchen. One by one, the children had to walk to the fridge, open it, take out a packet of Crunch Pak, and put it in a brown paper bag, as if they were packing it as part of a home made lunch for school. That went well. They had to do a few retakes because the kids looked at the camera when they weren't supposed to. My daughter got quite excited about being on film, and started to show off a bit, but the camera man said that they could edit out anything they didn't want. Then it was time to go outside and play a little basketball. Cass was filmed shooting hoops and dribbling, so was my nephew Boone. Then Domini had to ask the boys if she could play. The story behind the commercial is that Domini ends up beating the two boys, dunks a basket, and is left hanging from the hoop, saying, "Can someone get me down from here?" Very cute. Two hours later, we were finished. The kids were very pleased with themselves, and are anxious to see the finished product. "I'll send each of your kids a little payment in the mail," said the camera man as we left. That made them doubly pleased.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes.</span></p>
<p>Related vocabulary: To take part in, to handle .../it, to dribble, to shoot hoops, to dunk.</p>
<p>1. My children took part in a play in the local theater.</p>
<p>2. It was a difficult situation, but he handled it very well.</p>
<p>3. In basketball you must dribble the ball. That is when you bounce the ball while you run.</p>
<p>4. To throw the basketball at the basket and get it in is to 'shoot hoops'.</p>
<p>5. If you get really good at basketball, you might be able to dunk the ball. That means to jump up, put the ball in the basket, and then hang on to the rim or the hoop.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Convenience food.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/convenience-food-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Oh, what will I make for dinner? There's nothing for dessert; what could I quickly make? It's a real pain when the evening has already begun, and my plans for dinner have been delayed for whatever reason. When that happens, I look around in the fridge, hoping to stumble across something substantial that can quickly be cooked. Or, sometimes, mid-afternoon at the weekend, if we are at home, everybody fancies something sweet, like cookies. Yes, of course, I could make some, and sometimes I do. However, it's becoming easier now to reach for a packet of this or a box of that, and whip up some convenience food. When I go to the supermarket, and read labels of different products, I find that I get a general view of the kinds of products out there. In the past, convenience food was made from very refined and artificial ingredients. However, I am finding that there are more and more healthier options on the market. People are beginning to get more of what they want: convenient <em>real</em> food. Let's take cookies for an example. The packets or tubes of cookie dough that were available usually had hydrogenated oils, super refined sugar, coloring, flavoring etc etc. Now, you have a choice. There are some convenience foods that have what we call 'whole' foods. I picked up a packet of ready-made cookie dough the other day, and was very pleased to read the ingredients:organic flour, sugar, eggs, butter, chocolate, oats. The list was short, and nothing on it annoyed me. Great! I'll keep that in the fridge this week, and when 'crunch time' comes, I can whip it out, throw it into the oven, and voila, please everyone. It's all about saving time, for me. And I'm sure that the marketers realize that. Making everything from scratch in the kitchen is ideal, but it can take away alot of time from other activities. Life is certainly different from when my mother was a child. You used to have to warm up your irons, and then iron almost every piece of clothing in the house.&nbsp;Nowadays, you can buy tumble dryers that have settings you can choose to avoid having to iron your clothes. And it's the same with cooking. Instead of having to gather eggs, and milk cows, and cook all the food, now we can cook if we want to, and supplement that with pre-bought, ready to eat food, that is actually food. It might cost a little extra, but it's great to have choices.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes</span>.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: to fancy something, to whip up, to whip out, hydrogenated oil.</p>
<p>1. I fancy some extra rich chocolate cake.</p>
<p>2. Could you whip up some eggs for breakfast, please?</p>
<p>3. All of a sudden, the man whipped out a gun from inside his coat. A passer-by jumped on him and seized it.</p>
<p>4. Hydrogenated oil is oil that has had hydrogen pumped through it, which makes it thicker.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Build those muscles.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/build-those-muscles-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The other day, when I stopped to get some free firewood, I realized that I'm not as strong as I would like to be. The owner of the tree that was chopped down, had left huge chunks of wood to be taken away. But, when I say that they were huge, I mean really huge. I'm a fairly muscular female, but some of those pieces were far too heavy for me; I was glad that my brother was with me. He is huge, and very muscular, and not intimidated at all by heavy stuff. "Okay," I said, "we can lift some of these together." So we did. Now,&nbsp;I don't know why, but when I lift very heavy things, I get the giggles, especially if I'm with someone else. So, I only managed a few pieces with my brother, but then I started to get silly, so he had to finish loading up the car himself. "It's very handy having a big, strong guy around," I said to him. He seemed to enjoy the work, and tried to fit as many huge chunks as possible inside the car. I wish I was that strong! "I bet you can't hold that piece above your head," I said to him. Oh, it was an easy challenge. He immediately lifted the thing up, right over his head, and posed for a good photo. "Gosh, I hope he doesn't drop that thing on his head," I thought to myself.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The other day, when I stopped to get some free firewood, I realized that I'm not as strong as I would like to be. The owner of the tree that was chopped down, had left huge chunks of wood to be taken away. But, when I say that they were huge, I mean really huge. I'm a fairly muscular female, but some of those pieces were far too heavy for me; I was glad that my brother was with me. He is huge, and very muscular, and not intimidated at all by heavy stuff. "Okay," I said, "we can lift some of these together." So we did. Now,&nbsp;I don't know why, but when I lift very heavy things, I get the giggles, especially if I'm with someone else. So, I only managed a few pieces with my brother, but then I started to get silly, so he had to finish loading up the car himself. "It's very handy having a big, strong guy around," I said to him. He seemed to enjoy the work, and tried to fit as many huge chunks as possible inside the car. I wish I was that strong! "I bet you can't hold that piece above your head," I said to him. Oh, it was an easy challenge. He immediately lifted the thing up, right over his head, and posed for a good photo. "Gosh, I hope he doesn't drop that thing on his head," I thought to myself. Of course, he didn't. He just swiftly put it in the car. He told me later that, back in Christchurch, he had to dismantle three tons of bricks from his house. They had formed the chimney sections, but the earthquakes had separated them from the rest of the house. "I had to take them down, one by one, and stack them in the garden." His muscles have certainly been working a lot. And you know what that means. His bones must be good and dense, full of calcium. They say that the best way to avoid osteoporosis is to lift weights.

			<title>Oh the olives!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/oh-the-olives-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On my recent trip to Nice, I was fortunate enough to go to an open market. Oh, the colors and smells were fantastic. I strolled around just taking everything in. It was February, but the weather was wonderful. It was very sunny, and you only needed to wear a light jacket. So walking around outside was very comfortable. Because my visit there was so short, my good friend Lorraine took me to as many places as possible near the coast. The market that we went to was a photographer's paradise. There were so many colors and textures there. Thankfully, I have a digital camera, so I didn't run out of film. There were all kinds of fruits and vegetables. There was a stand loaded with salamis of all shapes and sizes. Flowers, local honies, cheeses, and finally, olives. Oh the olives! Just looking at the photo makes my mouth water! Having a mother who is a Spaniard, means that I have had a lot of olives in my life. My favorites are green olives stuffed with anchovies. Mm, mm! I think also, olives represent a lot for me. They represent my experiences in Spain, and they remind me of sights, sounds, and smells that are typically Mediterranean. It's funny to think that when I was a teenager in the North of England, a lot of kids my age weren't familiar with olives at all. Delivery pizza was not yet a big thing. And the favorite foreign dishes in England were Indian. Since then, even the small, rural towns have become more exposed to the rest of the world, and more cosmopolitan. Thank goodness. In my 'A' level Spanish class, I remember my teacher bringing in a couple of small jars of Spanish olives to pass around to the students. Most of them had never tried them before. I was amazed. One by one, they smelled the olives, and slowly put them in their mouths. And when they chewed, they were really unsure about the taste. I, on the other hand, wolfed down most of the olives quite happily. I'm sure that now, all of those people who were in that class, are a lot more familiar with olives. I think that we humans have a special connection to foods that we have been brought up with, that also have an important traditional role in our particular cultures. The food might be good in and of itself, but it is the context in which we have experienced it that makes it important and familiar. My Mexican students in High School would tell me about a soup of their culture which they absolutely loved. It's called Menudo. Finally, one day I was able to try it. It turns out to be cow's stomach soup......Well, I just wasn't too sure about the taste, or smell, or texture...But I realize that if I had been brought up with it, I would probably love it too. That's the power of culture right there.</p>

			<title>The cost of teeth is rising.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/the-cost-of-teeth-is-rising-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've had teeth all over the house recently. My children just happen to be at the ages where they are all losing teeth. For my oldest boys, it's no longer a novelty. They have gaps here and there where teeth are growing in. And the contrast between their new, big, adult teeth, and their baby teeth is quite amusing. My third son still gets excited about losing teeth because of the prospect of getting money. In his mind, each dollar he gets is a step closer to him obtaining a Star Wars Lego kit. My daughter, on the other hand, is still taken up by the mystery around the Tooth Fairy. Does she exist? How does she sneak into the bedroom and take the tooth away without waking anybody up? Is she beautiful? Surely Mom isn't the Tooth Fairy. And Dad certainly can't be. So, fairies do exist, right? And is what the older brothers say true, or are they just being old meanies, as usual. The big boys laugh about the idea of believing in fairies. But, you know, I don't think that upsets Domini very much. She has a natural resistance to anything her brothers say or do anyway, so what they say might actually encourage her to believe in fairies even more. I personally believe in garden fairies. I admit it. I haven't seen them, but I'm sure that they live at the bottom of the garden, are tiny, have wings, and are very quick, and very smart. All inteligent people know that.... The Tooth Fairy must be a cousin of some sort. There, that's my story, and I'm sticking to it. One thing that I have noticed about fairies is that they keep up with the cost of living. They no longer&nbsp;leave coins; they leave&nbsp;paper money. They know a good commodity when they see one. I suspect that they know&nbsp;more about the value of teeth than we do. They have their bills, and we have ours, so they need a good quality tooth in exchange for a dollar.&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, food, clothes, wing maintenance services, and babysitters, are all&nbsp;more&nbsp;expensive than they used to be.&nbsp;So, with the fall out of teeth in this house, I find that a couple of quarters just isn't enough. The nice sound&nbsp;of two coins clinking together is not acceptable anymore. It's the lonely, silent dollar that is wanted. It's dangerous to mess around with fairy tales. And it's wise to keep the children and the fairies happy.</p>

			<title>A Starbucks Revolution.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-starbucks-revolution-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>"Hello, we have a special triple grande caramel mocha with whipped cream for only three ninety-nine. Can I take your order?" That's the kind of information-loaded question that you get asked when you pull up to a Starbucks drive-thru. Just as you are about to speak, the lady inside the building beats you to it. And there is always a special of the day, a huge, sugar-filled, creamy thing that costs fifty cents less than it normally does. And, because Starbucks opens early, the people who use the drive-thru to get a coffee on the way to work, also get asked the same question. I doubt if many would buy a triple grande caramel mocha with whipped cream first thing in the morning. Whose stomach would be ready for that? But, as far as drive-thrus go, they have one of the best. There are drive-thrus all over town, and in every town. There are even drive-thru banks. The service of Starbucks, though, is probably the best. Firstly, the speaker system is loud, clear, and effective. Generally, the person taking your order is articulate, and doesn't speak too quickly. I've been through some drive-thrus where the person taking my order has spoken so fast, that I haven't understood a word. Saying, "I beg your pardon," just adds to the confusion in a situation like that. What is needed, quite simply, is a "What?" So, at Starbucks, you can relax and not worry about not understanding the employee. You can spend a few seconds looking at the list of drinks and pastries before ordering. All of this takes place, of course, with the smell of fresh coffee wafting your way, encouraging you to buy more. You pull the car up to the second window, where you pay for your drink, and everybody is happy. That's what it is; it's a happy place. Think about it. The people who work there are instantly pleasing each customer. That can't be bad. Compared to other businesses, like, say for example, clinics, insurance companies, or even banks, you don't always have happy customers. Then, as you drive off, sipping your not-too-hot coffee, you quickly glimpse the happy customers who are sitting inside Starbucks chatting, or on their laptops, all getting a creative caffeine high, writing lists of how to improve the world, or at least, cause a local revolution.</p>

<p>Related vocabulary: to beat someone to it, articulate, to waft, say for example.</p>
<p>1. I was going to buy the last pair of silver high-heels, but someone beat me to it.</p>
<p>2. She is so articulate for a young person; talking to her is like talking to a college literature professor.</p>
<p>3. The smell of fresh baked bread wafted from her house all over the neighborhood.</p>
<p>4. You might need an umbrella in the rain. Another instance is, say for example, to hit someone who is trying to steal your purse.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/i-m-on-facebook-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, everyone, I've taken&nbsp;the plunge and joined Facebook. I signed up months ago, but didn't really start communicating properly with people until a couple of days ago. You can find me under, believe it or not, Acupof English. I had to put in Acupof as my first name, and English as my last. I couldn't figure out how else to do it. So, I've jumped on board with the millions of people who chat and network on this social media. At first, I was a bit baffled by how Facebook worked, and I was a bit concerned about the privacy settings. However, the recent update to Facebook has, I think, given us users better and more specific options to keep our network as private as we want, or the opposite. Everybody I know has a Facebook page. Infact, my brother showed me that his High School students back in New Zealand had created a page dedicated to him, and they did this without him knowing anything about it. It all started when he decided to grow out a beard. Well, this hairy mass on his face got bigger, and bushier, and longer by the day. It became quite an eccentric looking feature. He liked it because it kept his face warm in the winter. His students, however, formed a plan to take a photo of him in class and sneak it onto a Facebook page. So, one of them secretly took a photo during class with his cell phone, and the rest is history. I think it is quite a compliment that&nbsp;students would make the effort to do that about a teacher. I wonder, how many of you are on Facebook? Do you find it useful? What have been the major benefits from using it? For me, catching up with old friends has been wonderful. I have a few really good friends in Europe who I hadn't seen for many years. Facebook allowed us to catch up on eachothers' news, and photos, by sending both public and private messages, and really soon, it seemed as if all those years of not seeing eachother disappeared. Getting to know new people as well is a prospect that I find exciting. So, if you're interested in a bit more English, and want to network with others that are posting on my wall, feel free to look up Acupof English. I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

So, if you're interested in a bit more English, and want to network with others that are posting on my wall, feel free to look up Acupof English. I hope to hear from you soon!

			<title>A shell from Hawaii.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/shells-from-hawaii-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have something pretty that sits on my windowsill in my kitchen. It's a shell from Hawaii. I'm not sure what kind of shell it is, or what it is called, but it certainly is something that I love to look at. My mother brought it back from her recent trip there. She went during the Winter, which apparently is one of the best times to go, with it not being too hot. I would like to say that she went scuba diving and found the shell, but then again, you would never find a shell that looks like this underwater. It has been processed, in a way. The outer most layer of the shell has been ground off. Underneath, a pearly white layer is revealed. It's stunning. There must have been a creature like a crab that lived inside it, because there is plenty of room for a little animal in its cavity. I'm not really into jewels, ornaments, and decorations around my house, but I do love shells. I think it's because there is usually a story that comes with them about when they were found, or how a person found them. I still have a tiny shell in my handbag that I found on one of the beaches in Mallorca, Spain, last summer when I went with the kids. When I'm rummaging around, looking for my cell phone or my check book, I will stumble across it. It gives me an unexpected reminder of our vacation. My sister also brought me a beautiful shell from New Zealand. It's called a Paua shell, and has the coloration of a bluish, greenish rainbow. Again, the outside has been ground off, revealing the unexpectedly beautiful layer underneath. When I started to write this podcast, I remembered that up in our storage area, we have a collection of large, conch-type shells from Mexico. My husband and I found them years ago while we were snorkelling. We used to have them placed around our bath in our previous house, but when we moved, we boxed them up and forgot about them. I'll have to fish them out today, to add to our growing collection of shells around the house.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ah Guinness! We have lots of it in our house at the moment. My brother loves it. I'm not unfamiliar with it either. Back in London, I used to drink it mixed with 7Up. I found it too bitter to drink neat. If you've never tried it, you should. It is a black, thick, creamy alcoholic drink that is served by the pint. It has a rich, cream colored head of bubbles that is one of its main features. The head is produced by the use of nitrogen when the beer is poured. It's actually considered a dry stout. A stout isn't a regular, cold beer. It is a strong, dark beer that is made from roasted barley. 'Stout' as you might know, is another word for strong, or proud. Guinness, in particular, is known for its slight burnt taste, or what we call its 'bite'. You might have noticed that I spelled burnt b-u-r-n-t. This word isn't used in the U.S. They use the past participle 'burned'. Anyway, Guinness is produced in Dublin, Ireland, but is sold all over the world to stout-lovers. It is actually quite nutritious as well. My ex-stepfather's mother drinks half a pint of Guinness every night to get her daily dose of iron. That was recommended to her by her doctor. So there! When I was researching Guinness, I came across a very interesting fact about it. One of its ingredients is the collagen from fishes' swim bladders. Yuck! Apparently, it helps to clarify the beer, and is also used in some wines. I'll think of that the next time I have a glass....Mind you, it's not as bad as some drinks. There is a famous cider from the south of England called Scrumpy. Traditionally, when it is being made, or so they say, a <em>sheeps head </em>is thrown into the mix. The fermentation process kills anything&nbsp;harmful, and, I suppose, the quite scary ingredient adds a special flavor. I don't know who the genius was who came up with that idea, or what inspired him to do it. It's not the usual thing to do when you are making up a drink. If I'm making a punch for a special occasion, it doesn't occur to me to throw in an animal's head. But, there you go; maybe I'm not a <em>natural</em> drinks mixer.</span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I'm afraid that I'm going to talk about one of my dogs. The reason for my apologetic tone is that some dog lovers go on and on about their animals, and often the people listening have no interest in their little beasties. Well, I'm actually not a dog lover, but I do love my dogs. There is a difference. You could say that I love my dogs because I know them so well, we have a history together, and they form part of our family. One of my responsibilities as a mum, is to make sure that the family members stay clean. One member, in particular, has a real problem with this, Rosie. I don't think she consciously likes to be dirty, but when the good Lord designed her, he gave her the rattiest, wiriest, dirt-holding coat of any dog. I remember taking her for her one and only haircut last year. What a performance that was! The dog stylist patted Rosie lovingly when she first met her, and about a handful of dirt fell out of her coat and onto the counter top. Well, I'm not going to let that happen again. The poor dog was so embarrassed; she looked up at me with her big brown eyes for comfort, by I had already turned and looked away. So, I made it my oldest son's job to give her a bath. The hardest part was getting her in it, and keeping her there. Once that was accomplished, the rest was easy. He used a huge jug to pour gallons of warm water over her while rubbing her hair. I'm sure after her bath, she was half a kilo lighter. These dogs that dig and go down holes, just accumulate layers of dirt and dust while they are busy sniffing out mice and rats. Anyway, Rosie came out of the bath and gave a tremendous shake. She was as shiny as a penny, and the bath looked as dirty as a sewer. Now, our little princess just needs a pink bow on her head to look like one of the royal family. Um, maybe that's not the best comparison....., to look like a movie star.</p>

			<title>A blasting experiment.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-blasting-experiment-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's always fun when my brother comes to visit from New Zealand. Because he is a math and science teacher, he often thinks of interesting things to do that fascinate the children. When he heard that one of my sons does experiments in the kitchen for his science homework, he had the idea of making a list of fun experiments. "The next time you go to the supermarket, could you get three large bottles of diet Pepsi, and some Mentos mints?" he asked. I had a sneaking suspicion that the experiment he was thinking of would involve either a mess, or an explosion of some kind. By the time I got back from the supermarket, the three boys and my brother were ready to start mixing things together. We took the ingredients outside to the back garden. I have a wooden planter pot that is upside down that we used as a base. Each boy took turns holding the top of the bottle, with five mints lined up in his hand, ready to drop them in when told to. The camera was set up, and then the count down came, "Three, two, one, put them in!" As soon as they were dropped in, the boys had to jump back, out of the way. A brown column of fizzy Pepsi came shooting out of the bottle, going five to six feet in the air. "Wow!" they all cheered, with smiles on their faces. The Pepsi splashed on their jeans and got all over the deck. Their uncle Richard is the coolest, according to them. Who else would encourage them to make a big mess? The next experiment is, apparently, one that is powerful enough to launch a Pepsi bottle over the roof of the house. I think a little supervision by me will be necessary. I don't want to upset the neighbors by knocking out one of their pets. That wouldn't do much for neighborly relations.......As they say, "Boys with toys..." it could get a little dangerous.</p>

			<title>Crocuses: a first sign of Spring!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/crocuses-a-first-sign-of-spring-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The official first day of Spring came and went on 20th of the month. We've had a few very spring-like days, but usually the next day, it has returned to wintry weather. That's okay, though. There are signs that Spring is on its way. The birds are beginning to get noisy in the mornings. And, little patches of colors are appearing here and there; the Spring flowers are coming out. The ones that I have noticed in my garden are the crocuses. They are one of my favorites; they are purple with yellow-orange stamens, and only about eight or nine pointed petals. They are a simple reminder that Winter is long gone. I have been meaning to buy some bulbs and quickly pop them in the ground. The most popular ones around here are tulips and daffodils. Its a cheap way to fill in an empty or boring area of your garden with color that returns each year. I don't know if you remember when I changed the entry way to my house. I transplanted five big bushes last year, planted perennials, and eventually found a Japanese maple tree to shade the walkway that leads up to the front door. Well, that red barked tree has gone bananas. It is about a foot taller than when I planted it. It will very soon been arching over the walkway, which is exactly what I want it to do. I've noticed that as the weather has improved, people have been coming out of the woodwork. That means that, like insects, people have been coming out of their homes where they have been avoiding the cold, and now they are walking around and enjoying the change of weather. Woodwork is actually the various wood panelling that you have on the walls in a house. The shops are doing their part, getting ready for the hoards of shoppers who will want plants, seeds, and gardening equipment. I'll be doing my best to find bargains, and to focus, I think on growing vegetables. If I want flowers, I will go for either seeds or bulbs. That will force me to be patient, and have to wait for the final outcome.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes.</span></p>
<p>Vocabulary: a patch, stamen, to arch, woodwork.</p>
<p>1. After painting the kitchen, I realised that I had patches of paint on my jeans.</p>
<p>2. The stamen is the center of the flower where the pollen is.</p>
<p>3. The trees leading up to the manor house, arch over the driveway.</p>
<p>4. We pulled out the old woodwork in the lounge and just plastered and painted the walls.</p>]]></description>

I've noticed that as the weather has improved, people have been coming out of the woodwork. That means that, like insects, people have been coming out of their homes where they have been avoiding the cold, and now they are walking around and enjoying the change of weather. Woodwork is actually the various wood panelling that you have on the walls in a house. The shops are doing their part, getting ready for the hoards of shoppers who will want plants, seeds, and gardening equipment. I'll be doing my best to find bargains, and to focus, I think on growing vegetables. If I want flowers, I will go for either seeds or bulbs. That will force me to be patient, and have to wait for the final outcome.
Grammar notes.
Vocabulary: a patch, stamen, to arch, woodwork.
1. After painting the kitchen, I realised that I had patches of paint on my jeans.
2. The stamen is the center of the flower where the pollen is.
3. The trees leading up to the manor house, arch over the driveway.
4. We pulled out the old woodwork in the lounge and just plastered and painted the walls.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was driving down the road the other day, to go to Walmart, when I saw something that really caught my eye. On the left hand side of the road, infront of a house, a huge tree had been cut down. It was so big that it took up all of the house owner's front garden. I was really surprised at first, because this tree, that I drive past every day, had not&nbsp;appeared to have any problems at all. It hadn't looked diseased or weak, infact, quite the opposite. It had been one of the biggest and oldest in the neighborhood, so much so that it dwarfed the house that was near it. That might be the reason that the owner doesn't want it anymore. Perhaps it was just too big. Well, the workmen started out the project of bringing down the tree, by hacking off the limbs, one by one. It's the only safe way to do it when the tree is right next to a busy road. Over the course of a day, all the limbs came off, and only the massive trunk was left standing. Then the next day, that too was cut down. I would be interested to measure the diameter of the tree, or at least count the rings inside the trunk to calculate its age, because it really is quite thick. As I drove home yesterday, I noticed a sign that had been put next to the trunk, "Free firewood." A great idea. It would be hard to get rid of all that tree from your front yard if you didn't have any help. Our firewood supply has dwindled because we've had quite a few fires this winter. We need to stock up again, chop some wood, and let it dry out for next winter. I hope that the big tree will be replaced by something tasteful and pretty, not just a two foot little twig that takes years and years to grow. There seems to be a gap now, where the big tree had stood. Let's hope it gets filled with something worth looking at.</p>

			<title>I'm back, with details of a yucky cold.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/i-m-back-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm sorry that I missed a couple of podcasts last week; I was really sick. When I spoke to you last, I was beginning to lose my voice and feel achy with a sore throat. I assumed, however, that with some good food, and a good night's rest, that I would be fine the next day. Wrong! I went downhill from there. I had originally caught the cold from my son, and then my daughter and I both&nbsp;got really ill. So, it's been a miserable week, with no energy, coughs, fevers, chills, and not a lot of fun in the house. Thankfully, my brother has been visiting from New Zealand, so he has been able to entertain the children more than me. What does a person have to do to get over this kind of sickness? One thing I have found to be very helpful, is to drink lots of fluid. That is something that doctors always say, and, at times, I haven't really paid much attention. But, you will find that if you have a cough or a blocked nose, drinking lots of water and juices makes you feel much better. Your mucus isn't so thick, so you can cough or blow your nose more effectively. I know, these details are a bit gross, but it's all common English that's useful. We normally use the word 'snot' for mucus, or we say that we are 'snotty'.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the U.S.A the word 'snotty' is very commonly used to describe a person as proud or unfriendly. So, when you use this word, make sure that your listeners know exactly what you mean. Anyway, another thing that helps when you are experiencing a bad cold, is to use an extra pillow at night, so your head and chest are elevated. This helps you breathe more easily, and it helps your nose and sinuses drain more easily. You might wish to take spoonfulls of medicine to help relieve some of they symptoms you are living with. Nasal decongestant unclogs your nose; an expectorant loosens the mucus in your chest so you can cough well; cough suppressant reduces coughing; and anti-histamine reduces the kind of allergy symptoms we get such as itchy eyes and throat. Most people have these medicines in their bathroom cabinet somewhere. It is useful to keep them handy, just in case. I'm so glad that I'm over the worst of my cold; I'm about one day away from being fully recovered. Our routines will get back to normal: the kids in school, some at home for homeschooling, and me back to podcasting. So, don't make the mistake I made of over-extending yourself and getting ill; it's not worth it. Sometimes we need to baby ourselves to avoid these yucky colds.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes</span>.</p>
<p>Cold related vocabulary: expectorant, to baby oneself, sinuses, decongestant.</p>
<p>1. Expectorant is great for loosening mucus in the chest so you can cough well. However, you must drink lots of water so your mucus doesn't get thick and choke you!</p>
<p>2. Relax, keep warm, take vitamins and chicken soup, and basically baby yourself. That way you can avoid getting ill.</p>
<p>3. When you have a sinus infection, you get pain and tightness across your forehead.</p>
<p>4. Decongestant unblocks or unclogs your nose.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Mythology looking at me.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/mythology-looking-at-me-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Mythology seems to be all the rage these days. There have been films released recently, like 'Percy Jackson and the lightening thief', and 'Clash of the Titans', that have had a lot of people talking about mythology and what it means to us today. Other books and their subsequent films, like the Harry Potter series, have also used mythological figures. Children, teenagers, and adults have, therefore, had mythology as a subject to be discussed, or at least commented on. Video games seem to have followed suit. Heroes battling hideous mythological beasts, and the powers of good against the powers of evil, are very common, and advertised on television often. I don't remember it being that way ten years ago. This interest in mythology has come about as a new kind of fashion, brought on by book sales. Mind you, I love it. Myth is a fascinating world. When I was in Vienna a few weeks ago, I came face to face with some colossal reminders of a mythological figure who has been portrayed on many buildings and in many paintings, Hercules. I found myself wandering around Michaelerplatz, when I was drawn to the huge statues. I didn't recognize the characters, but I photographed them anyway, and planned on googling who they were later. Hercules apparently had 12 labors, or things to do. I spotted three of them in the square, the most impressive of which was when he kills the Lernaean Hydra which is a nine headed sea serpent that has poisonous breath. I'm sure that beast kept him busy for a while...The statues are located on a wing of the imperial palace, the massive Hofburg. They are in keeping with its neo-Baroque design of the 1200's. Gosh, if I had had the time, I would have explored the Hofburg; apparently it has 2000 rooms! And there is a feast of classical mythology to be found inside the palace as well.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">You know, being a mother is an interesting job. I sit back sometimes and consider the influence that I have over my children; it's quite a responsibility. My likes and dislikes are obviously reflected in how I run the home, in what I do, in places we go, and even in the things that we eat. Because I am homeschooling two of my sons at the moment, I have decided to exert my influence over them for their physical good. Cross training! I first heard about it through my other son, Cass, who goes to a cross sport training facility to get in top shape for baseball. It is a total body workout. When I spoke to one of the trainers, he told me that, unlike other gyms, they do not isolate muscle groups in cross sport. The whole body moves in each of the activities. Because of that, the workouts are intense but short. So, Hudson and Robert have started to go twice a week for a hard and fast muscle building experience. The first time they went, I sat and observed. The workouts are never the same. They started by raising and throwing to the ground an eight pound ball. They did this about ten times. Then they had to jump up with both feet at the same time onto and off of a huge wheel. Next, they climbed a net up to the ceiling. Finally, they had to run around the track a couple of times. They repeated all of this three times. The whole thing only took about fifteen minutes. Another thing to take into consideration is that you don't get any breaks at all, not even one minute of rest! So, when the boys had finished working out, they came and collapsed on the sofa that I was sitting on. They were all red faced, but happy. I chatted to the trainer a little, and the next thing I knew, the boys were up and pulling weights on a sled. Kids recuperate so quickly! They wanted some more action. I'll take them again tomorrow, and see what other whole body work outs the trainer has planned for them.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hot Pasties.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">If you've never had a pasty, you've never lived. That means that eating one is an experience you must have because they are so good. I actually haven't had a pasty for years and years, though I did eat them up until I was a late teenager. So, do you have any idea of what a pasty is? It's a bit like a pie; it's usually meat and vegetables in a pastry shell that is the shape of the letter D. It has a thick crust that is twisted which you hold the pasty by. It originated in Cornwall, in the south west of England. Records of pasties in Cornwall date back as far as the 12<sup>th</sup> century. It is said that the tin miners in the south would take them to work. They are a whole meal in themselves, and the crusts are perfect for holding on to the pasties without getting them dirty. If you are a miner, that's a good thing, especially if your dirty hands have traces of arsenic on them. A tradition was to leave the crusts for the spirits of the mine to keep them happy, to stop bad things from happening. Well, I'm not a miner, and most of the time I have clean hands, but I came across a pasty shop in the York train station when I was visiting my sister. I had just said goodbye to my sister, and was waiting in the chilly station for the next train to King's Cross in London. I suddenly smelled the most wonderful smell; it was familiar. I followed it until I came to the West Cornwall Pasty company, where there were hot steak and vegetable, and chicken and mushroom pasties lined up, warm and crispy. We had had a huge lunch, so I didn't have one, but for old times' sake I took several photos. They even had some steak and stilton pasties which I had never heard of before. Stilton is a very strong blue cheese that melts deliciously, so I should imagine that that combination would be worth a try, especially on a cold, wintry day.</p>

They are a whole meal in themselves, and the crusts are perfect for holding on to the pasties without getting them dirty. If you are a miner, that's a good thing, especially if your dirty hands have traces of arsenic on them. A tradition was to leave the crusts for the spirits of the mine to keep them happy, to stop bad things from happening. Well, I'm not a miner, and most of the time I have clean hands, but I came across a pasty shop in the York train station when I was visiting my sister. I had just said goodbye to my sister, and was waiting in the chilly station for the next train to King's Cross in London. I suddenly smelled the most wonderful smell; it was familiar. I followed it until I came to the West Cornwall Pasty company, where there were hot steak and vegetable, and chicken and mushroom pasties lined up, warm and crispy. We had had a huge lunch, so I didn't have one, but for old times' sake I took several photos. They even had some steak and stilton pasties which I had never heard of before. Stilton is a very strong blue cheese that melts deliciously, so I should imagine that that combination would be worth a try, especially on a cold, wintry day.
&nbsp;
Grammar notes.
Crust, to come across, lined up.
Cut the crust off of the pie, would you? It is overcooked and too hard.
Whilst looking through my papers, I came across a war medal that belonged to my grandfather.
The children were lined up, waiting for their chance to talk to Santa Clause.]]></itunes:subtitle>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I have never really been much of an ice skater. When I was a teenager, I would go indoor skating with friends, mainly to have a good laugh. When people are wobbling and falling down on a regular basis, it can be amusing! My friends and I never practiced enough to get really good. And that, I'm sure, makes all the difference. When you see someone who really skates well, it is like looking at good art. I had the opportunity a couple of weeks ago to see world class skating. A friend of mine had bought tickets to see 'Stars on ice'. Well, I had heard of the show, but didn't really know any details about who would be performing. I assumed that it would be a group of ice dancers, so to speak, but not anyone you could consider a champion. How wrong I was! The whole group of dancers were Olympic and World gold and silver champions! I couldn't believe it! They had come all the way to little old Wenatchee! You might recognize some of the names: Kurt Browning (4 times World Champion from Canada), Evan Lysaceck (Olympic gold medalist from U.S), and Ekaterina Gordeeva ( 2 times Olympic gold medalist). The performance lasted about 2 hours, with a short intermission. I took my little girl, who was mesmerized by the acrobatics and the beautiful dresses. And the stadium was packed, as you can imagine. There were cheers and claps all the way through as the stars spun in the air and landed flawlessly. I'm sure that young people in the audience were inspired to rent some skates, and go to the next public ice skating session, to wobble around and imagine themselves as stars.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Alps from the plane.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;Many of you have seen some part of the Alps, I suppose. They're spectacular, aren't they? I saw a small part of them recently from a plane. I was traveling from the south of France up to Germany. Luckily, I was sitting next to a window, so I could look at every detail as we flew over. Now, typically, when you take a photo from a plane, it won't come out very well at all. The plane windows aren't the clearest, for sure. And it is impossible to control the light. Add to that the fact that my camera is a little cheapo. I certainly didn't expect to get a good result from any of my pictures taken on the plane. So, I snapped away when I could. When I got home, I looked at what I had taken, deleted most of them and then edited a couple that had come out well. I use an editing software by Google called Picasa. You can do all sorts of things with it. You can crop the photos, which means to cut them. Then you can add color, texture, shadow, and definition. You can even add text, which means writing. One of my photos was taken at a strange angle, so I used the straightening option to give it a better perspective. A couple of years ago I decided to create nice portraits of my children. I looked through our collection of different school photos, and those taken at home. I scanned them into my computer, edited them, saved them onto an SD card, and then printed large versions of them in a sepia tone. Sepia is a lovely dark beige or light brown color that gives the photo a soft, sometimes older look. These photos now hang formally in frames going up the stairs. I'm so thrilled that this software can improve photos. Now I have a beautiful snap shot of the alps that I otherwise would have deleted.</p>

			<title>The York Minster.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The York Minster.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I couldn't visit York Minster without telling you about it. What is a minster? It's the name of a major cathedral that used to be associated with a monastery, and considered the most important building representing the church in a large area. So, okay, it's a cathedral. But, you know what, it's a treat to visit. The city of York is what I call 'the complete package', which means that it has everything that you could want. If you check out york.com, you will see what I mean. It is about as historical as anywhere could ever be, it's a thriving center of education, it has all the facilities and entertainment of a city, but is clean and rural at the same time. York was a strategic political center for hundreds of years. It was founded by the Romans; they called it Eboracum. They used this point as a stepping stone on the way to Scotland. Well, as you know, they didn't manage much in Scotland, but York became fortified and busy. Then, after the Roman Empire fell, Vikings took over. York didn't avoid the Norman invasion either, but became a center of prosperity and trade from then on. When you are there, you can sense the history. It is all around you. The well preserved wall around the center of the city is a great reminder of the Roman presence. In fact there are even remains of Roman shrines to Jupiter and Mars. The cathedral started as far back as the Romans, but obviously not as a cathedral. The Roman buildings which were recently uncovered under the cathedral were stations for some of the 5000 legionaries. With each invasion and different people groups taking over, it was added to. It has survived fires, destruction through invasion, and the civil war. Oh, and you should see it now. It is a Gothic beauty. I walked around it with my sister, and we silently soaked it all in. I know that you don't need to know all of the vocabulary about cathedrals, but a few words are common in conversation. The nave is the large, often central part of the church. There are towers on some, spires on others, with spires looking like cones with a point. In the York Minster there is a crypt, underground, where tombs are kept. You can't go to York without admiring the Rose Window either, which is a spectacular circular stained glass window in the cathedral. I have seen a lot of cathedrals during my travels, but I would say that this should be in the top three of 'must sees' when traveling in Europe.</p>

			<title>Vienna by chance.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vienna by chance.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Have you ever been to Vienna? I was lucky enough to get there by chance during my trip to Europe. How can anyone go to Vienna by chance? Any person with a brain would go there deliberately, right? Well, because I didn't have a lot of time, I had to fly to a different place each day. After visiting a friend in Frankfurt, I flew the next morning to Nice to visit my friend Lorraine. Now, when I had organized my flights back at home, I had chosen the cheapest flights possible. My reasoning was, well, I would be by myself, having an adventure, so I could easily put up with a bit of discomfort, or a few extra airports. My flight from Frankfurt to Nice was not direct. I booked it through Expedia.com, which I have used before. There was to be a short change of plane in Vienna, and then the journey would continue. So, Thursday morning came, and my friend, Blanca, dropped me off at the airport. I noticed that it was quite foggy, but I really didn't pay much attention. I got to the gate just when the announcer told us that the flight would be delayed by about one hour. Mmm, I would be in a big hurry to catch my connecting flight. And, as you can guess, when I arrived at Vienna, my connecting flight had already left, and I was put on a later flight, five hours later. It just so happens that there is a bullet train from the airport into the city. So, before you could blink an eye, I found myself in Stephensplatz, the center of Vienna, gazing at the cathedral wide-eyed and open-mouthed. I say open-mouthed because the architecture is stunning. I walked through the maze of cobbled streets and squares taking pictures and video clips. I rushed into a bakery and bought a pastry; well, everyone was walking around eating pastries! I wanted to fit in! It was a beautiful, sunny day, but very cold. So, I had a good excuse to buy myself a scarf. By the time my four hours in Vienna were up, my feet ached because I had walked non-stop. I would have loved to have stayed longer, of course. But, I contented myself on the plane by resting my feet and having a good look at the photos of my day's adventure.</p>

			<title>Breakfast in Nice.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/breakfast-in-nice-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A double treat for me during my week's vacation, was to visit my dear friend, Lorraine, in Nice. I hadn't seen her for eleven years, which, of course is far too long. But, as you probably know, when you get together with a great friend, even if you haven't seen her for a long time, it is as if you haven't been apart for very long. We stayed up until late, catching up on eachothers' news. Since I had seen her, she had had a little girl, started her own business, and moved several times. We chatted late into the night, and it felt like old times. The next day, although I only had a few hours, she took me out for breakfast. She chose a patisserie that just about blew my socks off. It's display case was so attractive that I asked the owner if I could take a video. Everything was presented so beautifully. And there was just about everything you could imagine, when it comes to baked goods. Believe it or not, I actually didn't have a pastry with my coffee! I know, I know, it was an opportunity that I shouldn't have missed, but I like savory in the morning. So, I had a delicious ham and cheese baguette instead. This time of year in Nice is perfect; it's sunny but not hot, so we sat out and enjoyed the view while we chatted. Afterwards, Lorraine drove along the coastal road, pointing out famous landmarks, and showing me the different areas where she used to live. Nice is so clean and pretty. For someone coming from the cold and dark, it was like a large dose of medicine. We went down to the port, where lots of yachts are moored. She showed me where the Microsoft yacht is. It's massive of course. Lorraine took my photo next to it, just so I can show off and tell people about it. I actually don't know what I would do with a huge yacht like that. It would be a nightmare to clean! I would probably sell it, and with a small portion of the money I'd make, I would fly all of my friends and family to Nice for a two week tour of all the patisseries.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[A double treat for me during my week's vacation, was to visit my dear friend, Lorraine, in Nice. I hadn't seen her for eleven years, which, of course is far too long. But, as you probably know, when you get together with a great friend, even if you haven't seen her for a long time, it is as if you haven't been apart for very long. We stayed up until late, catching up on eachothers' news. Since I had seen her, she had had a little girl, started her own business, and moved several times. We chatted late into the night, and it felt like old times. The next day, although I only had a few hours, she took me out for breakfast. She chose a patisserie that just about blew my socks off. It's display case was so attractive that I asked the owner if I could take a video. Everything was presented so beautifully. And there was just about everything you could imagine, when it comes to baked goods. Believe it or not, I actually didn't have a pastry with my coffee! I know, I know, it was an opportunity that I shouldn't have missed, but I like savory in the morning. So, I had a delicious ham and cheese baguette instead. This time of year in Nice is perfect; it's sunny but not hot, so we sat out and enjoyed the view while we chatted. Afterwards, Lorraine drove along the coastal road, pointing out famous landmarks, and showing me the different areas where she used to live. Nice is so clean and pretty. For someone coming from the cold and dark, it was like a large dose of medicine. We went down to the port, where lots of yachts are moored. She showed me where the Microsoft yacht is. It's massive of course. Lorraine took my photo next to it, just so I can show off and tell people about it. I actually don't know what I would do with a huge yacht like that. It would be a nightmare to clean! I would probably sell it, and with a small portion of the money I'd make, I would fly all of my friends and family to Nice for a two week tour of all the patisseries.
Grammar notes.
Expressions: When it comes to, to show off, to get together.
1. She is a master at arranging flowers. When it comes to decorating entryways, she is the most creative.
2. He is such a show-off! He is always talking about his latest purchases and how much they cost.
3. The reunion was a real success. It was a get together that we will all remember.]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Free hugs in London.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/free-hugs-in-london-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone. I'm so pleased to be back, podcasting to you again after my week of fun in Europe.<br />I have lots to tell, as you can imagine. I saw some amazing places on my trip, and had a very meaningful <br />and inspirational time. So, where should I start? I'm a fairly emotional person, deep down,so I'll start<br />this podcast by telling you about something that I love to do, and found myself doing right in the middle<br />of London. It was on Saturday, a lovely sunny but chilly 12th of February, when I had arrived in London<br />with my husband from Berlin. We immediately went to our hotel in Leicester square, put our luggage in our<br />room, and met up with my father and his wife. They had come down to see family in London, so it was a perfect<br />coincidence that I was going to be there. As you might know, central London is very 'walker friendly', meaning that basically it's great to walk around, and you can easily get from one major, famous spot to the next. We walked to Trafalgar square. I snapped away with my camera as we all chatted. There was quite a crowd in the square. Amnesty International had a big, peaceful rally going on, which is similar to a demonstration. There was a lot of music, and different groups representing their causes. The group that caught my eye, however, was a tiny one of only two people. Their signs said 'Free Hugs'. Well, how could I refuse? A free hug, and from perfect strangers, .....what better way to make world peace? So I dove in and gave the two lovely guys a good old hug. In retrospect, I should have asked their names. They might start a hugging revolution, right there in Trafalgar&nbsp;square. Can you imagine, with all the different people from every corner of the world, hugging? That would be absolutely fantastic. Perhaps it would spread throughout London and into the Houses of Parliament...; imagine the changes that could take place there if people started to hug. I'm sure the MPs would make better decisions, and pass better laws. They could start each parliamentary&nbsp;meeting by doing the conga, and having a big hugging session. I think those two fellas giving free hugs in London are a couple of geniuses.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expressions</span></p>
<p>To do the Conga, what better way to..., fella/ fellow, a good old ....</p>
<p>1. The Conga is a dance where you line up, holding eachother's waists, and kick your legs to the side as you move forward to the music.</p>
<p>2. 'What better way' is like saying 'There is no better way'. Ex: What better way to relax than in a warm bath.</p>
<p>3. 'Fella' is English for 'guy'. It is the short form of 'fellow', and is similar to 'chap' which is more antiquated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ex: He's a nice fella, isn't he?</p>
<p>4. 'A good old hug; a good old arm wrestle; a good old pot of stew; a good old roaring fire.' Good old can be added to give a sense of endearment to a thing or an activity. It is also used sarcastically when you mean the opposite of something being good. Ex: Nothing like a good old invasion to mess everything up!</p>]]></description>

			<title>A Sixth Grade Experiment.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-sixth-grade-experiment-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Before I start today's podcast, I would like to mention a little something about the title of yesterday's podcast. One of my listeners, called Bahareh, asked me to explain the expression Super Duper Slither Scooter. First of all, the scooter is just the thing that you ride. Slither is the brand name of it; you could call it 'The Slither'. Super Duper is a silly phrase that we use to say that something is wonderful. We also use it sarcastically. Most often, super duper indicates that something is brand new, or of good quality, or just quite special. And, of course, the two words rhyme, which makes it a little more playful in speech. "My father bought a super duper car" is less serious or formal than "my father bought an elegant, expensive car". I hope that is clear. Anyway, the sixth grade science experiment found its way into my kitchen. I discovered it sitting on the counter top. There was a strange smell in the air, something unpleasant and sharp smelling. So I looked around, and there it was. It was a glass with an egg floating in white vinegar. Okay, that makes sense. My son, Hudson, has started to learn about the Periodic table, the different elements, the molecules, and how they interact. I remember many years ago doing the same thing in science class. If my dim memory serves me well, the experiment showed how the calcium carbonate of the egg shell dissolves in the vinegar. I think that's right. So, my son is bringing home all sorts of instructions for kitchen experiments. He has to carry them out, and then write down his observations. He loves it. It reminds me of a story my husband told me about when his cousins were young. They made a concoction in the kitchen that ended up blowing up. They were very lucky that they didn't get seriously hurt. They charred the kitchen ceiling, and singed off their eyebrows. Unsupervised kids are a recipe for disaster. Thankfully, Hudsons' eyebrows are safely on his face, and I am keeping a close eye on his experiments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes</span>.</p>
<p>Expressions: to singe, concoction, someone's memory serves them well, to char.</p>
<p>1. The coal fell out of the fireplace and singed the carpet.</p>
<p>2. What kind of concoction is this drink; it's disgusting!</p>
<p>3. I remember that day; my memory serves me well.</p>
<p>4. The walls had been charred black by the fire.</p>]]></description>

			<title>A Super Duper Slither Scooter.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-super-dooper-sluther-scooter-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's time to rock and roll. Glide, wobble, balance, and slither. Let's try something new to get ourselves moving. Did you know that the part of the&nbsp;brain that deals with balance, also deals with focus? Isn't that interesting. An educational specialist told me that the other day. One of my sons is going to see her each week to increase his reading abilities. I am really intrigued to see what she will do, and what the effects will be. I would like to pick her brains. One of the things that she recommends for children who need to control their focus, are balancing exercises. So, another trip to Walmart, and we have a Slither scooter. It's a super duper one. It's actually a combination of two things: a regular scooter, and a rip stick. I won't go into detail about what a rip stick is because it will actually take too long, but I think you get the gist. If you check out one of my previous podcast, 'A Refreshing Park', you will get more of an idea about what a rip stick is. So, we have the box in the kitchen, and my two oldest pounce on it like a couple of cougars. They immediately tear the box open, and start putting the thing together. "Shouldn't you read the instructions?" I ask them. My experience is that males will often put something together, and then later have to take it apart and start all over again, this time reading the instructions. I could be wrong though, ....... I shouldn't generalize, so you men out there, please don't get offended. But of course, mothers are always wrong, right? So, I let them get stuck at one point, and then intervened, pushing the instruction manual under their noses. And guess what happened? They followed the instructions, and put it together correctly! Mmm, am I making my point clearly? Anyway, they all tried the super dooper Slither scooter on our driveway. They described it as "cool", "difficult", "awesome", and "tricky". That means that they like it. I'm going to try it tomorrow to see if it will help me to super duper up my focus.</p>

			<title>Entertainment at half time.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/entertainment-at-half-time-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Entertainment at half-time is a big deal over here. Whenever you go to a college level or professional level sporting event, there is entertainment half way through the game. I saw some interesting half-time performances the other day in Spokane. My family and I had gone with my in-laws to see Whitworth's men's basketball against Lewis and Clark. Three&nbsp;of my husband's&nbsp;second cousins&nbsp;actually play on the Whitworth team, so there was an added incentive to go. &nbsp;At the moment, Whitworth's team is second place in the nation, as far as college level goes. And Lewis and Clark have only been defeated by them. The rivalry was quite intense. I actually have never seen players play so hard. Both teams were really trying to win. Someone made a good point, that at the college level, you often see a better game because the players are so intense. At the professional level, often there is a lot of showmanship, and playing for the crowd. Anyway, half time came, and there were two performances. One was a modern dance troup who performed to rap music. The other was a group of little girls who looked like fairies. They danced in a fairly modern style to a song entitled 'It's all about me'. It was perfect for the age of the girls who were dancing, because, after all, they are really into themselves. It would have been great if my daughter had been there. I'm sure that she would have come home, dressed herself up, and danced to the same song. Mind you, it's a good job that she didn't because we didn't get home until after 1am. Spokane is three hours away from Wenatchee, so all together, its a long trip. And, on top of the distance that we had to drive, there were thick patches of fog on the highway, so getting to the game was an ordeal! But, when there is a good game going on, you have to find a way to get there. And when you do, there is not just a great game, but also&nbsp;some half-time entertainment.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes</span>.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: intense, fairy, ordeal.</p>
<p>1. This chocolate is 90% cocoa; the taste is intense.</p>

			<title>The Reptile Man.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/the-reptile-man-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, the Reptile Man came to visit my kids' elementary school. It is a very worthwhile show to watch. The owner of the Reptile Man business, and the Washington Serpentarium is Scott Peterson. You could say that he is an advocate for reptiles of all kinds. He is based in Monroe, in the Seattle area. His business is open 365 days a year, and speaking at schools is part of his commitment to spreading the word about how necessary and wonderful reptiles are. He is very informative, having studied zoology in college. And he has a very calm, soothing voice. And that's just as well, because when he is holding up a venomous snake, or an alligator in a room full of people, he has to keep everyone calm. I have seen him before, and I've also visited his serpentarium. However, each time I see his show, I learn something new. At one point, for example, he held up Lucy the alligator, telling us many facts about the animal. I didn't know that alligators never stop growing, and can reach up to 1000 lbs in weight. Lucy is just a baby, and was raised as a new born by Mr. Peterson. In fact, he raises all his animals from newborns or eggs; he doesn't keep any wild-born animals. All of his venomous snakes have had their venom sacks removed, obviously for the safety of everyone around them. And, talking about snakes, he has many, many kinds, including the deadly black mamba, cobras, and&nbsp;rattle snakes, and the non-venomous pythons, anacondas, and boas.&nbsp;I also didn't realize just how important snakes are because of&nbsp;their diet. They&nbsp;mainly eat rodents, and that saves us all from diseases and a lack of crops. One of the animals that I liked best was the&nbsp;African tortoise. They&nbsp;can live up to 200 years. I was able to pet the one he&nbsp;brought. It was amazing. It's shell was thick and hard like rock. In fact, you can drive a car over one and it won't be crushed; it is that strong! Lions&nbsp;try to eat them, and have to give up, because they cannot penetrate the touch shells. It really was quite a show. The children and parents loved it. I recommend his website too, at : reptileman.com. Enjoy!</p>

			<title>Progress at Walmart.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/progress-at-walmart-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm so used to going to Walmart, that I could probably get there with my eyes closed. It's two blocks away from our house, so it's the perfect place for a quick shop stop. There have been renovations going on there for several months now. It started out with heavy machinery digging up a large section of the parking lot, then scaffolding on the outside, and lots of building noises. I happened to pop in the other day to buy some basic essentials, like milk and bread, when I realized that things had progressed somewhat. Where I usually walk in, was locked. It looked derelict actually, as the entryway sign had been taken down. And where there had been covered scaffolding, a new entryway was on display. It isn't quite finished yet; the sign is actually just a hanging sign. However, the entryway is usable; people were walking in and out, there were several drink dispensing machines there, and a lot more room. In true 'buy some stuff' style, the entryway was full of tasty, unhealthy treats like chips and coke, stacked like a tunnel that you had to walk through to get to the rest of the store. I'm actually excited about the rest of walmart being finished, because it will cut my shopping experience in half. After I shop at walmart, I always have to go somewhere else for fresh fruit and vegetables. Poor me! I always seem to be in a hurry, so shopping in one place&nbsp;will be convenient. I'm not sure what the other shops in town will do when Walmart becomes a 'super store'. Competition is healthy, but that is easy to say if you <em>don't</em> own a shop in the same town as Walmart. The reason I'm talking for the second time about Walmart is because it's a 'big deal' over here; it is a monstrous business that keeps its customers because of its unbeatable prices. Its slogan is "Save money. Live better." That is simple and straight to the point, isn't it! So, let's see if, in the near future, their grand re-opening lives up to their tremendous reputation.</p>

			<title>A nocturnal visit by deer.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-nocturnal-visit-by-the-deer-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Wow! What a shot! I have been hoping to get a photo or a video of deer to show all of you. This time of year is crazy with the deer coming down from the nearby mountains. They are all over the place, and&nbsp;obviously very comfortable in town. I think the fact that there are orchards here and there in town help. They sleep in the orchards, and have plenty to eat there. Then at night they walk around the neighborhoods, looking for more tasty treats. It just so happens that a favorite spot for some of them is our property! A few years ago, we found three of them sleeping on our back porch! Now, however, we have dogs, so they keep away. The two dogs that we have live in the back garden. It is a large area that is fenced in, ideal for dogs. So now, we don't have any deer visitors in the back garden. Our dogs do, however, alert us as soon as they smell them approach. Infact, they bark like crazy and drive everybody nuts. It doesn't happen during the day, because the deer only come around at night. We have often had to put the dogs in the garage at 3am because of the noise. We don't want to make enemies of our neighbors. I can see that deer have been hanging out in our front yard because there are hoof prints and droppings everywhere. One of my neighbor friends told me that she saw a large herd of deer walk up the road, and settle in my front garden where we have alpine trees. When I was pulling up to the house the other night, my headlights flashed in the eyes of three deer who were happily munching away at the plants near my entryway. The dogs were barking, of course, but the deer seemed to know that the noisey want-to-be-wolves couldn't get out. I drove towards the deer very slowly, illuminating them. Their ears pricked up and they turned to face me. Then, they gracefully turned and walked into the darkness. It doesn't happen very much, but when it does, it is so worth watching.</p>

<p>1. The alarm alerted us to the fire that had started in the kitchen.</p>

			<title>Shooting skeet.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/shooting-skeet-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of skeet shooting, or perhaps clay pigeon shooting? Well, we are beginning to do it. Having&nbsp; been inspired by his grandfather in Scotland, my son Cass caught the bug. Doing it once when we went to stay with my father last summer just wasn't enough for him. When we returned to Wenatchee, he brought with him two of 'Grandad's' shooting magazines. I, at first, tried not to think about guns; I don't know much about them, and quite frankly, they scare me. However, my dad has been a hunter all of his life, and is an example of using guns responsibly, and only for hunting or clay pigeon shooting. My husband decided to try skeet shooting recently. He bought a couple of shot guns, ammunition, and a skeet thrower. So we are set. We have everything that we need. It just so happens that guns are very popular in this part of the country. Many men hunt deer, wild turkey, or even bear and cougar. A lot of them are very skilled, and even become bow hunters. There are several gun shops in town, gun sections in major stores, and all sorts of clubs to join. Having seen my father shoot birds while I was young, I feel that <em>that </em>would be a reasonable kind of hunting. You can eat the birds as well. Bringing down a larger animal, however, doesn't appeal to me at all. I'm certainly not an expert, nor do I intend to be. I'll leave that to the people who know what they're doing. For now, starting out skeet shooting, learning all about safety issues, the equipment, and how to aim, are enough for me. We went to a shooting range at the weekend. It is a simple place, a couple of miles from our house, up towards the mountains. You have to have a club key to unlock the gate and get in, and then you drive to either a pistol range, a rifle range, or a shotgun range. The place was empty when we went. It is still very cold outside, so I'm sure a lot of the regular shooters were staying at home. And yes, I actually had a go. It was funny though. Looking back now, I realise that I was standing in the wrong position, my head was uncomfortably leaning on the gun, and I barely knew which eye to close in order to look down the barrel. I must have looked ridiculous! However, my husband and my son gave me all the advice I needed to stand and aim properly, and that made a difference. I didn't manage to hit any skeets, but at least I feel that I'm a step closer to aiming and firing.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I hope that this never happens to you. You're driving along, minding your own business, when suddenly your car stops. It could be because of engine trouble, or because of something in the road that is preventing the car from moving. I spotted this poor man the other day as I was pulling onto the main road. He was digging the snow out from around his tires. The trouble was, he wasn't parked on the side of the road. He was right in the middle of the main road, with two lanes of traffic on either side of him. He was in the turn lane. That is where the snow plows pile up the snow from the rest of the road. And that is where, if your wheels aren't&nbsp; big enough, and your engine isn't strong enough, you get stuck. I was relieved to see that there was another man with him who was also digging around the wheels of the little truck. Lucky for them, they had shovels. Who ever carries shovels in the car when you drive? If I got stuck like that,&nbsp;I would have to dig myself out with my shoe, or the cup holder of the car.&nbsp;It must have been something to do with their job. They were both dressed in the same uniform, and I could make out that there was a company name on the vehicle. I had to drive off before I saw them dig themselves free. They're not there now, so their efforts paid off. I remember getting 'stranded' on a road once. It wasn't because of snow, either. It was years ago. I was driving my husband's Chevy truck across the large, main bridge. It was a great day, I was listening to music, I had the window down; everything was perfect. Then, suddenly, the truck started to slow down. Before I knew it, I had pulled over to the hard shoulder. A few cars beeped me as they passed. The traffic speed was fifty, and I was doing zero. I had been too busy enjoying the wind blowing through my hair, to notice that the fuel level was blinking 'empty'. Oops! Thankfully, my brother-in-law came to the rescue with a canister of gas, and I was able to complete my trip and get home. How embarrassing! That was a mistake that I won't forget.</p>

			<title>Black and white snow.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/black-and-white-snow-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a strange sight. You get so used to seeing the lovely clean snow falling, and getting piled up on the side of the road. But then, all of a sudden, it seems, that beautiful stuff has turned ugly. I was driving to the shops the other day, when I drove past a huge pile of snow that had recently been dumped there by a snow plow. There seemed to be no mix of the colors at all. The black snow was, obviously, the snow that had been right on the road. It had all kinds of grit, gravel, and dirt mixed in. The white snow was from the most recent fall, which had been heavy. This season creates quite a lot of work around the town. There are snow plows busy every day, moving this pile of snow, clearing that neighborhood, or turning three lanes of traffic into two. I can hear them drive into our neighborhood early in the morning. Beep, beep, beep, I hear as they back up. Their lights flash to make it obvious that they are here. Some people actually make good money by mowing lawns during the warmer months, and then snow plowing during the snowy months. I've got a little 'putt-putt-putt' snow blower for clearing our driveway. I've used it enough to realize that it is super easy. Just follow the instructions, turn the different knobs, push a few buttons, and pull a cord very hard, and it's ready to blow. You just have to make sure that you concentrate, otherwise it's easy to blow a load of snow at your own house or garage. That defeats the object! So, we have a couple of more months to deal with this white stuff. I don't mind using the snow blower on it when it is pretty and clean, but I wouldn't like to deal with the dirty stuff, yuck!</p>

			<title>After school.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/after-school-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>One part of my daily routine during the week is to pick up the kids from school. I'm sure that a lot of you listening now probably do the same thing. Thankfully, I live very close to the school where three of my children go. It's literally a three minute drive from my house. My kids used to catch the bus home, but, interestingly enough, it would take them an hour to get home. We decided that it was a bit of a waste of time sitting on a bus for an hour, when they could be at home relaxing or doing homework. So, now you can find me sitting in the line of cars, waiting for my little ones to come running out. I watch the school buses pull up to the sidewalk, just in front of the kindergarten block. The children who&nbsp;take the bus have to line up outside a little earlier than the rest of the kids; they wouldn't want to miss the bus. Some of the students live far away, so it's a good job that the buses are available. Other children live quite close to the school, so they can simply walk home. There is an interesting system of road safety to get the kids safely across the various roads on the way to and from school. The oldest students in the school, the fifth graders, put a bright green vest on, bring out green plastic models of children that stand on the road near the cross walks, and they help the younger children cross the roads in a safe manner. Cars are supposed to stop at a cross walk anyway, if there are people there. So, that is the system. I sit in my car and wait for the bell. I love to see how the masses of children pour out of the building; they spill out like different colored beads, going everywhere, and of course, making lots of noise. The parents put their magazines away, or put their cell phones down, start up the cars, and get ready for the kids. It's time to hand out some snacks, and to hear the stories about how the day went.</p>

			<title>Wok with me.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/wok-with-me-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever fancy eating something really fresh? Something savory, healthy, and tasty? I'm so thankful that there is a place in town where we can get food that is just like that. It's a restaurant called the Wok-About-Grill. It is a play on words. You might already know that a wok is a special kind of frying pan used in Asian cooking. And, because 'to walk about' is an English phrase, the owners of the restaurant decided to change 'walk' to 'wok'. Anyway, it's a cool place. When you walk in, you immediately smell the wonderful stir fries. It's a simple place, but very clean, and nearly always packed. The main idea about the Wok, is that you put the raw vegetables, meat, and uncooked noodles that you want on your plate. Then you add oils, garlic, condiments, and sauces as you like. You hand the plate to one of a group of cooks who puts everything in your bowl on a large, round, cooking surface. After tossing and scraping it for a few minutes, he then sweeps all the cooked food into a new, clean bowl, and there you have your food. It's a smart set up. Think about it: you do some of the work, so the staff can concentrate on cleaning up rather than getting orders of different food. Plus, as a customer, you don't feel as if you are waiting for your food because you experience your meal happen, instead of sitting at a table and not being involved in the process. In this culture of fast food, and other restaurants that use pre-prepared food, it is refreshing to know that what you eat is fresh, fresh, fresh. If you fancy a stirfry that has loads of garlic and onion, then that's what you have. If you want just vegetables and no meat, no problem. I usually have lots of vegetables, some beef, and no noodles. So, the owner must be happy knowing that, with this system, the customer is always satisfied.</p>

			<title>A new camcorder.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-new-camcorder-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, it was about time that I got myself a camcorder, a decent one. I have been meaning to for a long time. The app that I have has bonus content which can either be an extra audio file, or a video. Until now, I have not really offered this bonus material because my little camera that takes pictures and videos, does not make quality videos at all. So, I took the plunge. What was I looking for then? Firstly, I wanted something that was easy to use. I also really didn't want anything big. I thought that if I could fit it in my handbag, then I would be happy. And, finally, I wanted something of quality. So, bearing these three things in mind, I drove to Walmart, and went to the electronic department. They mainly had cameras. There were the regular cheapo ones, all the way up to Nikons. Well, I didn't want to spend that much. A friend of mine recommended that I get just a camcorder, not a camera that also takes videos. "A video taking camera could compromise quality," he said. I took his advice. There were only two camcorders to choose from. Both were the same size, shape, and quality. They both had a USB plug to download directly into a computer. However, the slightly more expensive one had HD quality picture, and a stabilizing capability, so when you walk or run while filming, the video doesn't jump around and get blurry. Bingo! I finally got what I needed. I am thrilled with my new device. I'm looking forward to adding video to my apps to become more of&nbsp;an expert producer. I have used my camcorder already: at my son's basketball game, and in a restaurant. One of the cool options is to plug it into our television to see what I have recorded on a big screen. I can also send decent videos to family and friends around the world through email. I'm feeling very proud of myself; I feel like I've caught up to the twenty first century!</p>

			<title>How much for postage?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/how-much-for-postage-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today, I&nbsp; found in my bag forty stamps that I had bought around Christmas time, and not used. I had bought them for mailing Christmas cards, but this year, for some odd reason, I didn't mail out any cards at all. I usually do. I must have just completely forgotten. Anyway, I'm keeping them with my stationary and office supplies for sending off bills. One thing that I have noticed about stamps is how they increase in price every year. Mailing, or posting letters as we say in England, is becoming more and more expensive. Living far away from friends and family doesn't help either. My mother recently sent off a package of Christmas presents to my sister; we shared the cost of the package, and it is just as well. The postage generally costs more than the value of what you are sending! Then there are all the different options you can choose for the freight. There is Federal Express which is super speedy and very costly. US postal service offers regular delivery, next day air mail (for national deliveries), or mail with tracking. A few days ago my mother also sent a small package to my brother who lives in New Zealand. She was told in the post office that it would cost eighty nine dollars. "What?" she replied. "Why so expensive?" was her next question. Apparently, they had added the tracking charge which was the majority of the total cost. "Forget about the tracking," she said. "Just send it the cheapest way possible." They did, and the price was only one tenth of the original cost. The world of mail is fascinating. When you think of how we manage to communicate with and send things to&nbsp;people on the other side of the planet, and most of the time with success, it is quite impressive! Yes, there are disasters with mail getting lost, held up, or broken, but most of the time, our precious packages arrive on time and in one piece.</p>

			<title>How do they do that?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/how-do-they-do-that-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever come across anything that someone has done that has made you wonder how on earth they had managed to do it? I've often wondered about how on earth window washers manage to clean the windows of high rise buildings, or how traffic controllers in airports manage to organize flights into and out of the airports so that all of the planes land and take off safely. There are jobs out there that we sometimes don't even realize exist, and the tasks involved in that job are either difficult or unusual. I haven't really got a stomach for heights, so I am always impressed when I see a job that has been done way up high somewhere, where most people would choose not to go. The other day when we were walking around Leavenworth, my husband suddenly said, "Gees, look at that. How did they do that?" He pointed to christmas lights that had been wound around tree branches in the central high street area. The trees were litterally covered all the way up to the top of the branches. Now, this might not sound like much, but you have to remember that Leavenworth is a huge tourist attraction, especially around Christmas time. There is a special lighting festival that is repeated a few times. The bavarian style buildings are beautifully decorated with lights, and the trees, which measure at least fifty feet, are also covered. I'm talking about every branch, from the bottom to the top. So, how do they do that? And, who are the they? They must be people who don't mind climbing up extremely tall ladders, up to the tree tops, or perhaps, hanging from a crane. Do they do this every year, or are the lights kept up all year long? I wonder how much they get paid. I would certainly not be a good candidate for that kind of job. I can just see me the first day of work, half way up, clinging hold of the ladder for dear life, crying for mama. I wouldn't be a useful employee.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Have you ever come across anything that someone has done that has made you wonder how on earth they had managed to do it? I've often wondered about how on earth window washers manage to clean the windows of high rise buildings, or how traffic controllers in airports manage to organize flights into and out of the airports so that all of the planes land and take off safely. There are jobs out there that we sometimes don't even realize exist, and the tasks involved in that job are either difficult or unusual. I haven't really got a stomach for heights, so I am always impressed when I see a job that has been done way up high somewhere, where most people would choose not to go. The other day when we were walking around Leavenworth, my husband suddenly said, "Gees, look at that. How did they do that?" He pointed to christmas lights that had been wound around tree branches in the central high street area. The trees were litterally covered all the way up to the top of the branches. Now, this might not sound like much, but you have to remember that Leavenworth is a huge tourist attraction, especially around Christmas time. There is a special lighting festival that is repeated a few times. The bavarian style buildings are beautifully decorated with lights, and the trees, which measure at least fifty feet, are also covered. I'm talking about every branch, from the bottom to the top. So, how do they do that? And, who are the they? They must be people who don't mind climbing up extremely tall ladders, up to the tree tops, or perhaps, hanging from a crane. Do they do this every year, or are the lights kept up all year long? I wonder how much they get paid. I would certainly not be a good candidate for that kind of job. I can just see me the first day of work, half way up, clinging hold of the ladder for dear life, crying for mama. I wouldn't be a useful employee. The trees would be beautifully decorated for the first six feet, but that would be it; I couldn't go any further.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been sledding? In places where it is snowy, I think it is a great thing to do. In a way it is as good as, or even better than skiing; I'll tell you why. First of all, you don't need any skill at all to sled. Secondly, if it is speed that you love, you can easily find a way to meet your need for speed. Thirdly, there is no expense involved, and hardly any equipment at all. The best kind of sledding I have ever done was on an inner tube. An inner tube is a circular tube that is made of rubber, and made to go inside a wheel. It is very bouncy and comfortable to sit on, and protects you from landing hard on the ground. A few years ago, I went sledding with my brother who had come over from New Zealand for a visit. We took an inner tube up to Mission Ridge, which is the ski resort of this town. We found an empty slope that went through a bit of the forest and up an embankment. It was safe, secluded, and provided an easy way to slow down at the end. Perfect. On the way up there, I stopped at Goodwill to pick up a second hand pair of ski pants, as I didn't have any. Once we were both ready, we set off, and within about twenty minutes we were out of the car, and scoping out the area for the best place to sled. Now, my brother is a very big guy, tall, broad, and much heavier than me. He made the first few runs. His big body on the big inner tube smoothed the snow down perfectly, making a track for us to use. It was so much fun. We laughed our heads off. The best runs were when we went together. Because of our combined weight, we picked up tremendous speed, and literally flew over the bumps on the track. Oh, I forgot to add a fourth reason to sled; you do actually do a lot of exercise. Once you have reached the bottom, you have to pull your inner tube back up to the top of the hill again, and again, and again. By the end of the day, we were exhausted, not only from the exercise, but also from all the laughter.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's great to be back podcasting to you again. I had a lovely Christmas break with my family, and now have plenty to podcast about. I actually have had a problem of no internet connection for about four days which has been very frustrating. When that happens, it makes me feel as if I live in the middle of nowhere, or 'in the boondocks' as they say over here. Well, I'm up and running again. My husband took Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the following week off, so we have been spending time together, and going on short day trips. Leavenworth, as you probably know, is the nearest 'hot spot' for anything touristy. It's much smaller than Wenatchee, and totally different. We took the children there a couple of days ago. It was snowy and very festive looking, and thankfully not too cold. What most people do in Leavenworth is: walk around the main, high street block, go into one of the many restaurants, and shop. There is a river and a park very close to the main street, and as we walked past it, I noticed people cross country skiing right there in the park. It is a very pretty rural area, and bears are regularly seen even in the park itself! Well, they're hibernating now, so there is no reason to be scared. It was fun window shopping with the children. It was also great to see such a mix of ethnicities in such a small town. Leavenworth attracts people from all over the world who happen to be up in the North West. One of the shops that we actually bought something from, was the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. I have often walked past this shop without going in. But this time we went in, and I'm very pleased that we did. The store smelled wonderful, and there was a long display case full of different chocolates and bonbons of all shapes and sizes. Everything was beautifully arranged. At first, I think, my kids didn't realize that they could choose something to eat at all. I had to say, "Go on, choose something." They each chose a treat which, by the time we left the shop, was already partly eaten.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>About nine years ago, I had some incredible luck in a local charity shop. It was coming up to Christmas, and I had gone to Goodwill to look around at all the second hand decorations, ornaments, and housewares. As I wandered up and down the aisle, taking my time to look at the hundreds of items that were for sale, I came across a house. It was a ceramic, Christmas-style house. I picked it up and examined it. It looked like an old English pub with several people here and there playing outside in the snow. There is a frozen pond next to it, trees, and a water wheel. I had seen this sort of decoration before, but brand new in the local stores. They are normally very expensive, as they light up. They often have moving parts, and play music. In a little plastic bag, attached to the item by some sticky tape, was a wire with a plug. I decided to take a chance. Normally, electronic items that are sold in charity stores are not to be trusted. They are often donated specifically because they don't work anymore. I bought it. After cleaning it up at home, I plugged it in. I reasoned that even if it didn't work, it looked festive and pretty. So, with fingers crossed I turned it on. It worked. If I push the button in one direction, lots of twinkiling lights come on that change color. If it is pushed in the opposite direction, lights and music come on, and the frozen pond turns around. The frozen pond is probably the reason that this house was donated. It had two skating figures, but one had his head missing, and the other lacked an arm and a leg. Thankfully, you can buy extra little figures in different stores, so I bought an extra snowman and boy. I very carefully twisted off the broken figures, and replaced them with the new ones. With a little help from superglue, the pond scene looked as good as new. My children would spend ages staring at it as its colors changed. They loved talking about all the details, like a story being told. It's a Christmas scene that I look forward to pulling out of the storage box, and putting on display each year.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have missed a couple of podcasts this week, oops! So here is the first of the two, a little late. My reason for writing this podcast late is that I've been spending time researching my options, as far as the education of my two youngest. They are in a normal elementary school which I like very much, and where they receive quite a lof of Spanish instructions. I'm thrilled that they have that extra benefit, as most elementary schools around here only teach English. But recently, I have discovered that my youngest son has a visual problem. He has what is called visual dislexia. It is not the well-known dislexia. When a child with this problem reads black writing on a white background,&nbsp;his eyes struggle to see clearly. The contrast is too much for&nbsp;his or&nbsp;her&nbsp;photoreceptors. Now that he has been diagnosed, he has green glasses to wear which really help him to see text clearly. I'm so thankful that we found out about his eye condition while he is young. Because this affects reading and writing, I have considered homeschooling him for the rest of the year. There is also a part-time support school where the classes are much smaller, and there are less transitions. I could teach him one-on-one which would give him an opportunity to really catch up. However, he is very happy in school, has lots of friends, and really likes a few of his teachers. So, what do I do? What is the best decision to make? I spoke to many people who homeschool, and asked a lot of questions. I thought, perhaps that my daughter who is in kindergarten could also be homeschooled and go to the part-time support school. I planned on creating exciting lessons for them, and of course, involving other children. So, I informed the principal of their school. All I had to do was sign some papers and that would be that. Well, as soon as I had made that decision, I started to change my mind. It was a struggle. I went back and forth, back and forth, thinking and rethinking. So finally, I went back to the school and told the principal that I had changed my mind. I will keep my kids in school, but have them at home a couple of mornings a week to teach them myself. He gave me a wary look, shook my hand, and politely went back to his office to change his records. Well, I'm a woman, right. Changing my mind all the time is what I'm supposed to do, isn't it? The important thing is that I do what is best for my kids. So, if they can stand to be around their back and forth mother a bit more than usual, I shouldn't have to change my mind for a while.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We spent a noisy night on Saturday at the local arena. We had tickets to go and see a basketball match between the two big local rivals, Wenatchee and Eastmont. We were lucky enough to have box seats, so we were up high with a good view. We took all of the kids, and met up with my husband's brother's family, and another set of friends. We snacked and chatted while the match played. To tell you the truth, I didn't pay much attention to the game; I was more interested in catching up with my sister-in-law and my friend. I would hear comments every now and then from the men about the game. The Eastmont band was just below our box. Whenever they would play, it was loud. The atmosphere was exciting; there was definitely a spirit of competition in the arena that night. Before the game started, a group of students from each high school shot baskets, to see who would make the most. Wenatchee won by a small margin. I'm sure nerves of the event affected the accuracy of the shots. There were quite a few sporty looking, tall young men shooting baskets, but they only did as well as the girls. At half time, there was a dance performance by a large group of local young girls. It was a sort of hip-hop style which went down well with the audience. And then, of course, there were the cheer leaders doing their thing, their arrangement of kicks, moves, and claps. It was a spectacle, as is to be expected of these arena events. While we were there, it snowed heavily. At one point, I went down to the first floor to get a bite to eat, and, as I walked past the windows, I was amazed at the large, thick snowflakes falling. It made the occasion feel special. This weekend, we have tickets to see a country singer called Clint Black, so I'm sure I will be podcasting about that experience.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[We spent a noisy night on Saturday at the local arena. We had tickets to go and see a basketball match between the two big local rivals, Wenatchee and Eastmont. We were lucky enough to have box seats, so we were up high with a good view. We took all of the kids, and met up with my husband's brother's family, and another set of friends. We snacked and chatted while the match played. To tell you the truth, I didn't pay much attention to the game; I was more interested in catching up with my sister-in-law and my friend. I would hear comments every now and then from the men about the game. The Eastmont band was just below our box. Whenever they would play, it was loud. The atmosphere was exciting; there was definitely a spirit of competition in the arena that night. Before the game started, a group of students from each high school shot baskets, to see who would make the most. Wenatchee won by a small margin. I'm sure nerves of the event affected the accuracy of the shots. There were quite a few sporty looking, tall young men shooting baskets, but they only did as well as the girls.

			<title>Gingerbread houses.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/gingerbread-houses-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Aren't holiday traditions great! I'm always fascinated by the many ways that people of different cultures celebrate special times. We use symbols, songs, colors, food, actions, religious rituals, and get togethers to express our humanity. And we all do it. When you think of just how different all of the countries on this planet are, how our histories have shaped us, and how we have developed our own traditions, looking at how we celebrate special occasions is similar to looking through a magnifying glass at us. Our celebrations reveal a lot about us. One of the traditions that we have adopted from other cultures is to decorate gingerbread houses around Christmas time. Gingerbread dates back to the early Greeks and Egyptians who used it in ceremonies. Monks brought ginger to France in 10th century. But it wasn't until around 11th century that crusaders brought ginger back to Europe from the Middle East. An early recipe for gingerbread was ground almonds, dry bread crumbs, rosewater, sugar, and ginger. This was pressed into wooden molds that depicted the news of that time, a bit like small edible newspaper. In the 16th century, the English replaced the bread crumbs with flour, and added eggs, making a lighter bread. The first gingerbread man is credited to Queen Elizabeth 1, who impressed visitors with gingerbread men made in their images. Gingerbread quickly became more and more popular. It was in 19th century that gingerbread houses appeared in Germany after the brothers Grimm published their stories, especially Hansel and Gretel. They are a common Christmas tradition in Europe and North America. There are even competitions to build the biggest ones, and there is also an annual gingerbread city in Bergen, Norway. So, you see, our tradition of making a gingerbread house didn't originate here at all. It's development has taken a long time, and each time it has reached a different country, it has been slightly changed. And that is the way that traditions evolve.</p>

			<title>Baked apples.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/baked-apples-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A recipe I have been making recently that happens to be very easy is baked apples. What could be nicer than hot, cinnamony apples, oozing with deliciousness, and making the whole house smell great? I have recently discovered an apple that has become one of my favorites. It is the honey crisp. It is unusually large, and has little bumps or dimples. It is very juicy, and has a similar flesh to the pacific rose of New Zealand, one that is light and breaks up easily in the mouth. The skin is not too tough, so it's fine to eat raw. The thing I like most about it, however, is it's flavor. It has the perfect combination of flavors, both sweet and tart. Believe it or not, the sweetest apples are not my favorites. Some, I actually find too sugary! To choose the right apple for baking, and I think for&nbsp;eating as well, I like to be able to taste some acidity in the fruit. When I was in the supermarket looking at all the different types of apples, I didn't know which one to pick for baking. I asked an assistant, and he very enthusiastically took me to the honey crisps. So, this is what you do: after washing them, you must remove the core. That can be tricky if you don't have a proper core remover. I've misplaced mine, so I had to struggle with a sharp knife, which annoyed me. But I managed, finally, to remove the cores without cutting myself. Then you place them on a baking sheet, with the core holes&nbsp;facing vertically, and fill them alternately with raisins, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Leave a little space at the top of the core for some butter. Then, put them in the oven for about an hour on 350 degrees, or medium heat. You will be able to tell when they are ready, because your house will smell divine, and the apples will have shrunk, there will be juice in the pan, and the skins will be wrinkled. Enjoy them with either vanilla icecream, or thick whipped cream. Mmmm, they are a winter favorite in this house.</p>

			<title>Very early practice.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/very-early-practice-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>When you have a hobby, and you want to improve your skills, you have to practice. There is no substitute for practice. Those of you who come from disciplined nations will know all about this. In the Western world, I think, dedicating ourselves to long-term practice is sometimes a challenge. It isn't in the fabric of our society. We are innovative, but not necessarily disciplined. Speaking from personal experience, and looking at myself, the practice of a hobby, whether it is a podcast or a musical instrument, a new language or a physical exercise, can be a painful process. Encouragement helps. For example, when I get positive emails from my podlisteners, I think, "Wow! People are listening! I must keep going!" Or if my violin teacher says that I sound better when I play, I feel so relieved that I am spurred on to continue practicing. My oldest son has shown some dedication recently that has reminded me of all of this, and I am impressed. He has basketball practice in middle school at six thirty in the morning, four days a week. Oooooo, now that's painful! I am barely conscious at that time of the morning. I drive him to the school, still in my pyjamas and slippers, wearing a&nbsp;big coat and an extra large scarf. The poor boy must think that his mother looks like a clown.&nbsp;The school&nbsp;is actually very close, but I choose to drive him because it is pitch black that early in the morning, and it is freezing cold, with snow and ice all over the place. As I watch him walk into the school building, I am encouraged that he is being consistent with his basketball. I know that he will see himself improve, and reap the rewards. When I drop him off, I see other boys appear from the darkness, and walk into school, their skinny legs only half covered by their long basketball shorts, and carrying backpacks that look bigger than they are. My heart goes out to them. Hopefully, they do it out of a love for the sport, and not just a sense of obligation. Either way, seeing them encourages me to keep going with my hobbies, and my efforts at self-improvement.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/get-the-setting-right-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was only this evening, after a busy day, that I realised that my phone had not rung all day. That is unusual. I checked my messages, and there were twelve! How come I hadn't heard the phone ring? I checked the setting, and it said 'silent'.&nbsp; "Oh, great!" I said to myself as I scrolled through the numbers that had called me. There was one particular one that had tried calling me eight times. Thankfully, it wasn't an emergency. It was the automated telephone system for the substitute teachers. It had called me all those times to offer me a morning job for tomorrow. I have already subbed in that class, which happens to be where one of my sons is. It would have been a perfect job, but it just so happens that I have two appointments in the morning, so I can't make it. I'm lucky, though, to have the teacher request me. Young students like to have a familiar face, instead of a different sub each time. The trouble with my phone is that it's an old design which has buttons on the outside. When I put the phone in my handbag, which I do often during the day, sometimes the buttons get pushed. The settings get changed without me even knowing anything about it. So, sometimes a call will come in, and my handbag will start vibrating, or music will play that I don't recognize. I never know what to expect from my phone. I should probably upgrade to a decent model that doesn't change its settings so easily. Come to think of it, my husband has an old Blackberry that he used to use. It has been sitting around, gathering dust because he has upgraded and no longer needs it. I actually think I understand why I have stuck with my little, old phone. It's because it is cheap, beaten-up, and not important. If I lose it, it's no great loss. However, if I were to lose a Blackberry, I would probably feel bad about losing something expensive. So, for now, I'll just have to double-check my settings, and put up with my comfortable old model.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/it-s-here-early-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you have the blog or the app of A Cup Of English handy, you will see from the photo or the video clip just what the 'it' is. Yes, the snow. Last year, we&nbsp;hardly had any at Christmas, and not even a hint of it at Thanksgiving. This year is very different. People have been saying that it is going to be a long, cold Winter&nbsp; because of La Nina. So far, they are right. The snow started several days before Thanksgiving, and now, today, it is snowing consistently. One thing that tends to happen during the first few days of snow, is that the traffic goes into a mild panic. Some people still drive as fast as ever, as if there was no difference in the weather. Other people go painfully slowly, even when they're on a dry road. Moods go up and down. The last thing you want is to be in a hurry when you are driving in the stuff. On the way home today from the supermarket, I drove past a man who was trying to push his car out of the middle of the road. It had obviously 'died' right there, and was in the way. I pulled over to see if I could help. Another man ran over, and the three of us managed to push the car back away from the moving traffic. I felt like a knight in shining armour, rescuing someone. The man didn't have a cell phone either, so he borrowed mine and called his family to come and help him. It's good insurance helping someone like that, because when your car dies in a snow storm, a couple of people will appear from nowhere and help you. That's my theory, anyway. So now I'm at home, looking out of the window. I have a beef stew bubbling away on the stove, so my kids can have something hot to eat when they get home.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[If you have the blog or the app of A Cup Of English handy, you will see from the photo or the video clip just what the 'it' is. Yes, the snow. Last year, we&nbsp;hardly had any at Christmas, and not even a hint of it at Thanksgiving. This year is very different. People have been saying that it is going to be a long, cold Winter&nbsp; because of La Nina. So far, they are right. The snow started several days before Thanksgiving, and now, today, it is snowing consistently. One thing that tends to happen during the first few days of snow, is that the traffic goes into a mild panic. Some people still drive as fast as ever, as if there was no difference in the weather. Other people go painfully slowly, even when they're on a dry road. Moods go up and down. The last thing you want is to be in a hurry when you are driving in the stuff. On the way home today from the supermarket, I drove past a man who was trying to push his car out of the middle of the road. It had obviously 'died' right there, and was in the way. I pulled over to see if I could help. Another man ran over, and the three of us managed to push the car back away from the moving traffic. I felt like a knight in shining armour, rescuing someone. The man didn't have a cell phone either, so he borrowed mine and called his family to come and help him. It's good insurance helping someone like that, because when your car dies in a snow storm, a couple of people will appear from nowhere and help you. That's my theory, anyway. So now I'm at home, looking out of the window. I have a beef stew bubbling away on the stove, so my kids can have something hot to eat when they get home. And I'm all wrapped up in my woolly clothes, quite happy to stay inside. Mind you, I'm going to have to get out the snow blower and clear the drive way, or our cars will get stuck. That machine will come in handy this season, I bet.

			<title>Do I make you nervous?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/do-i-make-you-nervous-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been conducting interviews with people in town who have businesses. Why? Because I am beginning to build a website of interviews and dialogues. I hope to launch it before Christmas;....let's see if I can get it ready in time. It sounds like a simple procedure, doesn't it? Interview a person, add grammar notes and pronunciation practice, edit it until it is clean and professional, and then upload it to my website. Well, it's actually all new for me, including the interviews. Most people, I have found, are not that comfortable with being interviewed. That's understandable; they don't want to sound silly. Some people might not even want their voices on the internet. So, there are steps that I have to take to keep everyone happy. First of all, I must ask their permission, and see if they are comfortable with being interviewed. Secondly, I must inform them that the audio of their voice will be on the web, and then together, we must arrange when and where to conduct the interview. Well, I've done that so far with four people, and it's all turned out to be okay. But, one thing I have noticed is that they all got nervous during the interview. Now, when you listen to the interviews, they don't seem very nervous. That's because I have edited out all of the ums and ahs and stuttering. However, as I sit in front of the people, I can see&nbsp;them&nbsp;fidget, scratch&nbsp;thier heads, chew&nbsp;their lips, and even sweat. Do I make them nervous? Is it me, or is it the experience of being interviewed? I do my best to make them feel comfortable. I smile, but not too much. I put my head on one side, to act friendly and not domineering. I agree with them and nod my head, and I make sure that I don't stare at them for too long. If I put myself in their shoes, I would probably feel the same. Thank goodness for editing.</p>

			<title>Bingo.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/bingo-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This past Friday night, I was settling in for the evening, when my youngest son said, "Mum, can we go to the family bingo night at school?" I groaned inside, not wanting to go anywhere. I had received an automated voice message from the school a few days previously about the fundraising night. Bingo was on the agenda, and the winners would win large baskets, or hampers, filled with all kinds of goodies. These hampers had been donated from various businesses in town to help the school raise money. I had actually never been to any of the bingo nights, but I had heard that they are very popular. So, being a push-over, and wanting to please my kids, I took my two youngest. My older two wanted to stay at home and hang out with their dad; anyway, they are far too sophisticated for school bingo, now that they are eleven and twelve.....As we turned up at the school, it was starting to snow. The parking lot was full of cars, so I knew that it would be a full event. We walked in and found the whole gym full of people sitting at tables, concentrating on their bingo cards, and munching away on snacks that they had bought at the concession stand. There was a table where you could rent bingo cards for five dollars for the evening. "Which one do you want?" said the lady who was in charge. "Oh, I don't care. Just give me any of them," I replied. "You're obviously not a serious bingoer,"she said to me laughing. She's right; I'm not. I've barely ever played it. But we sat down and started to cover the numbers that were called out. My children really got into it. We didn't win anything at all. I was hoping that we could take home one of the Christmas hampers, but it wasn't to be. What made it worse was that a couple of people each won three hampers. Three! There should be a rule against that! But we tried our best. My kids were very disappointed that we went home empty-handed. I told them, "Most of the time, you don't win anything. Only a few people ever win in these games, but there is always a chance." That didn't cheer them up, but I suppose it was a good lesson in reality.</p>

			<title>Little dragons.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/little-dragons-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>My energetic daughter has been begging me to take her to karate classes. She had already enrolled in gymnastics, and our rule is to do only one after-school activity each season, so I decided to only look into it, and not agree or commit myself to taking her. The other day, however, we were in the neighborhood, so we popped into the karate school, just to have a look. It is situated in one of the older brick buildings, near the railroad tracks. It has been nicely converted, preserving the brick and old wood feel, but updating it at the same time. There are three rooms in the school. One long exercise room with a big mirror which is used for lots of running and jumping exercises, a room with lots of punching and kicking bags, and then the entryway with a large wooden floor space for further exercises. Domini had a twinkle in her eye when she saw the children exercising in their black suits. They all looked so cute! "Mum, can I quit gymnastics and do this instead?" Domini asked me. She was extra excited because there was a little boy there who she recognized from preschool. She had always played and got along well with him, so she felt at home. Well, I agreed. Domini will finish this month of gymnastics, and in the meantime, she will try a few classes of karate, and see how she gets on. So, today was her first time. Let's just say that it wouldn't surprize me to see my daughter with a black belt on in&nbsp;a few years. She loved it. There was a warm up, a break, more exercise, and then learning some forms. She was in a beginners' group with children her age. At one point they all had to do 10 push-ups because one of the boys wasn't listening. It was serious business, and you know, I think most kids enjoy that side of it too. It makes the whole event seem important. So, to conclude, she will get her black suit and join the rest of the little dragons, that's the name of her class. My only advice to her is not to practice on her brothers, at least, not yet.</p>

			<title>Bilingual night.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/bilingual-night-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that I had on the calendar this month was the bilingual night at my children's school. It is held a few times a year, to inform parents about progress being made with the school's dual language program. Tonight was the first meeting of the year, and there had been lots of preparation for it. My daughter, who is in kindergarten, had been practicing three songs. I had heard her singing around the house, but it took me a few days to ask her if there was something that she was practicing for. Sure enough, kindergarteners and first graders were going to perform on stage for the parents, to impress them with some bilingual songs. It was a rush to get there on time because Domini had just finished a gymnastics class, I had to drop of one of my sons at his basketball practice, and then get to the school lunch room on time, where seats had been put out in rows for all of us. Going to one of these is not a new thing for me. All four of my kids are going through the same elementary school, so I know all about the bilingual program. I'm thrilled that they can be exposed to Spanish, and, hopefully, each year pick up more and more. As I sat chatting to another parent, the students came out and lined up on the little stage. The music teacher played the guitar, and sang loudly, opening his mouth very wide, to get the children to follow him. The kids did a great job. They sang four songs, each a mix of Spanish and English. Every now and then, when they came to a difficult part, the singing trailed off and became quite quiet, and then in the easy parts, they got very loud and confident. You know what it's like with children: they fidgeted, looked at their shoes, at the ceiling, whispered to eachother, and some even picked their noses. It all added to the performance. When the singing was over, we actually sneaked out, and didn't stay for the talk about the importance of being bilingual. I've heard the talk many times, and, besides, I'm already a believer in language learning!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As we move into the middle of November, the countryside seems to be changing every day. The colorful leaves that decorate the whole valley are beginning to fall, and preparations are&nbsp;being made for the long, cold winter.

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-stack-for-winter-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We used to have a&nbsp;large pine&nbsp;tree in our front garden. It was a very tall, old one. It was planted about thirty years ago, but last year, we decided to cut it down. I wouldn't normally agree to chop down a tree, but this one was yucky. Half of one side of it had no branches, and it looked weak. My husband and I are really into trees, and really into planting them, so we had a plan of filling in the area with new pine trees. I found it hard to imagine what the front garden would look like once our shade giving old pine was gone. We need shade in this area, so I hesitated at first. However, I know how enthusiastic my husband is about getting a permit each year to go up into the mountains to dig up trees for our garden. I imagined that the area left by the old pine would soon be filled in with many more trees, and probably healthier ones as well. And I was right. The new trees are growing fast, creating shade, smelling and looking great, and givng the impression of a mini forest. So, what did we do with the old tree? The same thing that a lot of people do around here. You see, we need trees for the shade in summer, but we need wood to burn in the freezing winters. So, our need for winter wood has been met. With the help of a good friend who used to be a forest ranger, Tom cut up the old pine into large logs for our fireplace. Both of them used chain saws. It was a noisy process, but exciting at the same time. The front area of our garden smelt like pine and smoke for a while, as the tree was getting chopped up. Now we have an organized pile of wood, sitting next to our garage, ready for when winter comes. Our boys are big enough now, that we can ask them to run out and each get a log so that we can build a fire in the fireplace in the evenings. As we sit and watch the fire dance, and hear the wood crack, we can remember the old pine, and look forward to our new mini forest getting taller and thicker.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>My good friend Nataliya called me a few days ago, and invited me to a concert at a local church. "There is a very good Russian pianist, Oksana Ezhokina, you might have heard of her." I vaguely remembered the name. She has performed a few times in Wenatchee. At the moment, she lives in Leavenworth, and is the artistic co-director of the Icicle Creek Music Center, and a member of the Icicle Creek Piano Trio. Accompanying her were Daniel Schlosberg, an accomplished pianist, and Artist-in-Residence in the Music Department at the University of Notre Dame, and also Russel Rolen who is a professional cellist and teacher, and is studying for his doctorate at Northwestern University. I was excited to hear about this trio coming to town; it had been a while since I had been to a classical concert. Nataliya gave me directions, and I decided to get there a little early, just in case there were a lot of people, I could get some good seats. It's a good job that I did because the place was packed. I made sure that I got a couple of seats as close to the front as possible. Nataliya arrived, and we looked at the program. They were going to play some very interesting pieces, and quite a variety: Gershwin, Schumann, and Rachmaninoff. Oksana started off the concert with a piece, and a little talk at first about how the concert was to raise money to buy a grand piano for the town. Several private donations had been made already, but money still had to be raised to have enough for the purchase. The concert flew by quickly because the music was so good, and so well performed. It was a delight to see real musicians at work who had obviously dedicated years to becoming accomplished. Everybody was impressed, and gave the musicians a standing ovation at the end. I'm so glad that my friend had told me about this concert. I must keep my ear to the ground for other concerts in the area.</p>

			<title>Expanding Walmart.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/expanding-walmart-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>For a while now, there has been a lot of construction going on at our local Walmart. I am a frequent shopper there, as it is only a couple of blocks from my house. Walmart is expanding. After a few years of doing tremendous business here, the owners have decided to turn it into a superstore. That means that it will soon sell fresh fruit, vegetables, and meat. It will become the 'one stop shop' for a lot of people, including myself. Instead of shopping at Walmart, and then needing to go to a regular supermarket for food items, everything will be in one place. That's a relief! The local shops and supermarkets won't be very happy about it, but that's competition I suppose. It will force a lot of merchants to lower prices and create more special offers. Walmart is quite a ferocious animal. There are more than 8,500 stores in 15 countries, and it's annual revenue is similar to that of a small country. Personally, I'm looking forward to the expansion. Because so many people shop at Walmart, their produce is quite fresh; they don't have goods hanging around on shelves for weeks. We call that a fast 'turn-over'. So, by Christmas, I think, it will be ready. For now, the machines of different kinds are digging, and banging, and lifting. One of the employees I spoke to told me that she had to hear a jack hammer for 8 hours one day. The workmen had to do a job close to her check-out till. By the time she went home, she said, her nerves were shattered. When you walk in the building, all of the aisles have changed position. The pet food is where the stationary used to be, and the stationary is where the diapers were. It's a little confusing. The parking arrangements have changed because work is taking place on a large area in the front of the building. These things take time; it's good to see the progress each time I go there. I expect that in true American style, there will be a grand opening with all sorts of freebies and special deals. But until then, there will be cranes, dump trucks, and jack hammers creating all sorts of noise and commotion.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you use calendars very much? I do. Without them, I'm sure I would forget a lot of appointments. I have a calendar conveniently placed in my kitchen, just above where I do my podcasts. I have a collection of other important things on this 'mini-desk' of mine, so it keeps me organized while I do my little projects, check my E-mails, or pay the bills. My husband has one on his iPad that is much more sophisticated than mine. He relies on his to keep his business affairs straight. However you use a calendar, it can be a great tool for remembering important appointments or events. In English, we say that people have a busy 'social' calendar, when they have appointments with friends, or commitments that are fun. I have a few of those on my calendar, but most of the things I have written down are mundane: dentist appointments, volunteering dates, taking the dogs to the vets for shots etc etc. But as I look up now to my calendar, I see that I do have some fun, social things planned for this month. I have lunch with my siser-in-law next week. Then there is a walk with a friend of mine in the park. We go every fortnight (or two weeks) There is a school bingo night which is to raise money for school supplies. And then, of course, there is Thanksgiving on the 25th. My birthday is also somewhere on the calendar, but I won't tell you where. This one calendar has been so useful for the whole family, that I bought a dry-erase version that hangs in the children's mud room. It is reusable, and has all of their school, sports, and music dates. If other people stay organized, it certainly takes the pressure off of me.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The other day I went for a walk in the park with a friend of mine. We don't see eachother very much because she is busy taking a nursing degree, so it was a treat to spend some time together. The day couldn't have been any nicer. It was a cool but very bright Autumn morning, there was color all around, and still a little mist over the river. I had a feeling that it would be a good occasion to take my camera, just in case. There is all sorts of new development planned for the river front. There are already a few new buildings that are used for offices and a cafe. However, a developer has posted a big sign, showing the plan for a building complex of condominiums, shops, and restaurants to go in where older buildings now stand. The plan looks very attractive, nicely landscaped, and quite modern. Already, the roads and parking areas have been changed a little. Roundabouts have been put in to avoid the expense of traffic lights, and they have been beautified with statues and plants. I was amazed when I first saw them. Roundabouts are so common in England, and actually in the rest of Europe. They are a very logical, easy way to keep the traffic organized and flowing. You don't find roundabouts very much over here, at least you didn't until recently. Most roads are dead straight with traffic lights. I'm happy to see some European influence where we live. After looking at the new roads, we started our walk. Our aim was to walk to the bridge and back, and then to have a cup of coffee in the nearby cafe.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The other day I went for a walk in the park with a friend of mine. We don't see eachother very much because she is busy taking a nursing degree, so it was a treat to spend some time together. The day couldn't have been any nicer. It was a cool but very bright Autumn morning, there was color all around, and still a little mist over the river. I had a feeling that it would be a good occasion to take my camera, just in case. There is all sorts of new development planned for the river front. There are already a few new buildings that are used for offices and a cafe. However, a developer has posted a big sign, showing the plan for a building complex of condominiums, shops, and restaurants to go in where older buildings now stand. The plan looks very attractive, nicely landscaped, and quite modern. Already, the roads and parking areas have been changed a little. Roundabouts have been put in to avoid the expense of traffic lights, and they have been beautified with statues and plants. I was amazed when I first saw them. Roundabouts are so common in England, and actually in the rest of Europe. They are a very logical, easy way to keep the traffic organized and flowing. You don't find roundabouts very much over here, at least you didn't until recently. Most roads are dead straight with traffic lights. I'm happy to see some European influence where we live. After looking at the new roads, we started our walk. Our aim was to walk to the bridge and back, and then to have a cup of coffee in the nearby cafe. On the way there we passed under some trees that had turned all sorts of colors. I couldn't miss my opportunity. I got out my camera, zoomed in, and clicked away until I got a picture that I was pleased with. You can't help but look up at this time of year because of the colors in the trees. When I got home, I put my SD card into my laptop and edited the photo. Actually, all I had to do was crop it and give it a touch of saturation. I liked it so much it has become my new screen saver.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, Halloween came and went as it does every year, leaving a house full of sweets! We had a lot of fun yesterday. I told my children that I wasn't going to buy them costumes this year. They had to find bits and pieces around the house and make do. It worked out really well, actually. One of my sons used a simple sheet to be a non-scary ghost. He ended up getting too hot under it, and not wearing it at all. My daughter dressed as a gypsy, and my other sons dressed as a Swat man, and an ugly clown. So, Tiong, to answer your question about whether my oldest is still into scary, dark stuff, I think the answer is no. So we set off around the neighborhood, knocking on doors, ringing bells, and hoping for treats. Most people in our neighborhood weren't in, so we drove to a busy area, where the houses are closer together, and the general atmosphere is one of a close community. You should have seen some of the houses! Talk about decorated! One lady opened her front door to hand out candies, and as I looked inside her large family room, I could see that she had decorated the entire ceiling with fake spiders webs, and purple and black bats and bugs. Normally, those who make an effort to decorate, just do the outside of the house. But, as they say here, she had 'gone the whole nine yards' (which means that she had taken the idea of decorating very seriously, and almost overdone it). The streets were packed with people dressed up in all sorts of costumes. There was even a tall man (one of the dads) dressed up as a deer. One house that we went to had scary statues in several places, spooky music playing, and eery lights. As we approached the candy bucket, I touched one of the statues, "Hey, he feels almost real," I said to my kids. They squeezed his arm and poked him, and at that moment he turned his head towards me. Ahhh! He was real! "How can you stand so still?" I asked him. He just shrugged. Thankfully there were some very pretty houses to stop at as well. Pumpkin carving is quite an art form, you know. And some of these neighbors were excellent at it. All in all, it was a fun and successful evening. Then came the mathematics. As soon as my children got home, they spread out their candies, grouped them, counted them, traded them, and even noticed mathematical patterns with them. Of course, as the evening went on, the groups got smaller and smaller.</p>

			<title>Friendly or scary?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/friendly-or-scary-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As I drive around town, I find myself saying the occasional "oooo!", "ahhh!", or "oh?!" Do you know why? There are Halloween decorations all over the place, and they make a real impression. There seem to be two approaches to decorating for Halloween: friendly or scary. Personally, I prefer friendly. The time of year leads me to decorate with themes of pumpkins, Autumn leaves, and the harvest. Okay, I throw in the odd friendly ghost here and there, a black cat, or some fake bats. But you can find a pleasant version of those things. Other people, however, choose to really scare. Perhaps they don't get frightened easily. Some of the houses near us are quite shocking. There is one with a huge skull picture in the window that is pulling an awful face, and then outside, on the front lawn are fake tombstones everywhere. I suppose it's all a bit of fun; it just depends on your taste. My oldest son seemed to enjoy the dark side of things a few years ago. One Halloween night, when all of my children dressed up and we took them out to trick or treat, he chose to go as the Grim Reaper, you know, Death. He wore a long black hooded cape, and had a mask on like 'the scream' by Edvard Munch. The rest of us were friendly looking creatures, and so he stood out in contrast. We stopped by a local church that had free hotdogs and lots of candies for Halloween night, and as we went from booth to booth, people would look at my son twice, the first time in shock, the second time in horror. On another occasion, he was dressed like Darth Vader from Star Wars, which wasn't bad at all I thought. However, he had a battery run voice pack that had some pre-recorded sayings by Darth Vader. I didn't pay much attention to it at all, until we got to the church parking lot, and the kids were filling up their candy buckets at the booths. Hudson turned on his voice pack, and you could hear, " You don't know the power of the dark side!" I'm sure some people found it distasteful or inappropriate; I actually thought it was hilarious. And Hudson, like the rest of the kids, was only concerned about getting as much candy as possible.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's funny how ordinary items or actions can show your knowledge of a language. Sometimes when I do something, or say something, I ask myself the question, "Could I say that in Spanish or French?" Your question would probably be, "Could I say that in English?" With that in mind, I was looking for a pen, the other day, to write down some notes. I couldn't find one anywhere which is really annoying. We seem to have little elves that come at night and steal useful items of all kinds, like pencils, pens, note paper, even envelopes. Mmmm....I wonder who they could be. I couldn't find a decent pencil either. The ones that were in the pencil holder didn't have any nibs. Whoever had previously used them had worn them down, or simply pressed down so hard that the nib had broken off. The solution? A pencil sharpener. But no ordinary pencil sharpener. We have always had the ordinary little plastic ones that have a small blade in them. You insert the pencil, turn it a few times while pushing against the blade, and voila, a sharp pencil. But I decided to buy something that would give immediate gratification. A super-dooper electronic office sharpener. Ooooo! It's black, and very serious looking. Now, with ease, I can insert a pencil into the hole, and the blades automatically come on. They do their job in a few seconds, and out comes the pencil, with a sharp nib, and ready to be used. No more messing about with pencil shavings. My kids were impressed with my new buy. They, by the way, are the culprits for the disappearing pens and pencils. My daughter sat down and sharpened about fifteen pencils straight away. I had bought a battery run sharpener a couple of years ago, but my youngest son tried to sharpen the other end of some pencils, you know, the end with the eraser in the little metal holder. Well, you can guess what happened. The sharpener broke. However, now the youngest are older and less likely to do that again. And their fingers are too big to put in the hole, ....thank goodness!</p>

			<title>Make a difference day, October 23.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/make-a-difference-day-october-23-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I received a flyer in the mail the other day. It rang a bell; I had seen something like it in previous years. It was the annual Make a Difference Day information sheet. From the title, you can tell that it is about getting involved in the community and making a positive difference. This event has grown since 1990, and is held the fourth Saturday of October. It started through USA Weekend and the 800 newspapers it serves. It is a day dedicated to serving neighbors and the community, to meeting needs and offering support. There are thousands of people involved in organizing it. Just letting people know which needs exist is a big job. Nowadays with the internet, people can find out much quicker who needs what and where. Last year, over three million people got involved with local groups to help in many ways. As I glanced through the list of places to help in our little community, I counted at least thirty. However, there are other charitable groups that are not mentioned. In a large city, there must be hundreds of causes that people can help. Several of the groups here are set up to help poor&nbsp;and homeless people in the Winter. It is an awful prospect to be caught in a freezing climate with nowhere to live. Free coats, blankets, and all sorts of basic essentials will be donated at various places. Also the shelters, such as the Salvation Army, will be cleaned, painted, and prepared for the Winter. Volunteers are asked to sign up ahead of time, sometimes bringing their own equipment, and then they will be assigned a job or two. The projects are not just charitable, though. People can choose to plant trees or flowers in public places, pick up litter along highways and roads, or even provide babysitting. It's not compulsory; it's all about volunteering, doing a job, helping. Of course, once you are out there, you begin to see other areas in the community that need help. That is probably why Make a Difference Day has grown each year. I've put it on the calendar, and will be deciding with my family what we can do to help in our town.</p>

			<title>Time's running out for turkeys.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/time-s-running-out-for-turkeys-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Are turkeys a part of your culture? They are over here in the U.S. You have probably heard about the Thanksgiving turkey. Did you know that the tradition of celebrating by eating a turkey started with the Native American Indians? It was the Wampanoag tribe, specifically, that in 1621 shared food that was naturally available locally, with the European Pilgrims at Plymouth Plantation in Massachusetts. They celebrated having survived a cruel winter, and having made important friendships with the Native Americans. There were other, earlier Thanksgiving celebrations by the Canadians and the Spaniards, but the American celebration of 1621 seems to be more famous. The native bird chosen as an important part of the feast was the turkey. That bird is also native of Mexico. It's an American bird, and a big one, come to that. A healthy turkey can easily weigh 20lbs or more. If you're going to cook one, you have to make sure first of all that your oven is big enough! In recent years, people have taken to deep frying them. You need an enormous deep frying pan for the job. And, it is actually quite a dangerous undertaking because of the large amount of boiling oil. Though the turkey cooks more quickly than it does in the oven, it has to be supervised at all times because of the risk of fire. Apparently, though, it is the best way to eat the bird because it stays extremely moist. Yes, turkey eating is big business here. In 2006, farmers raised 270 million turkeys to do&nbsp;almost 8 billion dollars worth of business. A third of those turkeys were consumed at Thanksgiving.&nbsp;So, if you're a turkey, run&nbsp;and hide! If someone offers you lots of corn, and a comfortable nest, don't be fooled.&nbsp;Thanksgiving is coming soon! I came across two&nbsp;lucky turkeys the other day during my trip to a petting zoo. They are caged, and on display, - not for eating.&nbsp;They really are odd looking things. Their colors are quite vibrant, but their heads are so ugly. They have the long, red flesh that hangs from the top of their beaks called the 'snood' in English, and the similar 'wattle' that hangs from underneath. The black and white body is more attractive, as it is nicely proportioned and looks like it is wearing a pretty skirt. That is&nbsp;what interests most people because, unfortunately for the turkeys, it is that part that will be served with stuffing and vegetables!</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Are turkeys a part of your culture? They are over here in the U.S. You have probably heard about the Thanksgiving turkey. Did you know that the tradition of celebrating by eating a turkey started with the Native American Indians? It was the Wampanoag tribe, specifically, that in 1621 shared food that was naturally available locally, with the European Pilgrims at Plymouth Plantation in Massachusetts. They celebrated having survived a cruel winter, and having made important friendships with the Native Americans. There were other, earlier Thanksgiving celebrations by the Canadians and the Spaniards, but the American celebration of 1621 seems to be more famous. The native bird chosen as an important part of the feast was the turkey. That bird is also native of Mexico. It's an American bird, and a big one, come to that. A healthy turkey can easily weigh 20lbs or more. If you're going to cook one, you have to make sure first of all that your oven is big enough! In recent years, people have taken to deep frying them. You need an enormous deep frying pan for the job. And, it is actually quite a dangerous undertaking because of the large amount of boiling oil.

			<title>A Smallwood's tradition.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/time-s-running-out-for-turkeys-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Every year, either in the summer, or around October, we make a trip to Smallwood's Farm. It is a family-run farm with a petting zoo. All of the produce grown on the farm is sold directly to the public. Through the years, it has grown from a small attraction, to one that does an awful lot of business for most of the year. Each year I have seen more attractions and events added, to draw in a bigger crowd of spenders. The journey from our home is only about twenty minutes. As we drive away from Wenatchee and head west, the hills become greener, and there is more forest; we are no longer in the desert region. The roads become a bit more windy as we get closer to Leavenworth. It's just outside of that town, that there is a turn-off to Smallwood's. You can't miss it. There are flags and tall signs, seasonal decorations, and, usually, a car park full of cars. When we went at the weekend, there was even a coach, so the place was packed. The kids ran all over the place excitedly. There were so many things to do and to see, that they didn't know where to go first. There was a big pumpkin patch, where you could choose from very small to huge pumpkins. A hay maze had been made, that you could walk around in, and, hopefully not get lost. There is a play area for the kids with swings and other toys. And there is even a cow ride. Not real cows, just little, metal cars, painted like cows with wheels pulled by a tractor. I've been on that a few times with my kids, their cousins, and my mother-in-law. The last time we went, we laughed and screamed as we whizzed around the corners. I think we had more fun than the kids. We still, just about, fit in the seats that are designed for children. It's&nbsp;encouraging that our rear ends aren't too big to exclude us from the fun. What a comforting thought!&nbsp;And then there is the petting zoo. There are llamas, goats, peacocks, pigs, sheep, and rabbits. You can feed the animals crushed corn, and pet them. It's always fascinating to be around animals, especially when you are not used to it. And when there are baby goats or rabbits, everybody flocks to see them. After the animals, and sanitizing our hands, there is a visit to the gift shop. There is so much to buy, and it is all so nicely presented. They must do so much business! There are lines of people with cash or credit cards in hand, waiting to buy fruits, vegetables, sauces, ornaments, candies, drinks, and even kitchen equipment. The owner of Smallwood's must have perfected his skill at attracting consumers of all ages. We are certainly hooked.</p>

			<title>Bras on the bridge.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/bras-on-the-bridge-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The photo on today's blog is one of the most unusual I have taken since I started A Cup Of English. Bras on a bridge.....um.....it makes you think. It's symbolic, of course. There are so many of them, each being unique. They represent the women who have suffered or are suffering with breast cancer. Many people use that particular bridge in Wenatchee, and so, have had the opportunity to think about the subject. The organizer of this display asked for one thousand bras to be donated. A walk to raise funds for cancer research took place that afternoon, and donations were to be given to an organization in town that supports families of ladies with breast cancer. This is the third annual breast cancer awareness event in Wenatchee. Someone had told me about the decorated bridge, so I had to see it for myself. From far away, it didn't seem like much. But, as I got closer, the double line of bras made quite an impression. They seemed to go on forever. Each one was different from the last. They were colourful (colorful), pretty, silly, sexy, and bizarre. It was an effective way to understand the large number of ladies who die from this each year: over fourty thousand. It also emphasized that each lady affected is an individual, not just another number. But, action and awareness are giving hope. Educating women and girls on self examination, mammograms, and a healthy lifestyle, can all make a positive impact and reduce fatalities. This sort of thing brings up questions as well. The local newspaper, The Wenatchee World, hosts a blog about its articles. Many men wrote in to comment about cancers that affect men, such as prostate cancer. One man suggested hanging up jock straps on the bridge as well. That would certainly get people talking.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I realized today, that yesterday's date was special: 10/10/10. It was October 10th, 2010. I had been too busy over the weekend to stop and realize the curious and interesting date. While I was chatting to my sister-in-law today, she mentioned that she had measured the height of her three boys, as&nbsp;a way of commemorating the day. It could be what we call an 'auspicious' date, a day of significance and importance. My children told me that a popular kids' program called 'Ben 10' had been on the cartoon channel all day. Now that sort of thing is important to children. The date 10,10,10 however, is very important to some adults. Apparently, many people who have been planning on getting married this year, decided to do it on that day. It will be impossible to forget an anniversary! Also, it seems that the number 10 gives us a sense of security, or familiarity. 'The top 10' is common in our world. We hear about 'the top 10 pieces of music', 'the top ten reasons for ....whatever', 'the top ten keys to success in business', and other top ten lists. As far as the date is concerned, though, it depends on which calendar you use. The Chinese calendar is based on astronomical observations of the sun and the phases of the moon. Numbers are considered lucky if they sound like words that are positive. The numbers 6, 8, and 9, are considered lucky because they sound like other words that are positive or fortunate. Some people will pay large sums of money to have these numbers&nbsp;as their home numbers.&nbsp; The Gregorian calendar is the internationally accepted civil calendar. Because it is number based, rather than meaning or sound based, a date like 10,10,10 does draw attention to itself. Mathematicians might have something to say about it. One website that had various people send in their ideas, had this comment from a man who took the date very seriously: " I was explaining yesterday how 42 is the answer to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything to my girlfriend, when one of my employees brought up that it's going to be 10-10-10 this year. I realized that 10-10-10 in binary equals 42." Perhaps that man will be lucky enough to get all of his questions answered this year!</p>

			<title>A kindergarten tree walk.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-kindergarten-tree-walk-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Kindergarten is proving to be quite a fun place for my daughter. They went on their first field trip the other day; it was a 'tree walk'. They have been studying trees: how they grow, and how they change with the seasons, so a tree walk was the perfect ending for their studies. I volunteered that day, and arrived at the school a few minutes before the bus left. There were several mothers there, and we all helped the teacher line the children up and get them ready for their big trip. When I say 'big trip', I mean that it was big for them, because it was exciting, and their first so far this year. It was actually just a five minute trip, up the road, to the Wenatchee Valley College grounds. The bus parked and let us off. We walked over to a shady area where one of the college staff greeted us. There were several stations of fun activities, all to do with trees. One was an observation of chlorophyll. The children had to find a large leaf, put in on&nbsp;a wooden board, under a white sheet of material, and then bang it all over with a hammer. Kindergarteners with hammers? Now, that sounds risky! They loved it! And they could see, as they banged, the green chlorophyll come out of the leaf and soak into the material. Another activity, which I'm sure was one of their favorites, was to build habitats for wild animals out of bark and pine cones. They paired up for this, and had a little toy mascot representing the kind of wild life that is found in the forest. Some had beavers, or squirrels, and others had mice. There were habitats of all shapes and sizes built for the little furry forest creatures. And, of course, when the children had finished, they wanted to keep the soft toys. It took some convincing to get them to put them back into the boxes for the next group of children. The last station was where we sang songs in the shade of a big tree. The songs were carefully chosen by two of the school district's music teachers; they were, of course, all about trees. The teachers passed out different percussion instruments to various groups of children, and each was told to play the instrument when a certain part of a tree was mentioned. So, for example, one group of kids would play the triangle when they heard the word "roots", other kids would play the wooden blocks when they heard "branches" etc. It was a well organized event for the first year students, and, I think, a great way to, solidify their knowledge of trees.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes.</span></p>
<p>Useful expressions: so far..., to soak, pine cones, solidify.</p>
<p>1. So far this season, the pumpkins have stayed quite small. Let's hope they get bigger for Halloween.</p>
<p>2. Let your shirt soak in water with a little bleach in it; that should get rid of the stains.</p>
<p>3. We collected pine cones as fire starters. They catch light very quickly because of their natural oils.</p>
<p>4. The liquid gelatin will solidify as soon as it gets cold enough.</p>]]></description>

There were several mothers there, and we all helped the teacher line the children up and get them ready for their big trip. When I say 'big trip', I mean that it was big for them, because it was exciting, and their first so far this year. It was actually just a five minute trip, up the road, to the Wenatchee Valley College grounds. The bus parked and let us off. We walked over to a shady area where one of the college staff greeted us. There were several stations of fun activities, all to do with trees. One was an observation of chlorophyll. The children had to find a large leaf, put in on&nbsp;a wooden board, under a white sheet of material, and then bang it all over with a hammer. Kindergarteners with hammers? Now, that sounds risky! They loved it! And they could see, as they banged, the green chlorophyll come out of the leaf and soak into the material. Another activity, which I'm sure was one of their favorites, was to build habitats for wild animals out of bark and pine cones. They paired up for this, and had a little toy mascot representing the kind of wild life that is found in the forest. Some had beavers, or squirrels, and others had mice. There were habitats of all shapes and sizes built for the little furry forest creatures. And, of course, when the children had finished, they wanted to keep the soft toys. It took some convincing to get them to put them back into the boxes for the next group of children. The last station was where we sang songs in the shade of a big tree. The songs were carefully chosen by two of the school district's music teachers; they were, of course, all about trees. The teachers passed out different percussion instruments to various groups of children, and each was told to play the instrument when a certain part of a tree was mentioned. So, for example, one group of kids would play the triangle when they heard the word "roots", other kids would play the wooden blocks when they heard "branches" etc. It was a well organized event for the first year students, and, I think, a great way to, solidify their knowledge of trees.
Grammar notes.
Useful expressions: so far..., to soak, pine cones, solidify.
1. So far this season, the pumpkins have stayed quite small. Let's hope they get bigger for Halloween.
2. Let your shirt soak in water with a little bleach in it; that should get rid of the stains.
3. We collected pine cones as fire starters. They catch light very quickly because of their natural oils.
4. The liquid gelatin will solidify as soon as it gets cold enough.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, there was a knock at the door. "Mum, there's some guy at the door," said my son, letting me know that he didn't feel like opening the door. I had just woken up from a nap. So, still feeling drowsy, I unlocked and opened the front door. I expected to find, perhaps, a neighbor, or someone selling something. To my surprise, there was a large man who I didn't know, who was dressed in an eighteenth century military costume. He beamed a smile at me, and handed me a plastic envelope containing a copy of the U.S. constitution. "Hello Ma'm," he said. "I'm just out encouraging folks like you to read our constitution." "Oh, thanks," I replied. "Can I take your photo?" I quickly added, seeing a good photo opportunity. He posed for me and then went on his way. He was part of the Patriot Corps, which is part of the Foundation For Liberty. Their aim is to, "educate our citizens on limited government and constitutional rights." He made quite an impression, especially dressed as he had been. Thinking about it, however, his costume was just like the British Redcoat uniform..., now that must have been a mistake. I checked on the internet, and actually, the American revolutionary uniform was&nbsp;blue, with soldiers wearing a lot of brown as well. Oh, well. Perhaps I'll send him an email and let him know that he looks more British than anything else. I appreciate having a constitution around, though.&nbsp;Of course, when I was doing my paperwork to become legal, I had to become familiar with some parts of the constitution. And when I was a teacher at the High School, I taught a 'citizenship' class, which included a lot of the constitution.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As I walked outside yesterday to throw the garbage in the dumpster, the evening sky caught my eye. There was a spread of small clouds that were lit up by the sun, beautiful and pink. An English saying came to mind:</p>
<p>Red sky at night, shepherd's delight; Red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning.</p>
<p>I remember hearing that saying when I was a child. At that time, I lived in a rural area where there was a lot of farm land. It was important to know when to plant seeds, and how the weather would affect the work on the farm. Who knows if this saying is accurate? Scientifically speaking, it is an indication that the low sun is lighting up clouds that are heavy with moisture. By the time the night has come and gone, it will either have rained, or the clouds will have gone. If the clouds are pink in the morning, the moisture will be around for the rest of the day, meaning that rain is on its way. That makes sense. The saying is one of many that we find in what is called 'weather lore', lore is a word that we don't often use which means 'old sayings' or 'old stories'. There must be some truth to some of them. They developed through the experience of people who have observed weather patterns over time, like fishermen and farmers. Another saying I like is:</p>
<p>When windows won't open, and the salt clogs the shaker;The weather will favour (favor) the umbrella maker.</p>
<p>Salt, as you know, absorbs water from the air. So, when there is high humidity, the salt will expand and not pour easily from the salt shaker. Also, the wood of doors and windows will expand because of moisture in the air. It's reasonable that generations of people tried to figure out what the weather would do, as a way of preserving their livelihoods. We're luckier nowadays, with weather satelites and weather stations, that can warn an inform us of important changes in the weather. We can even, ahead of time, evacuate areas that will be hit by hurricanes. And think what that saves! Weather lore has its uses, but science and technology now lead the way.</p>

			<title>An eye exam.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/an-eye-exam-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>At this time of year, the schools have tests of all kinds for the children. Reading and writing tests, math skills tests, and tomorrow, there will be hearing and vision tests for the whole school. If you think about it, the two last mentioned tests are fundamental; if a child cannot hear or see properly, he will have a very hard time in school. Ironically, my youngest son had a vision test today with an eye specialist. He had had a reading test the other day that raised a few questions about his eyes. His eyes are very sensitive to the white and black contrast of the print and the paper. It was found that when a blue plastic sheet was put on top of a text, then he could see the words clearly and read properly. This is considered a syndrome of the eye called Scotopic Sensitivity. I had never heard of it. It is a newly found syndrome, apparently. It is so new that some eye specialists don't take it seriously. Well, I bought some blue plastic to help my son read without getting frustrated, and I also made an appointment for a thorough eye test. We arrived at the clinic, where my son was first tested by a nurse. She asked me questions, put drops in Robert's eyes to dilate them, and then left us in a room full of fascinating eye testing equipment. Robert and I both looked around and wondered how the doctor was going to use the devices that were hanging here and there. Finally, the doctor came in and immediately started testing Robert's eyes. He put one mask-like metal device up to Robert's face and asked him to look into it and to tell him what he could see. He did the same with another larger piece of equipment, and wrote down a few things while Robert was talking. It turns out that his eyes are fine, but he is a little far-sighted. We become more near-sighted as we mature, so reading isn't such a strain. He gave us the option of Robert having glasses for school, until his near-sightedness develops. Thank goodness there is no real problem with his eyes. It's definitely worth having a test so you know what your options are.</p>
<p>Grammar notes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the places we stayed this summer was Whithorn, Scotland, where my father lives. It is one of many picturesque towns in Galloway. Whithorn happens to be very famous; it is considered possibly Scotland's first town. It is the starting point of Christianity in the U.K, with St. Ninian establishing the building called the Candida Casa, or Glimmering White House, after the stone it was made from. This building became a cathedral and a monastery. Whithorn was a center for pilgrammages, even for royalty. Archeological findings have shown that Whithorn became a sophisticated town, with many being literate, with trade and contact with the rest of Europe flourishing. Without understanding its rich history, you could very easily walk through Whithorn, admire its pretty terraced cottages and gardens, and come away thinking that it is simply another quaint and well kept farming community. Throughout Galloway, in the southwest of Scotland, there are historic towns, that still thrive, and offer spots of beauty to visitors. Naturally, the southwest has a mild, temperate climate because of the Gulf Stream. Its land is rich and used for farming. There are fishing villages throughout this area, and also many secluded, pristine beaches. Though the area in general gets plenty of rain, the sunlight is brilliant. The land is not built up at all from industry or large cities, so the sky scape is huge, and when the sun comes out, the colorful houses and fishing boats look cheerful and bright. I think especially those who come from cities will appreciate the colors of Galloway: its sparkling green countryside, the rolling hills and farms, the clean, empty beaches, and the historic and well kept towns.</p>

			<title>Creetown gem rock museum.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/creetown-gem-rock-museum-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>During the summer vacation, I took my children to visit the Creetown gem rock museum, in Scotland. It is highly recommended, as it is the leading independent gem rock museum in the whole of the UK. We travelled about fourty five minutes to get there, and, believe me, it was worth it. Though the entrance is small, the first room you come to opens up into a world of colorful gems and rocks of all kinds. There are many tall display cases, showing huge crystals, with their names and information on where they come from. There is a wall where children, or indeed anyone, can touch and feel the rocks and gems. My children spent the whole time saying, "Wow!" and "Look at this!" It's the sort of place you go to where you don't want to rush; there is so much to see and examine. Moving on from the first room, you come to the Crystal Cave. It is a man made cave that is set up deliberately to show rocks and crystals in an underground setting. Every nook and cranny has a different crystal, and one area even shows stones that are naturally fluorescent. In daylight or under artificial light, you wouldn't know that they are fluorescent, but in the cave, their amazing variety of colors glows. There is also a large study, full of squashy sofas, where visitors can sit and watch a video on basic geology. It's just the right length to give the information everyone needs to know&nbsp; about the fundamentals of rock and crystal formation. Then, after having your eyes occupied and your brain informed, you can visit the Prospector's Pantry Cafe, and fill up on hot soup, sandwiches, quiche, and locally baked goods. It's a perfect spot to visit when you are in Galloway, rain or shine, with or without children, to enjoy the beauty of what is found in the earth, and to come away with more understanding of this fascinating subject.</p>

Grammar notes.
Everyday expressions: rain or shine, the whole...., nook and cranny, believe me.
1. He works every day restoring old buildings, rain or shine.
2. Throughout the whole film they chatted. And then, the whole way home they sang loudly.
3. If you are going to clean the house, I expect every nook and cranny to be spotless!
4. It's a good job that I took my heavy coat and gloves to the soccer match because, believe me, it was freezing!]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been roped into&nbsp;a project that you didn't plan, or necessarily want? To be roped into something, is to be caught up, or carried along by someone else's idea. It's like being involved because you are forced to, or you feel obliged. Well, I have been roped into a project recently. My son Cass is having his birthday party soon, and wants to have a medieval battle with his friends on our back lawn......hmmm, I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I have been given orders to collect as many Nerf swords as possible. These are replicas of real swords that are made out of a hard foam, like a spongey plastic. You can hit someone with them and not cause any damage. That is the whole point, - a friendly battle. There will be two teams, the Reds and the Greens. My other task is to buy some material to make the slip-on, sleeveless shirts. On the one hand, fighting with spongey swords shouldn't be a problem; but on the other hand, kids in battle can quickly get over excited and have accidents. I suppose the answer is to have a few rules, explain them clearly to everyone, and then to supervise. I will have my camera ready; there are bound to be some excellent photo opportunities that I would like to share with you. I should probably also have a box of bandaids or plasters, and some ice available for the wounded soldiers. I will be the nurse Florence Nightingale for a while during the party, I'm sure. Well, I've managed to collect five swords so far; I need to find seven more. And then I'll get to work, making the team shirts. I don't mind being roped into this really; it's quite fun, and it's what my son really wants for his birthday. If he has his battle, a chocolate icecream cake, and a pinata, he will be one happy birthday boy.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The other day, when I went to lunch with my mum, I noticed that the restaurant was decorated in an autumn theme. It was beautifully done. The owner, or someone who works in that restaurant, must have gone to the local arts and crafts store to get the supplies. I love that place! There you will find all the bits and pieces you need to create beautiful projects for your house. The items are all expertly made, and imported mainly from China and Taiwan. There are artificial flowers, fruits, and feathers. Of course, there are all kinds of strings of lights that you can hang up, or wrap around something else to make a focal point. Candles, wooden boxes of about ten sizes, artificial birds and their nests and eggs, metal ornaments and stands, and all kinds of glass beads, paints, frames, and materials are available. It is a creators paradise! The nice thing is, there are examples, throughout the store, of the different projects you can make using items from the shop. All you need to do is take a few minutes to look at the finished project, make a mental list of the supplies you need, buy them, of course, and then put them together. Voila! A finished project. Most shops and restaurants, at this time of year, have something pretty that reflects the season. It's the pattern of things. After Thanksgiving, the autumn themes will be taken down, and Christmas decorations will go up. Until then, it's my turn to have a look in my storage boxes for the arts and crafts items that I have collected over the years, and to turn them into something pretty for my entryway. Candles look wonderful in the middle of these crafty arrangements. As yet, I can't use real candles, because my two youngest children would be tempted to touch them. There are, however, some tiny artificial candles, called tea lights, that I can use to add a comforting glow to whatever arrangement I make. And guess what? I'm out of them, so I need to make a trip to the arts and crafts store to buy some more, and ...perhaps a few more bits and pieces.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/a-stow-away-praying-mantis-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Those of you who listen to my podcast on a regular basis, know that one of my hobbies is gardening. Whenever I have a free moment, I'm out there planting, weeding, or sowing seeds. It is September now, and the season for growing is just about over. There are still some Autumn flowers that are appearing here and there, but, judging by what you find in the shops, the time for gardening is coming to an end. You probably also know that the end of a season is, in shopping terms, the perfect time to find bargains. I popped into a local do-it-yourself store the other day that has a garden center. I quickly scanned the area with plants for anything with color that still looked plantable. I finally found a table that had bright orange flowers which still looked like they had a lot of life in them.&nbsp; I was in luck! These flowers were Summer flowering plants that nobody wished to buy. They had been put in the corner, and some were on the floor, and were at a very reduced price. I bought them and drove home, already knowing where I was going to put them. As I was digging the soil, I looked over at the biggest plant and saw something amazing. There was a huge praying mantis sitting right on top. I picked the plant up, and the insect turned its head towards me. Creepy! It didn't move though, even while I took the plant out of the plastic pot and put it in the ground. It seemed to be quite happy&nbsp;on the plant. It must have been a stowaway from the shop. I had put it in the car without even realizing. I think it's good luck, because these insects are great for the garden. They are serious predators who will eat most insects. It could have been a bad bug that I brought home from the garden center, but instead it was a garden helper.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes.</span></p>
<p>Useful phrases: judging by..., to scan, to be in luck, a stowaway.</p>
<p>1. Judging by his negative attitude, he doesn't like living here.</p>
<p>2. The police quickly scanned the parking lot for any movement.</p>
<p>3. We arrived at the airport just in time. We were in luck; people were still boarding the plan.</p>

			<title>Lunch at the Wild Huckleberry.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/lunch-at-the-wild-huckleberry-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I called my mother the other day and arranged for us to meet up for lunch. She had been in Spain for two weeks, and had just returned. We had a lot to talk about, and I was really looking forward to seeing her. But, where would we&nbsp;meet up? There are quite a few restaurants in town, but we are fussy individuals. If we are going to pay for food, we don't want to eat just rubbish. Fast food was 'out', meaning that it wasn't an option. We didn't feel like having sandwiches or heavy pasta either. I love asian food of all kinds, but I fancied something more like salad, so we decided to go to the Wild Huckleberry. I arrived at noon to find that Mum was already there. She had chosen a table next to the window that overlooked the road. The inside of the restaurant is full of character. It is an Americana style house that has flowers and 'collectibles' in many places. Collectibles are similar to antiques, but not old at all. In fact, they can be brand new items that are made to look old. We ordered a soup and salad combination, and chatted about her time with the family in Spain. She was still very jet-lagged, and had not adjusted to the time difference. Now that all of my children are in school, having lunch with a loved one is a treat that I can enjoy. So, we caught up with eachother's news over a clam chowder and an asian salad. It was so pleasant to look out on a quiet street, on a mild Autumn day, just relaxed with nowhere to rush to. As we were leaving, we looked around at the decor and interesting items on the shelves and in corners here and there. I came across a&nbsp;large wooden statue of a waiter holding a tray. It's a place where you put your tips. I couldn't leave without taking a photo. It's a typical collectible, probably not very old, but unusual and attractive it its own way, another thing that adds to the charm of the Wild Huckleberry.</p>
<p>Grammar notes.</p>
<p>Useful expressions:&nbsp; to be +'out', to overlook, a collectible, to adjust.</p>
<p>1. That skirt is really 'out'. She should follow fashion and get one that is up to date.</p>
<p>2. His bedroom window overlooks the garden; sometimes he sneaks out at night.</p>
<p>3. That shop doesn't sell antiques, but it does sell collectibles that are quite attractive.</p>
<p>4. It took me four days to adjust to the time difference after I came back from China.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One thing that I do in the morning, is to drive my children to school. It doesn't take very long, perhaps five minutes. Parents can pull up into a parking area that is near the school playing field to drop their kids off. Something caught my eye, the first day of school, which I hadn't seen before. A school garden has appeared, and is full to the brim with all kinds of plants. I had completely forgotten that it existed. Because I was out of town for most of the Summer, I hadn't seen the progress that this new garden had made. It was designed and planted this year, so it is new. After the funds had been raised for this project, some volunteers got together and sectioned off a piece of the school property that is right next to the road. A fence was built, and the grass was removed. Then, good quality soil was added, paths were made, and tiny plants were planted. It seemed like nothing at first. Mostly what you could see was the bark that was put on top of the soil which keeps the weeds away. By the time school finished in June, there were quite a few perennial flowers and some vegetables. But that was all that I got to see. My goodness, what a difference now! I had a good look at the garden the other day, and was very impressed at what I saw. There are several, large pumpkins which will be huge by the time it is Halloween. Tomato plants, vines, and a mix of vegetable friendly flowers are also there, you know the kind, like Marigolds which keep certain insects away, and encourage others. It's a jumble of healthy plants, which is what I like to see, - not too neat and tidy. I'm sure the teachers have some lessons planned that will include the garden and its produce. It's a great example of 'hands-on' learning.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, one of my sons had a couple of baseball games in a local park. It's that season again! It was actually a perfect day for the sport as well; it was sunny but cool. There were lots of people sitting and watching the event. In fact, there were more people than usual because there was a huge Mexican fair taking place in the same park. There was live music from various mariachi bands, lots of food stands selling authentic dishes, toys and ceramics to buy, and even bouncy castles for the little children. It was very colorful and fun, and more and more people came to it as the day went on. The place was packed by mid-afternoon. The fair was to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the independence of Mexico from Spain. So, as you can imagine, the parents and family members who were watching the baseball game, would smell the delicious Mexican food, and briefly disappear into the crowd to buy a plate of fresh tacos. It was unusual and quite amusing, to watch a serious baseball match to the sound of loud mariachi music! One thing I noticed was that people were dressed up very smartly. Families had made the effort to look extra elegant for this event. And there were traditional costumes and flags everywhere. Accompanying the crowd, were a multitude of dogs, who also were very elegantly dressed! They were everywhere! There were dogs of all sizes, wearing all kinds of costumes! One caught my eye because she was so, so tiny. A 'tea-cup Yorky' called Daisy who belongs to a family I know, was showing off her pink, flowery dress near the game. I couldn't believe how small she was. She actually didn't look real, I think because the combination of her size and her dress made her look like a toy. How small do these animals get? And how fast she was! Her owner told me that if she escapes, no one can catch her. It's a good job that she was on a leash in that busy park, otherwise she would have been gone like a flash. Daisy is a cute name, but one that suits her better would be Mini Lightening!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that we enjoyed most about our vacation this Summer was the beach. I've always been an inland person; I love forests and mountains. However, this Summer we were in very beachy places. It was the first time that I had been on the Costa Brava in Spain. It is renown for its interesting, rocky beaches, fishing villages, and small, sandy coves. Because we stayed in Girona, in the north of Spain, we were about half an hour from a whole list of beaches. It happened to be an extra hot Summer in Spain, so being close to the sea was very appealing. We went several times. We would pack a lunch, get our supplies of towels, swimming suits, goggles, and water bottles, pile into the rental car, and off we would go. One of the beaches that we went to was unusual in that the grains of sand were much bigger than normal. I know this seems unimportant, but for me it was. Once you were dry, the sand just brushed off perfectly cleanly. Magic. There was no hassle of sticky sand in your shorts, between your toes, or in the car. It came off with a quick wipe. And, of course, the views were wonderful. You could look along the coastline and see other towns and villages to the north and to the south. Our children begged us to rent one of those, ..., well, I'm not sure what they are called, but they are like a paddle boat, but shaped like a car with a slide ontop. Crazy! And crazy fun it was. My husband and I did the hard work of pedaling, and the kids had the job of sliding down into the water and making lots of noise. Both of us tried a couple of times, but when we did it, it was like a couple of whales&nbsp;sitting on top of the boat, sliding slowly, and making the whole boat&nbsp;lean to one side.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, and welcome back to A Cup Of English. I'm very excited to start this season of podcasts; I have a lot to tell. I have been away, with my family, travelling around Europe, visiting family, for about 6 weeks. We had a great time, but now it is time to get back to work, and to 'hook up' with my listeners again. I hope your Summer was a very good one, and that now, you are ready to learn some more English. For the first week back from vacation, I dragged my feet a little. That means that I didn't have a lot of energy to get on with normal activities. Jet lag was one reason for my tiredness. And then, when I saw the huge mountain of laundry that I had to do, I felt like running and hiding. But, hey, I have nothing to complain about. It is nice to be back in familiar surroundings. The kids were pleased to play with their toys again. My boys immediately set up a big 'battle' with their various soldiers, plastic monsters, robots, and bionicles. They kidnapped a few of my daughter's dolls to make their game more interesting. She was pleased to see her Hello Kitty soft toys again, and to color in her coloring books. The best part of getting back was the beds! To sleep in your own bed is heaven! My son Cass giggled when he went to bed because he was so relieved and comfortable. Those long, transatlantic flights are not the most comfortable, are they? So, what about your English? Have you kept up with it at all? It is difficult to do so during vacation, unless you are lucky enough to be around native speakers. I was able to practice my Spanish quite a bit with my family in Spain. And I even had a few short conversations in French when we were near the border with France. It may sound silly, but it was very exciting for me. Well,&nbsp; now, I have to drive off and pick up my kids from school, but I will be podcasting again tomorrow, and talking about some of the fascinating things I saw this Summer. So join me for some practice!</p>

<p>"Oh no," exclaimed Darzee so the snake could hear, "my wing is broken and I can't fly." The bird just needed to get the snake away from her eggs. The bird fluttered down the garden path and Nagaina followed closely. Rikki-tikki ran to the melon patch and carried off the eggs. he was carrying the last egg, when Darzee flew over him. "Oh Rikki-tikki, Nagaina has trapped Teddy and his parents on the porch of the house." Rikki-tikki ran as fast as he could. He reached the porch with the last egg in his mouth. Teddy's family had sat down to eat, but none of them moved. Their faces were white as snow. Nagaina stood inches away from Teddy's chair. She was ready to strike at any moment. Rikki-tikki dropped the egg on the floor. He yelled, "Nagaina, I have the last of your eggs here. I have taken all the others from the garden. This is your last one. Leave them alone and I will give this egg to you." Nagaina spun around. She forgot everything for the sake of that one egg. As soon as she turned away from them, Teddy's father grabbed him and pulled him to safety. Now Nagaina turned on Rikki-tikki, and a wicked fight began. The two animals moved round and round in an angry dance on the porch. But Rikki-tikki was very quick. He jumped back with each of Nagaina's wicked strikes. Rikki-tikki forgot about the egg, though. After a few minutes, Nagaina got close to her treasure. Before Rikki-tikki could catch her, she snapped up the egg in her mouth and raced down the steps off into the garden. Rikki-tikki followed behind Nagaina. Darzee flew straight at the snake to slow her down a bit. She gave Rikki-tikki the chance to grab Nagaina's tail just as she slid down into her hole. Deep in the hole they continued their fight. The long grass at the entrance to the hole shook as the two struggled underground. Then the grass stopped waving. All the animals thought that Rikki-tikki had lost. Suddenly, Rikki-tikki's head popped out of the hole. "Nagaina has taken her egg and gone," he said. "She will never come back to this garden." The tiny mongoose was content. He owed Teddy's family a big favor for saving him from the flood. By keeping his English friends safe from Nag and Nagaina, Rikki-tikki had returned the kindness.</p>

<p>"Who is Nag? I am Nag. My family has ruled this garden for thousands of years. Look at me and be afraid." Rikki-tikki was scared for only a minute. He knew that as a mongoose, he was supposed to fight snakes. Nag knew it too. "Look out!" yelled Darzee's wife. At just that moment, another snake struck at Rikki-tikki from behind. The snake, Nag's wife Nagaina, had tried to bite Rikki-tikki. She just missed him. Then, the two snakes quickly slithered off into the grass. Later that night, Rikki-tikki heard a peculiar sound. Rikki-tikki could make out what seemed like the sound of snake skin rubbing on bricks. Nag or Nagaina was in the house! As quick as he could, Rikki-tikki ran off to Teddy's parent's bathroom. There he heard two voices whispering in the dark. It was Nag and Nagaina. "When the house is empty of people," Nag said to Nagaina, "we'll force Rikki-tikki to go away. Then the garden will be ours again. We are the king and queen of the garden. Remember, our eggs in the melon patch will be hatching soon." "Go in quickly," Nagaina said, "and scare off the people. Then you and I will take care of Rikki-tikki together." "Go in quickly," Nagaina said, "and scare off the people. Then you and I will take care of Rikki-tikki together." Rikki-tikki's eyes glowed the deep red of a polished ruby. He heard Nagaina slide away into the grass outside. Rikki-tikki thought of all the nice things that Teddy's family had done for him. He inched closer to the deadly snake. He would fight the snake and send him away for good. Then, as quickly as lightning, Rikki-tikki jumped. He grabbed the snake by the back of the neck. Nag whipped his head around. Then snake swung Rikki-tikki like a limp rag doll. Then Rikki-tikki heard a large crack. Teddy's father had taken a stick and hit Nag in the head. The cobra lay still on the cold tile floor. Teddy's father picked up the snake and got rid of him. "Oh my," Teddy's mother cried from the bathroom doorway. "That mongoose has saved all our lives." Rikki-tikki walked back into Teddy's room and slept. When morning came, he knew he would have to find Nagaina and fight her too. Once she found out that Nag was gone, she would be very dangerous...to everyone. Rikki-tikki went to the garden with a plan. "Darzee," he called, "you have to help to distract Nagaina while I go and find her eggs." Darzee agreed to fly over to where the snake was lying in the grass and lure her away. Nagaina was sitting by the house and crying over her lost Nag.</p>

The cobra lay still on the cold tile floor. Teddy's father picked up the snake and got rid of him. "Oh my," Teddy's mother cried from the bathroom doorway. "That mongoose has saved all our lives." Rikki-tikki walked back into Teddy's room and slept. When morning came, he knew he would have to find Nagaina and fight her too. Once she found out that Nag was gone, she would be very dangerous...to everyone. Rikki-tikki went to the garden with a plan. "Darzee," he called, "you have to help to distract Nagaina while I go and find her eggs." Darzee agreed to fly over to where the snake was lying in the grass and lure her away. Nagaina was sitting by the house and crying over her lost Nag.

<p>This tale is of a brave mongoose, named Rikki-tikki-tavi, and his great fight to help a family that saved him. It all took place in the far-off land of India. It began on the first sunny day after many days of darkenss and rain. A young English boy, Teddy, went outside to explore. There he found a mongoose in the road. A mongoose is a small animal, a bit like a cat and a bit like a weasel. This mongoose, Rikki-tikki, had thick hair and a bushy tail that made him look like a cat. His skinny head and the way he moved his feet were just like a weasel. His wiggly nose and eyes were pink. But when he got mad, his eyes turned deep, deep red. A big summer flood had washed Rikki-tikki out of the hole where he lived. The water carried him along and dumped him in a ditch just outside Teddy's house. This was how Teddy found him. "Look, Mummy, a dead mongoose," Teddy said as he carried Rikki-tikki inside. "Let's have a funeral." "No Teddy," said his mother. "Maybe he's just wet. whey don't we dry him off?" Teddy's father wrapped the animal in a towel to warm him up. The towel tickled Rikki-tikki's little pink nose. The mongoose sneezed and then looked around. Rikki-tikki was very curious. Rikki-tikki ran up to Teddy and rubbed his wet head under the boy's chin. "Hey, that tickles," Teddy cried. "He wants to be your friend," Teddy's father laughed. "Wow, how amazing," said Teddy's mother. "He's a wild animal. I guess he's so tame because we've been kind to him." "As long as we don't pick him up by the tail, or put him in a cage," said Teddy's father, "he'll be happy here." Then Rikki-tikki spent the whole day running through Teddy's house making himself at home. At bedtime, he climbed up into bed right next to Teddy. The next morning Rikki-tikki went out into the garden. It was a large yard with rosebushes and plenty of tall grass. Rikki-tikki heard a sad song coming from the trees. He looked up and saw Darzee, the songbird. One of her eggs had fallen out of her nest and a snake had eaten it. "Those snakes, Nag and Nagaina, are evil," Darzee cried. The snakes were cobras, some of the biggest, deadliest snakes around. "I'm sorry," said Rikki-tikki, "but I am new here. Who is Nag?" Just then, a big snake slithered up through the tall grass. It hissed a low breath that was harsh like steam from a radiator. Rikki-tikki was so scared by the sound that he jumped two feet.</p>

The people had moved inside the castle for protection. But soon the dragon had run out of animals to eat. "If you do not feed me sheep each day," the dragon roared,"I will come through those walls for my breakfast!" So each day, as the sun rose, so did the dragon, looking for its breakfast. "The dragon sleeps now," said the princess," but we gave up our last two sheep this very morning. Tomorrow we shall have nothing to give the dragon, and we shall all perish." "Then I have arrived at the right time," said George bravely. They came to a cave in the dark forest. "To slay the dragon," Sabra told George, "we need help, that is why we are here."

"Alas, sir," the woman replied, "you are only one man. I'm afraid you cannot help." George looked into her eyes and said, "It is my destiny.

<p>Thumbelina (part 3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span></span></strong></span></strong></p>
</span></span></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Thumbelina told the field mouse of the horrible frog who took her away from her home. She told her how much she couldn't wait to get back to her mother and her garden. The field mouse invited Thumbelina to stay with her for the Winter. Together they gathered nuts, grains, and berries for the cold months ahead. Thumbelina sang songs and told stories, while the field mouse cokked their dinner or sewed by the fire. One day it began to snow lightly. Thumbelina had never seen snow before, so she opened the door to peek outside. But as she looked outside, she saw something strange. Lying near the front door was a young sparrow with a broken wing. He was shivering and he looked sad. Thumbelina called the field mouse. Together they helped the sparrow into the burrow and fed him some soup. Thumbelina, the sparrow, and the old field mouse spent the Winter together in the burrow. Thumbelina helped to mend the sparrow's wing so that he would be able to fly again. She told them stories of her kind mother and the beautiful garden where she was born. She hoped she would see her home again. One day, Thumbelina poked her head outside the burrown again. Tiny green shoots were beginning to appear all over the meadow. "Spring is coming!" she shouted to her friends. Soon the days were warm and sunny. The sparrow decided it was time to leave the burrow. "Thumbelina," he said, "you saved my life. Now I woiuld like to help you find your mother." Thumbelina said good-bye to her field mouse friend and climbed on top of the sparrow. She held on tight to the sparrow's feathers as he flew high above the trees. "Do you think we will ever find my mother?" Thumbelina asked the sparrow. "Yes, but first I have something special to show you," said the sparrow. He flew deep into the forest and landed gently in a thicket. All around them, beautiful flowers blossomed. No sooner had they landed, than a lily opened and out stepped a tiny boy. He wore a crown on his head, and he had a pair of shiny wings. "I am the Prince of the Flowers,: said the boy.

Thumbelina (part 3).
&nbsp;

Thumbelina told the field mouse of the horrible frog who took her away from her home. She told her how much she couldn't wait to get back to her mother and her garden. The field mouse invited Thumbelina to stay with her for the Winter. Together they gathered nuts, grains, and berries for the cold months ahead. Thumbelina sang songs and told stories, while the field mouse cokked their dinner or sewed by the fire. One day it began to snow lightly. Thumbelina had never seen snow before, so she opened the door to peek outside. But as she looked outside, she saw something strange. Lying near the front door was a young sparrow with a broken wing. He was shivering and he looked sad. Thumbelina called the field mouse. Together they helped the sparrow into the burrow and fed him some soup. Thumbelina, the sparrow, and the old field mouse spent the Winter together in the burrow. Thumbelina helped to mend the sparrow's wing so that he would be able to fly again. She told them stories of her kind mother and the beautiful garden where she was born. She hoped she would see her home again. One day, Thumbelina poked her head outside the burrown again. Tiny green shoots were beginning to appear all over the meadow. "Spring is coming!" she shouted to her friends. Soon the days were warm and sunny. The sparrow decided it was time to leave the burrow. "Thumbelina," he said, "you saved my life. Now I woiuld like to help you find your mother." Thumbelina said good-bye to her field mouse friend and climbed on top of the sparrow. She held on tight to the sparrow's feathers as he flew high above the trees. "Do you think we will ever find my mother?" Thumbelina asked the sparrow. "Yes, but first I have something special to show you," said the sparrow. He flew deep into the forest and landed gently in a thicket. All around them, beautiful flowers blossomed. No sooner had they landed, than a lily opened and out stepped a tiny boy. He wore a crown on his head, and he had a pair of shiny wings. "I am the Prince of the Flowers,: said the boy. "Live with us and be the Princess of the Flowers." He gave her a tiny pair of silvery wings and a beautiful crown. But Thumbelina missed her mother. She agreed to come back to the prince, but she had to see her mother. When Thumbelina flew into her mother's garden, the woman was so overjoyed to see her tiny daughter that she laughed and cried for joy. ]]></itunes:subtitle>

<p>There was once a woman who lived in a tiny cottage which had a beautiful garden. She was very happy tending her garden, but over time she became sad. She had no children who could share her garden with her. She decided to ask the old witch in her village for her help. When the woman explained that she wanted a child, the old witch thought for a moment. Then she pulled a tiny bag out of a pocket in her cloak. "Plant these wildflower seeds and look after them. Soon you will have your wish." The woman was overjoyed that the witch had given her a solution to her problem. She took the seeds home with her. The next day, she planted them in a sunny corner of her garden. It was the prettiest spot that she could find. She watered and watched over the seeds every day. Soon, tiny green sprouts began to poke up out of the ground. Before long, the sprouts grew and blossomed into a beautiful patch of wildflowers. In the corner of the wildflower patch grew a single, beautiful tulip. Its deep pink petals were closed up tightly. The flower was so lovely that the woman could not resist bending down to smell it. As she knelt in front of the flower, its petals suddenly opened. The woman was amazed to find a tiny girl sitting inside. She wore a tulip petal for a dress and had long, gleaming hair. "You are the most beautiful child I have ever seen! And you are hardly even as big as my thumb. Would you like to stay with me in my garden? asked the woman. "Oh, yes!" replied the girl. "I will call you Thumbelina," said the woman. At home, she made Thumbelina a tiny bed out of an acorn shell. Thumbelina slept soundly under rose petal blankets. She and her mother lived very happily in the garden the whole summer long. She loved to play in the little pond in the middle of the garden, so her mother made her a tiny boat out of a maple leaf. She rowed around the pond using two blades of grass for oars. Her mother sat by the side of the pond and read stories to her while she played. Sometimes, Thumbelina sang as she rowed. She had the most beautiful, silvery voice that her mother always loved to hear. One day, a frog was hopping by the garden pond. Her heard Thumbelinas's beautiful voice.

<p>In the yard, the Captain whispered to his men, "Wait until you hear my signal. Then leave your barrels and storm the house." Morgiana helped Ali Baba's family feed their guest. She thought it strange that a man would arrive so early for market, but the oil merchant seemed very polite. After everyone had gone to bed, Morgiana finished cleaning up. Her lamp ran out of oil. She thought she'd have to finish cleaning in the dark until she remembered the barrels of oil in the yard. She walked up to a barrel. A voice whispered, "Is it time?" Morgiana sensed danger. She answered in a deep voice, "Not yet, but soon." Then, gathering some hay around each barrel, Morgiana lit the hay with a torch. The 39 cowardly thieves coughed from the smoke. They popped out from their barrels and ran away to keep from getting burned. The Captain of Thieves made his signal, but none of his men moved. Something had gone wrong again. The Captain returned to the cave to find his 39 robbers gone. Now on his own, the thief decided he would have to use all his cunning to plan his revenge. it would take time, too. The Captain dressed as a shop owner, went into town, and took up lodgings at an inn. He opened a shop across the road from Ali Baba's shop. The Captain pretended to be somebody else for many months. He waited in this disguise until just the right moment. After a while, Ali Baba invited the newest shop owner over for dinner. The Captain accepted and brought a basket of fine goods. He smiled as he met Ali Baba and his family. Even though he was polite, the Captain carried a dagger in his belt which was intended for Ali Baba and his son. Morgiana saw the dagger first. She then recognized the man as the oil merchant who had threatened Ali's household. Morgiana quickly came up with a plan. She wore long, flowing scarves, then entered the dining room to dance for the guest. Morgiana danced close to the Captain. Stepping behind him, she wrapped a scarf lightly around his arms then pulled hard. He could not move. "What are you doing?" Ali Baba cried. "This man is our guest." "He is your enemy," she exclaimed. "He has a dagger!" At that, Ali Baba's son took the dagger, and the Captain of Thieves was sent directly to prison. "I owe you my life, Morgiana," Ali Baba said. "Please marry my son and join our family." Morgiana agreed and they celebrated with a splendid wedding.</p>

"Mark the door, and I will lead 30 men to storm Ali Baba's home."The thief did as he was told, but again Morgiana played her trick on the Captain and his 30 thieves. The Captain decided to use all his power against Ali Baba. The Forty Thieves gathered together and made a plan. The Captain would disguise himself as an oil merchant. He would lead a train of mules that carried 39 barrels. The thieves would hide inside the barrels and await their Captain's signal. It was a great plan. Early that night, they arrived at Ali Baba's shop. "I have brought some oil to sell at market tomorrow," the Captain lied. "But tonight I need a place to stay and I have a lot of cargo. Will you take me in?" Ali Baba was as generous as usual. "Of course you can stay here," he replied. "Leave your cargo in the back. There is hay there for the mules. Then come in for dinner."</p>

<p>The minister saw the odd procession and cried out at the three sisters, "Have you no shame, girls? Why are you running after the boy? It's just not right!" He tried to pull the youngest girl away. Suddenly, he felt that he was stuck in the crowd and had to follow the goose, like everybody else. The minister's wife saw her husband running along with the three girls. She cried out in amazement, "Dear husband, slow down! We have to be at a wedding in a few minutes!" She pulled on his sleeve to try and stop him. Then, she was caught in this silly parade too. They passed two farmers on a road. The minister's wife called for help, but as soon as they touched her, the farmers were pulled along, too! Samuel hurried into the next town, with the curious party of seven behind him. There a king lived with his only daughter. The princess was so serious that it was believed that she could not laugh. So the king sent out a proclamation. Whoever made the princess laugh would have her hand in marriage. When Samuel heard about the princess, he took his golden goose to her. At the sight of this silly group of people, the princess burst into laughter. The king thought she might not stop. Samuel asked the princess to marry him. But, before she could answer, the king stepped in. He did not want Samuel to marry his daughter, so he made up a list of conditions. "First," the king said, "bring me a man who can drink a whole cellarful of cider, then a man who can eat a mountain of bread." Samuel thought of the little man in the woods and rushed off. The old man was sitting in the same spot as before. "Oh, I'm so thirsty, and so very hungry," said the man to Samuel. "I cannot seem to drink enough cider or eat enought bread." Samuel quickly took the old man to see the king. The little man happily drank all the cider and ate all the bread in the king's cellar. Then Samuel approached the king and asked for his bride. But the kiing was ready with a third demand. "Now bring me a ship which sails on land as well as on sea." Again, Samuel went to see the little man. " I will share all my magic with you," said the old man, "because you have been so kind to me." Soon Samuel was back at the castel with a ship that sailed on land and sea. The king had no choice but to let Samuel marry the princess. The two were married that very day.</p>

</span></strong>When Samuel reached for their snack, he found a magnificent sweet cake and a large bottle of cider for them to share. "My, look at this," said Samuel. "I am glad I have much more than stale bread to share with you." When they finished their tasty meal, the old man told Samuel, "You shared your goods with me, and for that I am grateful. Now you will have good luck to go with your kind heart." The little man pointed at an old tree nearby. "Cut down that tree and you'll find something special there in its roots." Then the man walked away without another word. Samuel was puzzled, but did as the old man had said. Samuel raised his ax and cut down the tree. When the tree fell, more than just a stump remained. Samuel found a goose sitting among the roots. This was no ordinary goose. Its feathers were made of gold! "What a wonderful surprise!" shouted Samuel. He had never seen anything like this before. He picked up the goose. Sure enough, its feathers were pure gold. Samuel took the goose and hurried into town. He had to show this goose to everyone he knew. Samuel was proud as he carried this goose through town. He passed an inn, and the innkeeper's three curious daughters came out to see the bird. Each of the three daughters wanted to take one of the goose's golden feathers to keep. When Samuel stopped to show off the golden goose to the three sisters, the oldest sister tiptoed behind Samuel and tugged at the goose's wing. her hand stuck there so tightly that she could not move it away. She waved to her sisters for their help. The sisters thought that together they could surely pluck out three gold feathers. They joined hands to pull. Instead, the three sisters found they were all stuck to each other! The sisters hushed their worried squeals and scurried behind Samuel, who never noticed the girls hanging on behind. He marched for the next town to share his goose's beauty with anyone who wished to behold it. Samuel hurried through a field on his way to the next town. The three stuck girls followed closely behind. </span></strong></span></strong><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>

His family often treated him poorly. They didn't know that he was capable of much greater things, until the day that he met a strange old man in the woods. That day began as Samuel's oldest brother went to cut wood. Their mother packed a sweet cake and a bottle of cider for her oldest son to take into the woods. Samuel stayed at home and chopped nuts. In the woods, Samuels's brother came upon a little gray man. The man kindly said good day and asked, "Will you share your meals with a tired old man? I am very hungry and thirsty." Samuel's brother yelled at the man. "If I share with you, I won't have enough for myself," he said. "Now out of my way!" The brother left the man standing there and went to chop a tree. After a few strong swings, his ax slipped and hit his arm. He suffered a deep cut and could no longer continue his work. The little man saw all this happen. He smiled as the oldest brother hurried home to dress his wound. Now, the second brother was called to get the firewood. Their mother gave him sweet cake and cider for his journey, as she'd done for the oldest brother. Before long the second brother also met up with the old man in the woods. The man kindly said good day and asked if he would share his meal with him. This next brother was as selfish as the first. "If I give you my food and drink, I won't have enough for myself," he said. "Now get out of my way!" The second brother walked away and found a tree to chop. He swung so strongly with the ax that the head dropped off. It fell right on his foot, and so, he also had to go home hurt. Back at the house, young Samuel said, "Let me go and cut wood, Father." "You know nothing about it," replied his father harshly. "But if you want to get hurt, then go." Samuel's mother gave him some stale bread and a jug of warm water. In the forest, Samuel met the little gray man as well. "Would you share some food and drink with a tired old man? I am so very hungry and thirsty," he said. "I have only stale bread and warm water," Samuel said, "but if you don't mind that, we can eat together." They sat in the woods to eat.</span></p>

"I have only stale bread and warm water," Samuel said, "but if you don't mind that, we can eat together." They sat in the woods to eat.

<p>Alistair led Oliver through the dining room. They hid behind potted plants and raced under tablecloths. They waited until the chef went to check something in the dining room, then they scampered across the kitchen and into the dark pantry where Oliver stumbled over something. "Do be careful," said Alistair. Oliver saw what he'd stumbled over. "It's a-a-a..." "A mousetrap," Alistair knocked it under a shelf with his paw. "You will learn to stay away from them." Alistair led Oliver up the shelves to the hors d'oeuvres. Alistair gobbled fancy crackers, nibbled pasta, and even managed to chew a hole in a tin of smoked salmon. "Now this," said Alistair, patting his tummy, "is fine dining." Oliver was still so frightened, that he barely ate a crumb. "Tonight the chef is preapring roast duck with herbed potatoes in a delicate cream sauce." Alistair's mouth watered. His whiskers twitched. "One taste and you'll never go back to the country." The mice crept out of the pantry. The kitchen seemed empty. Alistair rushed about, gathering up bits of duck and potatoes. He didn't notice the chef coming back into the kitchen. But the chef noticed Alistair. "You again!" shouted the chef. The chef chased the mice around the kitchen with a broom. Alistair and Oliver escaped through a hole under the sink. "No main course tonight, I'm afraid," said Alistair. "But don't worry, cousin. We'll make up for it with dessert." Alistair showed Oliver the tarts and pies and cheesecakes. Oliver nibbled the edge of a flaky cream puff. It was so delicious! He leaned forward to get a bigger bite and splat! He landed face down right in it. Alistair helped him climb out, and cleaned him off. "I'm not cut out for life in the city," Oliver said. "You take too many risks for your dinner. A mouse could starve to death here, too. I'm going home to the good life." So Oliver dragged his carpet bag back through the crowded city streets, over fields and valleys, until he reached his hole under the roof of the big oak tree. He ate a late supper of acorns and wheat seeds, then curled up in his leaf bed. He could hear the crickets chirping. Back at his hotel, Alistair curled up in his linen napkin and listened to the orchestra play. Both mice sighed. "I love being home," they said.</p>

<p>Oliver gathered acorns and stacked them near his hole. Then he collected seeds from the grass and carried them into the hole. Then he went to the cornfield to find fallen corn. While Oliver was hard at work, Alistair yawned and leaned against the root of the oak tree. Then he wiped the dust from his shoes with his silk handkerchief. When Oliver returned with some corn, he piled it neatly. "Thank goodness you're done." Alistair collapsed into the wheelbarrow. "Now I'd say it's time for a snack and a nap." Oliver giggled. "The work isn't finished. We still have lots to do before we can rest." Alistair sighed. "I'm simply not cut out for the country life," he said. "A mouse could starve to death here. Come home with me for a while. I'll show you the good life." Alistair packed his silk pajamas into his fine leather suitcase. Oliver packed his long johns into his old carpet bag. The two mice set out for Alistair's home in the city. Oliver followed Alistair over fields and valleys, into dark, noisy subway tunnels, and through crowded streets, until they reached the luxury hotel where Alistair lived. Alistair stopped in front of the door. "Polished marble floors and shiny brass knobs," he said. "Now, this is how mice like us are supposed to live." Oliver stared up at the revolving glass door. "H-h-how do we get inside?" "Wait until the opening comes around, then run through," Alistair replied. The door swing around, and Alistair disappeared inside. It took a few more spins before Oliver gave it a try. Oliver spun around and around in the door until Alistair pulled his carpet bag and got him inside. Oliver followed Alistair across the lobby and through a small crack in the wall hidden by velvet draperies. "My appartment," Alistair said when they were inside. Oliver looked around in amazement. Alistair's home was filled with gold candlesticks, crystal goblets, and linen napkins. "We're under a bandstand." Alistair pointed out of the hole that was his front door. "An orchestra plays, and ladies and gentlemen dance every night until dawn." "How can you sleep with all the noise?' asked Oliver. "Sleep?" said Alistair. "I can sleep during the day. We do things a little differently here. Dinner, for example. At a five-star hotel, dinner begins with hors d'oeuvres."</p>

<p>Once upon a time, a country mouse named Oliver lived in a hole under the root of a big, old oak tree. Oliver loved the sound of squirrels chattering during the day and crickets chirping at night. He loved the smell of rich dirt and sweet grass all around him. One day Oliver invited his city cousin, Alistair, for a visit. Before Alistair arrrived, Oliver tidied up his hole. He straightened his leaf bed. He spread fresh pine needles on the floor. He scrubbed the tuna can table and polished the bottle cap plates. Then Oliver sat by the entrance to his hole, gazed out at the stars, and waited for his cousin to arrive. When Alistair arrived, he put his fine leather suitcase on the pine needles. "I say, cousin, is this your cellar?" he asked Oliver. "No," said Oliver, "it's my home." Oliver showed Alistair the back of the hole, where he stored his grain. He led Alistair up to the top of the old oak root, where he sometimes sat to watch the sunset. Then he sat Alistair down at the tuna can table and served him a dinner of barley and corn. Alistair nibbled his meal politely. "This certainly tastes as though it's good for me." He coughed and swallowed. "A bit dry, perhaps. Could I bother you for a cup of tea?" Oliver brewed a thimble of dandelion tea for them both. "Here's to my cousin Alistair! Thanks for visiting," toasted Oliver. When the thimbles were empty, Oliver changed into his long johns, Alistair changed into his silk pajamas, and the mice settled into their leaves for the night. After Alistair rustled around in his oak leaf for a while, he finally went to sleep.Oliver woke up early the next morning, as usual. A robin family was singing in the old oak tree. A rooster crowed in a nearby farm. Alistair squeezed his pillow over his ears. "Oh, dear. What is that terrible noise?" he mumbled. "That's the sound of morning in the country," said Oliver. "It's the wonderful music that makes me want to start the new day." Alistair pulled the pillow from his face and opened one eye. "You start your day in the morning?" he asked. "Here in the country we rise at dawn," Oliver said, putting on his clothes. He pulled on his work boots, and pushed his wheelbarrow out into the garden. Alistair rolled to the edge of his bed. He wiped the sleep from his eyes. He slid his feet into his shiny black shoes, and followed his cousin outside.</p>

<p>Summer time is check-up time for the kids. When school is out, it's convenient to take them to their various appointments with doctors or dentists. Now, believe it or not, dental check-ups are quite exciting for my kids. I know, it sounds crazy. The reason for the excitement is that we have an agreement. If they have no new cavities, then they get a cash prize. The aim is to encourage them to brush their teeth well. They make their plans to buy a certain toy, and I hope that they don't need any fillings. You might think that it's a bit extravagant to pay the kids for not having cavities. Well, when you consider that one filling costs anywhere between one hundred and two hundred dollars, it's worth paying a lot less to a child to keep them brushing. Of course, I help my little ones brush. They always need a bit of extra help cleaning out the hard to reach places of their teeth. But, so far, I'm happy with our system. Only once did one of my children not get his prize, and that was because he would sneak candies into his room and eat them at night, and then fall asleep without brushing his teeth. I only realised this after cleaning his room one day, when I decided to pull out everything that was under his bed. What an experience. Amongst the jumble of toys, books, dirty socks, rocks from the garden, and gross unrecognisable thing, were candy wrappers. "Uh-oh," I thought to myself, "I wonder how long this has been going on..." When we found out that he had a couple of cavities, I had to give him the bad news that he wouldn't get his cash prize. <em>That</em> made a lasting impression! So he had two appointments with the dentist. They gave him the gas to relax him, the injections in his mouth, the fillings and the clean-up. Fortunately, the dentist and his assistant are extremely friendly, - not scary at all. They made every stage of his appointments fun and pleasant, as far as is possible at the dentist. And you know little kids, they love all the equipment, from the reclinable chair, to 'Mr. Thirsty', the liquid extractor that is put in your mouth. And the place looks so nice. There are flowers everywhere, nice furniture, photos of smiling people, and little toys for kids. They manage to create quite an illusion!</p>

<p>Hello there podlisteners. I hope your Summer is going really well so far. I realise that I have 'slacked off' this week when it comes to podcasting. The Summer bug has bitten me, and I have been having too much fun to sit down at work at a computer. To slack off means to become lazy, or to not do your job properly.

What a slacker!

&nbsp;

Hello there podlisteners. I hope your Summer is going really well so far. I realise that I have 'slacked off' this week when it comes to podcasting. The Summer bug has bitten me, and I have been having too much fun to sit down at work at a computer. To slack off means to become lazy, or to not do your job properly. And, we talk about being 'bitten' by a certain bug, when we mean that we become enthused by an activity. For example: The baking bug has bitten me; I bake every day. OR The tennis bug has bitten me; all I want to do is watch the matches on television. So it is with me. There's the good weather, the baseball, the gardening etc etc, so I have officially 'slacked off' this week. However, I'm back in gear again (that's another expression which means to be ready and prepared) to give you all some more podcasts. The thing about slacking off is that it is not satisfying in the end. When you know that you should do something, but don't do it, it's hard to enjoy everything else. My children were watching an episode of Spongebob Squarepants the other day that showed him 'slacking off' and being miserable because of it. He had to write an essay for his boating class. He procrastinated and procrastinated so much, that his time ran out, and he got into a big panic. For some reason, he occupied himself at home with all sorts of activities and chores, even things that he normally wouldn't do, instead of writing his essay. He exercised, cleaned the house until every square inch shone, and did all kinds of unnecessary, silly things, just to avoid his essay. Well, I remember those days in college when I would have an essay to write, and for some reason it would become a painful process of procrastinating. Finally, I would get on with it, and feel much better about myself once it was finished. Podcasting, though, is much more satisfying than writing an essay because I know that my international friends will be listening.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where, oh where can they be?</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">
<p>Have you ever lost something, and looked and looked for it? I've been doing that lately. My oldest son had a PSP and an iPod touch. I say had, because he doesn't have them anymore. They have disappeared, vanished, evaporated. I have looked everywhere. We have all wracked our brains. That means to think and think hard to try and reach a conclusion. Sometimes the grey matter just doesn't work well. The grey matter is, of course, the brain. I tend to get forgetful when I am busy, and when there is a lot on my mind. I often forget something at the supermarket even if I take a list with me. Have you ever walked into a room to get something, and forgotten why you went there? Or perhaps you've met someone on the street who you know, but if you need to introduce them to someone, you forget their name. That too has happened to me. We call these incidences 'senior moments'. It is as if we are very old already. Mind you, a lot of elderly people I know have great memories. Apparently, your memory is like a muscle: the more you use it, the better it works. My mother does sudoku and crosswords to keep her memory sharp; perhaps I should do something like that. Exercise is great for the memory aswell. It forces oxygen rich blood into the brain, and helps you focus, and feel more 'in the moment'. We all laugh about the times we have looked for our sun glasses, and realized that they are on our heads. The other day, I was talking on my cell phone and tidying up in the kitchen at the same time. I wanted to charge my phone, but for the life of me, I couldn't find it. It was only when I finished my conversation and hung up, that I realized that I had been talking on the cell phone, so, of course, I hadn't been able to find it. It's just like the funny story of the busy thief, who went into a bank at lunch time to rob it. His head was covered, but unfortunately for him, he had forgotten to take off his name tag from his place of work. So he was instantly recognized. Oops! I think he needs to do some sudoku too.</p>

<p>A month before we fly.</p>
<p>Today, I went to the awards ceremony at my children's school. It was for the fourth and fifth graders who have made great improvements during the year. It was also to give the fifth graders a good send-off, because they will be moving up to Middle school in September. The principal was the speaker; he handed out certificates and talked about all the activities that the students had taken part in during the year. It was a fairly emotional assembly; I could tell that the teachers would miss the students, - well, some of them. It made me realise that time is moving on. The Summer holidays are upon us! And we will be leaving in a month. I am going to take my kids to Europe for six weeks to visit family and friends. We will fly into London, stay with my step-brother, then up to Scotland to be with my father for about ten days. Then, back down the country to Yorkshire where my sister and two nephews live. The beginning of August we will travel to Mallorca and stay with my mother's family for two weeks, and then we will fly to Girona where we will meet up with my husband for the last two weeks. He plans on getting some serious cycling in, and I just want to discover another part of Spain. I also hope to visit two friends who live in the south of France; it's the perfect opportunity. I can't wait. I will load up on inspiration, I'm sure. Believe me, there will be tonnes of podcast flowing after the Summer, from all the experiences we are going to have. There are no substitutes for beautiful european countries; I'm really looking forward 'going home' for a while. Travelling with four children, however, makes me feel a little nervous, but then again we will be with family most of the time, so that eases my nerves. One month and counting. We will have just enough time to finish up with baseball season, load up the computer with podcasts for my lovely listeners, and off we will go. I won't take my lap top with me, for fear of losing or breaking it. But, I will have a whole Summer of podcasts ready for you. So, here's looking forward to the Summer holidays!</p>

			<title>Real age.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>I was on Facebook today, updating comments to friends and family, when I came across a health test that I chose to take. It is called the 'Real age' test that many people have seen on Oprah. Well, I haven't seen Oprah in years, but I did want to find out about this age test. The main question to be answered by taking it is, "What is your biological age?" You might be forty, but physically you could be older or younger. I have heard of the potential difference between our biological and chronological clocks. So, of course, I was curious about mine. I'm forty two, but biologically how old am I? Thirty, forty, fifty? Eek, the thought of being older didn't please me. I clicked on the link and got on to the Real age page. There were some very simple questions to answer: my age, height, weight, my eating, driving, and exercise habits, and general lifestyle. I was thrilled to find out that I'm only thirty four biologically. Well, perhaps it's true. This Real age thing started at the Cooper clinic longevity center, and Dr. Michael Roizen examines patients with the aim of them changing a few things in their lifestyle to increase their longevity. An improvement can always be made. From the information I put into the test, apparently I don't eat enough whole grains. Okay, I agree. I buy lots of whole grain food for the family, but I don't necessarily eat it myself. I could probably eat more fruit as well. So, a good result of taking the test is that I will make a few changes. I also spent a short while on a yoga website, as I'm thinking of adding more gentle exercise to my daily routine. Whatever I do has to be doable, if you know what I mean. Something that easily fits into my day. Do you do anything for health each day? Let me know and I'll mention it on a podcast.</P><B><U>

<P>Something has been happening recently that pleases me a lot. My newly planted roses have been flowering. For some reason I didn't expect them to make such a show this year, with them being new. My entryway project has continued, and I ended up planting two scented roses right next to a row of lavender. My idea was to get a mixture of sweet smells and color altogether. I wasn't a rose fanatic when I was younger, but I am quickly becoming one. It's the smelly ones that I love, and by that I mean, of course, the ones that smell wonderful. I look forward to the day when my floribunda roses have grown substantially, and fill the area with perfume. Having horses across the street, and goats right next door, the smells in this area can become a bit....um...shall we say overpowering. So I'm going to combat evil with good, stinky with sweet smelling. Another one of my plants that is healthy and has a heavy perfume is my honeysuckle. This Spring, it has been loaded with flowers. The humming birds and butterflies love it. As I was looking around a garden center the other day, I noticed that they had some bougainvilleas. Now there is a plant that I would love to have. I have seen some in Sevilla in Spain that were spectacular, and must have been very old because they were huge. Here, however, our winters are very harsh, and I don't believe that they would do very well. I'm on a mission to find wonderful smelling plants, and beautiful creeping plants to transform my garden. Give me a few years, and I will have done it.</P><B><U>

I wasn't a rose fanatic when I was younger, but I am quickly becoming one. It's the smelly ones that I love, and by that I mean, of course, the ones that smell wonderful. I look forward to the day when my floribunda roses have grown substantially, and fill the area with perfume. Having horses across the street, and goats right next door, the smells in this area can become a bit....um...shall we say overpowering. So I'm going to combat evil with good, stinky with sweet smelling. Another one of my plants that is healthy and has a heavy perfume is my honeysuckle. This Spring, it has been loaded with flowers. The humming birds and butterflies love it. As I was looking around a garden center the other day, I noticed that they had some bougainvilleas. Now there is a plant that I would love to have. I have seen some in Sevilla in Spain that were spectacular, and must have been very old because they were huge. Here, however, our winters are very harsh, and I don't believe that they would do very well. I'm on a mission to find wonderful smelling plants, and beautiful creeping plants to transform my garden. Give me a few years, and I will have done it.

<P><STRONG><U>A badly broken arm.<BR></U></STRONG><BR>It was championship night on Monday. My son Cass and his team were through to the baseball finals. They had worked hard all season, and were about to face an equally good team. It was going to be the Blacks against the Greens. The game started at five thirty. My husband had already taken Cass to the team's warm-up session before the game, so I arranged to meet them at the baseball field at the start of the game. As I entered the ball park, I saw my father-in-law, already situated comfortably to watch the game. I chatted with him a little, but was interrupted by my phone ringing. "Anna, it's Doreen. I've broken my arm. I've broken it badly," I heard my neighbor say with difficulty, and then she hung up. I had to leave. There was no one else to help her. Her son, who lives in town, had a stroke last year and can't drive or talk. Her daughter lives in California, and most of her friends are in their eighties, so it was up to me to help. I told my father-in-law what was going on, and he agreed to look after my kids. I ran off to the car and got to her house as soon as possible. The door to Doreen's house was open, as was her car. There were shopping bags full of groceries here and there; she had obviously fallen whilst trying to unload the car. She was standing in the kitchen crying, and holding on to her arm. After easing her into her car, off we went to the hospital. The nurses cut off her sweater; it was too painful to move her arms and to take off her top. They gave her pain medicine, and then x-rayed her arm. It turned out to be a very bad break, in three places, with one of the little bones in fractures. Doreen looked exhausted. She was tired and hungry, drowsy from the medicine, and now, suddenly, nauseous. She has a delicate stomach, and does not take medicine easily. "I'm going to be sick!" she said covering her mouth. I held a plastic bowl under her chin and held her forehead; that's what my mother used to do when I was little. "Fan her!" I said in a bit of a panic to a lady in the room. After a while she felt better. Poor, poor lady; I felt sorry for her. At least she was in the right place, and arrangements were being made for her surgery in the morning. Her daughter-in-law turned up and said that she would take her home. Of course she wouldn't be able to drive herself, not even for a few months.</P><B><U>

<P>The bell rang today while I was tidying up after dinner. I wondered who it could be at eight o'clock at night. As I approached the door, the bell started ringing very fast, which made me guess that it was one of my children. When I opened the door, I found three boxes on the doorstep. One was a box lid full of dry cut grass, one was a similar box full of tree bark, and the third was the baseball box emptied out and filled with pine cones and pine needles. My son Robert was standing there with a big grin on his face, "D'you see what I did, mum?" His hands and torso were filthy. He had gathered all of these things from the front garden, and had got a lot of the stuff on himself rather than in the boxes. I have been saying for a long time that we should gather up the debris from a tree that we cut down, because it would make great burning material for the Winter. Pine cones catch fire quickly, and keep burning nicely, helping to set the wood on fire. We have two large pines that give a lot of cones each year, so I would like to make the most of this resource that is in our own garden. I am a hunter-gatherer at heart. I have been putting off this task for months, procrastinating, and doing other things instead. So, Robert took the initiative, and did the hard work for me. If we are smart, we will gather the pine cones from the many little pine trees that we have. Though they are small, they have already produced a lot. All together, we will have at least three huge garden bags full of fuel for the Winter. It's funny to think of stocking up for the Winter now that the season is getting warmer and warmer. </P><B><U>

<P>The value of water.</P></B></U>
<P>I don't know if any of you are into photography or not, but it is becoming a passion of mine. I have a cheapo digital camera, but it serves me well. I find myself feeling lost without it. I try to take it with me wherever I go, because you never know when a fabulous photo opportunity will present itself. One such opportunity did the other day, after a heavy rain shower. Most people I know had been complaining about the unusual amount of rain we have had recently. However, one day, after one of those showers, my husband called to me from outside, "Hey, babe, come and see this." When I went out, he was standing by our honeysuckle which grows up and over the fence. It is covered in sweet smelling flowers this time of year. The leaves are waxy and smooth and form a cup shape around the younger flowers. Tom stood quietly and pointed to something down inside the bush. It was a little pool of water that had gathered in the leaves, forming a shiny mound, that sparkled like a diamond. It took my breath away. I immediately ran into the kitchen and grabbed the camera. You'll see on the blog page the result. Later, Tom and I talked about the value of water, the amazing combination of hydrogen and oxygen that we completely rely on, and yet which we take for granted. Water was all around me in England, and here, in the North West there is also an abundance of it. A water shortage for me seems bizarre because I have never had to work hard to obtain it. And yet I know that for much of the planet, a lack of safe drinking water is normal. I remember when I was little, my father would tell me to turn the tap off while I brushed my teeth. He had worked in Nigeria for many years, and was familiar with water preservation. He understood the need to take care of this resource. And now, in many ways, the weather seems to be upside down, with floods in rainy nations, and droughts where water is always short. How can we bring back a balance of water for all? It is, surely, after air, the most precious resource we have.</P>

<P>What do you do at the weekends? Do you do anything special <I>to let off steam </I>or to get inspired? I suppose it depends where you live and what is available. After a hard week's work, it is nice sometimes to not do anything. If you look around, though, sometimes you can find entertainment that is designed to attract the public at the weekend. I went shopping on Sunday, and as I pulled into the parking lot in front of the mall, I saw a large, fenced off area where cars are usually parked. I could hear a lot of noise, as well, even though the car windows were closed. I parked, and looked over to see what was going on. A large go-kart track had been set up inside of the fence, with stacks of tires here and there making the shape of the course. All of the diesel run go-karts were running at top speed. It looked like great fun. I contemplated bringing my kids over later. The trouble is, my youngest two wouldn't be allowed to, and would, therefore, feel left out. It would cause more problems that it was worth. Infact, I didn't even mention what I had seen, because I knew that if I did, they would beg me to take them. So, I just stood there and watched as the drivers zoomed around the track, having a great time. Each person wore a white helmet, and was given about twenty minutes to ride freely. There was a smell in the air of rubber, and an atmosphere of excitement. It was an unusual thing to see in front of a beauty store and a sushi bar. But, I suppose, if the parking area is available, why not? When my youngest are a little older, I might let them put on the gear and race eachother.</P><B><U>

So, I just stood there and watched as the drivers zoomed around the track, having a great time. Each person wore a white helmet, and was given about twenty minutes to ride freely. There was a smell in the air of rubber, and an atmosphere of excitement. It was an unusual thing to see in front of a beauty store and a sushi bar. But, I suppose, if the parking area is available, why not? When my youngest are a little older, I might let them put on the gear and race eachother.

1. My friend bounces on a trampoline to let off steam. She has such a good time when she does it.
2. We put up a fence so the dogs wouldn't escape.
3. After I chopped up the wood, I stacked it next to the garage.
4. We had dinner out on the deck last night, and contemplated the stars.]]></itunes:subtitle>

<P>“The track meet will be postponed until tomorrow,” said a recorded message on the phone, for the second time. The end of the school year is the time for track and field events for all elementary schools. Recently, however, the weather has not been cooperating. Though my flowers have loved the heavy showers, the organizers of this sport have not. Parents of all the contestants have been looking at the sky from about lunchtime onwards, to see if the clouds are moving in. There must be hundreds of phone calls needed to inform everyone about a cancellation. It is a time when, hopefully, everyone involved gets the message. Especially those people who live out of town. Well, today I’m looking in the sky, and I only see a few clouds, so I assume that the event will take place. My son Cass will be sprinting and doing the long jump. He is long and thin, so he is pretty good at that. The administrators have told me that they keep an eye out for good runners during the year, and then they ask them to represent the school in the Spring. The track and field takes place on the Wenatchee High School grounds, because they have the right facilities. Each elementary school wears a different colored t-shirt, so the crowd knows who is who. It is a big, colorful mix of children of different ages, most of whom have long, insect-like legs. There are teachers and volunteers waving their hands around and yelling instructions, so kids know where they need to be. Names are called from lists, and the students line up at the ready. Parents and friends come to cheer them on. We will all go and watch, take a picnic of some kind, and I will look for photo opportunities. The other events include the eight hundred meter relay, the four hundred meter, the two hundred and the one hundred meter dash. And, as far as practices, there haven’t really been any. How do you train a child to run fast? Most of them just do. All of that goofing around in the back yard playing tag will pay off today.</P><B><U>

<P>Every two weeks, on Wednesdays I meet up with a friend of mine, and go for a walk in the park. Today was that day, and though it was really rainy, we had a nice time walking and chatting. I took my camera just in case a photo opportunity presented itself. One did. Coming over a small hill, I saw in the distance about twenty, huge poles sticking up out of the ground, equally spaced, and filling the view. "What on earth are they?" I asked my friend Jody. She told me that they were poles for the power lineman climbing competition. Phew! That is a bit of a mouthful. Power linemen are the men who put up and repair the power <I>cables</I> that are held up by very tall, wooden poles. I had no idea that there were pole climbing competitions anywhere. Who has ever heard of that? Anyway, about the time that school is out for the summer, there will be a day of competition and family fun in the park. Linemen from all around the Northwest will compete to win special belt buckles, and the reputation of being strong and skilled. One of the great things about this event, is that it helps to raise scholarship money for high schoolers who are active in preventing drug and alcohol abuse in the community. Now, that's always a good thing. This competition is named after a lineman who was killed by a drunk driver, and so the fundraising is appropriate. There will also be talks on electrical safety, the dangers of drinking and driving, and the need to wear a seat belt. I will take my kids to the park. They will be allowed to talk to the linemen, handle their tools, and have a photo taken with them. I might be able to try my hand at climbing a pole. Wouldn't that be funny!

<P>Muddy, brown water. A couple of wiffle balls. An old, dirty snowman toy. A plastic Dora the Explora figure that has been buried in the earth for over a year. Add to these things a stinky sock and a few sticks, and you have the perfect recipe for 'sock soup'. And of course you have to mix it all together in a wheel barrow. That is what took place today in my vegetable garden. I was peacefully planting some seeds, and making sure that everything was just right, when I heard some little monkeys come running in my direction. "Uh-oh," I thought to myself, "here comes trouble." Robert and Domini were wanting to get involved in the garden, get their hands dirty, do no work at all, and make a huge mess. You know, like kids normally do. So, I gave them a few rules to follow, and then let them get on with their project. I think they were pretending to be scientists. They stirred the chemicals carefully, and immersed their patient, the snowman, in the mix. It was very serious play time. This experiment would change history. As I watched them, I was reminded about a similar occasion, when a little boy (my brother) and a very little girl (myself) were also mixing a very important cocktail. We were at my grandparents house in the Summer. They had chickens, and some how my brother and I had got hold of the corn feed. We mixed it with water in a very large watering can. And we invented a chant, "Corn and water, water and corn. Corn and water, water and corn." We were so happy, mixing and chanting, chanting and mixing. We could have continued for hours. However, my very traditional, serious, and a little impatient grandfather was trying to sleep on a lawn chair nearby. He tossed and turned, and tried to ignore us. But then, suddenly, he just couldn't take it anymore. He sat upright, and barked like a bull dog, "For goodness sake, would you be quiet!" Surprised, and a little amused at how cross and red-faced he was, we fell silent for a few minutes. But then we started whispering our chant, instead. How kids love to mess about. It's great. I let my children get on with it, and use their imaginations, until it gets too messy. Then we call it a day.</P><B><U>

            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>A few weeks ago, while my oldest son was having a check-up with the pediatrician, I collected several pamphlets from the clinic's reading area. I thought perhaps I could learn something while I waited. One of the pamphlets was about back health, something that I don't really think about very often. A couple of years ago, however, I had no choice but to think about it, because I suddenly developed back pain. It was nothing serious. I had been carrying my baby on my left hip for a year, and, I think, my back finally had had enough of the imbalance. So, it sent me a message, in the form of pain. Gosh, it was awful. I didn't know what to do. I tried stretching carefully, lying on the massaging chair that we have, and I finally took a pain killer. My husband advised me to go to the chiropractor to check out my spine, and get it adjusted if necessary. The next day, I found myself in line at the chiropractic clinic, waiting for my turn, and reading the posters on the wall that talked about back health. The chiropractic philosophy is that each vertebra affects a set of nerves that influence other parts of the body, including organs and glands. So everything is interrelated. If the spine is okay, the rest of the body can take care of itself. "Makes sense to me," I thought as I read about the parts of the spine: the spinal column, the spinal cord, vertebrae, sciatica, the discks, and the upper, middle, and lower back. As I looked at the people in line, I wondered which part of their backs were hurting, and why. I had met people who had been in car accidents and who had suffered whiplash. That was common. Some people had worse conditions which needed on-going treatment. My back pain was acute, meaning sharp but not long lasting. Others had a chronic condition which goes on for a long time. Well, my turn came. After having an x-ray, the chiropractor told me that I just had a couple of vertebrae out of place. He was pleasant and relaxed, and chatted away as I lay down on the adjustment bed. I remember that I was in the middle of answering one of his questions, when WHAMO! He pushed and twisted my lower back in one second. I heard a 'click' in my back and felt some pressure, and it was over. After checking my mobility, I was on my way home. The pain was gone, and my spine felt loose again. What a relief! I'll take an acute back problem over a chronic one any day/</P><B><U>

            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>Have you ever walked into your kitchen first thing in the morning and found that little, tiny strangers have moved in? And not only have strangers moved in, but there are hundreds of them, and they are eating your food. Ants. Ants. Where do they come from? And how do they sense where the food is? For the past few days I have been paranoid about people dropping crumbs in the kitchen, because it seems that ten minutes later, some clever ants have gathered around whatever was dropped, and they're figuring out how to move it. And I have to tell you about what I saw a few days ago in my dining room. I was filing some paid bills into a filing box that is close to the floor, when I spotted a dead moth. "No big deal," I thought, until I noticed several ants around it. I bent down to look closer, and I could see that the ants were holding the moth and rocking it back and forth, trying to move it. They succeeded, and started to move the body slowly, slowly towards the wall. Well, believe it or not, I don't have <I>that </I>much time on my hands that I can sit around and watch ant activity, so I had to leave for a few minutes to get on with some work. But, when I <I>did </I>come back, the moth was gone. I couldn't believe it! It was so much bigger than the ants, and they had quite simply taken it. I was so impressed that I am now sitting in the kitchen writing, watching a piece of cracker that I put on the floor a few minutes ago. I am hoping that in a few minutes lots of ants will gather around it, and I can take a good photo. I don't want to encourage them to invade my house, but I have to get a good photo for the blog page. I admire ants; they really get the job done, and they work as a team. Just imagine what we could do if we had their energy! So, for over a week I've been hovering over my kids when they are getting something to eat, saying, "For goodness sake, can you put that on a plate? Ants! Ants!" I have nicknamed one of my sons 'Senor Migas' which means Mr. Crumbs, because, no matter what he eats, he always manages to drop crumbs on the floor. Now, he would probably come in handy.</P><B><U>

But, when I did come back, the moth was gone. I couldn't believe it! It was so much bigger than the ants, and they had quite simply taken it. I was so impressed that I am now sitting in the kitchen writing, watching a piece of cracker that I put on the floor a few minutes ago. I am hoping that in a few minutes lots of ants will gather around it, and I can take a good photo. I don't want to encourage them to invade my house, but I have to get a good photo for the blog page. I admire ants; they really get the job done, and they work as a team. Just imagine what we could do if we had their energy! So, for over a week I've been hovering over my kids when they are getting something to eat, saying, "For goodness sake, can you put that on a plate? Ants! Ants!" I have nicknamed one of my sons 'Senor Migas' which means Mr. Crumbs, because, no matter what he eats, he always manages to drop crumbs on the floor. Now, he would probably come in handy.

<P>AZ's cafe.</P></B></U>
<P>I was running errands today, when I spotted a new business in town. At the bottom of a three story building, in the basement area, a cafe has opened this week. I noticed it because there are some colorful flags flying in the outside eating area. "Oooo," I thought as I waited in the traffic, I must go in there for a quick bite to eat, and to '<I>check out' </I>the atmosphere. Well, I'm very pleased that I did go in. Not only does the inside have a lot of character, but it's purpose <I>serves a good cause</I>. AZ's cafe is a business that gives the unemployed an opportunity to learn skills that will help them get better employment in the future. From dealing with money, a computer, working in the kitchen, waiting on tables and serving the public, or any of the other jobs that are needed to run a cafe properly, this place offers training. It's profits are used to keep it <I>self-sustaining</I>, so it can train people for many years to come. It is run by the YWCA, or the Young Women Committed to Action, or the Young Women's Christian Association, which fights racism and promotes opportunities for women who need help. There were quite a few people eating and drinking in the cafe. The decor was casual, a little eclectic which I like, and antiques were for sale here and there. Well, my eagle vision spotted something dark in a corner that <I>drew </I>me to it. It was a piece of furniture which I immediately recognized as being both a real antique, and English. An extra small church pew, you know, the hard, dark, but ornate seats that you find in old churches. Well, this really was the 'real deal'. I asked if it was for sale. The lady told me that it had been donated after someone had passed away, that it was three hundred years old, and that it costs $850. I almost choked on my coffee! When she went back to the kitchen, I investigated. I opened it to have a look for a brand, or a name, or something. "These people around here don't know what 'old' is," I thought to myself. "It's probably not 300 years old, but it could be. I'll have to ask my mom to have a look; she's an antique's expert." The price tag actually said $500 dollars. That's still too much, but perhaps I can work on these people and over time charm them into giving it to me for a bargain....you never know. But even if that doesn't happen, I will make AZ's cafe my regular place for coffee with friends, to support the people in training, and to keep my eye on that little piece of England.</P><B><U>

<P>The entryway of our house is finally beginning to look pretty. I have recently transplanted plants from other areas of our garden to the walkway that leads up to our house. After choosing a tree to shade the area, I thought that I had finished. About a two weeks ago (a fortnight in British), I saw lots of green shoots coming up right next to the path. I could immediately tell that these new plants were not weeds; they were too uniform, and had pretty leaves. As time has gone by, these little shoots have developed into larger plants that have now flowered. I had completely forgotten that I had planted anemones in the Autumn. And now, they are beginning to flower. Wow! What color they have! It is hard to believe that a little bulb can produce such a spectacular display of beauty and color. These anemones need partial to full shade to grow properly, and the great thing is that they are perennial. They come back every year, each time in larger numbers. I just googled anemones to find out more about them. Their name is Greek for 'wind flower', and they even have medicinal powers to help get rid of cramps and emotional distress. I have a love of shade and semi-shade plants. One of my other favorites is the cyclamen. The flower head is so unusual in the way that it hangs down but all of its petals stand up towards the sky. Each flower is spectacular in its own way. One of the many things that I enjoy about gardening are the surprises that come along. Seeds of a certain wild vine that is in our garden have blown over to the front area, and so now we have baby vines growing all over the place. I try to imagine sometimes what my garden would look like if it were abandoned for a while. It would become a gorgeous jungle of color and shapes, with a mixture of weeds, vines, roses, and stunning anemones.</P><B><U>

<P>In the kitchen yesterday, I was considering all of the language that we are exposed to around the house. Containers of food and cleaning fluids can all teach us a lot of a new language. Even some small appliances often have instructions of some kind on them. When I'm at the kitchen sink, which is very often, I use all sorts of liquids for all of the cleaning that I do. My dish soap is anti-bacterial. Then I have a hand sanitizer that you can use without water. Even some of the hand creams that I put on after washing have ant-bacterial properties. One item that is very popular among housewives are the 'wipes'. They come in a large, plastic, cylindrical containers. They are disposable, already wet, and either have bleach or alcohol in them, so they blast germs wherever you wipe. They are so convenient to use in almost any room in the house, especially the particularly germy rooms, like the bathroom and the kitchen. I remember about 10 years ago, there was an E-coli outbreak in one of the fast food chains here in the U.S. Jack in the box, the American food chain almost came to ruin because of the scandal. And when I say scandal, it really is, if a chain of restaurants is unclean or serving unclean food. It took years for the company to come back and start getting customers again. This, and other incidences have caused standards of cleanliness in restaurants to go up, partly because the restaurants can easily be sued if people get ill. We expect the places where we eat to be very clean, even if the food is no good. And so it is at home. When flu season gets here, we take extra precautions: hand washing, avoiding people who are sick, and using antibacterial wipes everywhere. When I volunteer at my children's school, I often think that handwashing should be part of the daily curriculum, because so many children have runny noses and coughs. Classrooms are a breeding ground for germs. At least, at home, I can do my part and go to war against the germs.</P><B><U>

<P>I have great neighbors. They are friendly, I trust them, and they are helpful. What more could I ask for in a neighborhood? As a friendly neighbor myself, I do what I can to keep my relationship with the people next door to me a positive one. The neighbor to my left recently got married to a lady who loves animals, infact, she used to have a farm. When she moved in she had goats, a pony, chickens, and she bred dogs. Gradually, to please her husband, she has sold some of the animals. That is actually a good thing because the smell of goat manure was becoming a bit overpowering. The neighbor to my right is a busy father of two, who goes to work early in the morning, and only has a cat. He is lively and amusing. He is also honest. He has always made it clear that he hates dogs. He thinks that they are noisy, messy, and silly. Cats, he thinks, are intelligent and sophisticated, and of course, much easier to take care of. Well, I happen to have two dogs, both of whom are still puppies. These dogs live in our back yard which is fenced in. They have a warm, insulated dog house, and plenty of space to run around and play in. But, they are dogs, and they bark. Not very much, mind you. But if they sense a deer is nearby, or if they smell a racoon, they will certainly bark. I think that they can also sense when people don't like them, because when Don, our neighbor who hates dogs, goes to work at six o'clock in the morning, they run up to the fence where they can see his car, and they start barking. They bark as if they have spotted an enemy. So, in order to stay friends with Don, I bought some 'shock collars' for the dogs that 'encourage' them to stay quiet. When they bark, they get a little vibration on the neck that they don't like. And you know, it works, but not enough to give Don a quiet morning. Now, when he gets into his car, the dogs still run up and bark once, "woof!" But then they howl slightly because of the collars, "argh!" After a couple of seconds they do the same thing. After about three times, they give up, and by then, Don has gone. I have to wake up at six, so it's actually an alarm clock for me, an amusing one. But poor Don must think I'm a terrible neighbor.</P><B><U>

			<title>Do it yourself and win $5000.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Do_it_yourself.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>Do-it-yourself is more than a hobby in this town. It is more like a craze. When a job needs to be done around the house, a lot of people will do it themselves, instead of hiring someone else. You don't always need to be an expert to fix a pipe, to paint a wall, to hang a door, or to replace a window. You just need to know how to do it, and you also need the right tools. There are a couple of stores where I live that supply those two things. They have employees who are very knowledgeable about all 'fix it' possibilities. And they have aisle after aisle of tools and equipment which will help you get the job done. As you might have guessed, these stores are huge. They are the biggest shops in the whole town, and they are always busy. They have a gardening section, a lawn care area, a lighting area, a lumber yard (which is where different kinds of wood sheets are available), doors, bathroom and kitchen appliances, floor coverings, paint, and tools. Phew! You could be in there for weeks without seeing everything. People keep coming back out of a desire to improve their homes, to save money, and to take pride in something they have done with their own hands. But now, something else brings them back, the chance to win $5000. Every time you buy something and receive your receipt, you will see on it an invitation to do a survey and enter the code that is on the receipt for a chance to win some big bucks. I have a few receipts at home that I haven't used yet. I should do. A $5000 card to the hardware store would be extremely useful. The list of things I could buy is very long: light bulbs, batteries, fertilizer for the lawn, cleaning fluids, paint, plants, picture hooks, garden tools.....well, I could go on. Apparently, one person each week wins the shopping card. That means that there is probably someone who comes to the store near me, who has already won, and who is buying 'freebies' for his projects.</P><B><U>

Do-it-yourself is more than a hobby in this town. It is more like a craze. When a job needs to be done around the house, a lot of people will do it themselves, instead of hiring someone else. You don't always need to be an expert to fix a pipe, to paint a wall, to hang a door, or to replace a window. You just need to know how to do it, and you also need the right tools. There are a couple of stores where I live that supply those two things. They have employees who are very knowledgeable about all 'fix it' possibilities. And they have aisle after aisle of tools and equipment which will help you get the job done. As you might have guessed, these stores are huge. They are the biggest shops in the whole town, and they are always busy. They have a gardening section, a lawn care area, a lighting area, a lumber yard (which is where different kinds of wood sheets are available), doors, bathroom and kitchen appliances, floor coverings, paint, and tools. Phew! You could be in there for weeks without seeing everything. People keep coming back out of a desire to improve their homes, to save money, and to take pride in something they have done with their own hands. But now, something else brings them back, the chance to win $5000. Every time you buy something and receive your receipt, you will see on it an invitation to do a survey and enter the code that is on the receipt for a chance to win some big bucks. I have a few receipts at home that I haven't used yet. I should do. A $5000 card to the hardware store would be extremely useful. The list of things I could buy is very long: light bulbs, batteries, fertilizer for the lawn, cleaning fluids, paint, plants, picture hooks, garden tools.....well, I could go on. Apparently, one person each week wins the shopping card. That means that there is probably someone who comes to the store near me, who has already won, and who is buying 'freebies' for his projects.
Grammar notes.
Related vocabulary: a freebie, a survey, to take pride in, knowledgeable.
1. A freebie is something that is free to buy, or a gift from a store.
2. After staying at the hotel, we were asked to do a survey about our stay.
3. That gardener really takes pride in his work, and, as a result, his garden is spectacular.
4. My father is knowledgeable about the world wars; he is always reading the war history books.Please, please rate my podcast (or app if you bought it). It's easy:1. Go to the iTunes store.2.

            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>As I was going to the recycling center today, I passed the postman (or, the mail man in U.S). He was sitting in his cute little mail van, next to the mail boxes where he was inserting all of the letters, cards, and junk mail. I pulled over and asked him for our mail which he very kindly gave me. Back in the car, I had a quick look through the collection of things that he had given me, and I found two official looking envelopes from the U.S Department of State, - the place where you get important documents. "I don't believe it," I said to myself, "they've arrived!" The passports that I had sent off for, for my two youngest children, had been issued. When I sent in the applications, I was told that it would take six weeks. It had taken only three, so I was <I>amazed</I> to see them in my hands. It's a miracle! Government paperwork has been completed <I>early</I>! This is one for the history books! Okay, I won't go on. I opened the envelopes and found two, brand new, dark blue U.S passports. Of course I quickly looked for the photos. My son looked very serious; he had had a big smile on his face, but then the photographer had told him not to. So he had quickly turned his happy face into one that looked very serious indeed. My daughter, the day before the photos, had decided to cut her fringe (or bangs in the U.S). So, her forehead had a large, triangular chunk of hair <I>missing</I>. Well, I suppose she is still very cute in the photo, and she'll be able to change it in about five years. So, our most important documents for traveling this Summer are ready. That's one thing that I can cross off my list of things to do. Most of our flights are booked; I just have to tie up a few loose ends and book some rental cars, and our plans will be complete. There is a lot involved in making a big trip, but I'm glad that we have the all-important documents already here.</P><B><U>

			<title>What's for breakfast?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Whats_breakfast.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>What do you feel like eating in the morning? Are you a breakfast eater, or do you just have a coffee or tea? There are so many things to choose from when it comes to the first meal of the day. Traditionally, in England, we have what is called the 'great British breakfast'. It is a substantial meal; if you happen to miss lunch, it doesn't matter because you will still be full with breakfast. Normally it includes: bacon (meaty not fatty), eggs, toast, stewed, skinless tomatoes, sausages, sometimes some black pudding (or blood sausage), orange juice, and coffee or tea. It's perfect if you are going to do lots of physical labor all day. Personally, I can't eat very much straight away after waking up. My stomach isn't ready. I need to be awake a good hour before having a heavy breakfast. A lighter, sweeter kind of breakfast would be french toast or waffles. They are two of my children's favorites. And, nowadays waffles are very conveniently found in the frozen breakfast aisle, in the supermarket. I do make them fresh sometimes, but I've found a brand that my kids like; it's fortified with vitamins, and they can pop them in the toaster themselves. Mind you, I have to supervise them, not just for safety either. They tend to go a little heavy on the syrup when they make their own waffles. As I say to them,"Do you want some waffle with your syrup, or syrup with your waffle?" I much prefer French toast; I find it more substantial and nutritious. It's quite a simple recipe: two eggs, about one cup of milk, beat together, and dip in the white French bread. Then fry in a little butter until both sides are light golden brown. Then you can put whatever you want on top. Syrup is the norm, but we like to put peanut butter, or jam, or sometimes even a piece of ham.It's up to you to choose what you want for a topping. Sometimes getting creative in the kitchen is worth it; it's just a little more interesting than a bowl of cornflakes.</P><B><U>

<P>I heard today that eating nuts helps to lower bad cholesterol. That's good news because I love nuts of all kinds. I always have a stash of almonds and walnuts in the fridge. Apparently, in order to have the full benefits of these nuts, they should be plain: not salted, not sugared, and obviously not roasted. There are some naturally occuring chemicals in nuts that counteract the LDL (or low-density lipoprotein which is the actual name of the bad cholesterol). You probably all know that here in the U.S there is quite a cholesterol problem. Obesity is on the rise, and of course, all of the related diseases as well. As I was thinking about this today, I remembered a sign that I saw in the recent carnival a few weeks ago. It was a list of some fast food items that were particularly high in saturated fat, sugar, refined flour, and all of those dangerous foods. If you check out the blog you will see the photo of the list. The worst item, I think, was the 'deep fried candy bar'. Wow! Just imagine, a candy bar that is already full of calories and so, so sweet, being dipped in a batter (made of flour, milk, and oil) and deep fried in oil. Now, I have a sweet tooth; I like to have something sweet in the house most of the time, but<I> that </I>treat sounds ridiculous. I wonder how many grams of saturated fat were in those fried candy bars. And how much sugar, come to think of it. Curiosity probably makes a lot of people try one of them. Let's hope that it doesn't become a habit. Obesity is predicted to cost the U.S health care 344 billion dollars by the year 2018, because of all the related diseases, complications, loss of work time, and extra health care needed. That is a huge cost! It sounds like some people should trade their candy bars for a few healthy nuts.</P><B><U>

			<title>Spelling mistakes.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>I was checking the comments on my blog today, hoping to get some feedback from my lovely podlisteners, when I came across one that was a bit worrying. Huy Mai very kindly complimented my podcast and informed me that I had made a couple of spelling mistakes on my blog of 'A Haitian art surprise'. I quickly looked up the blog, and realised that I certainly had made a couple of spelling mistakes. "Oh, Anna! How could you?" I said to myself, as I erased and corrected my mistakes. An English teacher making a mistake in English spelling? How is that possible? Shame on me. I made my mind up that I would not allow this to happen again, and that I will triple-check my work in the future. Do you find that you make mistakes when you are tired or in a hurry? I certainly do. It reminds me of a story about my children's school. There was a spelling competition going on, and one of the staff members had put up a message of encouragement on the large notice board that is next to the main road. It told the date of the spelling competition, a few details, and then it said, "We know that you'll do grat," instead of 'great'. Someone driving by noticed the spelling mistake and took a picture of it on her iPhone, and then sent it in to a television station. Gosh, bad news travels fast! I do catch myself, every now and then, when I'm writing a podcast, wondering if I should put the American or English spelling of a word, as many are different. For example, today I have used the words 'realised' and 'surprised', both spelt the English way. In the U.S they are spelt with a 'z'. Infact, the word 'spelt' is not used much in the U.S.; it is interchangeable with spelled, though it really is, in this instance, describing the words, not the action of spelling. Here are some further examples:</P><B><U>

<P>4. The cookies are burnt; we can eat them. Sorry everyone, I burnt (burned) them!</P>

<P>"Did your teacher give you your homework packet?" is a question I ask my children often. Every week they get a set of papers that are stapled together, each paper being either a math sheet or a reading and writing sheet. For the longest time, I couldn't get my youngest son to do his daily sheet. The teachers expect the students to do one sheet each afternoon at home. If they concentrate, it hardly takes any time, but, obviously, the longer you wait to do it in the evening, the longer and harder the homework seems to become. I remember those days of putting off the essay or the written exercises, just hoping that by some miracle they would disappear. Oh, the frustration. The way I got my son to do his homework every day was by using a strategy that included three things. First, he wasn't allowed to play on the Wii until he had done one page. Secondly, I would always be near him to help him, encourage him, push him a little if needed. And third, I would praise and congratulate him once he had finished. After a few months of this, he adopted the habit of always getting his job done. I think that being consistent is really one of the hardest things <I>in life</I>, especially if you haven't managed to turn your obligation into a habit. At least, that's how it is for me. These homework packets are cute, obviously simple; afterall, he is only in the first grade. On most pages there are cute characters drawn, to make the sheet look friendly and fun. And a lot of the exercises are in the form of a game, or a puzzle. You find things like dot-to-dots, crossword puzzles, and counting pennies exercises. It's great to see my son's progress, and I realize that it was worth using strategies to get him to 'dig in' and get the work done.</P><B><U>

			<title>A feather nest.</title>

<P>It's time that I bought a new camera. I need a digital that has a decent zoom. I realized that the other day when I was outside, trying to get a good shot of two birds who were nesting. I had been busy throwing the ball to our dogs, when I saw a flash of white out of the corner of my eye. When I turned to see what it was, I saw a bird, obviously the male, sitting on top of the bird house, with a beak full of white feathers. There were so many of them, that they covered half of his body. He had seen me looking at him, and was nervously twitching his head back and forth, waiting for an opportunity to get into the house in order to carry on with his project. The female was off to the right; she was hard to see because her coloring was so pale. I inched my way forward with the camera already in focus and zoomed as far as it could go. However, these smart, nervous little creatures aren't stupid. Their eyes were fixed on me, and they didn't go anywhere near their birdhouse entrance while I was around. They would fly off and observe me from a distant tree. So, I would back off each time and wait for them to return. This went on a few times, until I realised that I was getting nowhere. So, I did a balancing act on the edge of an outside reclining chair, whilst leaning on a wall, holding the camera around the corner towards the birds. I couldn't even see what I was taking a picture of; I just knew that I had more of a chance of getting a good shot if the birds couldn't see me. I risked my own health for the sake of art, people; I hope you appreciate it. Anyway, I got a fairly good picture of the busy parents-to-be, making the nest cosy for their future chicks. It was worth the danger. But next time, I'll just get a better camera.</P><B><U>

			<title>Rwanda.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
<p>Today, I'm going to continue with my series of 'Getting to know our planet' with the country of Rwanda. What do you know about this central african nation? What springs to mind when you hear the name Rwanda? Before I began this study, I didn't know much at all about this country, apart from the conflicts between the Hutus and the Tutsis, and the genocide of 1994. However,in 2009 a report by CNN called Rwanda the greatest success story of Africa. It is stable, it's average income has tripled in the past ten years, and it has developed positive international relationships. It has turned itself around and become a model for developing countries. How has it managed to do all of this? The answer is good leadership and sensible foreign aid. It's economy is still growing at a rapid rate, such as 11% in 2008. Rwanda is well known for its mountain gorillas which live in the Volcanoes National Park. Out of the one million tourists who visit each year, many choose to track these large primates. The savannah, forests, and rolling hills keep the visitors coming back, and have helped the economy greatly. Other money makers are coffee, tea, and mining. Though Rwanda is so successful, it is actually a very small country. It is under 27 thousand square kilometers, and land locked by Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since its independence from Belgium in 1962, and its initial civil problems, it has become a safe and democratic country which protects all Rwandans from discrimination of any kind. Its capital is Kigali, its currency is the rwandan franc, and its population is over 10 million. It has recently adopted the goal of becoming a knowledge based economy by 2020 with every child owning a laptop in the next five years. That is quite an ambition. But, judging by its record, Rwanda is determined, organized, and will meet its goals.</p>

			<title>A Mother's Day Surprise.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>Sunday, May 9th, it's Mother's day! I don't usually give it much thought, apart from choosing what I should buy for my mother and mother-in-law. I always forget that I will receive presents as well. Mind you, I shouldn't forget. There are plenty of reminders all around. The television has countless commercials for shops that have special offers for mums, and the local newspapers also advertise the deals on flowers, chocolates, clothes, and other things. We are actually bombarded with info. about the special day. I was taken by surprise the day before Mother's day when my husband and second son walked in after returning from baseball practice. The door to the garage opened and in walked, what looked like, an enormous, walking bouquet of flowers. All I could see was a pair of legs (still dressed in baseball pants and shoes), and a huge armful of flowers on top. How lovely! It took my breath away. I've never received such a big bouquet before. It has lillies, roses, daisies, and lots of other flowers that I'm not familiar with. It's big enough to divide amongst two or three vases, but for now, I'll keep it in one. Talk about over the top! Then, each of my children handed me their cards that they had made in school. They were even better than the flowers! What could be nicer? And the spelling mistakes in the poems were so sweet. The typical poem is: Roses are red, violets are blue; sugar is sweet, and so are you. But I received the following: Roses are red, vilets are blue; your smile chers me up, and I love you. I'll have to explain to Cass how to spell 'violets'; I hope I'm nothing to do with vile....His picture is a keeper, however. I'm going to frame it and hang it on the wall in the kitchen. He drew a vase of flowers that he painted with watercolors. It is so soft looking and dreamy,- very impressionistic. It's just what I like.</P><B><U>

			<title>Learning how to bike.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/learning_bike.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2>
<P>'Prevention is better than cure' is a saying that I fully believe in. Similarly, using the correct tools for a job, or wearing the correct protection, is just as smart. I've been thinking about this recently because my little girl has been learning how to ride her bicycle without the training wheels. If it were up to me, I wouldn't teach her yet. However, my husband is confident that she is ready to take this big step. Each afternoon for about a week, they have been practicing on our driveway and around the cul-de-sac. He has given her plenty of coaching about all the things that you need to bear in mind: watch for traffic, get your balance, put the pedals in the right position, don't go too fast, give yourself time to make a turn etc etc. And, you know, she is doing very well. She is completely safe because from head to toe she is protected with pads of all kinds, and then, of course, she has the crowning glory of the all important helmet. Not wearing a helmet is looked upon as being seriously unintelligent in this house. My husband is a serious bike rider, and even some of his veteran riding buddies have had serious accidents. In some of their accidents, if they hadn't worn their helmets, they wouldn't be here today. So, our kids know that you cannot get on the bike without putting your head protection on first. But once that is taken care of, it's time to have fun. I love watching my daughter's sense of achievement show on her face; she's such a tiny little thing, but now has freedom on wheels. I suppose being five is actually a big thing; you learn to read, you learn to ride your bike, and you start school. Gosh, those are big steps!</P><B><U>

<P>Hypothesis and speculation using the subjunctive + related expressions: to bear in mind, from head to toe, veteran, the crowning glory.</P>
<P>1. If he doesn't bear everyone's efforts in mind, he could become quite unpopular.</P>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[
'Prevention is better than cure' is a saying that I fully believe in. Similarly, using the correct tools for a job, or wearing the correct protection, is just as smart. I've been thinking about this recently because my little girl has been learning how to ride her bicycle without the training wheels. If it were up to me, I wouldn't teach her yet. However, my husband is confident that she is ready to take this big step. Each afternoon for about a week, they have been practicing on our driveway and around the cul-de-sac. He has given her plenty of coaching about all the things that you need to bear in mind: watch for traffic, get your balance, put the pedals in the right position, don't go too fast, give yourself time to make a turn etc etc. And, you know, she is doing very well. She is completely safe because from head to toe she is protected with pads of all kinds, and then, of course, she has the crowning glory of the all important helmet. Not wearing a helmet is looked upon as being seriously unintelligent in this house. My husband is a serious bike rider, and even some of his veteran riding buddies have had serious accidents. In some of their accidents, if they hadn't worn their helmets, they wouldn't be here today. So, our kids know that you cannot get on the bike without putting your head protection on first. But once that is taken care of, it's time to have fun. I love watching my daughter's sense of achievement show on her face; she's such a tiny little thing, but now has freedom on wheels. I suppose being five is actually a big thing; you learn to read, you learn to ride your bike, and you start school. Gosh, those are big steps!
Grammar notes.
Hypothesis and speculation using the subjunctive + related expressions: to bear in mind, from head to toe, veteran, the crowning glory.
1. If he doesn't bear everyone's efforts in mind, he could become quite unpopular.
2. If you had been protected from head to toe, you wouldn't have got hurt.
3. If the war veterans received a decent pension, there wouldn't be a need for their charities.
4. If the architect's plans for the new park were approved, it would be the crowning glory of the whole city.]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>A Haitian art surprise.</title>

<P>Leavenworth is fast becoming my favorite local place to have lunch. I took my mother up there today for a yummy trip to Pav's restaurant as an early Mother's Day gift. It was a perfect day, sunny and cool. Actually, they had had a heavy snowfall a few days previously which everyone thought was a bit crazy, but considering that it is a mountainous region, it's not that surprising. We wandered around the main streets a little and window shopped, until we got hungry enough for lunch. Pav's opens at eleven thirty, and we got there bang on time. We were the first ones there, so we chose the very best spot to sit. After we had ordered, we chatted, both admiring the surroundings at the same time. The metalwork on the walls caught our attention, and as we commented on it, the waitress told us that they had bought it all from Haiti. Each piece was for sale, she said, but they weren't sure if they would ever get any more, because of the situation in Haiti at the moment. "They are made out of oil drums", she said. We were immediately intrigued, so we got up, and wandered around the other rooms, looking at the different wall decorations. There were motifs of hearts, crosses, birds, and twisted vines. They were simple yet beautiful, primitive but with delicate detail. My mother couldn't resist it; she had to buy one. As we ate our meal, we read the little attached paper that came with the piece that she had bought. It said that the artisans cut the oil drum open, stuff it with straw, and burn the inside to get rid of residues. Then, sections of metal are cut, and the wall decor evolves out of the use only of a hammer and a chisel. It must be time consuming work, and one that shows how people can become imaginative and resourceful when in need. Looking at the art, we would never have guessed that it came from Haiti. The restaurant, after all, is supposed to look French. However, I can see a connection, and these unusual pieces of art add something special to any decor.</P><B><U>

			<title>What's happened to the weather?</title>

<P>The weather is one thing, where I live, that is consistent. It is one of the attractions about living here. The tourist information about Wenatchee talks at once about the 300 days of sun each year, and the regular, consistent four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Rarely does the weather 'step out of line' or not follow the typical patterns of this climate. Yesterday, however, was a different story. The first thing that made me realize that something was different was that, at six o'clock in the morning, the birds were not singing. Usually they are making a terrible racket at that time. I could hear, instead, the whooshing noise of the wind, and a buffeting or banging as it was hitting the house. I was immediately reminded of the poem 'Wind' by Ted Hughes, but I could hear my kids getting up, so I didn't have time to dream about poetry. As I pulled out of the driveway, I saw that most of the asphalt of the cul-de-sac was under water. The trees were being thrown around by the wind, and the rain poured heavily without stopping. The children were excited at the change in weather. It makes the day interesting, after all. "We must make cookies today, after school," I said. "Yes, and have a fire too," replied one of the children. The idea of getting cosy on a day like today is the fun part of bad weather. 50 mile an hour winds were recorded, and continued to blow most of the day. The baseball game was cancelled, and nobody was out on the street. Our warm front was over for a while, now that a cold one had moved in. C'est la vie! I annoyed a few people by telling them that I love the rain, but it's true. It's in my genes. Well, by evening, the storm had blown itself out, and everything was soggy and still. No harm done, just a good reminder that we can never get too complacent about our consistent climate.</P><B><U>

<P>"Mum, I want to make a volcano," said my son Cass on Sunday morning. "You know, the kind that we can make out of paper," he added. That is an unusual request for a Sunday morning. Papier mache is what he was talking about. I remember making heads and masks out of papier mache in school. We would blow up balloons, and then cover them with a mixture of torn up newspapers, flour, and water, and then leave them to dry for a couple of days. Then, the balloons would be popped and removed, and we would paint and decorate the project. Sounds like fun. This would be a bit more special because, in its center, we would put a plastic container, into which vinegar and baking soda could be poured, in order to get the bubbling, lava-like reaction. We sat and brainstormed for a while: what its base would be, did we have enough newspaper, how to make the lava realistic, could we put model villages at the base of the volcano, etc etc. Our imaginations took off. After we came to a consensus, we made the preparations. We covered the diningroom table with newspaper, mixed the glue, tore up lots of pieces of newspaper, and decided who would do what. Oh, it was so messy! The flour water mixture was wet and gooey, and I had to really supervise my kids who unintentionally would flick the goo from their fingers, and it would go all over the place. Slowly, slowly, the volcano took shape. It even has a lake on one of its slopes. It is drying at the moment in the garage, soon to be painted, varnished, and made more real. Some people I know are quite anxious to see the lava flow, and the warring villagers fight.</P><B><U>

<P>These past two weeks have been Apple Blossom here in Wenatchee. It is a springtime celebration that brings in a lot of business to the area, and is great fun. Just around the time that the apple blossoms appear, the setting up of this week begins. We see large trucks coming into town with the equipment for the food fair, the carnival, the parade, and all the related games and stalls. This annual event has taken place for 90 years, and has grown from a one day event to about eleven days of celebration. It is run by volunteers from different groups, and overseen and organized by the Applarians, which are a group dedicated to the festival. The carnival was the main attraction for us this year. Our children are now at the ages when we can relax a bit more; when you have young babies and toddlers, it's a bit hectic and tiring to go to a carnival. In fact, our oldest is what we call a pre-teen, so he is very much into the scary rides, the fastest, scariest ones that would probably make me throw up. "Are you sure you want to go on that, Hudson? It looks at bit crazy to me," I said when he asked me if he could go on the 'Hard Rocker'. Silly question, really. Obviously he was sure that he wanted to go on the ride, otherwise he wouldn't have asked me! Sure, go ahead, get locked in a metal cage that swings 360 degrees, and then the whole ride spins around fast. As long as it's you and not me. He did the scariest rides with his friends who were as braves as him. Oh, to be a teenager again. No thanks. I would rather keep my feet on the ground and just watch. We did, however, all have a great time. The kids went on several rides each, and finished off with cotton candy.

			<title>The best bargains at Ross.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Ross.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2 face=Helvetica><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica>
<P align=left>Do you like to shop? I actually do not like to at all. I always find that I am in a hurry, I don't enjoy looking through aisles and aisles of clothes for just one piece that I like, and I get impatient when I have to wait in line. But, one thing makes a very big difference. If I can find a good bargain, then I am a happy camper. That means that I am quite content to do the shopping 'thing', just like everybody else. There is a place just over the river from here called Ross. It is one of a chain of clothing and houseware stores that sells new items for incredible bargains. But, how is that possible? As far as I know, the store buys out of season clothes and surplus items from big department stores. Now, I have a hobby of second-hand store shopping; getting ridiculously cheap items from stores that sell second-hand items. That is different all together. When you go into one of those places you never know what to expect. You know that you might not find anything suitable at all. You are very unlikely to lose money or feel cheated, because everything is so, so cheap. And, occasionally when you do find something worth buying, it feels like a major achievement. Ross gives a similar experience, but you also know that you are buying something that is brand new; it's never been used. It is brand spanking new. So, if you do happen to have some time to browse, it is worth making a trip to Ross. I bought a couple of bags worth of tops today, that I threw on in the changing rooms to make sure that everything fit well, and when I got to the check-out till, I had a smile on my face because I had managed to spend very little for what I had bought. "Good deal!" as they say around here.</P></FONT></FONT><B><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[
Do you like to shop? I actually do not like to at all. I always find that I am in a hurry, I don't enjoy looking through aisles and aisles of clothes for just one piece that I like, and I get impatient when I have to wait in line. But, one thing makes a very big difference. If I can find a good bargain, then I am a happy camper. That means that I am quite content to do the shopping 'thing', just like everybody else. There is a place just over the river from here called Ross. It is one of a chain of clothing and houseware stores that sells new items for incredible bargains. But, how is that possible? As far as I know, the store buys out of season clothes and surplus items from big department stores. Now, I have a hobby of second-hand store shopping; getting ridiculously cheap items from stores that sell second-hand items. That is different all together. When you go into one of those places you never know what to expect. You know that you might not find anything suitable at all. You are very unlikely to lose money or feel cheated, because everything is so, so cheap. And, occasionally when you do find something worth buying, it feels like a major achievement. Ross gives a similar experience, but you also know that you are buying something that is brand new; it's never been used. It is brand spanking new. So, if you do happen to have some time to browse, it is worth making a trip to Ross. I bought a couple of bags worth of tops today, that I threw on in the changing rooms to make sure that everything fit well, and when I got to the check-out till, I had a smile on my face because I had managed to spend very little for what I had bought. "Good deal!" as they say around here.

<P align=left>Fire up the barby! The good weather is here, minced meat is on sale in the supermarket, and the nights are longer. It's time to clean the outside furniture, put a tablecloth on the table, buy propane for the barbecue, and decide what's for dinner. Our barbecue has spent the winter under a heavy duty, plastic cover. Now we can get it out, clean it up, put in a new tank of fuel, and get out the recipe book. The longer days are so much more cheery than the short ones of winter. Eating outside, 'al fresco', is a real pleasure, and always makes the food taste better. This weekend is a special spring celebration in Wenatchee; it's Apple Blossom weekend. There will be a parade through the center of town, a food fair in one of the parks, and a carnival in another. It is the perfect time to invite friends and family over, after the day's events, and have one of the favorites: hamburgers, hotdogs, marinated chicken, thinly sliced beef, vegetables on a scewer, or a vegetarian kebab. Yummy! A potluck is also a good choice. That's when each couple or family that comes over brings a dish of some sort. One person brings a salad, another brings a dessert, perhaps drinks can be brought, and then the host family supplies the main dish. You can eat and chat away until the sun goes down and the stars come out. I look forward to the days when it stays warm until nine or ten o'clock at night, so we can all stay out until we all get sleepy. A friend of mine barbecues all year long. She has a covered deck or patio, so even when there is snow outside in the middle of winter, she can barbecue whatever she wants. So, this weekend, tell your friends, bring some beer and some punch, and come and join us.</P></FONT></FONT><B><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold>

<P align=left>Grab your baseball hat or something else that will keep the sun out of your eyes, your sunglasses, a blanket, and a chair that isn't too hard. It's time to be a spectator. It's the season. You'll see these people, parking in the parking lot of a baseball or soccer field, opening up the back of their cars, and getting all kinds of equipment, blankets, coolers full of food and drinks, hats, gloves, newspapers. They've thought of everything. Spectating is a serious business. When a family member is involved in the sport that you watch, you don't want anything to distract you; you want to keep your eyes on the game, keep score, and not miss a thing. I made the mistake of taking my laptop to my son's game the other day; I had to do my podcast, and, I thought, while he was in the dugout (or not playing) that I could get some work done. Big mistake! I had all kinds of dirty looks coming in my direction. It is not the done thing, not kosher; it's breaking an unwritten rule. So, I won't do that again. It's interesting, you know, watching all the other spectators. Most of them sit quietly and occasionally cheer someone on, but some of them really stand out. You have the ones who are particularly loud, and yell instructions at the players, even though the coach is quite capable of doing that. You have the ones who have practically set up camp, who pass out food, chat through the whole game, and spend a lot of time setting up and packing up. And then there is always a scattering of people who have just got off work in time to see a son or daughter play; they rush to the field, coffee in hand, baseball cap firmly on their heads, nodding and saying "hi" to people here and there. It's generally a positive place, and friendly too. Everyone is enjoying themselves, even when their team is losing. I suppose it is a shared experience: the sport, the parenting; we are all in the same boat. How could I possibly think that a laptop would fit in here? I've had some good conversations with people at the ball park, and a good laugh too. It's one place in the U.S. where people can leave the rush of work, and sit and enjoy a sense of community.</P></FONT></FONT><B><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold>

<P align=left>Helen the hippo is my friend at the moment. My little girl is learning how to read, and Helen is the type of character that is helping her to do so. It has been wonderful and fascinating to see the transition from knowing the alphabet to putting words together. Today, in the car, while we were waiting outside of the music school for my oldest son, Domini picked up some books that we keep in the back. To my amazement she slowly started to spell out the words, reading slowly. Every now and then, she would get a word wrong or guess it, but I noticed that she would recognize the first two letters in each word, and often the last one or two. In English, you have to use tricks like that because we have so many odd spellings: the silent e's, the silent gh's, the ph's, and the wh's that can be anything from 'what' to 'who'. Believe me, native English speakers have a hard enough time learning how to read English, not just the non-natives. My daughter squealed with delight when I would say,"Yep, you got that right." Her sense of satisfaction is tremendous; at last she can tell her brothers, who are all readers, that she too can do what they do. Good for her! Now I can get out the series of beginners books that I have used with the boys, and they can be kept in her room. Helen the hippo comes from this series, along with Olive the octopus, and Suzy the snake. The books work their way through the alphabet, introducing what we call 'sight words', those common English words that have to be memorized because they are essential, and a lot of them are irregular. Some of these words that you will be familiar with are: there, their, who, what, one, two, eight, night, and the list goes on. I've noticed, when I volunteer in Robert's class, that children's books use a lot of patterns, rhyme, and humor or surprize to keep the children's attention, and to make the words memorable. You'll find sentences like:&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zoe the zebra likes to cook, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she gets her instructions from the book. <BR><BR>This is a good technique for those of you who are learning English.

<P align=left>"Mummy, can I pet the horses?" said my daughter as we crossed the road to the center of the town of Leavenworth. We had decided to spend a few hours in a nearby town, for a change of scenery. The horses in the road were attached to carts that were well decorated, intended for tourists. There were leather straps on the cart with bells and flowers, and the drivers were dressed in traditional German costume. "One day, darling, we'll go on one of those rides," I told my daughter as I took her by the hand and we all crossed the road. There is a restaurant on the main strip of Leavenworth called Pav's, a creperie, where I planned on taking everyone. I wasn't sure if it was open or not, with it being Sunday. Mind you, Leavenworth is a tourist town, so I had a feeling that it would be open. The children and I walked along the main road, past many shops of all kinds, and tourists who had obviously come from all over the world. I could hear people chatting to eachother in many different languages. What a refreshing change! We found Pav's, and yes, it was open. When we were seated, I told the kids that they could only have a dessert, because the dishes are huge, and there was no way that they could eat a main dish and a dessert. As the kids looked at the menu, I looked around at the decor: thick, heavy curtains in each room, dark, earthy colors on the walls, a massive mirror that takes up a whole wall, and lots of French pictures. The kitchen is in the entryway, and completely open. It is a restaurant that has a lot of atmosphere and character, which is important to me; I like to enjoy my surroundings when I eat. My husband joined us after a while; he had cycled up to Leavenworth. The food came and, oh my, what a feast! Two of my sons had ordered fresh pear crepes with vanilla icecream and whipped cream. The other two had chocolate gelato and lemon cheese cake. Hey, you have to make memories while you can. I actually only ordered a coffee, because I knew that my children would never finish their food, so, like a vulture, I would finish it off. After Pav's, we walked through the town and down to the park which has two bridges and lots of trails. We saw several deer and geese with their goslings. It was a magical day, a full Spring day with a feast for the stomach and the eyes as well.</P></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold>

When we were seated, I told the kids that they could only have a dessert, because the dishes are huge, and there was no way that they could eat a main dish and a dessert. As the kids looked at the menu, I looked around at the decor: thick, heavy curtains in each room, dark, earthy colors on the walls, a massive mirror that takes up a whole wall, and lots of French pictures. The kitchen is in the entryway, and completely open. It is a restaurant that has a lot of atmosphere and character, which is important to me; I like to enjoy my surroundings when I eat. My husband joined us after a while; he had cycled up to Leavenworth. The food came and, oh my, what a feast! Two of my sons had ordered fresh pear crepes with vanilla icecream and whipped cream. The other two had chocolate gelato and lemon cheese cake. Hey, you have to make memories while you can. I actually only ordered a coffee, because I knew that my children would never finish their food, so, like a vulture, I would finish it off. After Pav's, we walked through the town and down to the park which has two bridges and lots of trails. We saw several deer and geese with their goslings. It was a magical day, a full Spring day with a feast for the stomach and the eyes as well.

2. The caterers finished off the wedding cake while everyone was still dancing.
3. The sofa took up too much room, so we got a smaller one instead.
4. All of a sudden, he found himself in unfamiliar surroundings.]]></itunes:subtitle>

<P>I did a really unpleasant thing the day before yesterday. It was totally necessary; in fact, it was a service to my family. There is the most delicious yet simple meal that is very traditional around this area, but to make it requires getting your hands dirty. That special meal is barbecue chicken. Now, that doesn't mean that we actually put chicken on a barbecue outside. This type of barbecue chicken is cooked in the oven, the longer the better. For this dish, I use the drumsticks ( or legs). I have to, very meticulously, peel off the skin from the raw chicken legs, one at a time, before putting them into a deep oven-proof dish. I do about twenty to thirty at a time. This is the unpleasant part, partly because it isn't easy, but mainly because the skin feels slimey, and gets under your nails. But that's the sacrifice you have to make. You put the lid on the dish and into the oven it goes at about 400 degrees for at least an hour. No water, oil, or condiments are needed. You just bake the begeebees out of the drumsticks. The next step is to take the dish out of the oven, and to discard at least three quarters of the juice that has come out of the meat. Just throw it away. Then cover the legs with barbecue sauce, either one large bottle or two small ones. Honey barbecue sauce is a favorite around here, as well as smokey flavored sauce. Well, you cover the dish again and put it back in the oven, this time at 300 degrees for an hour, or even better, two hours. The meat wil be more tender the more you cook it. And that, my friends, is it. Simple, simple, simple. It goes really well with mashed potatoes, baked beans, and a crispy salad or coleslaw. The meat literally falls off the bone, and there is no fat or skin to deal with, so even children can tuck in without complaining. It is great if left overnight in the fridge, or even frozen for a while and then reheated. You can't really go wrong with it, as far as using it for left-overs. In fact, I had some for breakfast just yesterday!</P><B><U>

<P>Just opposite where we live is a cherry orchard. It must be about four or five acres. In the late winter or early spring, the trees get pruned. Excess branches are cut off in order to make the trees more productive. That system works, and is understood by everyone around here. It is part of being effective when growing fruit. The trouble is, that habit of seriously pruning fruit trees has crept into the rest of Wenatchee. Although Wenatchee is a dry valley, people over the years have made the effort to plant quite a number of trees. We also, thankfully, have quite a few very large trees that were planted by the first settlers. In a hot climate you need your shade. Most of the oldest trees have been left alone. They are splendidly huge, and spread out nicely. Of course, every now and then a limb must be cut off if it is diseased, or weak enough to blow off in a wind storm. However, if you look at the photo in the blogpage, you will get an idea of the crazy pruning that I have seen in quite a few places here in town. It alll started when I saw, in the main outside mall area, a shocking sight of big trees that have been cut in half; their top halves have been chopped off. It looks like a war zone! What were these pruners thinking? Who gave the instructions? Were these people actually licensed? Ever since then, as I drive around town, with my camera at the ready, I have noticed more and more butchered trees. Then, about two weeks ago, a tree expert wrote in to the daily newspaper to comment on how unnecessary the pruning is, how it weakens the roots of a tree, and makes it more of a hazard. Being a tree lover myself, I am very alarmed, and I will certainly send in my thoughts to the towns newspaper, along with a number of photos of the disfigured trees of Wenatchee.</P><B><U>

<P align=left>A strange type of creature has been appearing in Wenatchee recently. Apparently, it comes out when the weather gets nice. It is very tall, furry, and generally has a smile on its face. Unlike most other animals, it likes to be close to people and traffic, rather than near trees and bushes. It is also very friendly to humans, just like dogs, but instead of wagging its tail, it waves its hand. Have you guessed what these creatures are? They are the happy mascots of different businesses around town. They stand on the street corners, or just outside where they work, and they wave at the passing cars. I drove past a drive-through coffee business, and found a panda dancing around on the corner. His black and white costume caught my eye, and I suddenly heard, "Mum, please, please, can we go and hug him?" coming from the back seat. So, I pulled the car around and parked in the parking lot. We got out and hugged the silent panda, who is best at hugging, so there is no need for him to talk. My daughter was thrilled. I haven't quite figured out if she knows there is a person inside, or if she chooses to believe that this really is a special kind of creature. Then today, as I was waiting at a traffic light, I spotted another furry salesman, dancing around outside a fast food hamburger business. I don't know how much business he had encouraged, but he certainly looked happy. Cars were zooming past him, but he just kept on waving. It actually got quite hot today, and I wondered if these furry salesmen were doing okay in their very warm coats. Perhaps they had been able to have a cold diet coke or an iced latte to cool them down. I have seen mascots at ball games, and in High Schools, but it seems that more and more are getting employment in Wenatchee these days. They are obviously willing to do the work that the natives do not want to do.....</P></FONT></FONT><B><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold>

<P align=left>The financial crisis has hit Wenatchee quite hard in the past year or so. Businesses have closed, some people have lost their homes or jobs, or both. Everyone seems to be more careful about spending, and it has become normal to be frugal, or very careful or thoughtful about money. My husband and I have been trying to find ways to cut costs. One expense that was easy to lower was our television bill. The cable and satelite companies here in the U.S sell packages to their customers: a certain amount of channels for a certain amount of money. The more you pay, the larger the choice of channels. Well, I realized a while ago, that we only watch a few channels, but we pay for a lot that we don't even like. After calling the company we use and lowering our package, I was happy to find that we saved about forty dollars a month. Good savings! But, I knew that we could do even better. I signed up for an on-line, instant television and film viewing network called Netflix. It's monthly cost is less than ten dollars, you can instantly view on your computer from a list of thousands of items, or you can have them send you, at no extra cost, DVDs in the mail, one after another. Brilliant! It works, and we love it. The next step was trying to hook my PC up to the tv. "Well, that shouldn't be a problem," I said to everyone confidently. Oh my goodness. I had to make four trips to Radio Shack, where they sell all kinds of cables, plugs, and computers. Each time I went I experienced great service, but I came away with something that didn't quite work. I was so frustrated. By the forth time, I was absolutely determined to get the right stuff, even if it meant buying a thousand cables. Okay, I'm exaggerating. I bought a package of cables that is used specifically to hook up a PC to a tv. I was almost scared to open it. When I did, I was horrified to see what looked like an ocean of cables. There were so many of them! The instruction booklet was so difficult to understand that I looked everything up on Google to get my step by step instructions. Thankyou Google! After plugging everything in, putting the tv on the correct setting, and changing the display setting of my PC, suddenly what was on my PC screen, appeared on the tv. Hurray! I did it!

            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2 face=Helvetica><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica>
<P align=left>Ah, Spring is here, and we are back to the normal good weather activities. This weekend, we had a couple of the kids' friends over for a 'sleep-over'. You can probably tell by the name what a sleep-over is: the kids come and play in the evening and end up spending the night. It is the latest thing that seems to be extremely important to my children. If only one of them can have a friend over, then it's just not fair, so we have to have at least two to keep everyone happy. The next morning, all the kids were running around outside, playing 'army' and climbing trees. My husband busied himself by mowing the lawn and fixing an irrigation pipe that was broken. I noticed that he was gathering wood and dry brush from the garden, going back and forth, back and forth. What was he up to? It got to late afternoon and he was still out in the back garden. I went to check on the children who were now playing in the front garden, when Hudson suddenly yelled, "Hey look everyone, a fire!" We ran over to the fence that separates the front yard from the back yard, and, sure enough, there was a big fire in the firepit. The plan was to burn a few things in the firepit, and then, as the fire died down, we would sit around it and roast hot dogs and marshmallows. This was cause for a lot of excitement! The idea of fire and sugar always excites the kids. Okay, so,let's get organized. Get the chairs, get the food, and get the long sticks to put the hot dogs and marshmallows on. When we had everything together, we sat around and gazed at the fire, while the kids held their special treats over the flames. The trick with marshmallows is to get them nicely browned, but not burned. If one catches fire, it is done for. So, you hold the stick over the fire, and slowly turn it, to cook the food just right, keeping an eye on it, so it doesn't get overdone. The packet of marshmallows soon ran out, the fire died down, and I could hear people starting to yawn. What a perfect way to spend a Spring evening. Fire and sugar, what a combination!</P></FONT></FONT><B><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold>

Ah, Spring is here, and we are back to the normal good weather activities. This weekend, we had a couple of the kids' friends over for a 'sleep-over'. You can probably tell by the name what a sleep-over is: the kids come and play in the evening and end up spending the night. It is the latest thing that seems to be extremely important to my children. If only one of them can have a friend over, then it's just not fair, so we have to have at least two to keep everyone happy. The next morning, all the kids were running around outside, playing 'army' and climbing trees. My husband busied himself by mowing the lawn and fixing an irrigation pipe that was broken. I noticed that he was gathering wood and dry brush from the garden, going back and forth, back and forth. What was he up to? It got to late afternoon and he was still out in the back garden. I went to check on the children who were now playing in the front garden, when Hudson suddenly yelled, "Hey look everyone, a fire!" We ran over to the fence that separates the front yard from the back yard, and, sure enough, there was a big fire in the firepit. The plan was to burn a few things in the firepit, and then, as the fire died down, we would sit around it and roast hot dogs and marshmallows. This was cause for a lot of excitement! The idea of fire and sugar always excites the kids. Okay, so,let's get organized. Get the chairs, get the food, and get the long sticks to put the hot dogs and marshmallows on. When we had everything together, we sat around and gazed at the fire, while the kids held their special treats over the flames. The trick with marshmallows is to get them nicely browned, but not burned. If one catches fire, it is done for. So, you hold the stick over the fire, and slowly turn it, to cook the food just right, keeping an eye on it, so it doesn't get overdone. The packet of marshmallows soon ran out, the fire died down, and I could hear people starting to yawn. What a perfect way to spend a Spring evening. Fire and sugar, what a combination!
Grammar notes
Common phrases: to busy oneself, it's not fair, sure enough, to be up to...
1. They busied themselves by setting up camp and preparing the dinner.
2. He has a bigger slice of cake than I do; that's just not fair!
3. The lady wasn't looking where she was going, so, sure enough, she tripped and fell.
4. What are you up to kids? How come the cookie jar is empty? Have you been up to no good?]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Oil change at Oil Can Henry's.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/oil_change.pdf]]></link>

<P align=left>I got a phone call from my husband the other day, " Hey babe, can you take the car to get the oil changed please? It's overdue." As he works forty-five minutes from town, he rarely has time to run those errands back in Wenatchee, so he gets his secretary, me, to do them. No problem. As you probably know, a car's oil has to be changed regularly. How often depends on your car and your driving habits. If you drive a lot, you might have to change the oil every three months or three thousand miles. If you drive very little, it might be a couple of years before you need to have the oil changed. Why does it need to be changed anyway? Apparently, it breaks down over time and stops performing as well. It no longer works well enough at cooling the engine. So, out goes the old, and in goes the new. Oil Can Henry's is a new chain of oil changing stations in town that is making a name for itself. What you notice first of all is its appearance. The building is brightly painted in red and tan, and everything is spotless. The workers are dressed in a smart uniform which matches the building; their shirts are stripey and their hats are paperboy hats. So all together, it looks like a very clean, professional place of business. As soon as I got out of the car, one of the employees handed me a complimentary newspaper, and I headed off to the waiting room . I had only been there a few minutes, when one of the gentlemen came in and politely offered me extra service of my car for a very special deal. I actually didn't understand what he was talking about; he used details about engine oil, the air filter, number of miles, and the color of the lubricants, which all sounded like a very foreign language to me. "Shame on you Anna," I thought to myself, " you need to read up on cars and how they work. Females should be just as savvy about cars as males....." I politely told the man that I would just have a regular oil change, nothing fancy or expensive. Before they finished the service, I walked out to where they were working on my car to take some photos for the podcast. There was a large room right underneath the car where the man was changing the oil. He was talking back and forth to another man who was looking at the engine from the top, under the hood. They were exchanging details in a way that reminded me of surgeons talking to eachother during an operation. Car maintenance certainly is a science, and one that I should get to know.</P>

            <description><![CDATA[<FONT size=2 face=Helvetica><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica>
<P align=left>I was just listening to a Swiss podcast about health. The presenters were talking about free radicals and how to fight them. They first of all listed all the situations in life that cause free radicals to be produced in our bodies: emotional and physical stress, pollution, medicines, a poor diet, alcohol, smoking and more. Jokingly, one of the presenters asked, "What doesn't produce free radicals?" because it seems that everything does. A discussion developed about a healthy life style, the importance of eating right, and how physical activity is crucial to general good health. So, what are good forms of exercise? Walking and swimming are probably the two best; you get the most movement with the least strain. Then there is cycling, running, weight training, ball sports, types of skiing, and yoga. Really, anything that moves your body, uses your muscles, and increases your heart rate is good. There are different benefits to different types of exercise. Some will build muscle, while others will make you flexible. When I was young, the idea of being strong was based on muscle that can lift a lot of weight. Thankfully, now the definition of strength is broader. Weight lifting strength is just one kind, then there is endurance (which is how long you can keep doing something), and flexibility. There are other kinds, as well, but in this podcast, I'm focusing on these three. It's not difficult to keep kids active. I find that my children just need to be given an opportunity to do something physical, and they will take it. While my sons play ball sports, my daughter does gymnastics. Watching her and other older children do gymnastics certainly makes me think of strength. They stretch, they bend, they hang from bars and swing. You can see that they use all of their muscles without even realizing (realising). There are posters in the waiting area that show how, with the right training, a body can become both flexible and strong, where the muscles are useful and quick, not just big and bulky. Gymnastics reminds me of martial arts: both require speed, accuracy, strength, and flexibility. I hope to introduce my daughter to martial arts at some stage. The physical discipline is admirable, and self defense is very useful. Maybe we could do it together. As she grows up, she needs to develop physical confidence, and as I get older, I need to maintain my flexibility.</P></FONT></FONT><B><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold>

<P align=left>Do you have photos around your house? Perhaps photos of family and friends? I have been in some people's houses where there are photos in every room. The fridge, in the kitchen, is a place where a lot of people place photos of loved ones or fond memories. I have had our family photos in a huge box for quite a few years. The project of sorting through them, putting some in chronological albums, and others in frames, has been a project that I have avoided for all this time. Am I lazy? I don't think so. It's just a really big job that requires a lot of time and concentration. I want to do the job right, after all. So, the other day, after buying some frames that were on sale, I decided to at least start the project. The photos I selected to put in the frames are our most recent family and individual photos. We had a professional photographer come to our house in the Autumn (Fall). It was the first time that we had hired anyone to take semi-formal pictures of us. It happened to be the perfect time of year, because the light in the Autumn really adds color and depth to a picture, plus the leaves had changed color and fallen on the ground, creating a pretty background. I love how these photos turned out. They are casual, and show each person's character. She did such a good job. A few days ago, I cleaned up the frames, and divided up the pictures. There were twelve photos and three frames, each with four holes. A perfect match! Every frame would have one of each of the children. I placed the photos carefully in each frame, put sticky tape on the back to secure them, closed up the back of the frames, and then decided where to hang them. Should I put them in the entryway next to the mirror, or on the stair wall? Should I put them all together, or separate them? Decisions, decisions. I ended up putting two on one wall, and one a little further up the stair case. I've had positive comments about them already, and I am quite satisfied with what I have done.</P></FONT></FONT><B><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold><FONT size=2 face=Helvetica-Bold>

<P>I have been making excuses recently, to avoid doing some gardening. I have had pots of plants ready to plant for at least a week. I even put them right on the spots where I intended to plant them, but they sat there for a long time. Every time I happened to go outside, for whatever reason, I would catch a glimpse of them and feel guilty. I made sure that I kept them watered, because I would have felt terrible if they had died in their pots, waiting for me to plant them. Anyway, today, Sunday, happened to be a perfect day: sunny, warm, and still. My husband inspired me to go out at first to help with the blackberry bushes. He had built some sturdy poles, and put wire horizontally to create a support for them to grow up. I helped him with that, and then got on with my project. The entryway to our house, as you might remember, had had five huge bushes that my husband had transplanted. There was nothing left in their place. I had put a few bags of manure and peat moss on the area, but had not mixed them or dug them in. So, that was my first job. Now, I don't know why, but I love to dig. I always have done. So this job, though it was hard, suited me. I dug the spade (shovel) deep into the earth, and then lifted and turned it to mix it in well. As I did this, a lot of roots came to the surface that had belonged to the bushes. I had to pick those out before planting the new beauties. Finally, I got to the fun part. I dug holes for each of the potted plants, turned them upside down, popped them out of the plastic pots, and put them in their holes. I filled in the remainder of the holes with soil, and continued until they were all done. My next job was to transplant the Bleeding Hearts, which are stunning this time of year. You have to be careful with them because they are delicate. So, I dug a large root ball for each one. That means the round collection of roots and earth that the plant is using. The bigger the root ball, the more successful the transplant. And yes, they filled in the corner where I put them beautifully. Finally, mission accomplished. I gave them a long water and then stood back and admired my work.</P><B><U>

Everyone who has a child involved in the sport knows that this time of year is very changeable when it comes to the weather. You have to be prepared for all sorts of weather: cold,&nbsp;icy wind, rain, hot sun, or perhaps even hail. Today was no exception. Unusually for Wenatchee,&nbsp;we had rain during the first game of the season. Mind you, it wasn't torrential at all; I didn't even&nbsp;take an umbrella. It was more like a 'chiri miri' which is what we say in Spain for a very light, misty&nbsp;rain. There are some comforts at the ball park, however. One of the traditional ones that springs&nbsp;to mind is the hot dog. It is an 'all american' thing to eat, even though it's origins probably lie in one&nbsp;of the germanic countries of Europe. There is just something about the smell of the warm hot&nbsp;dogs wafting through the air, mixing with the fresh smell of grass. When you've been sitting on a&nbsp;bleacher (which is the american term for the set of benches), and you start to get a little chilly, the&nbsp;smell of hot dogs is enough to prompt a little trip to the concession stand. I volunteer occasionally&nbsp;to help at the concession stand. It is definitely part of the American culture. The hot dogs are&nbsp;turning on a mechanical warmer, there is popcorn popping away in the popcorn maker. There are&nbsp;slurpies of different flavors to drink, and candies to buy. The last time I helped out, I had a smile&nbsp;on my face because it reminded me of some of the typical American films that I had seen when I&nbsp;was young. Boys would come up to me with baseball caps on and dirty knees from having played;&nbsp;they would usually ask for candies or a slurpy. Then the parents would come, asking for popcorn,&nbsp;coffee to warm up, and of course hot dogs. Plain, with relish, or just with ketchup, they would sell&nbsp;out so quickly that we would have to turn people away with a , "Sorry, we'll have to get some more&nbsp;tomorrow." It's all part of the experience of being involved in baseball, and, thinking about it, we&nbsp;probably have only another ten years of it left, because our youngest son is seven. There is a lot&nbsp;to observe at a baseball game, especially if you are a foreigner. I'm sure I will be telling you of&nbsp;other things I notice in the ball park in the future.</span></font><span style="font: 12.0px Helvetica"><font face="tahoma"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></font></span></p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Helvetica"><font><font face="tahoma"><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></font></font></p>

<P>The Wenatchee golf club is a place that was introduced to me by my in-laws. For quite a few years now, they have played golf several times a week, and also enjoyed the club's other facilities. I don't golf, or at least not yet, but I have become familiar with the goings on there. It was established in 1923 in East Wenatchee. To get there from here, you have to cross over the Columbia river and head up to near the top of the valley. There are spectacular views from the club, which I have heard is a feature of many good golf courses. There is also an outdoor swimming pool which is a wonderful treat for family and friends of those who are members. In the summer heat, when golfers who have been brave enough to play in the sun have finally had enough, they can cool off in the pool. My family and I only go there occasionally to eat. The kids always get very excited about the food; the desserts especially are very memorable, like the devil's chocolate pie. So, who are the golfers of the club? They are mostly retired people or business men and women. Some business owners will bring their clients to the golf course for a game and lunch, a clever way to make business more pleasant than usual. There is a busy calendar of events, as well. Tournaments of all kinds take place for different age groups. There are lessons with the expert golf instructors, and there are even all female or all male days, when the opposite sex is not allowed. Prizes of money or trophies are awarded at the end of each tournament, and each year, more and more high school students are signing up for lessons and tournaments. The balance of generations in the club is changing, as golf becomes more 'in' with youth, and also more in the media. One of my nephews golfs at the club regularly with friends, and in the local high schools, golf is now offered as an alternative sport to the traditional ones. I have often heard about my in-laws winning tournaments and prizes, but now some of the younger people are walking away with first place.</P><B><U>

            <description><![CDATA[Before I start this podcast, I'd like to let you know that I have corrected a mistake I made on yesterday's podcast about cherry blossoms in Japan. The photo I included was actually of dog wood blossoms. I didn't realise at the time,&nbsp;but I have corrected the photo and uploaded one of cherry blossoms. <BR><BR>Today's podcast is about a very special bird house that was presented to me the other day by my husband and son. The day that we came back from our recent trip to Seattle, I was busy unpacking and puttiing things away. The kids went off to their various bedrooms and started playing, and my husband disappeared for a while. I assumed that he was in the garage, tinkering with his bicycle. It's his hobby afterall, and he enjoys cleaning and preparing his bike for the next big ride. Some time had gone by when I realised (realized) that I hadn't seen my youngest son around the house. He is usually the loudest and busiest, so normally, I can tell exactly where he is. Suddenly, I hear him stomping through the garage with his cowboy boots on, running upstairs, rummaging noisily around in his room, and running back downstairs. I met him as he was zooming around the corner to head outside again, "What are you up to, monkey?" I asked. "I'm building a birds house with dad," he replied, showing me his armful of kids tools that he had gathered from his room. I only had time to say, "Oh," and he had already disappeared. About half an hour later, my husband walks in carrying a bird house made of thin branches. It was very well made. Most of the branches had been cut to the same size, so it looked very even and balanced. There was a little, square hole in the middle of the front, the entryway, and a perch just above it. "I can't believe you just whipped this thing up!" I said in amazement. "It's lovely!" "Robert made most of it," said my husband. Robert gave me a big smile; he was very proud of himself. "So, where shall we put it?" asked my husband. "In the front yard," I replied, "far away from the house; the birds are already very noisy early in the morning." For now, the house is still in the kitchen. I'm not in a hurry to have birds move into it.

			<title>The blossom season.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/blossoms.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This podcast was inspired by Kimiyo from Japan who recently E-mailed me a photograph of the cherry blossoms on the street where she lives. She told me that, at the moment, the wave of blossoms is moving through Japan, and so she decided to capture it on film and send it to me. Thanks Kimiyo! Blossoms are dear to my heart because they are a central subject of the area where I live. Without blossoms orchards cannot produce fruit, of course. I decided to investigate blossoms in Japan, and I ended up learning a lot. The word for cherry blossom is 'sakura'. It is such an anticipated event in Japan that the national weather bureau makes a forecast, and charts the progress of the blossoming, as it moves from the south to the north. The first cherry blossoms in Japan start in January, in Okinawa. As the season continues, the wave of blossoms&nbsp;moves slowly up the country, reaching the capital, Tokyo, in about the beginning of April. It finishes in Hokkaido a few weeks later. There are flower viewing parties, where people will eat under a blossoming cherry tree, and also tea drinking rituals, and artistic events. In most places, the trees are also lit up at night. Because so many hundreds of thousands of these trees were planted in Japan, the season is one of extreme beauty. For the Japanese, cherry blossoms represent love, affection, and good fortune, as well as mortality. Cherry trees are native to Japan, Korea, and China, Japan having about 200 different kinds. The mass planting of these trees started in the eighth century, and the tradition of blossom viewing, practiced in China, became part of life in Japan. Admiration of these beautiful trees is international, of course, with countries all over the world celebrating and enjoying this flowery display. The Japanese government has made a gift of flowering cherry trees to the U.S. on several occasions, and so now, they are enjoyed here also. One of the biggest collections is found in Macon, Georgia where there are over 300,000 trees.

            <description><![CDATA[Easter Sunday, a day of family, celebration, and fun. Today, after church, my family and I got together with my in-laws in the East Wenatchee Country Club for lunch. The club is actually for golf, but even if you don't golf, you can go to the restaurant which is really very good. For special occasions, their kitchen puts on quite a spread.

And for those of you who are vegetarians, they also have a variety of egg and bean dishes with lots of fruits and vegetables.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Easter Sunday, a day of family, celebration, and fun. Today, after church, my family and I got together with my in-laws in the East Wenatchee Country Club for lunch. The club is actually for golf, but even if you don't golf, you can go to the restaurant which is really very good. For special occasions, their kitchen puts on quite a spread. Today they had lamb, ham, and chicken with mushrooms. Often they will serve prime rib beef which just melts in your mouth. And for those of you who are vegetarians, they also have a variety of egg and bean dishes with lots of fruits and vegetables.

            <description><![CDATA[Because it is Spring break, we have arranged a quick get-a-way to Seattle for a couple of days. My husband has been extremely busy at work, and hasn't even had a weekend break for a while, so I decided that it is time for us to 'get out of dodge'. He has taken this Friday off, and we are heading West. I got online yesterday and booked the hotel. What do you look for in a hotel? Location? A good rating? An available restaurant or swimming pool? These are all things to take into consideration. Because all of us are going, the location was most important to me; we don't often go to Seattle, so we should be close to downtown. The web page for this particular chain of hotels offered locations all over the city, at varying rates per night. The cheapest was in an area close to where my sister-in-law lives. Mmmm, that would be good, because we want to visit her anyway. But there wasn't a swimming pool available, and that is a priority for the kids. We could always travel a little from a different hotel to visit family. How about a decent breakfast? I have had experiences of staying in hotels that claim to serve a 'continental breakfast' which ends up being a dry pastry and a cup of coffee. If a breakfast is included, it should be substantial. Those two prerequisites limited our choice to about three out of the original list. So, I thought, what else would make our stay comfortable and pleasant? A free shuttle service to different parts of downtown. You know what it's like to drive in a big city when you don't know the streets; it can be a nightmare. A free shuttle would be soooo helpful! How about internet access. It seems to be a constant need in our lives, and so useful in so many ways. After considering this, I crossed off the least appealing hotels from the list, and ended up with, believe it or not, the same hotel we stayed in the last time we went. It has the amenities that we were after, all of them: location, a huge breakfast, a free shuttle, and internet service. I was even able to order a roll away bed, and extra towels. How convenient.

			<title>Passport application.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/passport.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[I've been getting some things ready for our Summer vacation. The most important thing, for now,&nbsp;is the passports of my two youngest children. My daughter has never had one, but my son has an old one that has already expired. I want to make sure that these important documents are up to date, or, as we say, valid. I popped into the court house to get the passport application forms, and then I read through the instructions. When I send in the forms, I need to also send in a fee and a birth certificate. No problem, I thought. I can just send in Robert's expired passport, and I will find Domini's birth certificate and send it in. Well, for the life of me, I couldn't find it. I looked in all of our files. I checked drawers where we keep important papers. And then I double checked. It was nowhere to be found. Okay, what do I do now? Nowadays, if I have a question, I immediately reach for my laptop. I googled where to get a copy of a birth certificate, and I was given the phone number of the Health Department. Great! After speaking with a lady on the phone, the birth certificate was ordered, payed for, and due to be mailed to my home in two days. Well, that was easy! So now it was a question of just filling in all the info. correctly, and double checking that. The form asked for the usual information: gender, last, first, and middle names, address, date of birth, parents, social security number, height, weight, and eye and hair color. Finally, I took my two little ones to Walmart to get their photos taken. They were excited about this quick, simple trip; I think they imagined it to be something very, very important. They stood infront of a white screen and waited for the photographer to take the photos. They looked a bit scruffy, and had big, cheesy grins on their faces. He told them not to smile, so they put on very serious faces, which made them feel like the whole experience was even more important. Well, we got home in one piece, and I finished the paperwork.

			<title>A Tour of Homes, The Dining Room.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/dining_room.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[It has been some time since we had an episode of The Tour Of Homes, so today we will take a close look at the dining room. It, like the kitchen and lounge, is a focal point of family life. A lot of good things happen here, and it is a place where we celebrate special occasions. This room centers around a table and chairs. Here in Western society, there are often more than four chairs around a table. When there is a special occasion, often friends and family come to celebrate, so more chairs are needed. The table is 'laid' (what we say in England), or 'set' (which is what we say in the U.S.) To do this, we need cutlery, crockery, glasses, sometimes a table cloth or a 'runner' which is a much skinnier version of a table cloth, and a salt and pepper shaker, and perhaps some candles. Don't forget serviettes, or napkins as they call them here in the U.S. For special times, the table can be decorated with candles, flowers, or some craft type arrangement. Here in the North West, it is very popular to mix candles in some pretty arrangement for the table, especially during the Winter. I have seen some center pieces that are a mix of flowers, pebbles, plastic fruit, and candles. But it's up to the imagination of the owner. Anything goes. Other furniture in the room includes dressers to store crockery and cutlery, wine glasses, and wine bottles. Often a dining room is decorated with art work of different forms, pretty curtains, perhaps a rug, and often a chandelier or other light fixture that has more than the average amount of detail. We use our dining room for family meals often during the week, even though sometimes we will eat at different times depending on our schedules. The special occasions are: Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Birthdays. These are the times that I really dress the place up, get out the nice plates and glasses, and make the effort of ironing a table cloth.

            <description><![CDATA[Did you witness any of the events of Earth Hour this year? There was a lot more participation this year from around the globe, than last year. 125 countries signed up to turn out some major (majour) lights, and out of those countries, 56 national capitals were to turn off lights on buildings that have great significance. I saw some of the 'turning off' on my laptop the next day, and I was impressed at the scale of this organized event. It is a statement that people want action, and that we can become an organized group and do something good for the planet. Last year in December, there was a meeting in Copenhagen about climate change. Politicians joined in discussions, trying to agree about what can be done to reduce global warming&nbsp;and its effects. There were a lot of hopes that strong action could be taken in every country to reduce CO2 emissions, and to develop clean sources of energy. It's never that easy though, is it. The U.S. and Europe have been the biggest polluters, and now China has caught up, and other developing nations like India. Development has to happen. Economies have to grow, and people's standards of living have to go up. It is only fair. The trick would be finding a cleaner way to do it all. So far, the political meetings, like the ones in Copenhagen and Kyoto, have been the first steps. But actions like Earth Hour show a public awareness, and a hope that we can all learn about what we can do as individuals.

			<title>Allergy Season.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/allergy.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<P>About two weeks ago, I found that my eyes were feeling quite itchy. The feeling lasted all day, and has continued ever since. About one week ago, my nose started running, as if a little water tap had been turned on all of a sudden. No, I'm not sick. It's just allergy season. Most people I know suffer from some allergy or other. I'm not sure exactly what I am allergic to, but I can guess that it is something to do with plants. It is Spring, the weather is warming up, plants and trees are budding, so I assume that there is something in the air that is seasonal that causes me to have an allergic reaction. The trouble with seasonal allergies is that, when you have them, you look like you are sick. Red eyes, a runny nose, general discomfort or annoyance because of the symptoms, all add up to a look of being ill. I'm not very good at taking medicine either. I choose not to, unless I'm feeling really bad. Mind you, the allergy medicine in the cupboard has been looking very attractive recently.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[About two weeks ago, I found that my eyes were feeling quite itchy. The feeling lasted all day, and has continued ever since. About one week ago, my nose started running, as if a little water tap had been turned on all of a sudden. No, I'm not sick. It's just allergy season. Most people I know suffer from some allergy or other. I'm not sure exactly what I am allergic to, but I can guess that it is something to do with plants. It is Spring, the weather is warming up, plants and trees are budding, so I assume that there is something in the air that is seasonal that causes me to have an allergic reaction. The trouble with seasonal allergies is that, when you have them, you look like you are sick. Red eyes, a runny nose, general discomfort or annoyance because of the symptoms, all add up to a look of being ill. I'm not very good at taking medicine either. I choose not to, unless I'm feeling really bad. Mind you, the allergy medicine in the cupboard has been looking very attractive recently. My husband also has allergies, but he doesn't mess around and waste time. He goes straight for the solution, takes the pill or the liquid, and gets on with life. Deep down I don't want to believe that I have allergies. I would prefer it if my symptoms came from a cold.

			<title>The U.S. Census.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/census.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA["We can't move forward until you mail it back" is the saying on the recent campaign to get everyone to fill in their census form. As required by the constitution, a census has to be conducted every ten years. We have all received the forms in the mail, and now it is up to us to fill them in and send them back. The data collected by the census will help determine which towns need roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. Schools, hospitals and senior citizens' homes will also be funded as part of the 400 billion dollars of federal money given for the needs of the country. It's tax money, of course, so it makes sense that we fill in the forms and get our communities what we need. If people fail to mail the census form back, a census taker will actually come to that house up to three times to get the paper work filled out. It is that important. Another thing that is important about the census is that it will determine how many seats our state will have in the House of Representatives. The way that works is as follows: each state has at least one representative in the House of Representatives, or 'the house' as it is commonly known. The more populated the state, the more representatives it can have. The number of representatives allowed is fixed by law at 435, the highest number coming from California. All of these members can vote on issues like revenue bills, or to impeach an official. You might already know that the house is part of Congress, it's position being under the Senate. So, I will fill in my census form, to let the government know that I am here, where I am from, what I do, and about my family. I certainly want us to have proper representation in the house, so the basic needs of our community can be met. Just think, the oldest recorded census was taken over 4000 years ago in China, during the Xia Dynasty. It has been a practical tool for governments ever since.<BR><BR><STRONG><U>Grammar notes.<BR></U></STRONG><BR>Related vocabulary: representative, state, member, to vote.<BR><BR>1.

			<title>Health Care in the USA.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/health.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Today, President Barack Obama signed into law his medical reform bill. Some people are very excited about this new development, and other people are not. The question of whether the U.S. needs universal health care has been debated for months. The government has been split about the idea. Democrats, in general, are in favor of it, but Republicans have not wanted it. The main problem is cost. The U.S. spends more on health care than any other country. There are lots of federal programs that help people receive health care. The two biggest ones are Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare supplies low-cost health&nbsp;insurance to the elderly and disabled, while Medicaid is for the poor. All of these programs are very expensive to run, and yet not everybody is covered. There are millions who have no health care coverage.&nbsp;Even those who can afford health insurance are not guaranteed help for all of their needs; some who have a pre-existing condition are refused help for that illness. Another problem has been the huge expense of medicine in this country. Lots of people actually go to Canada to buy cheaper medicine. Regulations need to be made on how much pharmaceutical companies can charge for their products. Historically, costs have also risen because of the many malpractice lawsuits, and the legal system allows huge sums of money to be paid in compensation. This has driven up costs in general. There is a lot of work to be done in the government to make the system fair. I suppose health care systems always need to be&nbsp;monitored and improved. Personally, I agree with universal health care coverage. It must be absolutely dreadful to be in a position where you cannot get medical care for your own children or other loved ones. Plus, a healthy nation is a productive one. Mind you, I can also see the Republican's concerns about 'big government' and too much taxing of citizens. The central question is, as far as I can see, a person's right to have health care. It's a moral question, not just a financial one. So it becomes a little more complicated.

			<title>Designing a special photo for the app.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/photo.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[I love to use my laptop, to play around with different programs, to surf the web, and to edit photos. Today I have been doing that for hours. Now that my app has come out in iTunes, I have been trying to design a really good photo for it. The existing photo of a red cup with flags on it is fine, but I wanted something a little more elegant. So, I have been playing around with a little tea set that I inherited from my grandmother on my father's side. It is a 'tea for two' set which is extra small. It is what we call 'fine bone china', and hand painted. It has a lot of sentimental value for me, as it is my only connection to a grandmother who died when I was just a baby. The idea of a cup of tea is a theme for my work for several reasons. First, I come from a tea drinking nation, England. Secondly, I love the stuff, and even though I try to avoid the stereotype of drinking tea in the afternoon, it is exactly what I do! Thirdly, I love the idea of filling up a cup with knowledge until it overflows. So, the tea cup image will always be in my work. To make just the right photo, I bought a large sheet of red paper, placed the cup and saucer on it, arranged some extra lighting, and held the tea pot over the cup. It would have been perfect if I had had an extra hand, but I just about managed with two. After taking the photo, I then had to edit it. I started by sharpening the picture. That means that I selected a button which adds strength to the edges in a picture. There is a feature in the program that I use which allows you to add text (or writing). What I hadn't realised before is that after writing the words, you can turn them to point in different directions. Perfect! I wrote and arranged lots of words on the photo. The 'look' that I was after was that of English pouring out of the tea pot into the cup. It took me ages to finish. I couldn't bend the words, so I had to reposition the words part by part. When I finished, I was relieved. It had taken a long time. You must check out the new photo and tell me what you think. It should replace the old one on the app in a couple of weeks. <BR><BR><STRONG><U>Grammar notes.<BR></U></STRONG><BR>Practicing the past participle with related verbs: to edit, to design, to arrange, to select.<BR><BR>1.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/venom.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Something very exciting has happened in Wenatchee. A professional american football team has been developed which is called The Wenatchee Venom. The team has a mixture of men from all over the country, and has just had its first game. I was lucky enough to go to this big event on Saturday night. It was held at the new stadium in town. We got there about half an hour before the game started, but still, the parking lot was full, and there was a long line of people waiting to get into the building. We were fortunate enough to have box seats for the night, so basically we had a private room with meals and drinks, and a great view of the field. Because this is an indoor stadium that is used for many different events, the field is not as big as an american football field usually is. In true U.S. style, the evening was not just about the game. It was a show from start to finish. There were performances by cheerleaders, three mascots dancing, a pretend sumo wrestler running competition, and loud modern music throughout. It is big business really. Advertisements for local companies and sponsors were announced all the way through the evening, and even in one of the end zones, a sponsor's name was written right on the field. It was interesting to observe all the elements of this sporting event. The game itself was great fun. Wenatchee won, and the players were real showmen. They danced and encouraged the crowd to cheer and clap. I was yelling, applauding, and making all kinds of noises, which suprised the people I was with. I couldn't help it, the Wenatchee Venom made some very good touch-downs. I hope I can go and see Venom again, because they are a team that plays with heart, as they say here. I think that means that they give it their all, they hold nothing back. A few of them were injured during the game and had to leave. It's not surprising considering how they would throw themselves head first at their opponents to block them. It must be like getting into a car crash when they collide!

			<title>An app for A Cup of English.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/app_for_acup.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Today, I have an announcement to make. I am very excited to tell all of you that A Cup Of English is available in app (or application)&nbsp; for the iPhone, the iPod touch, the iPad or similar devices. It is already available in iTunes. For those of you who <EM>have</EM> such a device, you can have instant access to all of my podcasts with the text, grammar notes, and photos that automatically come with the blog. Pretty cool, isn't it? No more need to turn on a computer and download; it's all there at the push of a button. I had no idea that I would get an app. until I was contacted by the company that hosts my podcast, Libsyn. They told me that there was a time-limited offer for producers of podcasts. There were a few forms to fill in and sign, and details to work out, but the whole process went quite smoothly. Have you ever looked at some of the apps that are now available? There are so many of them! My husband has a Droid which also uses apps. He has one that gives step by step directions to anywhere you want to go. Another lists restaurants, their times of operation,&nbsp;comments on the food, and makes recommendations. And the list goes on. Apple&nbsp;first opened its app store in iTunes in July, 2008.&nbsp;As of 15th of January, there&nbsp;were one hundred and thirty three thousand nine hundred and seventy nine applications made by different producers.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Today, I have an announcement to make. I am very excited to tell all of you that A Cup Of English is available in app (or application)&nbsp; for the iPhone, the iPod touch, the iPad or similar devices. It is already available in iTunes. For those of you who have such a device, you can have instant access to all of my podcasts with the text, grammar notes, and photos that automatically come with the blog. Pretty cool, isn't it? No more need to turn on a computer and download; it's all there at the push of a button. I had no idea that I would get an app. until I was contacted by the company that hosts my podcast, Libsyn. They told me that there was a time-limited offer for producers of podcasts. There were a few forms to fill in and sign, and details to work out, but the whole process went quite smoothly. Have you ever looked at some of the apps that are now available? There are so many of them! My husband has a Droid which also uses apps. He has one that gives step by step directions to anywhere you want to go. Another lists restaurants, their times of operation,&nbsp;comments on the food, and makes recommendations. And the list goes on. Apple&nbsp;first opened its app store in iTunes in July, 2008.&nbsp;As of 15th of January, there&nbsp;were one hundred and thirty three thousand nine hundred and seventy nine applications made by different producers. And guess how many downloads?&nbsp;About three billion. I love those big numbers! I suppose apps are supposed to make your life easier by giving you quick access to needed or wanted information. What a great invention. Technology is changing and getting updated so quickly that I feel I need to keep up with the changes. When I think back to the first computer games we had, Pac Man and Pong, I am amazed at the progress that has been made. In this area, I certainly don't want to be left behind.Grammar notes.Using the past participle of a verb as an adjective: watched, needed, signed, recommended, left.1.

			<title>Road works.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/geolo.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This Spring, we have experienced an unusual amount of rain, so much so that it has caused problems in many areas. I was driving to a local bakery the other day, when I came to some road works. I had to stop my car and wait for the heavy machinery to get out of the way, so I took a few minutes to look around at what had happened. The road followed a hillside that was cut away to look a bit like a cliff, but the mixture of rock and soil looked crumbly. The consistent rain over the course of a week had loosened the rock from the soil and brought some boulders down onto the road. A very dangerous situation! Watch out drivers! The heavy machinery was clearing the road so the traffic could continue. When I got home, I looked up the geology of this area on the internet. It turns out there are two trails that a person can drive along to view an enormous variety&nbsp;of geological activity. Apparently, about 17,000 years ago there were enormous glaciers covering a lot of North America. It just so happens that there was a blockage of ice that stopped a huge lake of melted water from flowing south. When the ice block finally gave way, the gigantic flood affected this area by depositing massive 200 ton&nbsp;boulders in strange places,&nbsp;and tons&nbsp;of gravel in other places. Scientists say that there is evidence of 50 cubic miles of earth and rock being displaced up to a hundred times, and contributing to what is now this area. It's funny what you learn by looking something up on the internet, isn't it? A man who has written a book about the geology of this area, Mr. Charles L. Mason, writes that there has been "a buffet of geological events....that are unparalleled nearly anywhere else on earth." Gosh, and I learned all of that because I had to wait for some road works.

            <description><![CDATA[Well, podlisteners, I thought that it was about time that you saw my husband and I, so check out the photo on the blog page......Okay, I'm only kidding. We look nothing like the two people in the photo. They are fitness trainers from the P90X program that my husband and I have just started to use. We saw an advertisement a few weeks ago on the television, you know the kind: it shows what people used to look like when they were overweight and soft, and then, it shows them after using the P90X, and they have been transformed into Greek gods. The system is based on, what they call, 'muscle confusion', never letting your muscles get too used to an exercise. It involves a lot of variety. I understand that advertising is a lot of exaggeration, but we decided that even if there was a moderate improvement in our strength and flexibility, that it would be worth it. So, my husband paid with his credit card over the phone, and a few days later we received the package in the mail. Now, you are supposed to exercise six times a week for about an hour, for ninety days, to see optimal results. Then you can reduce the exercise to two or three times a week. So, that is the plan. And, you know, so far we have stuck to it. Even our kids have joined us, in their own way, in the push ups and sit ups. In typical kid fashion, they get bored after about fifteen minutes, and start goofing around. But it's all great fun at the moment. Tom, my husband, and I are definitely transforming into something....I'm not sure exactly what. The other day, we did yoga, and it was tough. I have never had such a good workout for my abdominal muscles, and do you know why? It's because I was laughing the whole time at my husband. He looked like an arthritic pelican, with long limbs in odd places, flapping around, and struggling. My stomach muscles are still aching a bit, but it's a good ache, one that I've earned through hard work. I am actually quite impressed with the instructor, Tony, who always emphasizes safety, the importance of warming up and stretching, and keeping good form (which means the correct posture). The last thing you want to do is injure yourself and not be able to exercise at all. So, we are full speed ahead on our fitness program.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/crickets_yuk.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In our house, at night, when everyone is asleep, the sounds of nature fill the air. Actually, the noises don't come from outside, but inside the house, and I'm not talking about my husband snoring. Chirp, chirp, chirp, is what we hear. It is the familiar sound of crickets. Normally, we would get cricket noises in our garden in the Summer. But it's only March, and&nbsp;these crickets are in a glass cage, living happily for a few days, until they get fed to our lizards. We have a leopard gekko and a bearded dragon who need a good, tasty meal every now and then. The lizards belong to the kids, but because I am the mum of the house, I am the one who basically takes care of the animals. I'm the one who goes off to the pet shop to by these bags of wriggling, jumpy insects. I'm also the one who has to feed them, so they can be healthy enough to feed Anthony and Dillon, the family reptiles. There is a lot of feeding going on in this house, and unfortunately for me, it involves crickets. I do love their chirping noises; however, at night they get very loud, and so I have to put their cage in the room that is farthest from the bedrooms. My sister-in-law used to have reptiles, and told me a horror story that involved crickets. She had bought an extra large bag of crickets from the pet shop, so she wouldn't have to return for a few weeks. She purchased&nbsp;two hundred and fifty&nbsp;crickets in all, and happily took them home so her sons could feed the lizards. Well, at some point in the process, a hole appeared in the bag, and all of the crickets escaped and ran into various places of her house. Two hundred and fifty of them! She said that it took them days to find the noisy ones, but it's a mystery what happened to a large number of the others, the smart ones who kept their mouths shut, or should I say, their legs still.<BR><BR><STRONG><U>Grammar notes.<BR><BR></U></STRONG>Related verbs: to fill the air, to feed, to chirp, to involve.<BR><BR>1.

			<title>Visit to Blueberry Hills.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Blueberry_hills_nursery.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[You remember, don't you, that last week I was busy in the front garden. I was enjoying the weather and changing the look of our entryway. Well, I had had enough of digging, weeding, and raking, so I decided to go on&nbsp;a hunt for the perfect tree. The closest nursery garden to our house is just down the road, literally about one minute by car. It is actually a home appliance business which opens up a nursery area for the Spring and Summer only. Bark is poured out over a large area and then a variety of trees and bushes are placed on top, watered regularly, and put up for sale. With a quick glance at the nursery garden from my car, I could tell that they didn't have what I wanted. I am not a fussy shopper, but I can quickly tell, in a shopping situation, if I'm in the right place to get what I want. So, I turned left at the traffic lights and headed west to Blueberry Hills nursery. They have a large selection of good quality everything. Their items tend to be more expensive than in other places, but the quality seems to make up for that. I got out and an employee helped me find the Japanese Maples. They had a kind called a Coral Bark which was gorgeous. As its name suggests, the bark is a brilliant pinkish red. The leaves are not out yet, but apparently they are green with a red outline. It sounds&nbsp;like it would make a stunning focal point for the entryway. I looked&nbsp;at the price tag and gasped. Nearly a hundred and fifty bucks! A bit too much for me, I'm afraid. I think I would have to talk to my husband first before I spend that kind of money on one tree. I walked around a little more, looking at other trees, and taking in the pretty landscape. Blueberry Hills overlooks a small valley to the side of Wenatchee where the Wenatchee river runs into the Columbia. It is very picturesque setting, especially with all of the blueberry and lavendar bushes covering large areas of the property, and, in recent years, they have planted vineyards and opened a wine tasting area.&nbsp;Even if we don't get the tree, I plan on returning for another look, or perhaps&nbsp;to sample some wine.&nbsp;<BR><BR><STRONG><U>Grammar notes.<BR><BR></U></STRONG>Related vocabulary: to have enough of..., bark, fussy, picturesque.<BR><BR>1.

			<title>Ghosts in the orchard.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/ghost_orchard.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pulling out of the parking lot of a country bakery today, when the orchard opposite caught my eye. All the bare trees were a bright white color, from the bottom of the trunks to the tips of the top branches. It was quite a sight, and contrasted beautifully with the dark hills in the background. The reason that the trees were so ghostly white is that they&nbsp;had&nbsp;been sprayed&nbsp;with&nbsp;diatomaceous earth, which is like a clay powder that stops&nbsp;the eggs of insects developing&nbsp;.Maintaining an orchard is a&nbsp;full-time job, as the orchardists around here know.&nbsp;When you have an orchard, there is a list of jobs which start, of course, with planting the young apple trees. In this&nbsp;area they are irrigated because Wenatchee only gets about 9 inches of&nbsp;rainfall each year. Putting in the irrigation pipes, and maintaining them is a job in itself. Like any plant, apple trees can get infested with harmful insects, so certain pesticides have to be used, in accordance with the state laws. Fertilizers are also used at certain times of the year. Then comes the pruning in the winter which is especially necessary if you want a big crop. Not many people know that the orchards are sprayed with calcium.&nbsp;This mineral helps replace the calcium that is lost when a tree goes through very cold or hot weather. A tree will remove calcium from the fruit to protect itself, leaving a poor quality fruit behind.&nbsp;Applying calcium can stop up to a 50% loss of some varieties of apple. It sounds like science, doesn't it?&nbsp;Well, it is. Researchers and orchardists have worked in this area for over a hundred years, trying to find&nbsp;the best ways to care for the&nbsp;trees, in order to produce the best fruit.&nbsp;That is why half of all the apples sold in the U.S. come from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR><STRONG><U>Grammar notes</U></STRONG>.<BR><BR>Common expressions and orchard vocabulary: to catch one's eye, a crop, fertilizer, irrigation, to prune, a variety.<BR><BR>1.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pulling out of the parking lot of a country bakery today, when the orchard opposite caught my eye. All the bare trees were a bright white color, from the bottom of the trunks to the tips of the top branches. It was quite a sight, and contrasted beautifully with the dark hills in the background. The reason that the trees were so ghostly white is that they&nbsp;had&nbsp;been sprayed&nbsp;with&nbsp;diatomaceous earth, which is like a clay powder that stops&nbsp;the eggs of insects developing&nbsp;.Maintaining an orchard is a&nbsp;full-time job, as the orchardists around here know.&nbsp;When you have an orchard, there is a list of jobs which start, of course, with planting the young apple trees. In this&nbsp;area they are irrigated because Wenatchee only gets about 9 inches of&nbsp;rainfall each year. Putting in the irrigation pipes, and maintaining them is a job in itself. Like any plant, apple trees can get infested with harmful insects, so certain pesticides have to be used, in accordance with the state laws. Fertilizers are also used at certain times of the year. Then comes the pruning in the winter which is especially necessary if you want a big crop. Not many people know that the orchards are sprayed with calcium.&nbsp;This mineral helps replace the calcium that is lost when a tree goes through very cold or hot weather. A tree will remove calcium from the fruit to protect itself, leaving a poor quality fruit behind.&nbsp;Applying calcium can stop up to a 50% loss of some varieties of apple. It sounds like science, doesn't it?&nbsp;Well, it is. Researchers and orchardists have worked in this area for over a hundred years, trying to find&nbsp;the best ways to care for the&nbsp;trees, in order to produce the best fruit.&nbsp;That is why half of all the apples sold in the U.S. come from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Grammar notes.Common expressions and orchard vocabulary: to catch one's eye, a crop, fertilizer, irrigation, to prune, a variety.1. The red hat in the shop window caught my eye; I had to buy it.2. Wheat is a crop that is grown in the flat lands near us.3. My roses&nbsp;need fertilizer; they produced very few flowers last year.4.

            <description><![CDATA[I make no appologies today for talking about one of my passions: gardening. It's that time again, whoopee! The weather has been perfect recently. Though there is snow on the tops of the nearby mountains, and the breeze is cold, the bright sun makes up for it. There is always something to do when you have&nbsp;a garden. This time of year means clearing the place up and getting ready for the Spring. Our entryway had five large bushes in a row. For years, I wanted to move them, and finally, we have. My husband dug them up, and replanted them next to the garage. Now, what am I going to do with the space that is left? I have a plan. There is a certain tree called a Japanese Maple. Its leaves look delicate and feathery, and the slim branches create a layered effect. I will look all over town until I find just the right one. This type of tree looks great next to a building because the branches grow delicately close to the walls, and often they form an arch that you can walk under. They come in green, red, or a mixture of both colors(ours). Then, I think a variety of perennials and bulbs will do the trick for the rest of the area. It's surprising just how much work it is to add manure, peat moss, to dig, to rake, and then to clean up. It's a great workout! I think one of the reasons I love to garden so much is that you see progress very quickly, and nothing, apart from rock, is static. Growth can be seen in so many ways.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Koi.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On our way to the basketball game at the weekend, we stopped at a restaurant for dinner. The consensus was that we wanted asian food. So, as we drove along, half of us in the car looked out in one direction, and the rest of us looked in the other, until someone spotted a chinese restaurant. We turned into the parking lot and looked at the building. It was pink, it had colorful (ourful) accent colors (ours), and its style was very chinese. "I have a bad feeling about this place," said my husband all of a sudden. "What do you mean? Why, just because it's pink?" was my question. He told me to trust his instincts, and to let him drive us to a different restaurant. We turned up at another, very large chinese restaurant that immediately caught our attention because of the huge fish tank full of koi. Wow! There were at least ten, large, brightly colored (oured) koi, swimming around gracefully. The history of koi is interesting. About 1000 years ago, the carp was bred in China specifically for certain colors, resulting in the goldfish. About four hundred years later, the carp was introduced into Japan. It wasn't until the 1820's that carp were bred for color in Japan. By the 20th century, the famous red and white koi had been established, and were revealed to the world in the Tokyo exhibition in 1914. Koi can live easily for more than 100 years. The longest living recorded koi lived 226 years, and outlived several owners! While the children and I gazed at the fish and oohhed and aahhed, my husband looked up the restaurant on his droid to see what the food was like. Well, it turns out that the food was not worth eating, and the previous restaurant was highly recommended. So, we had a last look at the incredible koi, and then sneaked out and headed off to the pink restaurant which, in the end, turned out to be the perfect place for chinese food.<BR><BR><U><STRONG>Grammar notes.<BR><BR></STRONG></U>Useful common verbs: To spot, to turn (into), to outlive, to sneak out.<BR><BR>1.

            <description><![CDATA[Here in the United States, basketball is really popular. Children start at a young age&nbsp;going to practice and joining teams. Both college and professional basketball games are televised, and most adults have a favorite(urite) team. I was lucky enough to see a college basketball game this weekend, in the city of Spokane which is about a three hour drive. We all piled into the car; we took blankets, pillows, snacks, drinks, video games, and colors(ours) and paper to keep the kids busy. The drive is fairly uneventful as it goes mainly through flat, wheat growing areas where you only see an occasional house. We eventually arrived at Whitworth college where the game was being held. Now, I have to tell you that I am used to watching ten and eleven year olds run around on the court, so this was an entirely different experience. The gym was packed with spectators and college students; many people had to stand up because&nbsp;the place&nbsp;was so full. There was a huge banner across one wall that said 'Pirates' which is the name of the Whitworth team.

			<title>The Magic Chair.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/the_magic_chair_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever have aches and pains? Do your muscles ever get sore? Do you get headaches? My husband used to until a couple of years ago. He would come home from work with tight shoulders, or a headache, or a knot in his back, near his shoulder blades. Tension was the problem, caused by stress from work, and sitting too long in front of the computer. I tried to help by massaging his back, but it wasn't very effective. Then he went to a chiropractor for an adjustment. You know the routine: you lie on a bed and get pulled in different directions until your tight&nbsp;back cracks loudly. It's a scary situation; you really have to trust the chiropractor. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen to your spine. It is usually very effective and gives relief quickly, but, it&nbsp;didn't do the&nbsp;trick&nbsp;for my husband. So, he tried Yoga. What an excellent choice. It's good for relieving stress, and for the body. I think, if he had done it properly, it could have worked, but it wasn't enough to get rid of his headaches. He really had to find a solution to his problem, because, as you know, headaches can wreck your day; they get in the way of everything. Finally, we went to Seattle to look at some massaging chairs that he had heard about. We spent the whole day trying out different kinds, until he chose one, and we brought it home.&nbsp;It&nbsp;replicates Shiatsu massage, so, when you sit in it and lie back, the rotating, metal&nbsp;balls inside the chair actually push up on&nbsp;specific&nbsp;parts of your back, neck, and legs. &nbsp;For the first few days, I had to put up with his exclamations of relief, "Ooohhh!" and "Aahh!" and "Did you hear my back just crack? This chair is amazing!" I'm glad to say it worked, and has done ever since. It has been a life saver; he is now free of headaches. For him, it has been like magic.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grammar notes.<br /></span></strong><br />Common expressions: to put up with, as you know, to do the trick.<br /><br />1. When we stayed with my dear, deaf aunt, we had to put up with her dog barking all night.<br /><br />2. The weather is getting worse, as you know, so we will not take the boat out until it is safe.<br /><br />3. I fixed the squeaky door; a spot of oil did the trick.</p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Do you ever have aches and pains? Do your muscles ever get sore? Do you get headaches? My husband used to until a couple of years ago. He would come home from work with tight shoulders, or a headache, or a knot in his back, near his shoulder blades. Tension was the problem, caused by stress from work, and sitting too long in front of the computer. I tried to help by massaging his back, but it wasn't very effective. Then he went to a chiropractor for an adjustment. You know the routine: you lie on a bed and get pulled in different directions until your tight&nbsp;back cracks loudly. It's a scary situation; you really have to trust the chiropractor. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen to your spine. It is usually very effective and gives relief quickly, but, it&nbsp;didn't do the&nbsp;trick&nbsp;for my husband. So, he tried Yoga. What an excellent choice. It's good for relieving stress, and for the body. I think, if he had done it properly, it could have worked, but it wasn't enough to get rid of his headaches. He really had to find a solution to his problem, because, as you know, headaches can wreck your day; they get in the way of everything. Finally, we went to Seattle to look at some massaging chairs that he had heard about. We spent the whole day trying out different kinds, until he chose one, and we brought it home.&nbsp;It&nbsp;replicates Shiatsu massage, so, when you sit in it and lie back, the rotating, metal&nbsp;balls inside the chair actually push up on&nbsp;specific&nbsp;parts of your back, neck, and legs. &nbsp;For the first few days, I had to put up with his exclamations of relief, "Ooohhh!" and "Aahh!" and "Did you hear my back just crack? This chair is amazing!" I'm glad to say it worked, and has done ever since. It has been a life saver; he is now free of headaches. For him, it has been like magic.Grammar notes.Common expressions: to put up with, as you know, to do the trick.1. When we stayed with my dear, deaf aunt, we had to put up with her dog barking all night.2. The weather is getting worse, as you know, so we will not take the boat out until it is safe.3. I fixed the squeaky door; a spot of oil did the trick.]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>A Musical Refuge.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Woodshouse.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[For a small town, Wenatchee is actually quite musical, I'm pleased to say. There are lots of choirs, trios, quartets, jazz groups, singers, and locations for them to perform. It is a growing trend, as well. Music isn't very well funded in public schools, but the availability of music centers(res), teachers, and musical groups, seems to make up for it. The Woodshouse Conservatory of Music is a historical building that has been converted into such a place. It was actually donated by the Woods family in 1997 specifically for the conservation of music. It has fifteen teachers and one hundred and seventy five students. On any given day, if you walk into the conservatory, you will hear a piano, a violin, viola, or cello, a guitar, perhaps a flute, or an oboe,.....and the list goes on. I first discovered the Woodshouse when I signed up for violin lessons a couple of years ago. Its antiquated design and creeky floors reminded me of my home country, England, and I felt immediately at home. But the real gem of the conservatory is not the building itself, nor the number of students. It is how the teachers really love music and want to share it. That feeling fills the building. This past summer, the administration arranged for a kiddies' workshop, in which small children could experience, perhaps for the first time, different instruments and the basic concepts of music. The younger a person starts, apparently, the better. And then, at the other end of the spectrum, one of my violin teacher's students who I met, turned out to be in his late seventies. What an inspiration!

            <description><![CDATA[You have probably learned from my podcasts, that the region where I live is agricultural. It is rural, the communities are small, and its post native american indian roots lie in the apple tree. I realised the other day how I take the apple tree for granted. Not only is it everywhere in this and the surrounding towns, but there are so many businesses built around the fruit. There is a large juicing factory called Tree Top which, of course, uses apples. There is also a special candy, unique to this area, called Aplets and Cotlets.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;similar to Turquish Delight, just a little more rustic, and made of apples and apricots. Then there are businesses that supply the farming industry, the apple art and collectibles products, clothing, and the Apple Blossom Festival in the spring. There is always something on the calendar that has something to do with the apple. My husband is a fruit broker, believe it or not, and so I hear every day about conditions of apples, how they are being shipped abroad, and the global market. I visited his office this weekend, and came across some apple box labels that originated in this region. They were framed, and displayed in a group of about twenty. Though no longer in use, they reflect some of the history and culture of the inland Northwest. Native American indians feature on several of them, which makes sense; most of the towns in this area have Native American names, and were originally established by indians.

			<title>The Coffee Trend.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/coffee_trend.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Drive throughs are part of daily life here in the U.S. It all started with fast food, but now, there are drive throughs for all kinds of products, even medicine. Some pharmacies have the available option of a drive through medicine pick up for those who are in a hurry. It is convenient, especially if you have little children in the car. It is so much easier than getting everyone out of the car, keeping them quiet inside the store, and then getting back in the car. But, in the past few years, a different kind of drive through has come to Wenatchee. It's coffee. The daily drug is available sooner than before because of drive through coffee stands all over town. Some established cafes also have a drive through at the back or side of the building. One such place is The Coffee Cabin. As its name suggests, its style is western. In fact, it is just like a log cabin. The inside is very woodsy, with a big stone fireplace, and the furniture is chunky and also made out of wood . On chilly days, they have a fire in the fireplace; people order their coffees and sit around and play chess, read, or chat. Internet access is available, and there are also indoor and outdoor play areas for children. Considering all the elements of this business, it meets most people's needs. There are often two or three full-time employees making coffee and handing out bagels or muffins; they will take turns dealing with the inside customers and then the outside, drive through customers. There is always a special of the day which is some kind of flavored(oured) coffee, very popular amongst Americans. In most cafes in town, you will find about twenty flavored(oured) syrups next to the espresso machine, anything from raspberry to sugar-free mint.

            <description><![CDATA[My family has adopted a new, night time routine on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. It's one that is an obsession in this country. We watch American Idol. You have probably heard about it. It is a reality television show which is based around a competition to find the next, big singing star. It was created by Simon Cowell, a British music executive producer, who started a similar reality series in England called Pop Idol. The American version has now become one of the most viewed series ever in this country. It is quite addicting to watch because, as a viewer, you become a judge, and even have some say in who eventually wins. In the first few weeks, a panel of judges travels to several major(our) cities and views large numbers of people who have signed up for the competition. There is a vote taken after each performance, which drastically reduces the number of singers that can go into the next round. This continues until there are about 25 people left. Then, after each performance, the public votes, either by phone or text. The program(me)&nbsp;is quite funny in the beginning weeks, as lots of people who actually can't sing do try out. The responses of judges add to the humor(our). However, the last few weeks become quite emotional as the pressure increases and more and more people get voted off. The series gives the viewers a look into the lives of the contestants, their hopes and their struggles, so we become emotionally involved with them as individuals. Opinions fly around the house as to who should win and who shouldn't.

			<title>The Springhill Suites Hotel.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/hotel.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[There has been&nbsp;a lot of activity just down the road from us, for the past year. A hotel has been built, and we have witnessed the process from start to finish. About a year ago, the construction crew 'broke ground' and started digging and moving earth. Then came the foundation. The big cement mixers came in to pour and pour until the amount of cement was just right. Each afternoon, driving my children home from school, I would deliberately take a slightly longer route which leads right past the hotel site. My kids would ooh and aah at the machines, and the changes that were taking place. Soon the walls went up, stage by stage. Just opposite the building site is a restaurant with an outside seating area. We sat there on a few occasions, eating icecream and watching the progress: machines coming and going, the large crew of workmen nailing, hammering, carrying, and cutting. At least half of the time there was plenty of yelling going on, and most of the time it was in a variety of different languages. It would have been good to film the work from the beginning to the end consistently, and then show the film in fast motion. I'm happy to say that the ordinances or rules for new buildings here is that they must have good landscaping around them: trees, shrubs, and grass. So, the hotel won't look like a big, boring, box of a place. It actually has an attractive design with some architectural interest, some natural stone, and now the landscaping. I'm sure that, in true American style, there will be a grand opening celebration. There will be balloons, free coffee, and perhaps a raffle. Once, when a department store was having its grand opening, my husband and I happened to be in a parking lot nearby. Suddenly, there was the sound of explosions.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[There has been&nbsp;a lot of activity just down the road from us, for the past year. A hotel has been built, and we have witnessed the process from start to finish. About a year ago, the construction crew 'broke ground' and started digging and moving earth. Then came the foundation. The big cement mixers came in to pour and pour until the amount of cement was just right. Each afternoon, driving my children home from school, I would deliberately take a slightly longer route which leads right past the hotel site. My kids would ooh and aah at the machines, and the changes that were taking place. Soon the walls went up, stage by stage. Just opposite the building site is a restaurant with an outside seating area. We sat there on a few occasions, eating icecream and watching the progress: machines coming and going, the large crew of workmen nailing, hammering, carrying, and cutting. At least half of the time there was plenty of yelling going on, and most of the time it was in a variety of different languages. It would have been good to film the work from the beginning to the end consistently, and then show the film in fast motion. I'm happy to say that the ordinances or rules for new buildings here is that they must have good landscaping around them: trees, shrubs, and grass. So, the hotel won't look like a big, boring, box of a place. It actually has an attractive design with some architectural interest, some natural stone, and now the landscaping. I'm sure that, in true American style, there will be a grand opening celebration. There will be balloons, free coffee, and perhaps a raffle. Once, when a department store was having its grand opening, my husband and I happened to be in a parking lot nearby. Suddenly, there was the sound of explosions. I ducked, not knowing what on earth was happening. My husband just laughed at me and pointed to the building, "It's just the grand opening fire works, babe. I know," he admitted, "we tend to overdo it here."Grammar notes.Practicing the use of 'would' using related vocabulary: to break ground, building site, ordinance, to duck.1.

            <description><![CDATA[So, I have a penguin in my car. It is small, plastic, and makes a very irritating, repetitive noise. Thankfully, it has an on-off switch. But, where on earth did it come from? McDonalds is the answer. I hardly ever go there, but, the other day, my two youngest children begged me to take them there. My son was taking a day off from school because he felt a under the weather, and my daughter didn't have pre-school that day. We needed to get out of the house, but I wanted to take them somewhere warm to play, so that is where we went. It is a very popular place in Wenatchee and all over the U.S. Thanks to its multi-million dollar advertising, it is, quite literally, everywhere. On the television there are countless advertisements about McDonalds, and then there are the jingles, the logos, and the toys. It's similar to Disney Land. Infact, until 2007, McDonalds had a contract with Disney to sell Happy Meal toys that were characters in the latest Disney movies. However, Disney has decided to associate its&nbsp;characters with healthier food. Though fast food here in the U.S. is known to be unhealthy, and leading the country to obesity, the advertising and the convenience of it all keep bringing the crowds back. The focus of McDonalds' advertising is children. If you can attract them, and create a safe and convenient place for them to play and eat, then they will come back, and keep coming back. If there are rewards for eating McDonalds, the children will&nbsp; be even more tempted, hence the irritating penguins. The company has also changed with the times. They offer salads, fruit, and premium lattes now, as alternatives, and in European countries are even changing their color(ur) scheme to look more sophisticated. So, however good or bad the food may be, the appeal of the plastic penguin still works for 47 million customers each day.<BR><BR><STRONG><U>Grammar notes.<BR><BR></U></STRONG>Common expressions: to feel under the weather, quite literally, hence, where on earth?<BR><BR>1.

            <description><![CDATA[It's time for me to start preparing our Summer holiday. This year, my family and I will take a trip to Spain for a month. We will visit my father and sister in Scotland and England first, and then family and friends in Spain. I can't wait.

"I have to organize(se) a substantial trip," I said to myself. "Who knows when we will have another opportunity..." So, I got the tickets over the phone with a representative from British Airways, got the confirmation number, and jumped for joy. Now, I need passports for my two youngest children.

My bag was searched, my body was checked, and I was given the ok. Phew! All I needed were two application forms. It was a quick in and out visit.

            <description><![CDATA[For 90 years, Wenatchee has celebrated the Apple Blossom Festival. It is a huge event that takes place, as the title suggests, in Spring. At that time of year, the valley becomes full of&nbsp;the color(our) and smell of pink apple blossoms.&nbsp;The&nbsp;festival celebrates&nbsp;not only the beauty of&nbsp;Spring, but the community that has been built around the apple tree, and the lives that the orchards support.&nbsp;A queen and two princesses are chosen from many High School age girls who apply. To become one of the royalty, there are some tough prerequisites. You can't just be a pretty face. You have to be a well-rounded individual, intelligent, involved in the community, and focused on several hobbies and causes. This year's royalty have just been chosen. They will be seen, from now on, in the newspaper, and in shops and businesses, making appearances and having their photographs taken. There is a great reward for becoming one of the royalty, as well, scholarships for college! When education is so expensive, that is a tremendous benefit. There are many other areas of preparation for Apple Blossom that take months of hard work. There will be a large parade downtown, a kids parade, a food fare, and a whole host of activities and events that involve the whole community. The festival is big business! It attracts 100,000 people every year, providing a great whoosh for the economy. At the entrance to Wenatchee, there is a sign that says, "The Apple Capital of the World". Though the economy has changed in recent years, and even the orchards, the Apple Blossom festival celebrates the roots of the community, and its human and natural resources.

            <description><![CDATA[They are crunchy, small, folded, and light brown in color (colour). They usually come in individual, plastic packets. They don't fill you up, but they are an important part of&nbsp;certain meals. They hold a different promise for each person at the table. And, finally, they have an Asian touch about them. So, what are they? They are fortune cookies, of course. No Asian style meal would be complete without them, at least, from a Westerner's perspective. I'm sure there are a lot of Asian meals that should never have fortune cookies at the end; you'll just have to forgive my ignorance. The cookies are, afterall, an Asian American invention that started around the beginning of the 20th century. Apparently, Asian immigrants, probably Japanese or Chinese, started to manufacture them in California. A cookie that they might have been copying is the omikuji cookie of Kyoto, Japan which was a temple cookie filled with random fortunes. It sounds similar. Well, they certainly are popular over here. Though they are normally served after a chinese meal, they can also be found in Japanese restaurants, and Asian-American restaurants. Children get excited by the idea of a special cookie at the end of the meal, especially one that they can break open to find a message inside. "This week, a special person will come into your life," one might say, or, "Use your good judgment to make your fortune this year." My children always imagine ways the prediction might come true; they get imaginative, and even ridiculous.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever go blank when you're trying to spell a word? It happens to me occasionally. When it comes to spelling, I have a problem. I have had to learn the Standard American English whilst living in the U.S. for the past 18 years, but, I'm English. That means that when I went to school I learned Standard English which has quite a few differences from that of the U.S. Some of the obvious ones are: color in American English and colour in British English, analyze in American English and analyse in British English, bank in American English and banque in British English. If you look through a list of the spelling differences, you will conclude that British English remains closer to its roots: Greek, Latin, French etc. The American English seems more phonetic, and I suppose, in some ways, is easier. Mind you, English is a bit of a pain <em>anyway</em>. My ten year old, who reads and writes well, still struggles on occasion with spelling. The silent 'e', the silent 'gh', the occasional silent 'p' (as in pneumonia or psychology), and the silent 'k'. "How am I supposed to know all of these spellings, Mum?" was his question. My answer was simply, "Learn the awkward words by heart." Both Standard American and British English share the same difficulties, I'm afraid. The only way to get around them is to consider them part of the beauty and interest of the language......I know, that's easy for me to say, I am English. Really, a language like Spanish is so much easier to learn because it is so phonetic. But, you know, English spelling is not always that easy for <em>me</em> because of this trans-Atlantic 'thing'. I have my own problems knowing when to double an 'l' when adding an 'ing', or whether to use an 's' or a 'z' (or I should say zed).

			<title>Valentines at school.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Valentines_school.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I looked over my shopping list, and saw something that my chidren had written down. "Valentines for school", were the instructions that I read. What they meant by that were little cards that are designed especially for school children. Here, in the U.S., it is tradition for the children to give a miniature card to each of their classroom buddies. Sometimes the teacher will allow a treat or tiny toy to be attached or taped to the card, something like an eraser, a pencil, or a small chocolate. It is a tradition which is unfortunately driven by materialism. Valentine's day itself, is not celebrated in a huge way at all by the general public. It is true that there are cards, flowers, and chocolates all over the place to give as gifts for a loved one, but it is not a holiday. The children take their card distribution very seriously, though. The teachers even print out a list of the names of the children in the class, so each child can write the correct names on the little gifts. The older children will read about St. Valentine; the younger ones will usually cut and paint big, red or pink hearts for their parents or guardians. Last night, as my children prepared their Valentines, it was all business. They each counted out the cards, wrote the names, added treats, and put them into a paper bag, ready for school today. And beware anyone who wished to interrupt! "Hey, that's my card!" "Don't use my pencil!" "You'd better leave enough chocolates for my class!" I think some of the Valentine's spirit should have been directed at eachother, let alone their friends.</p>

			<title>A treat from England.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Maltesers..wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>My husband recently returned from a business trip to Germany and England. It is an annual visit that he makes to attend a large, international fruit convention. He spends most of his time in Berlin, and then finishes his trip in London. He loves that city. When he is there, he always calls me and tells me that he is enjoying his wife's 'old stomping ground'. That means a place either that you grew up in, or that was very significant for you. When he&nbsp;comes home, he always brings treats from London. Usually he will bring three or four kinds of chocolates: Smarties, Maltesers, Galaxay, and Toblerone. My favorite is Maltesers. When I see the red bag and feel the chocolates inside, it takes me back to my childhood. You know how a certain smell, or sight can have you feeling like a child again; that's what happens when I am around Maltesers. It just shows how significant our formative years are; how memories from that time become engraved in our brains and hearts. There is a certain smell that also brings the same nostalgia to me. It is the smell of a child's play dough that is called Plasticine. Since I have lived here, I haven't encountered that smell at all. But sometimes when I visit England, and I am, let's say, in a toy shop, I&nbsp; might walk past some children's art supplies and smell that smell. Oh bliss! I get transported back to the days of pig tails and tricycles. It would be interesting to hear from some of you listeners which elements of your culture bring up those nostalgic feelings. If you E-mail me and let me know, I will do a podcast dedicated to just that.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></span></p>
<p>Vocabulary practice: bliss, annual, significant, let's say.</p>
<p>1. That chocolate cake is so good; it is pure bliss!</p>
<p>2. All the local gardeners are preparing for the annual vegetable competition.</p>
<p>3. The rainfall has caused a significant rise in the height of the river.</p>
<p>4. I'm not sure how much that house is worth; it might be, let's say, three hundred thousand.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Junk mail can be a real pain sometimes. You know the kind: offers from credit card companies, catalogues that you will never use, and all sorts of letters and advertisements that try to get you to spend money in some way or other. I receive a lot of coupons in the mail, mainly from local supermarkets where I shop. Now these are actually useful. Most people I know use coupons at least part of the time; it's a smart way to shop. My sister-in-law is an expert at using coupons. When the coupons come out in the local newspaper on Tuesdays and Thursdays, she spreads them out on her kitchen countertop, and when she has time, she scans all of them, searching for the ones that she can put to use. Because she has done this for so long, she is quite knowledgeable about what is a good&nbsp;deal and what isn't. To be a good coupon user, you must always keep them close to your shopping list, and remember to throw the expired ones away. Coupons have been around for a long time. It was in 1887 that Coca-Cola started using new advertising ideas. One of these was to put&nbsp;coupons in newspapers. By 1913 8,500,000 free drinks had been consumed, but the company had grown so much that the drink was being consumed in every state. Now, each year, coupons generate 3 billion dollars in sales. Now that's a lot of sales. So, the little pile of coupons that I receive each day in the mail (post) is just a tiny part of that advertising machine, trying to get us to spend money by saving money. It's a great idea when you think of it.</p>

			<title>A growing obsession.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/orchids.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're looking for a bargain in this town, there is a store that offers some very good deals. It is called the Grocery Outlet. I was in there the other day, searching for the latest 'best buys' when I saw a large shelf of flowers on display. In amongst the different kinds of flowers were orchids. I was pleased and surprised at the same time. You&nbsp;can never really be&nbsp;sure what you will find in this shop; their specials change from one day to the next. To find orchids was a very pleasant surprise. It just so happens that my mother has started collecting orchids. She is very quickly becoming an encyclopedia about them. I called her on the cell phone to let her know about my find. "Get me two of the best, will you? I'll pay you back later," she said. There were several colors to choose from, and the plants ranged from small to about two and&nbsp;a half feet tall. When I got home, I thought I would find out about these exotic flowers that so many people have as a hobby.</p>
<p>Orchids can be found in almost every habitat on the planet, apart from deserts and glaciers. Most are found in the tropics. And when I say most, I'm talking in terms of thousands. Orchids are the largest family of all flowering plants. There are over 22,000 species of orchids; about 800 new kinds are found or cultivated each year. One orchid is responsible for vanilla which we use in cooking. It comes from Mexico, and, not surprisingly, is called Vanilla. With so many orchids around, you can imagine the variety of shape, color (colour), and pollinating practices. Some are self pollinating, and there is even one in Australia which lives underground, and relies on ants and other underground insects to pollinate it.&nbsp;Orchids have been around for a very long time, as well. A fossilized bee that was trapped in amber about 15 million years ago was found to have orchid pollen on its wings. There are annual shows around the world dedicated to orchids, and hundreds or thousands of people visit these shows to feed their obsession.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Tatoo.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It is supposed to be a good thing to reward your kids every now and then for going to school, or doing their chores. Domini, my daughter is no exception. When she changed preschools, she went through a time of adjustment, and had to be encouraged to stay at her new school. She only goes four mornings a week, but, even so, a change is a change. I found that I could persuade her to go along with the new plan by giving her a surprise randomly after preschool. Sometimes it was a treat, and at other times it was a little toy, or art supplies. Well, it worked. She soon got into the habit of going to her new preschool, and now she loves it. She loves the teachers, and has made good friends there. So, the need for persuasion has, thankfully, disappeared. But every now and then, I will drive her to a little shop that is a few blocks away from her preschool, and there we will buy a transfer sticker, or what she likes to call a tatoo. Just outside of the shop are some little glass dispensers with pretty pictures and patterns on them. I give her two quarters which she holds onto with excitement while she chooses the one she wants. There is a flat metal plate with slots in it into which you put the money. Then, in order to receive the 'tatoo', you have to push the metal plate into the dispenser. Automatically, it pops out in a small piece of protective cardboard. It's not a big deal at all, but for Domini it is. The first time we got one, she immediately said, "Mum, I need to go to the bathroom." I thought it was a little odd, but said that we could ask in the shop if she could use their toilet. So, I stood outside the bathroom and waited and waited. "Domini, are you alright in there?" I asked. "Yes Mum, I've almost finished," was her reply. I heard the water running, and was congratulating myself on training her well to wash her hands, when she came out with a big grin and showed me her 'tatoo'. That's why she had wanted to go to the bathroom; her tatoo had to be displayed immediately.</p>

			<title>A Tour of Homes, the stairs.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Stairs.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This podcast seems like a very simple one; what&nbsp; could I possibly have to teach about the stairs? Well, there are many kinds of stairs in a home. You have the steps leading up to the front door, or between one room and another. Sometimes a room can be 'split level' meaning that there is a step all across the width of the room, creating the effect of two different rooms. And then you have the stairs that take you from one floor to another. The stairs between floors can be called the staircase. We also use the expression, "a flight of stairs" when you are not in a home. For example: At the clinic, I had to go up three flights of stairs to get to my doctor. In the home, there are also different kiinds of stairs. Normally, a staircase is made of wood, concrete, compressed materials, or even metal. A spiral staircase is an interesting and space saving way to connect two floors. Have you heard the word 'landing'? Of course it could be used when talking about planes 'landing' in the airport etc. But the noun, a landing, can refer to an area of level ground in the middle of a staircase or at the end. For example: You left your shoes at the top of the stairs, on the landing. Or: The children love to play half way up the stairs, on the landing. A staircase will often have a&nbsp;handrail which prevents you from falling over the edge.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This podcast seems like a very simple one; what&nbsp; could I possibly have to teach about the stairs? Well, there are many kinds of stairs in a home. You have the steps leading up to the front door, or between one room and another. Sometimes a room can be 'split level' meaning that there is a step all across the width of the room, creating the effect of two different rooms. And then you have the stairs that take you from one floor to another. The stairs between floors can be called the staircase. We also use the expression, "a flight of stairs" when you are not in a home. For example: At the clinic, I had to go up three flights of stairs to get to my doctor. In the home, there are also different kiinds of stairs. Normally, a staircase is made of wood, concrete, compressed materials, or even metal. A spiral staircase is an interesting and space saving way to connect two floors. Have you heard the word 'landing'? Of course it could be used when talking about planes 'landing' in the airport etc. But the noun, a landing, can refer to an area of level ground in the middle of a staircase or at the end. For example: You left your shoes at the top of the stairs, on the landing. Or: The children love to play half way up the stairs, on the landing. A staircase will often have a&nbsp;handrail which prevents you from falling over the edge. This is made up of banisters, which are like upright poles, and then the horizontal piece on top that you hold on to. So, as you are running upstairs and downstairs, you hold on to the handrail, or just let your hand slide along the top of it. The finish, or surface material of stairs, can obviously be just about anything, depending on where&nbsp;you live. We have carpeted stairs at home because of the cold winters. Some houses that recquire carpet for warmth, have a 'runner' on the stairs. Runners are long strips of carpet that do not completely cover the stairs; the edges of each step are exposed. Using a runner allows a view of the material underneath, perhaps a beautiful wood, or an elegant tile. It just goes to show that there is a lot more to stairs than you might first think.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>My son, Cass, has been playing the piano for over a year. He loves it! He practices at home, and attends his weekly class religiously. He really has the discipline thing 'down' as we say, meaning that he understands why and how to be disciplined. I am really impressed at his progress. When he first started lessons, I bought him an electronic keyboard that I found on Craig's List for seventy five dollars. It was a bargain. The previous owner was obviously serious about music, and had taken good care of the instrument. When I went to pick it up, I found a house full of music sheets and musical instruments, so I knew that the keyboard had been in good hands. And so, it came to our house. Cass used it and enjoyed it for a long time, especially all of the special effects and pre-recorded classical music that you can enjoy with the push of a button. But, there was a problem. It wasn't a full sized keyboard. We needed a keyboard or piano with 88 keys because his teacher had started to give him melodies that recquire the whole piano. So, I got on the internet, looked up Craig's List, and spotted a couple of pianos for sale. One was a little damaged. The other belonged to a family who was moving to another town and who didn't want to pay for the delivery. I dragged my feet about both; I wasn't very enthusiastic. Then, we received a phone call from one of Cass' friends. His parents had just bought him a new piano, and they wanted to give Cass the old one. He was thrilled! A week later, the moving men pulled up in their delivery truck and carefully rolled the dark, upright piano into our living room. We got to work, polishing, testing, and decorating with pictures. It now sits in a welcomed spot, and gets played every day.</p>

			<title>Goodbye to old toys.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Old_toys.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As I was walking back to my house from the mail box the other day, I looked at our entryway and realised that it looked like a junk yard. There were about four, old, plastic vehicles that our children don't use anymore, just sitting on the driveway looking yucky. I have been meaning to throw the things away, but my youngest children always beg me to keep them for a few more months. The thing is, they are too big for the vehicles, and these old favorites (favourites) of theirs are now faded, weather worn, and have parts missing. I can understand why my kids don't want to see their toys thrown away. When I look at them they certainly bring back memories of when the children were little, and how excited they were to get them. One of the tricycles has a peddle missing, the other is missing the seat, the four wheeler goes backwards only, and the little, plastic buggy is too small for anyone. "Oh, don't throw away my buggy!" pleads my daughter when she suspects that that is my plan. Once, my son Robert, fished the buggy out of the dumpster where I had previously thrown it. I found it sitting happily back on the driveway where it shouldn't have been. Perhaps my urge to Spring clean is too obvious; I'll have to be more sneaky about it and get rid of these old play things when the kids are in school. I never thought that they would be so emotionally attached to the toys!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend, I took my children to Seattle to have a break from our home town, and to take in a few of the famous sights. "A change is as good as a rest," is a saying in England which I agree with. Sometimes if you are worn down a little, instead of resting, it is actually good to go and see something new;&nbsp;it is good to be refreshed. So, I booked a hotel that is fairly close to the downtown area of the city. We set off Saturday morning. Travelling over the Cascades was beautiful; mist was all over the forest. We finally made it to the hotel at lunch time. The children wanted to go swimming in the pool at the hotel before doing anything else. So, of course, that's what we did. I know that children are not as enthusiastic about site seeing as adults are; they need lots of physical fun too. When they were good and tired from splashing around, we got ready and headed off to the Space Needle. It is the landmark of Seattle. It was built for the 1962 World's Fair, and has been quite an attraction ever since. It is 605 feet tall, has a restaurant inside that turns 360 defrees every hour, and was built to widthstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour, and earthquakes of up to 9.1 magnitude. A lot of thought went into the building; you could say that it was built to last. We zoomed up in the elevator to the observation deck where you can find lots of binoculars, spotting scopes, and multi-media that talk about the interesting places that you can see from the Needle. And there is a lot to see. Not only is the city all around, but on a clear day, you have spectacular views of the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Ranier, Mount Baker, Elliot Bay, and lots more. Unfortunately it was a drizzly day, so we couldn't see the mountains, but there was so much to see that we could have been up there for hours. Well, there was a lot more exploring to do, so we took some photos and headed back down in the elevator. We must return on a clear day to take in the views.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Every year in Wenatchee, there is a home show. It takes place in a large convention center that is called the Town Toyota Center. This place hosts concerts, sporting events, and any kind of large function that involves lots of people. It is a great, new facility for our area. The home show includes many exhibits of products that are used to either build, furnish, or decorate the home. So, you can imagine, there are ton(nes) of items being displayed. It's all about networking, really. The NCHBA stands for the North Central Home Builder's Association. It was established in 1993, is non-profit, and has over 600 members. As far as the general public is concerned, the home show provides an exciting view of all that goes into making a home. Also, if you happen to be looking for a general contractor, a sub-contractor, a realtor, or a craftsman, then this is a good place to start. Their association agrees on standards of quality. They also petition for or against legislation that affects the building industry. 'Our membership is united and committed to promoting and protecting affordable housing, so that families can achieve the American dream of owning their own home.' That is one of the goals of the association, as well as to increase business. There are posters all over town advertising the event which will last for three days. It is really quite an eye opener to go and see all that is involved in home ownership. I think that January is the ideal time to have the show here, as the cold weather keeps most people at home with little to do. This attracts those people, gets them out of the house, and provides a kind of entertainment, or, at least, interest. It is one of those areas of life that is easy to take for granted, especially if you have never built your own home.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">As most parents, I am concerned about what my children eat. Do they eat healthy food, and if they do, do they eat it consistently? And what about me? Am I careful about what I put in my body? It will, in time, influence my health and those around me. I find it is easy to quickly grab food when I am 'on the go', and not necessarily feed my body everything that it needs. School kids, especially, need a balanced diet. When my children come out of school, they are always ready to devour something. I have been experimenting recently, to see just how healthy I can make their after school snacks. There are so many quick, processed foods that I could feed them, but how would they benefit? So, the other day, when I picked them up, I presented them with chicken and a bag of blueberries each. "Ah, cool!" was their only reply as they tucked into the food. You would have thought that they would want something sweet, or starchy, but they were totally satisfied with what I had brought them. "Great!" I thought to myself, "I can feel good about feeding them all kinds of healthy snacks on the way home." Once when I was at the check-out till at a supermarket, the cashier made a remark about a box of pumpkin bread mix that I was buying. "Oh, this is really good stuff," she said. "I bought this the other day because my kids were getting tired of Oreo cookies as an after school snack." I was actually horrified at the thought of the super processed Oreos being eaten every day! Processed ingredients sneak into all kinds of foods these days, but every day Oreo cookies take the biscuit!</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[As most parents, I am concerned about what my children eat. Do they eat healthy food, and if they do, do they eat it consistently? And what about me? Am I careful about what I put in my body? It will, in time, influence my health and those around me. I find it is easy to quickly grab food when I am 'on the go', and not necessarily feed my body everything that it needs. School kids, especially, need a balanced diet. When my children come out of school, they are always ready to devour something. I have been experimenting recently, to see just how healthy I can make their after school snacks. There are so many quick, processed foods that I could feed them, but how would they benefit? So, the other day, when I picked them up, I presented them with chicken and a bag of blueberries each. "Ah, cool!" was their only reply as they tucked into the food. You would have thought that they would want something sweet, or starchy, but they were totally satisfied with what I had brought them. "Great!" I thought to myself, "I can feel good about feeding them all kinds of healthy snacks on the way home." Once when I was at the check-out till at a supermarket, the cashier made a remark about a box of pumpkin bread mix that I was buying. "Oh, this is really good stuff," she said. "I bought this the other day because my kids were getting tired of Oreo cookies as an after school snack." I was actually horrified at the thought of the super processed Oreos being eaten every day! Processed ingredients sneak into all kinds of foods these days, but every day Oreo cookies take the biscuit!
Grammar notes. 
The past conditional with the past subjunctive&nbsp;with the new expressions.
1. 'On the go' - I would have grabbed a quick 'on the go' lunch if I had known that the cafeteria was closed.
2. 'To tuck into something' - We would have&nbsp;tucked into&nbsp;our chicken if it had been cooked properly.
3. 'Starchy' - If they had realized(sed) just how starchy the bread, pies, and cookies are, they wouldn't have bought them.
4. 'Check-out till' and 'cashier' - If the check-out till hadn't been so slow, the cashier wouldn't have been so frustrated.
5. 'To take the biscuit' - I would have been embarrassed to have performed like that on stage; she really takes the biscuit.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's no secret that computers are a large part of our lives, a huge part. The other day, I noticed as we sat in the lounge, that my husband and I were both busy on our laptops. The television was actually on as well. A couple of years ago that would have seemed like an odd scene, but now it is the norm. My oldest son keeps on begging me for a laptop. "Mum, I will need one in middle school," he insists. Hmmm, why on earth would he need one in school? When I went to school, we just needed paper, pens, and pencils, and those were supplied by the school. "He's just working you, babe," says my husband. What he means by that is that he is using whatever he can to get whatever he wants. Clever boy. But he has to get a bit more clever to get around his mother. I've only just got a laptop myself; there's no way that I'm going to buy one for an eleven year old, especially when there is a perfectly good computer available in the house. Half the time, my laptop drives me nuts. Infact, the day that we were both working on our laptops in the lounge, my husband was also having problems. What kind of problems? Connection problems, the computer working slowly, program(mes) suddenly closing etc etc. There seems to be nothing as aggravating as a malfunctioning computer. Throw the thing out of the window, and let the dogs play with it. Of course, I would never actually do that, but it is so tempting.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I can't believe that it is almost the end of January already. Where has the time gone? We have had an unusual Winter so far, weather wise. It has gone from being overcast and dull, to sunny and mild, back to freezing and snowy. You don't know what to expect from one day to another. One thing that helps me through the cold season is remembering my New Year's resolutions. Everybody I know seems to make them. They might not tell anybody else about them, but they make them nonetheless. Some people will decide to lose weight, or exercise more, perhaps eat more vegetables, or take up a new hobby. Apparently, lots of people now practice Sudoku to improve their memories, or they do yoga to reduce stress. These all sound like wonderful goals to have. The key, I think, is being consistent. Plan something that is not too overwhelming, something doable, then put it into your daily or weekly routine so it is easy to accomplish. One of my New Year's resolutions is to get toned by lifting weights. For some reason, I like the feeling of that kind of workout. I also know that it is great for your bones and your mood. Well, last week I went to the YMCA with great enthusiasm and had a thorough workout. I felt very proud of myself. A day or two later, my elbows started to ache. A couple of days after that they felt even worse. When I drank tea, I had to bring the cup up to my mouth with my elbows sticking out in a very abnormal way, otherwise they would hurt. You can say that I had overdone my workout. My achy muscles are better now, but I'm still determined to stick to my New Year's resolutions. But I think I'll have to be kinder to myself and use lighter weights.</p>

			<title>Roasting marshmallows.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Roasted_marshmallows.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On a cold, dull, Winter day, I sometimes light a fire after picking the children up from school. We gather around and feel cozy. The lounge where we have the fireplace also has a computer and a Wii console, so there is plenty to do for everyone. Though I like to give the kids a healthy snack after school, I make an exception every now and then. Marshmallows are the perfect treat when you have an open fire. Put them on a stick, hold them over the flames, and in no time you will have a light brown, soft, warm marshmallow, ready to be devoured. It is a favorite (favourite) when camping. Infact, there is a special marshmallow recipe that I was introduced to when I came to live here: Smores. Smores are melted marshmallows with a chunk of chocolate, sandwiched in between two square crackers. A very sweet treat indeed. Smores are part of a tradition when people go camping over night, or an occasional treat to make over an open fire at home. Apparently, Americans eat about 90 million pounds of marshmallows each year. Phew! The marshmallow, as we know it, was first manufactured in 1948. However, a much older type of soft candy is found in recipes using the marsh mallow plant that has a spongy inside. This was cut out and either boiled in sugar syrup, dried, and then rolled in confectioners. However these treats began, they are certainly popular in our household, and make a sweet addition to a wintry day.</p>

			<title>British Birds.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/British_Birds.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was cleaning inside a free-standing storage cabinet that we have in the dining room, when I came across a tray that I bought a few years ago in Scotland. It is medium sized, made of a light metal, and has a beautiful picture of British birds. Since I bought the tray I have barely used it. It's perfect for tea for two, or a full meal for one. The picture reminded me of the place I bought it. It was in the gift shop of an owl sanctuary near the Mull of Kintyre. Do you remember the song by the same name, sung by Paul McCartney and Wings? Well, I won't sing it for you; I would like you to continue listening to my podcasts. But what I will tell you are the names of the most common birds that we speak about in English. The ones that I am most familiar with from the British Isles are: the robbin, the dove, the finch, the kingfisher, the bluetit, the crow, the owl, and the hawk. The dove, the crow, the owl, and the hawk I have found in any country that I have visited. The others, though they may be found in other countries, have a certain character and reputation in Britain. The robbin is absolutely tiny, unlike in the U.S. It is also ready for a good fight to defend its territory. The finch and the bluetit are common, colorful (colourful), small and plump, and can be found in lots of traditional stories. Because of its mild climate and geographical position, Britain has a huge number of migrating birds each year, and ornithology and pictures of birds are very popular.</p>

It served also as a huge weapon; it had a massive lazer which could destroy whole planets. Anyway, after saving his money for two years, Cass finally had enough to order the Death Star on line. He was thrilled. It only took about a week to arrive. Everyone was excited to see him open up the box, and we all gasped in amazement at the number of Lego pieces and the size of the instruction book. Two hundred and fifty nine pages and three thousand eight hundred and three Lego pieces later, he was finished. What dedication! I had to remind him to drink and eat during the day and a half that he spent in his room, working away like a little elf.

			<title>A Tour of Homes part 11, The Mud Room.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Mudroom.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well podlisteners, it is time to continue with important vocabulary about the homes that we live in. There is one room which helps me keep the house both clean and organized. It's the mudroom. It's name suggests that it gets very dirty, muddy even. That only happens sometimes. The mudroom is the first room that you enter when you walk into the house from the garage. It is the place where you hang up your coats and jackets, store your shoes and boots, and even put your extra things away. In our house, the mudroom is just for the children. It is where all of their shoes, boots, coats and backpacks are. Before we had a mudroom, it was frustrating trying to locate an odd shoe, or a certain jacket, as they tended to get left anywhere in the house. Now the children know that this is the only place they can leave those important items. My husband actually made the wooden compartments where everything is stored. They are like heavy boxes of wood of different sizes stacked together. We call them 'cubbies'. Metal hooks are in the largest cubbies, and on them we hang coats and jackets. The floor is tile, the walls are painted, and we have a large mirror and a clock also in the room. There is a small mat for wiping our feet if they happen to be muddy, dusty, or wet. And there is a seating area (actually a shelf) where the kids can sit to put on shoes or take them off. So there you have it, the place that helps us stay organized, and keeps me from headaches.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Haiti, as you all know, has suffered a terrible catastrophe recently. The 12th of January, an earthquake hit the nation. It registered 7.0, and there were many after shocks, about 33. Many countries have given assistance and money to help the Haitian people. The greatest need is to find people in the rubble, and then to give medical assistance and basic food and water to those who are alive. One of the many problems faced by the international help groups is the difficulty of getting to the people who need help. With buildings and roads destroyed, it is hard to transport help and supplies. Another problem is that government and infrastructure are almost non-existed. The president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, has already visited Port-au-Prince, the devastated capital of Haiti, and pledged practical help. People will be evacuated to the border in order to receive medical attention and vaccines. The Dominican Republic will help to set up supplies of water and electricity, and also it will help to organize all of the international help. Because these two countries share the island of Hispaniola, many Haitians will flee to their neighboring country. The global response to this catastrophe has been enormous, but the needs are even greater.</p>

<p>4. The Red Cross and other organizations helped to evacuate the people.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The history of Haiti is fascinating. The Taino people were the original inhabitants. In 1492, when Columbus came to the 'New World', he discovered Hispaniola, claiming it for Spain. Spain profited from the gold mined in Hispaniola by natives who had become slaves. In 1592 Spain created a set of laws called the Laws of Burgos which forbade the maltreatment of natives. African slaves were imported for labor. Hispaniola became a popular destination and stop-over for pirates. In 1697, a treaty was signed between the France and Spain, sharing Hispaniola; Spain would own the eastern side, and France the west. Subsequently, about 30,000 people from France emigrated; most of them came from Bordeaux. These settlers set up plantations of sugar, coffee, and indigo thanks to the skills of the African slaves. In 1791 the slaves revolted, slavery was abolished, and a long battle ending in 1804 brought about the independence and naming of Haiti. Since independence, Haiti has suffered cruel leaders, an attempt by France to re-take control, 32 coups, and international intervention to either change or help governments. The Haitian people are certainly resilient, and have had a tumultuous history. Their geographical location, and tremendous cultural mix give them the potential to be self sustaining and prosperous. Let us hope and pray that the devastation on Haiti can be quickly healed, and that its people can build a future with hope and peace.</p>

			<title>Mango languages.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Mango.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Mango languages is an internet language learning program(me) that we get for free through our local library. I want my children to learn Spanish very well, so&nbsp;the program&nbsp;will be a useful tool to use at home on our computer. My three boys are in a bilingual program at school. They have about three hours of classes in Spanish. Their knowledge of the language has really grown. At home, I try to speak to them in Spanish at least 50% of the time. I am proud to say that they understand everything that I say. What needs to happen now is the 'speaking' part of it. I decided at the beginning of the year to not only speak to them in Spanish, but also to help them respond in Spanish. They can do it themselves about half the time, but they need help to do it consistently. I am so excited to see their progress. My mother is also delighted whenever she hears them speak her native language. We will go to Spain this year for a month, so I think it is a good idea to prepare the kids. The more they can communicate with their family the more comfortable they will feel. I remember learning different languages in school, all those centuries ago, and, though we had lots of oral practice, it was very time consuming. Nowadays, with computers, we can practice at any time of day or night, listen, read, repeat, and even hear ourselves speak the foreign language. What an advantage!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Related vocabulary: a tool, not only....but also, time consuming.</p>
<p>1. To build the shelves you will need to buy some tools from the hardware store.</p>
<p>2. Tomatoes are so healthy; not only are they full of vitamins, but also they have fibre.</p>
<p>3. This job is really time consuming; I hope it is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>So, how does this Mango Languages system work? Well, in a similar fashion to other language programs, you log on, choosing a password. Then, you select your prefered level: beginners, intermediate, or advanced. You make sure that you are comfortable, because each session will last for about 15 to 20 minutes. Head phones are a good idea so you don't get distracted by surrounding noises. Then, the program takes you stage by stage, word by word, through a series of practices. You start at the easy stuff: letters, numbers, introductions etc. Then you move into slightly more complex practices of common sentences and dialogues, including questions and answers. It's all good stuff. I'm going to attach some kind of weekly reward for doing it. If they use the program consistently, we should see lots of progress within a few months. There are lots of these types of programs on the market, but because the local library is offering this for free, we will try it first and see how it works out. As, I'm sure you know, the key to language learning is being consistent. Let's see if my New Year's resolution of being more consistent pays off.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Practice of the subjunctive with related vocabulary.</p>
<p>1. If he was more consistent, he could complete his projects.</p>
<p>2. If the team practiced more, we would see progress in their performance.</p>
<p>3. If you finished your homework, you could go out and play.</p>

			<title>Tom yung goong.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Tom_yung_goong..wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>One of our favorite soups to eat is Tom Yung Goong. It is Thai soup that we first discovered in the local Thai restaurant. Someone recommended it to us. As with the rest of their food, the restaurant gives you the choice of the food being mild, medium, or spicy. We usually order the soup medium; I can't handle spicy. It's far too hot. This soup is a traditional recipe that is used to help people get over colds and flus in Thailand. It's ingredients are not only very healthy, but also extremely tasty, enough to make your mouth water. I decided to download the recipe and try to make it at home. I looked over the list of ingredients and got them out of the fridge. But I had one problem; an essential ingredient was missing. Instead of having fish sauce, I only had oyster sauce. &quot;Well, that will have to do,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;I'll just have to make it work.&quot; The&nbsp;way the soup is made is basically mixing the bouillon, then adding raw vegetables, and some briefly cooked shrimp. I suppose you can add anything you fancy. I didn't have any shrimp either, so I used cooked chicken that was nicely browned and tasty. I cut it into short chunks and added it to the finished product. It turned out to be a different sort of Tom Yung Goong, but actually, my family enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Vocabulary: to handle, the choice of, essential, raw.</p>
<p>1. I can't handle this situation; it is too much for me.</p>
<p>2. We had the choice of roast beef or fried chicken.</p>
<p>3. Good sleep is essential for optimal health.</p>
<p>4. I love to dip raw vegetables in ranch dressing.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>To make Tom Yung Goong you will need:</p>
<p>1-2 limes</p>
<p>lime leaves</p>
<p>Chile paste or flakes (to taste)</p>
<p>1 tablespoon of lemongrass</p>
<p>2 tablespoons of fish sauce</p>
<p>4 cups of water</p>
<p>&nbsp;fresh mushrooms, cilantro, green onions and whatever other vegetables you prefer</p>
<p>1-2 handfuls of raw shrimp.</p>
<p>Put the water, lime juice, chile, fish sauce, and a couple of lime leaves in a large saucepan. Bring to boil and then simmer for a few minutes. Add the shrimp and turn off the heat. Watch and stir the shrimp until they are cooked. They get rubbery very quickly, so they don't need to be cooked very long. When the shrimp are cooked, add the chopped, raw vegetables and serve. One of the things I like most about this soup is that it is so easy to make. It is extremely quick to make. You could actually make many variations of this soup, depending on your preferences.&nbsp;Would you prefer a fish based soup or chicken?&nbsp;Would you prefer asian type vegetables or regular. You could even make it more substantial by adding rice or noodles of some type. Yum! I actually looked for the fish sauce today in the local supermarket but they didn't have any. I need to find a specialty shop; it's hard to do so in this small town. I think that there must be a small asian supplier somewhere because we do have a small and varied asian community in town. I must ask where I can find the right ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: your preferences, specialty, substantial, supplier.</p>
<p>1. When you join an on-line dating service, you have to tell the company your preferences.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>When we travel, it is great to feel safe. If you travel by car, train, boat, or plane you want to feel secure. You don't want anything dangerous to happen, do you? One of the safest ways of traveling is by plane. It is true. Just think about it. There is not much that you can crash into. Other planes are easy to avoid, and birds don't cause a problem for a big, metal airplane. It seems a little scary to be flying around, thousands of feet up in the air, with nothing between you and the ground but thin air. But, you have to believe the statistics. Flying is much safer than driving. When you drive, there is a false sense of security. You feel that you are totally in control, and we know that that is not quite true. There are many other factors involved that can either make it safe or dangerous on the road, like other people. You don't know if the other people on the road are safe drivers or not. So, what do you do to stay safe? Drive defensively is the answer. Do all that you can to keep your distance from other cars. And stay alert! Keep your car in good condition, and make sure that everything works properly, especially the brakes. But, what can you do about safety on planes? Though they are one of the safest ways to travel, occasionally there can be a concern.</p>

When we travel, it is great to feel safe. If you travel by car, train, boat, or plane you want to feel secure. You don't want anything dangerous to happen, do you? One of the safest ways of traveling is by plane. It is true. Just think about it. There is not much that you can crash into. Other planes are easy to avoid, and birds don't cause a problem for a big, metal airplane. It seems a little scary to be flying around, thousands of feet up in the air, with nothing between you and the ground but thin air. But, you have to believe the statistics. Flying is much safer than driving. When you drive, there is a false sense of security. You feel that you are totally in control, and we know that that is not quite true. There are many other factors involved that can either make it safe or dangerous on the road, like other people. You don't know if the other people on the road are safe drivers or not. So, what do you do to stay safe? Drive defensively is the answer. Do all that you can to keep your distance from other cars. And stay alert! Keep your car in good condition, and make sure that everything works properly, especially the brakes. But, what can you do about safety on planes? Though they are one of the safest ways to travel, occasionally there can be a concern.

2. You should avoid that part of town; it's dangerous.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>The other day, my friend Nataliya invited me to go cross country skiing with her. We don't see eachother very much, so I&nbsp;was happy&nbsp;to go. &quot;Julia can babysit your two youngest, if you like, and we can leave at about ten o'clock.&quot; Julia is her eighteen year old daughter who often babysits my children. &quot;It's okay, Nataliya,&quot; I said, &quot;I think I'll take the kids with me.&quot; There was a pause on the phone, &quot;Okay,&quot; she replied, &quot;if you're sure, it's up to you.&quot; Nataliya also has a ten year old boy, so her plan was for the boys to play. Bringing all the kids changed the plans a bit. I packed our sled in the car, extra gloves, hats, and even slippers to warm up cold feet after the fun. The seven of us squeezed into the car and made our way to Leavenworth. The journey takes about half an hour, and before we knew it, we were at the cross country and skate skiing area. We got out of the car and looked around. The place was empty. It was cold, crisp, and sunny, the perfect conditions to ski a little, and to pull the kids on the sled. There was just one problem, Nataliya had brought the wrong skis, so we could only use my rentals. Oops. &quot;No problem,&quot; I said, &quot;we can take turns, and the kids can pull eachother on the sled.&quot; So that is exactly what we did. Everyone had a good workout, and a good slippery time.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Related vocabulary: to pack, to take turns, slippery, crisp.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>To pack: You need to pack plenty of clothes for the journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were packed into the car like sardines.</p>
<p>To take turns: We took turns throwing the ball.</p>
<p>Slippery: The icy pavement was too slippery to walk on.</p>
<p>Crisp: The autumn mornings are lovely and crisp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The apple was perfect: juicy, firm, and crisp.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>After we had walked a short way through the forest, along the ski tracks, Nataliya took her turn with the skis and disappeared further into the forest. I stayed behind with the children who found a large snow hill to play on. They marched to the top of it, and threw snow balls down at whoever was unlucky enough to be at the bottom. They played and played until they were tired. I had to supervise a little so they wouldn't do anything dangerous, but they couldn't get up to much trouble, so I relaxed and wandered around the area, enjoying the scenery. It was a clear day; the sun was quite intense, and because there hadn't been any fresh snow for a few days, there were ice crystals all over the place. Every step made a loud crunch, and every limb of tree or branch of bush reflected the light. Even though I only have a wimpy camera, I took it out to capture some of the beauty around me. I kept trying to zoom in closely to some of the ice covered plants, but the photos would always get blurry. &quot;I need to get myself a decent camera for close-ups,&quot; I thought to myself while I snapped away. After a while, Nataliya came back, and it was my turn to cross country ski. I'm just a beginner, so I slipped and slid all over the place. Back at the car, we had hot chocolate and something to eat. We warmed up as we drove home; the children were quiet while my friend and I chatted. After reviewing the photos at home, I realised that some of them had turned out well, showing the ice crystals of that wintry forest.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;It's that time of year again. I find myself rushing around with lists of things to do. I need to get the Christmas cards written and sent out to my list of friends and family. This year, we decided to send a family photo, which is what a lot of people do in this area. The photo is sometimes a Winter scene of the family next to some trees covered with snow. Or, you might get a family holiday picture that was taken in the Summer. These types of Christmas photos can be designed and printed very easily in places like Walmart. Well, there is a Walmart just around the corner from us, so I find myself there every two or three days. I went there yesterday to get the Christmas cards done. I took a little, plastic device called a 'Cruzer' which stores pictures or other information from your computer. I went to the photo area of the store and waited in line to use one of the machines. I must say, these machines are very cool. You can plug in one of many different storage devices, and print out photos, documents, calendars, key chains, and even permanent stickers for your cups. If you want to give Grandma a coffee mug with a picture of her grandchildren on it, then, that is the machine that you need to use. The lady in front of me finished and I touched the screen to start the process, putting in the&nbsp;Cruzer at the same time. I waited, and waited, and waited. Nothing happened. I examined the Cruzer and realized that it's edges were too big.&nbsp;The part of it that inserts could not go in properly. Hmmm.&nbsp;My only option was to buy another storage device.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary and expressions: a scene, a device, to find oneself...</p>

<p>The artist's new picture was a Western scene of cowboys and horses.</p>
<p>The calculator is such a useful device. I can add up my expenses so quickly!</p>
<p>I find myself dreaming of a beach holiday quite often.</p>
<p>They found themselves lost in the cave and without a flashlight.</p>
<p>He found himself locked out of his house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so I needed to buy another small storage device so I could download my photos onto it, go back to Walmart, and upload them into the printing machine. At least I was in the right place to buy a storage device. I either needed to buy something similar to a Cruzer, which is, wait for this, a flash memory data storage with a USB interface, or, more simply, a USB flash drive. Or, I could opt for a memory chip. So, I bought the latter. Gosh, I really need to learn more about computers; the vocabulary seems to be from another planet! Let's just look at the USB flash drive and try to understand it's title. USB is short for Universal Serial Bus; it is the standard connection between a computer and other devices, such as a mouse, or a digital camera. Okay, so what does flash memory mean? It means computer storage that you can erase and reprogram. It replaces a floppy disc, which, as you probably remember, was a disc just like a CD. Flash drives are tiny and can be carried conveniently, even in your pocket. I came back to Walmart after downloading my pictures, and slipped the memory chip into the machine without any problems. I scanned through the photos, chose the one I wanted, added a Christmas message, and printed out thirty of them. Simple! The next time I will know which storage device to use. </p>

			<title>Goodwill snowmen.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Goodwill_snowmen.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>This morning, I went into the kitchen and checked the outside thermometer; it was two degrees. Two degrees! Now <em>that </em>is cold! I made my coffee and looked out of the window. It was still dark, dark and freezing. It's a good job I have my coffee; otherwise I would stay in bed. But there are bright and pretty parts to Winter, even on a dark morning. As I walked around our quiet house, I saw our Christmas lights outside that twinkled all different colours/colors. I went into the lounge and plugged in the Christmas tree. I smiled to see all of its pretty details. As I walked past the stairs I looked up at the wreath that I put up yesterday. It is a length of artificial greenery, that goes all the way up the stairs. Every three feet or so, there is a red bow. Then, I realized that there were faces smiling at me. Lots of them. All up the stairs, in between the wood of the banister, are snowmen and Christmas bears, all looking out with big smiles. I collect them. Some of them are a few years old, and some are quite new. They are all different sizes and shapes, colors/colours and textures, but they are all cuddly and cute. I tell people that I decorate the house for the children because they love it, but of course, I do it for myself as well. I'm a child at heart. </p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Vocabulary: wreath, banister, to twinkle, otherwise.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>That lady makes wreaths for every season, but her Christmas wreaths are quite spectacular.</p>
<p>Hold onto the banister; the stairs are slippery.</p>
<p>We looked out over the cityscape and watched the lights twinkle.</p>
<p>Use an oven mitt, otherwise you might burn yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>My yearly tradition of buying Christmas soft toys leads me to a place called Goodwill. It is a second hand shop that sells everything from clothes to televisions, furniture to ornaments. It has a large stock of the toys I look for. There is usuallly a huge wire box full of snowmen and bears, so you have to dig in and rummage through them until you find what you want. Each year, I buy two or three because, invariably, a snowman will get lost, and a couple will break. That is usually the result of my kids using them as footballs... It's a great place to shop if you want to save money. I have often bought Winter snow clothes for my children, such as boots, hats, gloves, and even snow pants in Goodwill, as well as other items during the year. Instead of spending two to three hundred dollars on their clothes for the season, I will spend only about fifty. Now <em>that</em> is a good deal! And, believe me, I don't buy the rubbish either. If you are willing to spend some time looking and searching, you can find clothes that are 'next to new' which means barely used. But yesterday when I went there, I wasn't looking for clothes; I was on a mission to find Christmas bears. After rummaging around for a few minutes in this huge box, I found four perfect individuals: two lady bears with pretty dresses, one tiny snowman, and a little, brown bear with a sweater and a hat who looked like he needed a good home.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Beginners.
This morning, I went into the kitchen and checked the outside thermometer; it was two degrees. Two degrees! Now that is cold! I made my coffee and looked out of the window. It was still dark, dark and freezing. It's a good job I have my coffee; otherwise I would stay in bed. But there are bright and pretty parts to Winter, even on a dark morning. As I walked around our quiet house, I saw our Christmas lights outside that twinkled all different colours/colors. I went into the lounge and plugged in the Christmas tree. I smiled to see all of its pretty details. As I walked past the stairs I looked up at the wreath that I put up yesterday. It is a length of artificial greenery, that goes all the way up the stairs. Every three feet or so, there is a red bow. Then, I realized that there were faces smiling at me. Lots of them. All up the stairs, in between the wood of the banister, are snowmen and Christmas bears, all looking out with big smiles. I collect them. Some of them are a few years old, and some are quite new. They are all different sizes and shapes, colors/colours and textures, but they are all cuddly and cute. I tell people that I decorate the house for the children because they love it, but of course, I do it for myself as well. I'm a child at heart. 
Grammar notes.
Vocabulary: wreath, banister, to twinkle, otherwise.
Exs:
That lady makes wreaths for every season, but her Christmas wreaths are quite spectacular.
Hold onto the banister; the stairs are slippery.
We looked out over the cityscape and watched the lights twinkle.
Use an oven mitt, otherwise you might burn yourself.
Advanced.
My yearly tradition of buying Christmas soft toys leads me to a place called Goodwill. It is a second hand shop that sells everything from clothes to televisions, furniture to ornaments. It has a large stock of the toys I look for. There is usuallly a huge wire box full of snowmen and bears, so you have to dig in and rummage through them until you find what you want. Each year, I buy two or three because, invariably, a snowman will get lost, and a couple will break. That is usually the result of my kids using them as footballs... It's a great place to shop if you want to save money. I have often bought Winter snow clothes for my children, such as boots, hats, gloves, and even snow pants in Goodwill, as well as other items during the year. Instead of spending two to three hundred dollars on their clothes for the season, I will spend only about fifty. Now that is a good deal! And, believe me, I don't buy the rubbish either. If you are willing to spend some time looking and searching, you can find clothes that are 'next to new' which means barely used. But yesterday when I went there, I wasn't looking for clothes; I was on a mission to find Christmas bears. After rummaging around for a few minutes in this huge box, I found four perfect individuals: two lady bears with pretty dresses, one tiny snowman, and a little, brown bear with a sweater and a hat who looked like he needed a good home.

Grammar notes.
Vocabulary: to rummage (around), rubbish/ garbage, next to new.

I thought the film was rubbish; really, I was very disappointed.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I took a trip to&nbsp;Seattle last week for an appointment, and to do some shopping. I had arranged for my mother to pick up my kids from school, and stay with them until my husband got home from work. So, I was free for the day. Luckily, we have no snow yet, so the towns and highways are still clear and dry. Driving from here to Seattle takes about three hours, so, there and back, you are on the road for six hours. It sounds crazy to drive six hours for a brief visit. Mind you, Seattle is a beautiful city with everything imaginable available. There are many products and facilities that you just can't get in a small, rural town, so sometimes a trip to the big city is necessary. I don't go there as often as I would like, so I decided to treat myself to a day away. Another good thing about taking that road trip is the scenery. It is breathtaking. Most of the journey between Wenatchee and Seattle is through forest. You must go over one of the mountain passes that take you&nbsp;through the Cascade Mountain Range, and then you drop down towards sea level where you find the city. I am not used to driving in busy Seattle traffic. You have to be alert and keep your eyes peeled. Ironically, in the middle of the busiest traffic, two of my sons called me from their school, &quot;Mum, I forgot to bring my homework to class. Can you bring it in?&quot; and &quot;Mum, we're low on lunch money. Could you come in a bring a check?&quot; Sorry boys, Mum is unavailable, she's taking the day off, she is out of the office!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Vocabulary: an appointment, to arrange, available, to keep one's eyes peeled.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>I have three appointments today, one with the doctor, one with the dentist, and one with a chiropractor.</p>
<p>I arranged a get together with some friends. We had lunch and did some flower arrangements.</p>
<p>The receptionist told me that the boss is unavailable right now; he's in a meeting.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled; if we're lucky, we'll see a deer or two in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I had a great time in Seattle. I did some shopping in one of my favorite stores, an international import store that carries typical English foods: baked beans, digestive biscuits, and lots of different chocolates. It makes me feel connected with England when I go there, and when I get home, my children always look curiously in the bag at the products that their mum used to eat as a child. Well, I unfortunately, shopped for too long, and so, was late for my appointment. But the day was perfect for this time of year. Seattle, as you probably know is very, very rainy. But this day was perfectly clear, sunny, and the views of the Olympian mountains was spectacular. My day came quickly to an end and I headed home. I had to go East, back through the Cascades. In a town called Cle-Elum, I decided to stop, stretch my legs, and have a bite to eat. I went to the Cottage Cafe. It is a local favorite. It is a combination of casual restaurant, cafe, and truck stop. It has low ceilings, wood everywhere, and the smell of fresh food and coffee. I ordered a 'chop chop' salad which had a bit of everything in it. Typically, it was huge; I couldn't finish it. But I was satisfied. I warmed myself up with a cup of coffee and chatted a little with the waitress. &quot;It is always really clean in here,&quot; I said, remembering the times I had been there before and thought the same thing. &quot;Thankyou, we try our best,&quot; she said while wiping down the glass of a pie display. It was a cosy stop for me. The hum of conversation, the wood cabin feel, the cleanliness, and the good food, had all made me feel at home. I noticed two wooded plaques on the wall. One said, &quot;Freshly baked pies,&quot; and the other said, &quot;Home cook'n&quot;. Yes, this place is definitely a good American road-side restaurant.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like beans?&quot; Answer: &quot;Nope!&quot; &quot;Yep!&quot;</p>

			<title>Black Friday.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/black_friday_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Black Friday is the name of the day after Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is the fourth Thursday of the month of November, and Black Friday is the following day. It is one of the biggest shopping days of the year. Stores open at 5am, and some even open at midnight. Typically, the shops are packed with people. It is a stressful event, and often, in the newspaper the next day there are stories of conflicts and fights. Too many people in a limited space, all trying to get the same cheap products, is a recipe for disaster. But, for a lot of people, it is worth it. They get all of their Christmas shopping done in one day, and, they believe, they save a lot of money. What a good deal! Presents, Christmas cards, wrapping paper, stocking stuffers, and decorations, can all be found and purchased. You have to be a committed shopper to get up early and squeeze through all of the crowded shops, especially after Thanksgiving. After celebrating the night before with friends and family, all the food, and all the clean-up, it is quite exhausting to get up at four thirty in the morning, throw on some jeans, and head out into the frosty darkness. But, every year more and more people do it. You suffer for a day, and then it is over, mission accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Vocabulary: stocking stuffers, a good deal, crowded, conflict.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>Stocking stuffers are the little presents that go in the Christmas stockings.</p>
<p>I bought those jeans at half price. What a good deal!</p>
<p>The shop was so crowded that I could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>I don't like conflict. I avoid it at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The first time I heard the name 'Black Friday' was a few days ago. I had never heard it before. A friend of mine explained to me that it is the official name for the shopping day after Thanksgiving. When I heard it, I was immediately reminded of 'The Black Death', when Europe suffered the effects of the Black Plague. Well, this is slightly different; okay, it's very different. It is a huge shopping day that designed to move shops financially from being in the red, to being in the black. That means that they will finish the year with a profit, and not a loss. Hence the word 'black'. The name started on the East Coast back in the 1960's in Philadelphia. There would be so much traffic on the streets that the name developed. There are well advertised incentives to bring shoppers in. Two of these are 'doorbuster' deals and 'loss leaders'. A doorbuster deal is a limited amount of very discounted items. After a certain time, the items will return to a regular price. Also a loss leader is a product that the shop sells at a loss in order to encourage shoppers. It could be something like ketchup, mayonnaise, light bulbs, or actually anything. Once the people are inside, they end up buying something else, and that way, the shop makes a profit. These good deals have a negative side to them aswell, though. People can go a&nbsp;bit crazy and get aggressive, even violent. There are&nbsp;cases of fights and even shootings on Black Friday. It's amazing what shopping will do to some people.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: official, to remind, to suffer the effects, to be in the red/ black.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>It's official. The divorce papers were signed yesterday.</p>
<p>That young man reminds me of his grandfather in his looks and actions.</p>
<p>The workers suffered the effects of the polluted air in the factory.</p>
<p>Previously the store was&nbsp;in the black, but this year it is in the red.&nbsp;</p>

			<title>Hot tub heaven.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Cold fingers, cold toes, chilly shoulders, and a cold nose. When the weather gets chilly, sometimes you feel as if the inside of your body is as cold as your extremities. Some how, putting on lots of clothes isn't enough. You long to get into a deep, hot bath. That is our plan this Winter. We bought ourselves a very early Christmas present that, I'm sure, we will enjoy for years and years. It's a hot tub. I wasn't familiar with hot tubs until I came to Wenatchee, and got in a few during the first two Winters. That was a long time ago. My first experience was that they were too hot; I couldn't stay in them for very long. However, you can personalize your experience by adjusting the temperature so it is exactly what you want. There is a huge variety of tubs on the market. Some are just like big, hot baths. Others are the Jacuzzi variety that have jets of water for massaging. That is the kind that we bought. My husband tends to get tension in his neck and upper back, so this is the perfect solution. There are other benefits aswell. Our hot tub focuses time on family. The whole family can get in and spend some relaxing time together with no distractions, - no tv, no computers, no video games. You can float around, relax, and chat. Another benefit is being outside and enjoying nature. The first time I got in the tub was at 7am on Saturday. The kids were still asleep, so my husband and I quietly sneaked outside and got in. It was raining softly, there was a little mist over the lawn, and it was perfectly fresh and quiet. Wow. We giggled like children as we sat back and relaxed. This could become a daily habit.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Related vocabulary: to personalize, to adjust, to tend to, a benefit.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>He personalized his hat by having his name sewn on it.</p>
<p>I adjusted the oven temperature so the turkey wouldn't burn.</p>
<p>He tends to shout when he speaks, but his wife tends to whisper.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of exercise is improved circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The hot tub that we know today was invented by an Italian family, the Jacuzzis, back in the sixties. They had immigrated to California and were responsible for inventing the first enclosed cabin monoplane. In the fifties, they invented the first hydrotherapy pump which sold to&nbsp;hospitals and schools.&nbsp;As engineering ran in their family, Roy, a third generation family member, invented the whirlpool in 1968. Those clever Italians. But we know that man's knowledge of the healing properties of water dates from pre-history. Early man utilized hot springs and pools. The ancient Egyptians used hot baths for therapy around 2000 BC, and about 600 B.C King Phraortes of ancient Persia built one of the first known hot tubs. Asian cultures from Japan to China celebrate water; the Japanese even have a saying that a person with a mind like water lives in harmony with the universe. The Greeks and Romans were known to place buildings around natural hot springs. In England, in the city of Bath, there are fully functioning Roman baths with multiple hot tubs and bathing areas. Infact, the first whirlpool was named 'Roman'. So, there you have it, lots of facts about the global appreciation of water. So, whether it's for an apres-ski warm-up, or just for relaxation, you can be sure that the hot tub is where you will find me.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Vocabulary and expressions: to be responsible for, enclosed, properties, to utilize.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>On this tour, you are responsible for your own safety.</p>
<p>Her rose garden is a beautiful, enclosed, secret place.</p>
<p>One of the properties of milk is calcium.</p>
<p>The solar panels can be utilized every day.</p>
<p><em>Practice of the preterite:</em></p>
<p>To build: The Romans built cities all over their empire.</p>
<p>To sell: He sold newspapers on the street for forty(fourty) years.</p>
<p>To say: They said they would meet us at 3pm.</p>
<p>To date: They dated eachother for six months.</p>

Another benefit is being outside and enjoying nature. The first time I got in the tub was at 7am on Saturday. The kids were still asleep, so my husband and I quietly sneaked outside and got in. It was raining softly, there was a little mist over the lawn, and it was perfectly fresh and quiet. Wow. We giggled like children as we sat back and relaxed. This could become a daily habit.

&nbsp;The hot tub that we know today was invented by an Italian family, the Jacuzzis, back in the sixties. They had immigrated to California and were responsible for inventing the first enclosed cabin monoplane. In the fifties, they invented the first hydrotherapy pump which sold to&nbsp;hospitals and schools.&nbsp;As engineering ran in their family, Roy, a third generation family member, invented the whirlpool in 1968. Those clever Italians. But we know that man's knowledge of the healing properties of water dates from pre-history. Early man utilized hot springs and pools. The ancient Egyptians used hot baths for therapy around 2000 BC, and about 600 B.C King Phraortes of ancient Persia built one of the first known hot tubs. Asian cultures from Japan to China celebrate water; the Japanese even have a saying that a person with a mind like water lives in harmony with the universe. The Greeks and Romans were known to place buildings around natural hot springs. In England, in the city of Bath, there are fully functioning Roman baths with multiple hot tubs and bathing areas. Infact, the first whirlpool was named 'Roman'. So, there you have it, lots of facts about the global appreciation of water. So, whether it's for an apres-ski warm-up, or just for relaxation, you can be sure that the hot tub is where you will find me.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>We have a mouse in our garage. There might be more than one. The one I have seen is small, grey, and causes a lot of mess. As much as I love animals, I'm afraid we have to put down a mousetrap. My husband bought a box of traps a long time ago, some of which we have used. So, he prepared the trap, put some cheese in it, and put it on the floor of the garage. My youngest son, Robert, wanted to make his own trap. He went into the garage and bashed about for a while, moving things, and arranging his special trap. &quot;Mum, come and see,&quot; he said after a few minutes. He had&nbsp;the lid&nbsp;of a metal cage propped up with a stick which was attached to a string. Under the lid was enough bird seed to feed a hundred mice. Ingenious! &quot;I'm just going to wait here until the mouse comes, then I'll pull the string and trap it!&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; I said, and walked back to the kitchen. About ten minutes later he came back into the house to watch cartoons. Waiting for a mouse is not that entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary and expressions: to prop up, some of which, I'm afraid.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>The workmen propped up the fence posts before they secured them.</p>
<p>I bought five pounds of bananas, some of which are ripe and ready to eat.</p>
<p>I'm afraid we will have to cancel the barbecue; there is a storm coming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The other day, I walked into our garage to put some cardboard boxes in the recycling bins, when I noticed a lot of bird seed on the floor. I looked up on the shelf above, and saw that a big bag of seed that we keep for the birds in the Winter, had a hole in it. As I looked around, I realized that the seed had been spread all over the shelf. This was not a case of an accidental tear in the bag; the hole had been made by an animal, a small one. My husband had warned me that as Autumn turns to Winter, small animals will try and get into the house, and will do so if we leave doors open for too long. This creature must be a mouse, and usually where there is a mouse, there are mice. The little thing must think that he is in heaven. He is in a nice, warm garage, and has a huge bag of bird seed all for himself and his family. My son, Robert, was very excited about seeing the mouse, so I picked him up, and very quietly and slowly walked into the garage, staring at the shelf. And would you know, we saw the little grey mouse running back and forth between the seed bag and a little hole in the wall. Robert and I looked at eachother and grinned with excitement. The mouse actually stood up on its hind legs and looked at us for a few seconds. It looked so tiny and cute. I actually wanted to let it live in the garage for the Winter, but I realize how unsanitary it is. I certainly didn't want to encourage mice to live in our house. That could end up being a real problem.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>I drove around town today, looking for 'Hello Kitty' posters. I couldn't find any. I was so frustrated. I have a project going on at home that I really want to finish. Last week I painted my children's rooms, and now I am looking for accessories like pictures, lamps, and rugs to make the bedrooms comfortable. I don't actually like shopping because most of the time I'm in a hurry. But, I'm making a special effort to get things just right. Robert is into fishing, so I would like to get a poster of someone fly fishing in a mountain stream. My oldest two are into music, architecture, and mythology, so I'm sure there are some interesting elements that I could add to their rooms. Domini's room is actually in need of posters to break up all of the pink of the room. The color I chose is exceptionally pink; a little overpowering. She thinks it's great. It's her 'girly' get-a-way from the boys and their stuff. &quot;No boys allowed,&quot; is her rule for her bedroom, and of course the &quot;no girls allowed&quot; rule applies to the other bedrooms. At night, though, when it gets dark, and they know that it's bedtime, you can guarantee that two or three of them will be sleeping in the same bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Vocabulary: accessories, to be in a hurry, element, a get-a-way.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>Those pillows and pictures are perfect accessories for this room.</p>
<p>Gosh, I'm always in a hurry. I feel like a busy mouse!</p>
<p>The marriage scene was a necessary element in the film.</p>
<p>The spa was a perfect weekend get-a-way for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Don't ask me why I decided to spend a week painting the kids' bedrooms. The project doesn't sound too intimidating does it? Projects never do, though, do they? They just get more involved and trickier as time goes on. In retrospect, I can say that the rooms definitely look better; it was time that they had a fresh coat of paint. However, my back, my hands, and my patience are all the worse for wear. I had originally wanted to present new and improved bedrooms to my kids all at once, which would have meant getting all of the painting and decorating done in one day, - impossible. The 'extreme make-over' programs that we have on television inspired me too much. If I had made over four bedrooms in one day, I would have ended up in hospital! But, my kids know me. They know that I try my best, and they also know to <em>not </em>say anything if I give them 'the look'. You know, the look that means, &quot;I'm exhausted, back off, you don't know what my day has been like, don't even think about moaning or asking me for&nbsp;anything ...etc...etc.&quot; Anyone who has had a mother will understand what 'the look' is. But, the worst is over; the work has been done, and is just about finished. I did some touch-ups today, and will probably do more tomorrow to make my little puppies proud.</p>

<p>After fixing the appliances in the kitchen, all of my tools were the worse for wear; they were worn out and bent.</p>
<p>You don't need to do much to your new house. A fresh coat of paint is really all it needs.</p>
<p>Behold my new and improved grandma. She's lost thirty pounds, had a facelift, dyed her hair red, and bleached her teeth.</p>
<p>Back off mister! Take one step closer, and I'll call the police!</p>
<p>I touched up the paint in the hall, then I touched up my makeup because I was going on a date.</p>

<p>It's my favorite time of year, Autumn. I love this season so much that I could burst into song about all the colors, the smells, the angle of the sun, the pumpkins etc etc, but I don't want to bore you, plus, I don't sing very well. I will tell you about two great things that you can do with leaves. You can rake together a big pile of leaves and jump into them, with or without friends. Or you can do something a bit more artistic. I did this a few years ago with my kids, and it turned out very well. You find&nbsp;some freshly fallen leaves,&nbsp;some that&nbsp;are quite wide, not skinny. You take them home and lightly wash them. Dry them carefully with a paper towel and leave them on the countertop in the kitchen. In a saucepan, on a very low heat, grate your favorite chocolate. Let it melt a little, then take it off the heat and stir until it is all soft. With your finger, rub a tiny amount of oil on the underside of the leaf, then spread the chocolate. Put the leaves on a plate and pop them into the fridge. After about 20 minutes or half an hour they will be ready. Simply peel off the leaves, and you have a perfect chocolatey replica, great for decorating a cake.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Vocabulary: a pile, to grate, a replica, to rub, to peel.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>At work today, I had a huge pile of papers to read. It was so depressing!</p>
<p>Just before you serve the spaghetti, grate the parmesan cheese on top.</p>
<p>My grandma has a replica of the Sphinx in her lounge.</p>
<p>The boy fell out of the tree, and ran home crying and rubbing his elbow.</p>
<p>The mandarin oranges you can buy now are so easy to peel.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The other day I was pulling into the parking lot outside of the local library, when I looked over to the nearby park and saw a lot of activity. There were all sorts of people there, some of them working. It is the middle of Autumn, and you can be sure that anywhere that there are trees, there will be lots of leaves to clean up. The park is one of the oldest in Wenatchee, so the trees are some of the biggest. I got out of the car and walked past a huge pile of leaves.Ooo, it was so tempting to jump in them, but I didn't. There was a loud, whooshing noise in the air; it was the sound of the leaf-blowers. Three men, dressed in brown, were moving slowly through the park, blowing the leaves into piles which were then going to be bagged up and taken away. What would happen if the leaves weren't removed? They would eventually rot, forming a slimey layer on top of the grass. This wouldn't be a problem if they could dry out, crumble, and feed the ground. Soon, you see, we will get snow, and if a thick layer of snow sits on a layer of slimey leaves, the grass underneath will die. So, as part of the local council's cleaning machine, paid for by wonderful tax dollars, the group of happy men, spent the day blowing leaves all over the place.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>There are signs of the financial crisis in different parts of the town where I live. We hear on the news about people losing their jobs and their houses. Certain shops have closed, and so the buidings are empty. But, in another way, there is growth in the town. There is a lot of new buildings that are almost finished. Just down the road from my house, a new hotel is almost ready.

When I had gone in the buiding, which was poorly lit, like an old garage, I was immediately annoyed that I had taken the trip. Why had I bothered? It looked just like a yard sale, with cheap items badly arranged on shelves and on the floor. The advertising had caught my attention and made me curious, so I had taken the time to drive there. But this new 'going out of business' sign must be for a different business. I didn't think anything else about it, until, a couple of months ago, I saw the same sign, held up by a pretty young woman in the center of town. &quot;Well, they haven't gone out of business yet!&quot; I said to myself. Then, just a couple of days ago, another man, quite close to our street, was waving a sign that said the same thing. I wondered what the other passersby thought. Are they curious about the business?

There are signs of the financial crisis in different parts of the town where I live. We hear on the news about people losing their jobs and their houses. Certain shops have closed, and so the buidings are empty. But, in another way, there is growth in the town. There is a lot of new buildings that are almost finished. Just down the road from my house, a new hotel is almost ready. I drive past it most days when I bring my children home from school, and we comment on the progress. &quot;Hey, mum, they've put in the windows!

			<title>Hello Kitty invasion.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>There is an invasion going on in our house. It started out as an unnoticed thing, but it has grown to huge proportions. Every room of my house is affected. Every corner shows a sign of this invasion. Even my friends and neighbors have mentioned it. And the scary thing is, is that it is unstoppable. It is Hello Kitty. Every time I open a cupboard, some Hello Kitty thing falls out. When I go to the shoe closet to get my sneakers, I have to shake them upside down, not because there might be a spider inside one of the shoes. Oh, no. But, because there might be a small, hard, Hello Kitty figure hiding inside. Even when I eat, I have no rest. The Hello Kitty cups, plates, and cutlery stare at me while my little girl eats away happily. The other day, when I was in the supermarket, I found myself humming a familiar tune. Can you guess what it is? It goes something like, &quot;Hello Kitty, it's a lovely day. We'll laugh and sing in a very happy way....&quot; and it never ends! Sometimes, when I'm in bed, trying to go to sleep, I see faces, of big, white, cute cats dancing about the room; it's terrifying! Will it ever stop? I don't think so. My daughter has a birthday coming up, and all of her friends have the same obsession. The day will be filled with Kitty!</p>

<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>Egypt is her obsession. Her whole house is filled with egyptian replicas.</p>
<p>He is such a happy little boy. He hums happy tunes all day long.</p>
<p>I want to go for a run, but I can't find my sneakers.</p>
<p>That home looks out of proportion; the garage is huge, but the house is small.</p>
<p>After the invasion of Spain by the Moors in 711, they stayed for 800 years!</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, it's not that scary, I just wanted to get your attention. Hello Kitty is, however, a part of the U.S culture now. Originally created by Ikuko Shimizu, this Japanese character has taken the world by storm, won the hearts of little girls everywhere, and created a profit of one billion dollars a year. Not bad for a little kitty! Her appeal is on many levels. First, she is just absolutely cute. Her pretty face, the bow in her hair, and her girly clothes, all go straight to the heart. Also, the stories of Hello Kitty take place in the context of friends and family, adventures and fun. So children feel happy and comfortable watching the movies or reading the books. She first came to the U.S in the form of a vinyl purse in 1976, two years after her creation in Japan. Now, there seems to be no end to the products that depict her character. Even expensive jewelery and clothes for women are quite common here in the United States. In Tokyo Japan, there is a place called Sanrio Puroland, where you can find Hello Kitty in all her glory. It is like a theme park that includes other japanese anime characters such as Pokemon. It's a big business. There are theme park rides, restaurants, musicals, and big gift shops. It's amazing how a well designed and appealing character can create such a&nbsp;globally successful business.</p>

<p>When my computer doesn't work, or when I cannot get a good internet connection, I miss podcasting. I'm sorry that I missed last week, but it was one thing after another with computers. Do you ever have problems with them? They are so useful sometimes, and then, at other times, they can be a real pain. Well, I suppose the reason for me missing a couple of podcasts has given me a story for this podcast. A week ago, I showed A Cup of English to a friend of mine. While we looked at the computer, the battery sign flashed once. I checked that the cable was plugged into the socket properly. But the sign kept on flashing, twice, three times. &quot;Battery failure, two minutes of power,&quot; it said. Then, &quot;Battery failure, thirty seconds of power.&quot; Then suddenly the screen went black. &quot;Oh, shoot!&quot; as they say around here in cowboy country. Well, off to the computer wizard it went the next day. At home, we have another computer, but it is a bit of a dinosaur. It is big, and slow, and seems to eat important information, just like a T-Rex eats meat. But at least I had a chance to do a podcast, <em>so I thought</em>. I happily turned it on, put in my password, selected the big E sign for the internet, but no luck! &quot;No connection available&quot; was the message it gave me. &quot;Sugar!&quot; as we say in England and a few other places. &quot;What on earth is wrong now?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Vocabulary: battery, to charge, failure, to plug in.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>We bought a new toy for Tommy, but we forgot to buy batteries.</p>
<p>The car battery needs to be charged; I think someone left a light on all night.</p>
<p>Lack of study will lead to failure on your exam.</p>
<p>Of course the tv is not working. You need to plug it in!</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The next day, when I woke up, there was a lot of noise in the neighborhood. I looked out of the window and saw lots of trucks of different kinds, a crew of workmen, a backhoe, and a roller. Hmm, interesting. I wondered what needed to be done. There didn't seem to be anything wrong with the road. Then, someone rang the door bell. &quot;Hello. I'm from the local council. We're putting in a drain because of the excess water that gathers on the street.&quot; I thanked the man for letting me know. Our cul-de-sac does get huge puddles when it rains, so what they were doing made sense. The trouble was, as they were digging, they cut the internet cable for our area. Oops! They notified us and fixed the problem, but not until a few days had passed. So, what was I going to do? A friend told me that the local library has internet access for one hour for free. Great! The problem was that I didn't have recording access, or my sound editing software. After the workman told me that they had fixed the internet cable, I tried to get on again, but no luck. Nothing! So, I jumped into action, called our internet provider, and a technician came to the house to see what was causing the problem. He looked here and there, pulled out wires and cables, and put them back. &quot;I think I've found the problem,&quot; he said. The plastic head of one of the tiny cables that plugs into the router kept on slipping out slightly, totally unnoticed by us. Oh my goodness! All this technology, and we depend on a little piece of plastic.</p>

			<title>H1N1.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/H1N1.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Have you had the flu this year? Do you know anyone who has had it? It can be a nasty illness. Usually you have a temperature, you feel weak, and sometimes you might have a cough also. There is a lot of talk about flus at the moment. You have probably heard about the new H1N1 flu. It seems to be scaring a lot of people. When I say that it is a new flu, what that means is that, though it is from the family of flus, it is slightly different than any that we are used to. It is cold and flu season here at the moment. Lots of children are staying home from school because they have a touch of this, or a touch of that. It's best to stay at home, get lots of rest, preferably stay in bed, and have nutritious drinks and food, if you feel like eating. Your body will fight the virus that you have, and it will eventually win. Thank goodness! Isn't it great that our bodies can do that! Doctors say, that to prevent illness there are some golden rules: wash your hands with soap and water regularly, avoid sick people, sleep well, eat well, and try not to touch door knobs and taps because they usually are covered in germs. Still, even if you do all these things, the viruses that float around in the air are difficult to avoid. Our local community has flu shots, or injections, every year. They say that the most vunerable people, such as the very young, the very old, and those who have weak immune systems, should have the shot. It is not a pleasant thing to have, but you can avoid a bad virus if you get the injection.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Related vocabulary: a virus, to float, to avoid, germs, immune system, a touch of (illness).</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I felt terrible for a week. I had some kind of virus, though I didn't know exactly what it was.</p>
<p>Look how the clouds float in the sky!</p>
<p>We avoid that area of town; it doesn't seem safe.</p>
<p>Wash your hands! They must be covered in germs!</p>
<p>His immune system must be weak because he gets one illness after another.</p>
<p>I have a touch of bronchitis; it's not too bad at the moment, and it's getting better.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The flu really has quite a history. Throughout history, humans have suffered because of various flus. One of the worst was the Spanish flu which caused the deaths of 100 million people around the time of the First World War. It didn't originate in Spain, and is only called the Spanish flu because Spain was the only country during&nbsp;the war that didn't have censorship in its newspapers.&nbsp;It is thought that the majority of those &nbsp;people who&nbsp;died, did so&nbsp;because of&nbsp;complications and infections after getting the flu. Now a days, we have access to antibiotics and better quality medicines and health treatment, so even if we get the flu, we can quickly intervene if our health gets worse. So, what is the panic about the H1N1? The World Health Organisation has called it a pandemic, which means that it has spread quickly all over the world. And, what does H1N1 mean, anyway? Well, flu viruses come from humans, pigs, and birds. Apparently, they all have two proteins on their surface, but each flu has a slightly different arrangement, and that is because the viruses can change or mutate. The H and the N are the first letters of the names of the proteins. It's fascinating, isn't it?

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Beginners.
Have you had the flu this year? Do you know anyone who has had it? It can be a nasty illness. Usually you have a temperature, you feel weak, and sometimes you might have a cough also. There is a lot of talk about flus at the moment. You have probably heard about the new H1N1 flu. It seems to be scaring a lot of people. When I say that it is a new flu, what that means is that, though it is from the family of flus, it is slightly different than any that we are used to. It is cold and flu season here at the moment. Lots of children are staying home from school because they have a touch of this, or a touch of that. It's best to stay at home, get lots of rest, preferably stay in bed, and have nutritious drinks and food, if you feel like eating. Your body will fight the virus that you have, and it will eventually win. Thank goodness! Isn't it great that our bodies can do that! Doctors say, that to prevent illness there are some golden rules: wash your hands with soap and water regularly, avoid sick people, sleep well, eat well, and try not to touch door knobs and taps because they usually are covered in germs. Still, even if you do all these things, the viruses that float around in the air are difficult to avoid. Our local community has flu shots, or injections, every year. They say that the most vunerable people, such as the very young, the very old, and those who have weak immune systems, should have the shot. It is not a pleasant thing to have, but you can avoid a bad virus if you get the injection.
Grammar notes.
Related vocabulary: a virus, to float, to avoid, germs, immune system, a touch of (illness).
Exs:
I felt terrible for a week. I had some kind of virus, though I didn't know exactly what it was.
Look how the clouds float in the sky!
We avoid that area of town; it doesn't seem safe.
Wash your hands! They must be covered in germs!
His immune system must be weak because he gets one illness after another.
I have a touch of bronchitis; it's not too bad at the moment, and it's getting better.
Advanced.
The flu really has quite a history. Throughout history, humans have suffered because of various flus. One of the worst was the Spanish flu which caused the deaths of 100 million people around the time of the First World War. It didn't originate in Spain, and is only called the Spanish flu because Spain was the only country during&nbsp;the war that didn't have censorship in its newspapers.&nbsp;It is thought that the majority of those &nbsp;people who&nbsp;died, did so&nbsp;because of&nbsp;complications and infections after getting the flu. Now a days, we have access to antibiotics and better quality medicines and health treatment, so even if we get the flu, we can quickly intervene if our health gets worse. So, what is the panic about the H1N1? The World Health Organisation has called it a pandemic, which means that it has spread quickly all over the world. And, what does H1N1 mean, anyway? Well, flu viruses come from humans, pigs, and birds. Apparently, they all have two proteins on their surface, but each flu has a slightly different arrangement, and that is because the viruses can change or mutate. The H and the N are the first letters of the names of the proteins. It's fascinating, isn't it? Many people have had the H1N1 flu and not realised it, thinking that it was a virus that they had had before. Well,&nbsp;I suppose we will get used to it, because it is here to stay, unfortunately. We can only do our best to stay healthy and clean, and follow the golden rules to avoid contracting the virus. Let's hope that we all stay healthy this year!

			<title>Digging trees on Sugar Loaf Mountain.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Digging.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>It's that time of year again. The days are rapidly getting colder. There is frost in the morning on the grass, the sun is mild, and the colors of the trees and plants are quickly changing. Around this time every year, my husband plans a trip up to a nearby mountain, called Sugar Loaf. What a pretty name! He goes there every year to dig up some trees, then he brings them home and plants them in the garden. You need a permit to do that. So he drives to the nearby town of Leavenworth which is close to the place where he gets the trees. There is a ranger station in Leavenworth where you can get all sorts of information about the wilderness area, camping, hiking, fishing, and the available trees. You must pay ten dollars per tree, and follow a map to a specific place where trees are going to be cleared. The mountain mainly has pine trees, Alpine Fir to be specific. Because the area where the trees are is quite high up, there is already snow up there, even though there is no snow in any towns yet. You must get wrapped up well, take good gloves, and maybe some hot chocolate in a thermos. Then, you park the truck, find the trees you want, and start the hard work of digging. I must say that it is always my husband who does the digging. Digging through snow, ice, earth, and roots is too much for me. But I help by wrapping up the root ball of the tree in burlap, a rough, degradable material. And then it is off to plant them at home.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Related vocabulary: to wrap, degradable, a thermos (flask).</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>About a week before Christmas, I try to get the presents wrapped.</p>
<p>We put our degradable kitchen waste in a pile in the garden.</p>
<p>We take hot coffee in a thermos flask when we go fishing in the mornings.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Two years ago, my husband dug up about twenty trees from Sugar Loaf Mountain. It took him the whole day to get there, dig the trees, load them up, and drive home. It really is a tremendous amount of work. He had gone with two friends, a couple who works in his office. It's important to have company when you do something like that, for safety mainly. If your truck&nbsp;were to break&nbsp;down, you would be in trouble. You don't necessarily get any cell phone reception up in that mountain, so you would have to walk a long, cold way back to civilization. It is also a bit of a scary ride up there. The road is narrow and very windy. When it is covered in snow and ice, it becomes dangerous and slippery. So, if you go with someone else, you are definitely safer, and you will have a much more pleasant time. The man who went with my husband is strong and really helped him dig. By the time they came home, they were tired but happy. There was no way that they could plant all of the new trees the same day because it was getting dark and they were exhausted. So, they did that the next day. So far, the trees have survived. Often when you transplant trees, about twenty percent of them die from shock, but we have been lucky and have not lost any of them. Because the growing season is much longer down here than up in the cold mountain, the Alpine Fir get tall quickly. We have put several near our fire pit, and plan on making the rest of our back garden into forest-like retreat.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>

			<title>An escaped Gecko in the house!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Escaped_Gecko.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>A couple of years ago, we bought a Leopard Gecko for our oldest son, Hudson. He didn't want any toys, just an animal. He is fascinated with reptiles and has read many books about them. So, we went to the pet shop and immediately found what we were looking for. A young, spotty, pretty Leopard Gecko, cool and dry to the touch, and easy to look after. It is surprising what you learn through your own children. I researched the Geckos a little, to make sure that his environment was as it should be. They need a ten to twenty gallon glass or plastic cage. They need a place to hide, some kind of paper or rock on the ground, a humid bed, a heat lamp, and several crickets or worms to eat every few days. They are nocturnal, so if you want to see them hunt and eat, it is best to feed them just before you go to bed. They are so interesting to watch when they hunt. They dart about, chasing their prey. They also lick the air to help them find the insects. After they have eaten, they will lick their lips, and their eyeballs! It sounds gross, but they are actually cute. As a pet owner, you can carry them around the house; they like the warmth of our bodies. However, they do move very fast, so it is best to keep them in their cages for safety. Another interesting fact about them is that they shed their skin and eat it! It supplies them with calcium. They are a very popular pet because they are very easy to take care of, they are quiet, and considered exotic because they come from Afghanistan, India, Iran, and Pakistan.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Expressions: it is/ was as it should be, to dart (about), prey.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The wedding was just as it should be, elegant, happy, and beautiful.</p>
<p>The fish dart about in the water; it is hard to see them when they move so fast.</p>
<p>The lion was looking for prey. It went down to the water hole and spotted a zebra.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Leopard Geckos are certainly fun to watch. It's just not much fun when one of them escapes in your house! Yesterday, I had decided to get some reading done. I have signed up for a college course which requires quite a bit of reading. A little girl friend had come over to play with my daughter, so I thought, while they played, I could read. A few minutes into their play, I got the sneaky feeling that they were up to no good; it was too quiet. Suddenly, breathlessly, Domini comes downstairs and says that Anthony, the Gecko, had got out of his cage. &quot;What?&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;And how on earth did that happen, Domini?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I don't know, Mum,&quot; she said, shrugging her shoulders and looking guilty. I raced upstairs and to my horror found that the cage was on the floor with the lid off, <em>and</em> that the bedroom door was open. He could be anywhere! Great! He's probably under <em>my</em> bed! I could just imagine hearing scratching in the middle of the night, and seeing him run across the floor, or worse, my bed! Well, I tried to control my imagination, and I got on with the job of looking for him. My son's bedroom was a terrible mess, so I had to pick everything up carefully, and tidy up very gently, keeping my eyes open for a little spotted head or tail. And, by the way, they drop their tails when they are scared. So I shuddered at the thought of finding a Gecko tail in my son's dirty laundry or in his pile of Pokemon cards. After an hour of moving furniture, and tidying up, I found the poor little thing, in a corner, behind some shelves. Because he was away from the heat lamp, he was cold and sleepy, so I could easily catch him. Thank Goodness! I can walk around barefoot in my house again. I'll have to read some other time.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Common expressions: to get a sneaky feeling, how/ what on earth?, to shrug one's shoulders.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I got a sneaky feeling that the water was left running all night. I checked, and the whole of downstairs had flooded!</p>
<p>How on earth are we going to replace that broken window tonight? It's freezing cold and snowing. What on earth were you thinking about playing golf inside the house?</p>
<p>The children didn't want to answer the question, so they kept shrugging their shoulders, as if they had no clue what was being asked.</p>

			<title>Robert's harvest.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Roberts_harvest.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>I walked into the kitchen this afternoon, and I found my son, Robert, climbing through the kitchen window. &quot;What on earth are you doing?&quot; I asked him. &quot;I wanted to open the window so I can pass you all my pumpkins.&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; I replied, still a bit confused about why he needed to climb through the window instead of just opening it. Anyway, he passed me all of his pumpkins, about eleven of them. He put them in the sink, washed them off, and then placed them on the mantlepiece as a decoration. He kept one of them in the kitchen. His plan was to open it, take out the seeds, and bake them. So that is what we did. He did most of the work. We have some little pumpkin knives that are not very sharp, but similar to miniature saws. They are good for cutting through the tough pumpkin skin. Next he took out the seeds and the gooey pulp. He picked out the seeds, put them in a pan of water, and washed them. When the pulp had been washed off, he dried the seeds in a paper towel, and put them on a metal baking tray.&nbsp;A sprinkle of salt, and into&nbsp;the oven they went, at 350 degrees. I actually forgot about them until I smelled something delicious. Luckily, they were not burnt. Yum, baked pumpkin seeds from our own garden! Well done, Robert.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Vocabulary: pulp, paper towel, baking tray. </p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I like to buy orange juice with no pulp.</p>
<p>If you spill that milk, don't use a kitchen towel. Please use a paper towel instead.</p>
<p>We put the cookie dough, spoonful by spoonful, on the baking tray.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>My son said to me yesterday that he wanted to pick his pumpkins. He had planted the seeds in early Summer, and much to my surprise, had had success. He had been shopping with me one day in June, and he saw an aisle with seeds of all kinds. The home store was gearing the sales around the garden, and planting vegetables. So he looked up and down the aisle. There were many kinds of seeds to choose from, but he stuck to the miniature and white pumpkins. He knew exactly what he wanted. &quot;Now, we have to follow the instructions properly, or they won't grow, okay Robert?&quot; I had said to him, knowing that he likes to do things his way, and not necessarily always the right way. &quot;Okay, Mum,&quot; he replied. When we got home, after unloading the car of all of our shopping, we headed straight out to the garden. He chose to plant the seeds in a circular, built up area of soil where we have lots of trees and bushes. In the middle of this area is a firepit. &quot;When we roast marshmallows over the firepit, we'll be able to look around and see pumpkins everywhere,&quot; he said excitedly as we opened the packets. However, he put &nbsp;both packets of seeds in one little hole. I told him that they probably wouldn't grow well at all and that we should follow the instructions, but he insisted on planting them his way. Well, wouldn't you know that out of the two of us, he is the one with the bumper harvest! So much for instructions!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Expressions:&nbsp; a bumper harvest/ crop, wouldn't you know, to my/his/our surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice of pluperfect.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>This year we had a bumper crop of tomatoes. The plants just kept producing and producing.</p>
<p>She bought a lottery ticket and, wouldn't you know, she won some money!</p>
<p>At first, the man and woman didn't like eachother at all. To our great surprise, they announced their engagement three months later.</p>
<p><strong>Pluperfect.</strong></p>
<p>He had planted many types of seeds, but had hardly harvested any crops.</p>
<p>Had he had enough of fighting, or did he want to box all night?</p>
<p>They had never been to Greece before; they had always stayed in the Americas.</p>

My son said to me yesterday that he wanted to pick his pumpkins. He had planted the seeds in early Summer, and much to my surprise, had had success. He had been shopping with me one day in June, and he saw an aisle with seeds of all kinds. The home store was gearing the sales around the garden, and planting vegetables. So he looked up and down the aisle. There were many kinds of seeds to choose from, but he stuck to the miniature and white pumpkins. He knew exactly what he wanted. &quot;Now, we have to follow the instructions properly, or they won't grow, okay Robert?&quot; I had said to him, knowing that he likes to do things his way, and not necessarily always the right way. &quot;Okay, Mum,&quot; he replied. When we got home, after unloading the car of all of our shopping, we headed straight out to the garden. He chose to plant the seeds in a circular, built up area of soil where we have lots of trees and bushes. In the middle of this area is a firepit. &quot;When we roast marshmallows over the firepit, we'll be able to look around and see pumpkins everywhere,&quot; he said excitedly as we opened the packets. However, he put &nbsp;both packets of seeds in one little hole. I told him that they probably wouldn't grow well at all and that we should follow the instructions, but he insisted on planting them his way. Well, wouldn't you know that out of the two of us, he is the one with the bumper harvest! So much for instructions!
Grammar notes.
Expressions:&nbsp; a bumper harvest/ crop, wouldn't you know, to my/his/our surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice of pluperfect.
Exs:
This year we had a bumper crop of tomatoes. The plants just kept producing and producing.
She bought a lottery ticket and, wouldn't you know, she won some money!
At first, the man and woman didn't like eachother at all. To our great surprise, they announced their engagement three months later.
Pluperfect.
He had planted many types of seeds, but had hardly harvested any crops.
Had he had enough of fighting, or did he want to box all night?
They had never been to Greece before; they had always stayed in the Americas.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>We are continuing with our study of countries of the world with Afghanistan. As you know, it is in the news all the time, and has been for quite a few years. Let's try to understand why, and to learn a little more about the country. Afghanistan is located in the central part of South Asia. To the West is Iran, to the Southeast is Pakistan, and towards the North are Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, with China to the East. It is what we call 'landlocked'. That means that it has no access to the sea. Most of its territory is mountainous, called the Hindu Kush area, with the highest peak, called Nowshak, reaching&nbsp; 7,485m. The land quality and shape is also very varied. Some mountains are very steep with narrow gorges and valleys, and others are more like plateaus. A very famous route through the mountains that was used as part of the Spice Route, is the Khyber Pass. The Northern Plains are very fertile and used for agriculture. The South, however, is dry and desert-like. The main rivers are the Amu Darya and the Oxus. There are also hydro-electric dams, but because of political problems, they have not been fully used for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Historically, Afghanistan has had a life of turmoil. It's location has made it susceptible to invasion, and that is exactly what has happened throughout its history. Because it has been used as an important passage between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, it has come under the control of wealthy and aggressive nations. The first settlers were Indo-Europeans, called the Aryans, who settled in the area about 4000 years ago. It became part of the Persian empire in the sixth century. Alexander the Great from Greece conquered Persia, followed by several other peoples. Khorasan, the original name of Afghanistan, was taken by Arabs in 7th century and from then on it adopted Islam as its oficial religion.The Turks invaded in the 10th century, and then the Mongols in the 13th century. Its prosperity was attractive to its aggressors. In the 18th century Khorasan was ruled by both the Moghuls of India and the Safavids of Persia, but in 1747 the Afghans revolted and separated themselves. Finally, it won independence from British involvement in 1919. </p>
<p>Afghanistan is an Islamic State that has a transitional government. In 1979 the Soviet&nbsp;Union invaded Afghanistan. They had&nbsp;planted a Soviet friendly government but met resistance from the population. The&nbsp;occupation continued for 10 years with the toll of 1 million Afghan lives. The opposing militia, the Muhajideen &nbsp;were supported by the USA and its allies. When the Soviets pulled out, the civil war followed. Then, the Taliban, a group sponsored by Pakistan, became their present occupier and aggressor. After the September 11th attacks, the U.S invaded Afghanistan with the aim of squashing Taliban terrorist activity.</p>
<p>This war ravaged nation is the focus of world attention. With untapped resources of oil and gas, and a strong sense of national identity, there is hope that the people of Afghanistan can regain independence and reach their true potential.</p>

			<title>Vaccines for Foxy.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Vaccines_for_Foxy.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Today, Foxy had an appointment with the vet for vaccinations and a general check-up. She is about eight months old,&nbsp;so she&nbsp;needed her second set of vaccinations. The vet also needed to see if her growth was normal and healthy. I put her in her cage, in the back of the car, and drove about ten minutes to the Animal Hospital of Wenatchee. It is a lovely building, brand new infact, that is right in the center of town. The owner had had a pet shop which sold many different kinds of pets, and their supplies. The owner's husband is a vet. Now, they have changed their business, and they deal with the medical needs of animals. When you walk in the building you see that it is all about animals, and very tastefully arranged. Their is a fish tank, huge books all about animals, a statue of St. Francis of Asisi, and accessories all around that have images of dogs. There is even a special greeter. A little, fluffy dog that belongs to the owners spends its days in the animal hospital. Every time someone new walks in, it comes up to you, has a look and a sniff, checks out your pet, and then goes back behind the secretary's desk. It can't quite say,&quot;Can I take your coat, sir? Please make yourself comfortable. The vet will see you shortly.&quot; But, it would be very fitting if it did. Anyway, we arrived on time and waited in the waiting area. Foxy was nervous, I think. She sniffed, and sniffed. And her tail wasn't wagging at all. We comforted her and cuddled her, but still, she was not too happy about being there.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;preterite: sniff/ sniffed, to need/ needed, to be/ was/&nbsp;were.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The movie was very sad. The audience sniffed through most of it.</p>
<p>I needed to tell the truth. I also needed to know if it was safe to do so.</p>
<p>I was&nbsp;waiting at the bus stop for half an hour.&nbsp;Where were all&nbsp;the buses? Were they on strike?</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Poor Foxy had an ordeal today. It wasn't anything serious, but she thought it was. Talk about a nervous female! She whined all the way to the veterinary clinic. When she was inside the building, her tail was down and between her legs, a sure sign of being unhappy or scared. I had to keep a tight hold on her leash because she was a little out of control, pulling and wanting to get out. Eventually, the vet was ready to see her. She put her up on a table and examined her bones, and checked her heart, ears, and teeth. She gave Foxy the thumbs up for good health. And then it was time for her injections. I was so surprised that Foxy whined and made a lot of fuss. My other dog barely whined at all when she had her shots. But, Foxy is obviously much more sensitive. &quot; Each dog is different, just like humans,&quot; said the vet. She had difficulty examining her paws also. The dog just wouldn't let her. She has been licking her paws for a couple of days, which could be a sign of injury. However, the vet ran her fingers over the surface and in between her toes, and found nothing. Perhaps, as she has been running, she has injured herself a little. But, she is recovering. All these things needed to be checked, and I was so glad that she was given a clean bill of health. It was a relief to get her home. She is not used to being away from our other dog, Rosie. So, she was happy to be reunited. Unfortunately for me, I had to hose out her cage when we got home. Nerves had got the best of her, and I had to wash out the consequences, if you know what I mean. </p>
<p>Grammar notes.</p>
<p>Vocabulary: an ordeal, a leash, a paw, a clean bill of health, to hose (off).</p>
<p>The strike was quite an ordeal. There was a lot of tension and bad feelings.</p>
<p>When I took the dog for a walk, the leash got tangled around her paws.</p>
<p>My grandmother had been really ill, but the doctor now gives her a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>Roll out the hose and turn the water on please. I have to hose off my children; they are covered in mud.</p>

			<title>A Tour of Homes part 10, the kitchen drawer.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Kitchen_drawer.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>We are continuing with our series 'The Tour of Homes', highlighting all the everyday details of life at home. You are probably thinking, &quot;When is she going to be finished with the kitchen?&quot; I think this is the last kitchen episode, at least for now. You also are probably thinking, &quot;We have already heard about drawers in the kitchen.&quot; Yes, you are right. However, the phrase 'The kitchen drawer', is actually quite famous. It has become an expression in English speaking nations. The reason is this: there is usually a drawer in any kitchen where junk of all sorts is found. The drawer starts out empty, or, at least quite organized, with just a few things in it. But, as time goes on, more and more bits and pieces appear in it. It is almost a mystery how things get there. When I am busy in the kitchen, and I find things that don't belong there, I automatically put them in the kitchen drawer. Small toys that my children leave in the kitchen, receipts from work, coupons, spare keys, all these things can be found in there and more. One of the books that I have that helps people get organized, talks about the kitchen drawer. It says that every now and then, that spot of the kitchen needs to be examined and organized. Most things inside it need to be thrown away, and the things that are left should be put in groups so they are easy to find. In superstores, you can even find 'kitchen drawer organizers'. It's part of the culture now.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Common expressions: bits and pieces, all sorts of/ all kinds of, every now and then.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>My handbag is full of bits and pieces. I don't know if any of these things are worth keeping.</p>
<p>The bakery had all sorts of miniature tarts! OR The bakery had all kinds of miniature tarts!</p>
<p>Every now and then my friend will come and visit, and we will talk about our college days.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Oh my, when I decided to write about the kitchen drawer, I cringed inside. I knew that I had to take a photo of mine, and I had the feeling that it would be bad. It was worse than I expected. The only reason I have opened it recently, is to chuck in a few more unwanted items. It has certainly been neglected. When I walk around Walmart, a large superstore that is very close to my house, I feel a little guilty when I walk past the shelf of drawer organizers. You know what they look like: rectangular wooden or plastic inserts that have different compartments for all the different sized objects. Maybe one day I will buy one. Some of the things we have in the kitchen drawer are important, or at least, useful, so they are worth keeping in there. It's just difficult to throw things away sometimes. Don't you find that when you do, a few days later, you need what you just threw away? Am I making excuses? Perhaps I could have a goal of spending five minutes&nbsp;a week sorting out the drawer. Let me have a quick look and see what has accumulated: pencils, tape measures, hair bands, bits of shells, a plastic Pez candy container, some screws, some keys, and a variety of coupons and books. Hmm, that's not too bad. I suppose I could put the coupons together in a zip-lock bag. I could also have the stationary and pens, pencils, erasers, and pencil sharpeners in one area for easy access. And then the keys; throw away the ones we don't use, and hang up the important ones somewhere safe. There, that looks much better. The process wasn't as painful as I thought it would be. The kitchen drawer looks much better now. Next time I won't leave it as long. </p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Vocabulary: to cringe, to chuck/ throw, an insert, a zip-lock bag.&nbsp; And practice of the future tense.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I cringe when I think of singing in front of the school.</p>
<p>Chuck all of the garbage away! I'm tired of seeing it.</p>
<p>I need to buy inserts for my shoes to make them more comfortable.</p>
<p>I put the kids' sandwiches in zip-lock bags to keep them fresh.</p>
<p><em>Future:</em></p>
<p>Will you be coming to dinner tonight?</p>
<p>He won't enjoy the ballet. It's not the sort of thing he likes.</p>
<p>We will order pizza tonight, but tomorrow I will make roast beef.</p>
<p>The furniture will arrive in three days, so I'm going to get the room ready. </p>

			<title>A quick stop for fruit.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Fruit_stall.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Do you like to eat fruit? What are your favorite kinds? I like all kinds of fruit, local and tropical. I am fussy about one thing, though, when it comes to fruit: it has to be fresh. There is nothing worse than biting into an old apple that is soft, or an old orange that is starting to lose its&nbsp;flavor. Because we live close to all kinds of orchards, we have the benefit of&nbsp;shopping at local fruit stands. Every year there seem to be more and more of them. Just around the corner, a block away from where I live, is a fruit stand. It sells most seasonal fruits from this area: apples, cherries, apricots, nectarines, peaches, and pears. The first fruit to be sold are the cherries. They are ready for harvest before the other fruits. Then come the apricots, followed by the peaches, nectarines, pears, and finally the apples. It's all colorful and delicious. The fruit stand, or stall as they say here, is a simple construction made out of wood, a shade, and a table.

Do you like to eat fruit? What are your favorite kinds? I like all kinds of fruit, local and tropical. I am fussy about one thing, though, when it comes to fruit: it has to be fresh. There is nothing worse than biting into an old apple that is soft, or an old orange that is starting to lose its&nbsp;flavor. Because we live close to all kinds of orchards, we have the benefit of&nbsp;shopping at local fruit stands. Every year there seem to be more and more of them. Just around the corner, a block away from where I live, is a fruit stand. It sells most seasonal fruits from this area: apples, cherries, apricots, nectarines, peaches, and pears. The first fruit to be sold are the cherries. They are ready for harvest before the other fruits. Then come the apricots, followed by the peaches, nectarines, pears, and finally the apples. It's all colorful and delicious. The fruit stand, or stall as they say here, is a simple construction made out of wood, a shade, and a table. You can park your car next to it, get out, and choose from a number of different bags of different sizes. The owners also grow tomatoes, so, just like in an open market, you can choose your own. And did you know that there is a drop box for the money that you pay, in case nobody is there to serve you. Yes! The fruit is sometimes left by itself, and if you take a bag, you are expected to put the money in the box. It's a test to see if you are honest! And, you know, most people are!

<p>If you drive around this town, you will see lots of new buildings, and some that are almost finished. The town is growing. There is heavy machinery of all kinds in many places: cranes, backhoes, dump trucks, and bulldozers.&nbsp;As you walk or drive past these busy places, you can hear all the noises of the machines, the workmen, and the automatic tools. It is interesting to see how quickly a neighborhood can be changed by a building. Now, also, there is a rule in Wenatchee that when a building is built there must be landscaping around it. That means that the owners must plant trees, grass, and bushes. It all beautifies the area and makes the new buildings look even better. It helps to sell the new buildings, and it attracts people to new stores. When attractive landscaping is put in, the whole area benefits. Did you know that trees and other greenery reduce crime? The beautiful, natural surroundings help us calm down and forget our problems. A tree here, some flowers there, a group of bushes, all add quality to our lives. That is why it is great to see Wenatchee getting more landscaping. Just a few streets away from where I live, there is a new spot of landscaping that catches everybody's attention. It is a beautiful advertisement for a new development.</p>

<p>This garden looks like a desert. It needs more greenery.</p>
<p>The new fountain really beautifies the center of town.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Boulder Falls is the name of a new waterfall on the corner of a street where new houses are being built. It is quite an eye catcher. There was nothing there a month ago, apart from some weeds and dry ground. Now, with the help of buiders, landscapers, and heavy machinery, the patch of land has become transformed. First the ground was prepared, weeded, smoothed, and pipes were laid. Then plastic was put on top. A natural looking wall of boulders was put in, piece by piece, with a stair step arrangement in the middle. Next, rich topsoil was spread all around the rocks, and the landscapers planted many trees and bushes. Finally, the water was turned on. Everyone who drives past that corner must have been wondering when it would be finished. And now, with the Autumn colors just around the corner, we will be able to enjoy the waterfall until the snow comes. &quot;It's smart,&quot; said my husband, as we drove past one day. &quot;It'll help to sell the new houses.&quot; I hadn't thought about that until he mentioned it. It's true. What a clever way to advertise new homes: put in a beautiful piece of landscaping that is right next to them. With the credit crisis still looming large in the area, new homes need all the help they can get. The landscaping company also has its name on a sign right next to the waterfall. So it is double advertising.</p>

<p>Baseball season has started. 'Fall Ball' is the title of the season's activities, and the town is busy and buzzing with the sport. Usually, when a child is signed up for baseball, he will have two practices per week, and then two games at the weekend. It is a big commitment because the games last for two hours each. Preparation has to be made: the rest of the family comes along to the game bringing chairs, hats, blankets in case it is cold, cold drink in case it is hot. The weather is changeable, so you never know what you will get. Even with a very consistent climate as we have here, September can bring surprises. The boys involved in baseball have to arrive at the baseball park about an hour early, in order to practice. They generally carry a bag, inside which you will find: a baseball glove (or mitt), a ball, a bat, a hat, and drinks. They stretch, run up and down the field, practice throwing and catching, and then listen to instructions from the coach. As the boys get older, they become more knowledgeable about the game, faster, and stronger. The games become more interesting and competitive. All goes well unless the weather does something unusual. Coming from a rainy country, the kids are used to playing in the rain; it's really no big deal. If you come from a very dry area, like Wenatchee, rain can seem quite intimidating.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: intimidating, commitment, consistent.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The boxer looked intimidating. He was very muscular and hairy.</p>
<p>She took her commitment to her family seriously: she took care of her grandmother for three years.</p>
<p>The sauce is not consistent. Some of it is smooth, and some of it is lumpy.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>There was a downpour the other day during a weekend baseball game. I loved it, but, I&nbsp;think, most people found it irritating. The coaches kept on calling a time-out, which is when the game stops for a while. The players would run into the dug-out (their shelter), and get dry and rest. It is difficult to play baseball in the rain because you play on hard soil, and what happens to that when it rains? Mud, mud, and more mud. So, even though this English girl was secretly loving the rain and feeling very at home in it, the players, coaches, and referees were frustrated and impatient. The sight of an umbrella is quite rare in this town, and their random colors cheered the look of the baseball park. Well, our team eventually won the game, and everyone went home to get warm and dry. People talked about how awful the weather was, but I think that it made the day more interesting. A friend of mine during the Summer was going to take her daughter to a swimming lesson, &quot;It might be cancelled because of the rain,&quot; she said to me. I looked in the sky and barely saw a drop of water anywhere. Gosh, what different ideas people have about the weather. I suppose it is all to do with your childhood and expectations. &quot;You people are soft,&quot; I once said to my father-in-law, &quot;a bit of water in the sky, and you have to run home and cancel everything!&quot; If we cancelled for rain in England, we would never do anything!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Vocabulary</em>: awful, to cancel, impatient, and the subjunctive.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The play was awful. It was poorly written and the actors were amateurs!</p>
<p>I had to cancel my appointment with the dentist in order to go to the doctor.</p>
<p>The train was late for the third time this week. Everyone on the platform was very impatient.</p>
<p><em>Subjunctive.</em></p>
<p>If the train had been on time, noone would have been grumpy.</p>
<p>If I were you, I wouldn't talk like that to the principal.</p>
<p>When the town grows more, the counsel might build a theatre.</p>

			<title>Going back to teaching.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Back_to_teaching.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>This year I have some free time. My youngest child goes to preschool four mornings a week, so during that time, I can do many things. I decided recently to put my application in for being a substitute teacher. That is a teacher who takes the place of a regular, full-time teacher who is ill, or who cannot make it to school for some other reason. Sometimes&nbsp;a teacher has&nbsp;a training day to attend, so someone else needs to take&nbsp;his&nbsp;class. Often, especially around flu season, a teacher might wake up ill, or have an ill child to take care of; that's when I step in. I have been a substitute teacher before. It is a good way to experience many different schools in a short period of time. Generally, a substitute teacher, or 'sub', as they are called, will work in a different school each day. Before I went to university to get my teaching degree, I subbed for a year in our town. It showed me that High School is my preferred place of teaching. I enjoy the company of the older students, even though the teenagers can be quite a challenge at times. As I plan to eventually go back to teaching full-time, subbing is a good way to introduce myself to the school district and all it's staff. Let's hope that they like me! </p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Useful expressions: full-time, part-time, to step in.</p>
<p>She has just got a full-time job and is thrilled. A fourty hour week will really help to pay the bills.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to job share. A part-time position would be convenient for me at this stage in my life.</p>
<p>The house was devastated by the storm. Thankfully, the neighbors all stepped in to help clean up the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>I'm really excited about getting back into the school system. It has been a few years since I last subbed, about nine actually. I suppose I'm a little nervous as well. Things have changed in nine years. Now there is an on-line application to fill in. We never had that before. It's not a problem, of course; it's just an extra step involving technology. Also, now I can look for jobs in advance on the internet. There is a specific site for subbing jobs which I can log on to and search. That way I can plan ahead and have a job or two lined up for me, instead of being called at five thirty in the morning to see if I am available. That is a definite improvement! There is certainly more paperwork involved, though. More forms, more information, more warnings even. There is a misconduct form which is new. It is required by state law from everyone who works in the schools. It also is a good idea. It basically protects the students from anyone who acts or has acted inappropriately towards youngsters. I'm glad that these regulations exist. They keep my children and all the students safe. Another thing that has to be done before subbing is fingerprinting. I went down to the school district office to have my fingerprints done. It is a simple procedure, but I ran into a problem. Some of my fingers didn't have prints! How did that happen? The lady told me that gardening without gloves on will do that. The prints will actually get worn down! Well, I learned something new that day. But it all turned out okay in the end. I had enough prints for the police to check out my record. It turns out that I'm not a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Vocabulary and verb practice: inappropriate, on-line, website, 'to require'.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The man acted so inappropriately at the wedding; he was very drunk and rude!</p>
<p>Checkout the new on-line store. It sells shoes really cheaply.</p>
<p>I will have a new website soon that I think you will find very interesting.</p>
<p>Three years of study are required to get that qualification.</p>
<p>All living things require food.</p>
<p>The law requires traffic to move slowly near schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Before I went to university to get my teaching degree, I subbed for a year in our town. It showed me that High School is my preferred place of teaching. I enjoy the company of the older students, even though the teenagers can be quite a challenge at times. As I plan to eventually go back to teaching full-time, subbing is a good way to introduce myself to the school district and all it's staff. Let's hope that they like me! 
Grammar notes.
Useful expressions: full-time, part-time, to step in.
She has just got a full-time job and is thrilled. A fourty hour week will really help to pay the bills.
I'm hoping to job share. A part-time position would be convenient for me at this stage in my life.
The house was devastated by the storm. Thankfully, the neighbors all stepped in to help clean up the next day.
Advanced.
I'm really excited about getting back into the school system. It has been a few years since I last subbed, about nine actually. I suppose I'm a little nervous as well. Things have changed in nine years. Now there is an on-line application to fill in. We never had that before. It's not a problem, of course; it's just an extra step involving technology. Also, now I can look for jobs in advance on the internet. There is a specific site for subbing jobs which I can log on to and search. That way I can plan ahead and have a job or two lined up for me, instead of being called at five thirty in the morning to see if I am available. That is a definite improvement! There is certainly more paperwork involved, though. More forms, more information, more warnings even. There is a misconduct form which is new. It is required by state law from everyone who works in the schools. It also is a good idea. It basically protects the students from anyone who acts or has acted inappropriately towards youngsters. I'm glad that these regulations exist. They keep my children and all the students safe. Another thing that has to be done before subbing is fingerprinting. I went down to the school district office to have my fingerprints done. It is a simple procedure, but I ran into a problem. Some of my fingers didn't have prints! How did that happen? The lady told me that gardening without gloves on will do that. The prints will actually get worn down! Well, I learned something new that day. But it all turned out okay in the end. I had enough prints for the police to check out my record. It turns out that I'm not a criminal.
Grammar notes.
Vocabulary and verb practice: inappropriate, on-line, website, 'to require'.
Exs:
The man acted so inappropriately at the wedding; he was very drunk and rude!
Checkout the new on-line store. It sells shoes really cheaply.
I will have a new website soon that I think you will find very interesting.
Three years of study are required to get that qualification.
All living things require food.
The law requires traffic to move slowly near schools.

			<title>A Tour of Homes part 9, the Kitchen Pantry.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/pantry.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Well, it looks like we're back in the kitchen. I told you, didn't I, that the kitchen is an important place, and that is why we need to spend more time using the every day kitchen vocabulary. The main idea of today's podcast is the pantry. It is an odd word, really. It means the storage area for all of the food. Pantries vary quite a lot. In our kitchen, we have three different areas for food items: one for cereals, one for baking items and canned goods, and another for pastas and rice. The system works for us. I want an easy reach place for the children, so they can get their cereals in the morning without any trouble. The pastas, rice,and spices, which I use a lot, are up in a cupboard where little fingers cannot reach them. Sometimes, it takes a while to figure out the best places to put things. It is a science. I think you need to live in your kitchen for a while, meaning, spend lots of time in your kitchen, before you know where you need to put things. We all hate looking for items when they have been put in the wrong place, so a pantry system saves time for a lot of people. I think I will gut a large cupboard, rearrange the shelves, and make it into one large pantry. It will make my life much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Useful expressions: to figure out, to spend time, to gut.</p>
<p>The children were give five minutes to figure out the math problem.</p>
<p>We should spend more time with our neighbor; she is such fun, and she lives alone.</p>
<p>We gutted the house; we took out all of the inside: carpets, cabinets, and appliances.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a wonderful book that I bought from a home improvement store a few years ago. It is called 'Creative ideas for organizing your home.' It is a guide to making your home efficient and clutter-free. Oh, that is a dream of mine. The book makes it all look so easy, though, a little bit like a Disney movie. I'm not too bad at being organized, but, then again, I'm not a natural accountant. I have friends who are, and they have everything in its rightful place. That is something that I admire. After all, it's more pleasant to live in a tidy, organized home, than to see 'stuff' everywhere you look. Don't get me wrong; I have improved over the years. I rearrange the cereal boxes in the pantry. I throw out the empty ones and put the ones that still have cereal in them in a straight line. I attack the kitchen draw every now and then, and throw out the unnecessaries. And when my children's bedrooms become despicable, I charge around picking things up, throwing things away, and putting things where they should be. Gosh, it takes a lot of time. As my children get older, they take on more responsibility which certainly helps me. They can make their beds, organize their cubbies where they keep their shoes and hang up their coats and backpacks. They can even vacuum quite well. The little ones are really not 'into it'. An answer I get often when I ask Domini or Robert to put their shoes away is, &quot;Mum, my legs are tired,&quot; to which I respond, &quot;Well, my everything is tired, but I still put my shoes away.&quot; My last resort to get them to help is bribery; it always works.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Useful vocabulary: clutter, a rightful place, cubby, to resort to.</p>
<p>There was so much clutter in his bedroom that I couldn't even walk in.</p>
<p>The diamond was returned to the museum and put in its rightful place.</p>
<p>I have just built some cubbies for the kids; they can hang coats, hats, backpacks there, and put their shoes in their own special place.</p>
<p>The criminal wouldn't talk, so the police resorted to rough interrogation.</p>

			<title>An animal icon show.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/iconic.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>On our recent trip to the zoo and aquarium at Defiance Point, my family and I saw a special show of wild animals. We sat in a packed open-air theater at about three in the afternoon and waited for the show to begin. Music played. It was the theme from Mission Impossible. I thought, &quot;Why are they playing that music? What has it got to do with an animal show?&quot; Well, it was a good idea for the show. The two female presenters found a box with a large red button on it. They pushed it, and a recorded voice gave them a mission, &quot;To find the best way to enjoy the outdoors&quot;. Through the show they acted as if they were camping, hiking, and repelling, and they talked about other out-door activities. With each activity, they came upon different animals, and showed them to us. One was an Aardvark. It walked on to the stage and suprised all of us. They are actually quite big. Its back was extremely round, and with its snout it busily searched for food under rocks. It looked cute and cuddly. Everybody in the crowd said, &quot;Ahhh,&quot; when it first appeared. When it had finished eating some food that had been deliberately placed for it, one of the ladies snapped her fingers, and it obediently left. Other animals came on to the stage. They were also trained. Wait until you hear about a few of them.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Useful phrases: to have to do (sometimes using got), to snap your fingers.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The film doesn't have anything to do with the original book. Their themes are quite different.</p>
<p>I disagree with you, Sir. What you said has (got) nothing to do with my argument.</p>
<p>He shouldn't listen to our conversation. This (matter) has (got) nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>It used to be tradition to snap your fingers to call the waiter; now it is considered rude.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>As the afternoon went on at the zoo, the show became more and more interesting. The list of different animals that made an appearance is long and quite varied. A tortoise from Madagascar was displayed. It moved slowly, of course, and looked cute and defenseless. Then came a fascinating fishcat. That's right, a fishcat, not a catfish. A fishcat is similar to a linx. It is sleek, beautiful, and quite small. But this creature actually has webbed feet! Can you believe it? A cat with webbed feet, just like a duck! Unlike most cats, it swims, and catches its&nbsp;food right in the water. As you can imagine, with an all fish diet, its fur is very sleek. Then came the birds. There was an ostrich, a hawk, a toucan, a barn owl, and then a bald eagle. It was impressive how the ladies had managed to train these birds. Of course they used food to make them obey, and it worked very well. The owl was white, cute, and fluffy, and its flight was completely silent. It flew over the audience and didn't make a sound. Last of all came the bald eagle. It was magestic, with a huge wing span, and an unpredictable look on its face. Iconic is the word, and a great way to end the show. It had been such an impressive show that we had forgotten how hot it was. We went off to get a drink, talking about all the animals and what we had learned. I'm so glad that I took lots of pictures. </p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Animal vocabulary: snout, hoof/ves, beak, webbed feet.</p>
<p>That woman has a nose and mouth that are just like the snout of a pig.</p>
<p>Banging that coconut sounds like horses hooves on a road.</p>
<p>Be careful when you stroke your canary. Its beak is quite sharp.</p>
<p>The duck's webbed feet look like they are made out of rubber.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>During the summer, my family and I took a trip to a beautiful and fascinating place. It was a zoo and an aquarium at a place called Point Defiance, near Seattle. A friend of mine had been there, and told me that it was worth a trip. We were staying close by, on the coast, in a friend's house. It took about an hour and a half to get there by car which was fine. When we got there, it was quite a shock. The huge parking area was completely full. Infact, cars were parked on the side of the road because there were no more parking spaces available. When we got inside, I understood why it was so full. It is an incredible place. The aquarium is very large and varied. We saw penguins, seals, otters, walruses, and a huge amount of smaller sea creatures. I loved the jelly fish. They were a small, see-through species. They were in a dark tank with lights shining up. They looked like pretty little ghosts as they moved through the light. We spent a lot of time looking at the walruses. Gosh they were enormous. One swam up to the window where we were and stayed there, yawning, snorting, and looking at us. It was quite a show.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Preterite and pluperfect of : to be, to tell, to swim, to take.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>He was a very handsome man; he had been a pilot in the war.</p>
<p>I told you we needed new batteries. Jim had told you too.</p>
<p>He was tired of swimming. He had swum a mile in total, so he swam to the beach, got out, and fell asleep on the sand.</p>
<p>I took the car to the service station to have the oil changed. I didn't realise that you had taken it in already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Point Defiance is on the coast&nbsp;right near the city of Tacoma. As we walked down the hill towards the entrance, we could see the sea. It was quite spectacular. The children were dying to sea the tigers, so we walked through the 'Asian Forest' area, through paths of bamboo, and into a cave-like area where we could look through glass into the large living area of the tigers. The adults were napping, laying on grass, barely moving. The babies, though, were right up close the glass, just relaxing, not seeming to take much notice of any of us. It was a thrill to see them. It was after the tigers that we went into the aquarium. There was so much to see. Again, we walked through a cave-like area that was dark, past windows of different fish, until we came to a huge aquarium. In it were sharks! I'm not sure what kind they were, but they certainly were intimidating. They circled around and came right up to the glass to check us out with their cold, black eyes. I wasn't sure who was observing who. I certainly wouldn't want to find myself swimming anywhere close to them. </p>

			<title>Back to School.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>It's great to be back podcasting for you, my listeners. And what an exciting time of year it is! Back to school. For some of us, it is back to work. It seems that for most of July and August, here in the States, there are advertisements everywhere for the children's clothes and supplies for school. Unlike in England, here each child has a long list of supplies that their parents must buy for them for the start of school in September. The list includes: pencils, paper, books, pens, kleenex, sanitary wipes, coloring pens, paints, and the list goes on and on. My children were very excited when I came back from the store with lots of bags full of their stuff. They took them and ran up to their bedrooms to make piles of their new supplies under their desks, or in a special place. It is quite funny to see them on the first day of school, because their backpacks are crammed full. They can hardly zip them up! I think that it is exciting for them because it helps them feel prepared for a new school year with new friends, a new teacher, and a new schedule. They probably feel a little nervous about the newness of it all, and so, getting organised with their stuff makes them feel ready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Useful vocabulary: supplies, kleenex, sanitary wipes, piles, to cram.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>Our most important emergency supply is bottles of water.</p>
<p>You must use a kleenex if you have a runny nose.</p>
<p>Instead of using bleach water to clean the countertops, I use sanitary wipes.</p>
<p>There were piles of dirty clothes all over the laundry room. Can't people just put them in the washer?</p>
<p>The little boy crammed the blueberries in his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>So, I found myself a few weeks ago in Fred Meyer. It is a huge, general store in East Wenatchee where you can buy anything from milk to shoes, plastic bags to eye drops, or toys to trees. It's a great place if you want, what they call over here, 'a one stop shop' experience. They also have a wonderful place called 'Playland' where you can drop off your little children in a safe, supervised, 'kids only' room, so they can play and have fun while you do all of the boring shopping.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Beginners.
It's great to be back podcasting for you, my listeners. And what an exciting time of year it is! Back to school. For some of us, it is back to work. It seems that for most of July and August, here in the States, there are advertisements everywhere for the children's clothes and supplies for school. Unlike in England, here each child has a long list of supplies that their parents must buy for them for the start of school in September. The list includes: pencils, paper, books, pens, kleenex, sanitary wipes, coloring pens, paints, and the list goes on and on. My children were very excited when I came back from the store with lots of bags full of their stuff. They took them and ran up to their bedrooms to make piles of their new supplies under their desks, or in a special place. It is quite funny to see them on the first day of school, because their backpacks are crammed full. They can hardly zip them up! I think that it is exciting for them because it helps them feel prepared for a new school year with new friends, a new teacher, and a new schedule. They probably feel a little nervous about the newness of it all, and so, getting organised with their stuff makes them feel ready.
&nbsp;Grammar notes.
Useful vocabulary: supplies, kleenex, sanitary wipes, piles, to cram.
Exs:
Our most important emergency supply is bottles of water.
You must use a kleenex if you have a runny nose.
Instead of using bleach water to clean the countertops, I use sanitary wipes.
There were piles of dirty clothes all over the laundry room. Can't people just put them in the washer?
The little boy crammed the blueberries in his mouth.
Advanced.
So, I found myself a few weeks ago in Fred Meyer. It is a huge, general store in East Wenatchee where you can buy anything from milk to shoes, plastic bags to eye drops, or toys to trees. It's a great place if you want, what they call over here, 'a one stop shop' experience. They also have a wonderful place called 'Playland' where you can drop off your little children in a safe, supervised, 'kids only' room, so they can play and have fun while you do all of the boring shopping. What a great idea. But I wasn't doing normal shopping that day. I was on a mission. School supplies. To be honest, with four kids, it's all a bit of a headache. Thankfully though, these shops are not only ready to receive our money, but they are also ready to help us find what we need very easily.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;We are continuing our study of different countries, with Croatia. It is a realtively small country in Central and Southeastern Europe, that is sandwiched between Slovenia and Hungary to the North, Serbia to the Northeast, Bosnia and Hertzegovina to the East, and Montenegro to the Southeast. Just opposite, to the West, across the&nbsp;Adriatic Sea, is Italy. It is shaped like a crescent moon. The geography of this country is quite varied. It has a very long rocky coastline, plains, lakes and rolling hills to the North and East, and very dense forests and mountains in the Dinaric Alps. Certainly there is a lot of variety in an area of 56 and a half thousand square kilometres. There are over 1000 islands in the Croatian territory, many inhabited, and enjoyed by tourists. Croatia is famous for its national parks and for having 49 caves, three of which are deeper than 1000 metres. It is also home to seven Unesco World Heritage sites. It has certainly become a hot spot for tourist in recent years. If you are looking for natural beauty and history at a reasonable price, apparently you need look no further.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: to be sandwiched (in) between, rolling hills, a hot spot.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>Our house is sandwiched&nbsp;between a butcher's and a baker's.</p>
<p>The rolling hills look smooth because they are not very high, nor do they have jagged rocks.</p>
<p>That night club is the city's main hot spot.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The earliest inhabitants of Croatia have&nbsp;been found to be Neanderthals. Several tribes of different regions lived in various areas of what now forms Croatia. In&nbsp; 9 AD, it became part of the Roman empire. However, in the 7th century AD, European Avars invaded and destroyed nearly all of the roman towns. The Croats organized themselves into 2 areas, and missionaries set about christianizing the people. Pope John V111 recognised Branimir as the Croats first leader in 872, but it did not become a kingdom until a century later. The Hungarian and Croatian royalties were related, and Hungary took over for 400 years, though Croatian independence was recognized. A Sabor, or kind of parliament ruled for the next 400 years. Croatia joined the Hapsburg empire in 1527 but then became independent in 1918. At this point Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes united to become Yugoslavia, much to the outrage of the majority of Croats; they wanted state independence. </p>
<p>Yugoslavia was quickly overtaken by Nazi Germany and a puppet Croatian ruling party, the Ustache, was set up. It was a brutal regime. After the war, Yugoslavia became socialist, and later a major war between the Croats and the Serbs took place between 1991 and 1995.&nbsp;Croatia was finally recognized in 1992 as an independent country.</p>

			<title>A Tour of Homes 8, cleaning the kitchen.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Clean_kitch.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing about cooking is the cleaning up that you need to do afterwards. Oh drudgery! The endless pile of cups, plates, cutlery, and pots and pans can spoil an otherwise fun evening. I am used to cleaning the kitchen. I do it every day, sometimes without even realising. My goal is to get the dishes done as soon as possible. Even my mother has commented on the speed with which I unload and load the dishwasher, clean the&nbsp;countertops and&nbsp;put clean crockery away. Well, if I don't like doing it, then why do it slowly? Get it done as soon as possible, so I can move on to doing something more interesting. I know that I can't complain; I do have an automatic dish washer, so the job isn't really that difficult. I remember when I was a little girl and nobody really had dishwashers. They were extremely rare. My mother would wash everything by hand in very hot soapy water. Then, she would rinse every item in the sink off in very hot, clean water. The pots and pans and everything else would sit on the draining board for a while. A short while later, when the water had run off, we would each take a kitchen towel and help her dry and put it all away. It seemed to take forever. I think, though, that back then, we had less to do; we didn't seem so busy. I can't imagine life without my automatic dishwasher.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Related vocabulary: drudgery, crockery, cutlery, to rinse, the draining board.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The class I just had was pure drudgery. It was slow and boring.</p>
<p>I need crockery. I hardly have any cups, plates, bowls, or other dishes.</p>
<p>Our silver cutlery needs to be polished with a special liquid.</p>
<p>After lathering up the car, the couple rinsed it off thoroughly with the hose.</p>
<p>My draining board is too small to hold all of the pots and pans; water runs over the edge onto the countertop.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Okay, roll up your sleeves and get on with it. Don't just stand there contemplating. It is a necessary evil, a daily duty, a pain in the rear. To do this successfully, make sure that you don't have any distractions; you need to focus. This is how I clean the kitchen. First of all, I scan the room to see if there is anything that needs to be thrown away. Then, I put away any clean cutlery or crockery that hasn't been used. I move all of the items that need to be washed close to the sink. Plates that still have food on them are scraped off over the pedal bin, (I have a really cool one that is extra big, and can be kept open if you are using it alot). I try to stack plates and bowls according to size so everything looks organised, even if it is still unwashed. I fill up the sink with these stacked, dirty items, making sure to put the cutlery in one pile, and anything delicate up on the countertop by itself. Wine glasses can easily break in the sink with the heavier items. I turn on the tap, switch the fosset head to spray rather than stream, and I rinse each item quickly before I load up the dishwasher. Once I reach this stage, it all goes very quickly. I try to arrange everything in the dishwasher to get maximum exposure to soapy water and rinsing. Nobody likes to open a dishwasher and find that it hasn't done its job. Then, I pour the soap powder into the little, plastic compartment, close the door, push a few buttons, and viola!, my favorite maid leaps into action. After that, I simply need to wipe down the countertops, and sweep the floor, and then pat myself on the back for a job well done.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Verbs: to contemplate, to scan, to scrape, to switch, to wipe.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>It was my day off, so I spent some time contemplating the flowers.</p>
<p>The robot scanned the building and detected an unexploded bomb in the corner of the lobby.</p>
<p>The girl fell down in the playground and scraped her knee.</p>
<p>I switched from regular coffee to decaf, but I was tired all the time, so I switched back.</p>
<p>She wiped the tears from her eyes with a handkerchief. His train had already left; she wouldn't see him for another month.</p>

			<title>Dominos.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Doms.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>The other day, I took the children to the local library. It is only a ten minute drive from our house. We had a lot of books that were overdue and needed to be returned. It's one of those great places to go when it is too hot to do anything else. Another benefit of going there is that it forces the children to be quiet. Ha-ha, that was my plan! We actually stayed there for over two hours. The library here in Wenatchee is divided into three sections. The main floor has most of the books, reference books, magazines, seating areas, and librarians' area. Downstairs has lots of computers for researching files of all sorts. Around the corner from this area is a quiet row of desks with internet access. You can take in your own laptop, plug it in, and search the web, or do any kind of work you need to. It is a very handy place. The top floor is dedicated to children. I love going there. The first thing you see as you go up the stairs is a huge, metal, green frog with a crown on it. There is a computer for children to do various learning games on. And then, the main room has a big fantasy mural, lots of toys and books, a tent with big pillows and stuffed animals, blocks of all sorts, and a fish tank. It is fun, imaginative, and cozy. There are two other small areas, amongst rows of book shelves, where children can sit and play with games, puppets, and puzzles. It was in the puzzle area that my children discovered a box of dominos. They were hooked. They absolutely refused to leave. I stopped asking them to get ready to go, because I could see that they were totally engrossed in the game. Dominos are fun, great to hold, and quite addictive.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: overdue, benefit, reference, handy, stuffed animals, to be engrossed.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The pregnant lady is overdue; she should have had the baby two weeks ago.</p>
<p>One benefit of being a teacher is that you often learn a lot from your students.</p>
<p>I can't take out that book from the library. It is a reference book.</p>
<p>This new cell phone is so handy! It fits in my pocket, has the internet, and even charges the car battery.</p>
<p>My little girl has&nbsp;loads of stuffed animals in her bedroom.</p>
<p>I was talking to my husband, when I realized that he was engrossed in his book, and hadn't heard&nbsp;a word that I had said.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>When we came home from the library, my children found our box of dominos, and immediately started to play. However, they didn't want to play the traditional game of number sequencing. Their goal was to set up a domino course that would all fall down at the slightest, deliberate touch. It wasn't as easy as they were hoping. They had visions of dominos all over the house, up&nbsp;and down the stairs, in and out of rooms, under chairs, through doors etc etc. Well, to start with, they didn't have enough dominos, so they had to settle for an obstacle course of medium size. They became very quiet and very industrious about the project. The whole thing took at least an hour. About half way through, I had to walk away and leave them alone because they were accidentally knocking down the arrangement, and becoming quite frustrated. It's always best for Mum to leave the room at that point and not say anything unless asked for advice. Finally, though, after a lot of trial and error, the domino course was ready for an audience. We all gathered around and waited for the count down. &quot;Three, two, one, go!&quot; Cass put a small, plastic ball on a shoot that pointed at the first domino. Success! It fell over and all the others did the same. They fell up a small stack of dvd cases that were positioned like stairs, then down the other side. They fell over in a circle shape, down an incline, and, for the grand finale, pushed two balls over to a wall of dominos that came crashing down!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Uses of the past participle as an adjective: asked, questioned, reminded, beaten, left.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>She will help you only if asked (only if she is asked to).</p>
<p>They were questioned by the police.</p>
<p>I am reminded every day of my friend who moved away.</p>
<p>The rugby team entered the changing room, tired out, and beaten by their opponents.</p>
<p>The kitten continued to sleep, left alone by the children.</p>

It was in the puzzle area that my children discovered a box of dominos. They were hooked. They absolutely refused to leave. I stopped asking them to get ready to go, because I could see that they were totally engrossed in the game. Dominos are fun, great to hold, and quite addictive.
Grammar notes.
Related vocabulary: overdue, benefit, reference, handy, stuffed animals, to be engrossed.
Exs:
The pregnant lady is overdue; she should have had the baby two weeks ago.
One benefit of being a teacher is that you often learn a lot from your students.
I can't take out that book from the library. It is a reference book.
This new cell phone is so handy! It fits in my pocket, has the internet, and even charges the car battery.
My little girl has&nbsp;loads of stuffed animals in her bedroom.
I was talking to my husband, when I realized that he was engrossed in his book, and hadn't heard&nbsp;a word that I had said.
Advanced.
When we came home from the library, my children found our box of dominos, and immediately started to play. However, they didn't want to play the traditional game of number sequencing. Their goal was to set up a domino course that would all fall down at the slightest, deliberate touch. It wasn't as easy as they were hoping. They had visions of dominos all over the house, up&nbsp;and down the stairs, in and out of rooms, under chairs, through doors etc etc. Well, to start with, they didn't have enough dominos, so they had to settle for an obstacle course of medium size. They became very quiet and very industrious about the project. The whole thing took at least an hour. About half way through, I had to walk away and leave them alone because they were accidentally knocking down the arrangement, and becoming quite frustrated. It's always best for Mum to leave the room at that point and not say anything unless asked for advice. Finally, though, after a lot of trial and error, the domino course was ready for an audience. We all gathered around and waited for the count down. &quot;Three, two, one, go!&quot; Cass put a small, plastic ball on a shoot that pointed at the first domino. Success! It fell over and all the others did the same. They fell up a small stack of dvd cases that were positioned like stairs, then down the other side. They fell over in a circle shape, down an incline, and, for the grand finale, pushed two balls over to a wall of dominos that came crashing down!
Grammar notes.
Uses of the past participle as an adjective: asked, questioned, reminded, beaten, left.
Exs:
She will help you only if asked (only if she is asked to).
They were questioned by the police.
I am reminded every day of my friend who moved away.
The rugby team entered the changing room, tired out, and beaten by their opponents.
The kitten continued to sleep, left alone by the children.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>A few days ago, we had a yard sale. I actually held it over two mornings, out of my garage. Yard sales are very common in this area, and very popular too. Do you know what they are? I suppose the name explains the meaning; a sale of household items which takes place outside on your driveway, or inside your garage. With it being so hot, I arranged everything inside my garage so prospective buyers wouldn't leave quickly because of the blast of the sun. The shade in the garage would keep them looking at the items a little longer. Amongst all the 'stuff' was a box of craft items and bits and pieces of little importance. I had marked the box with &quot;$1 each or best offer&quot;. When the sale was finally over, I&nbsp;took most of the left over things to a charity organization, leaving just one box in the garage. I happened to look in the box today, and found something that I had long forgotten about: two ears of Indian corn. I had bought these a few years ago as a decoration for the house at pumpkin time, or late autumn. It is a reminder of the harvest, of the change of season, and of the richness of creation. But Indian corn has a unique look, and a unique history. All corn, I suppose, could be called Indian corn, but, in general, we give that name to the multicolored variety of corn that is used mainly for decoration rather than food.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Useful vocabulary: houshold items, to arrange, a prospective buyer, 'bits and pieces'.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The shop sells household items, no farming equipment.</p>
<p>She is very good at arranging flowers in a vase.</p>
<p>If the entryway of the house is attractive, we will attract prospective buyers.</p>
<p>&quot;What's in your bag?&quot; &quot;Oh, just bits and pieces.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Corn, or maize, was originally an american plant, grown by the Native American indians throughout Mesoamerica. It was a staple food for many of the tribes, and still is for many people. In Mexico, for example, corn is ground up into a crumbly flour, and made into 'masa' which is rolled out and cooked into tortillas, a round, flat grain wrap eaten with meat and vegetables. About three hundred and thirty two million metric tonnes of corn are grown in the U.S every year, more than in any other country. A lot of it is exported, but much of it is made into corn syrup which is added to many processed and premade foods. In hot climates it is quite easy to grow, and there are many varieties. A couple of years ago I grew corn, and was quite impressed at its performance. It got to about seven feet tall and produced a lot of ears. Mind you, the corn kernels were not consistently shaped. Some were swollen, and others were non existent. Some ears had a lot of flavor, others had very little. It'll take a bit of research for me to get it right, I think. However, when the Europeans first came over to the Americas, the Native Indians gave them some very good advice as to how to survive by growing successful corn. They taught them to put salmon in the earth where the corn was to be grown. This increased the nutrients of the earth greatly and gave good yields. Corn is a fascinating and delicious vegetable, and though used world wide, it is distinctly american. I'm glad I didn't manage to sell the two ears of corn. I think I'll keep them as a decoration and a reminder for a few more years.</p>

<p>You will probably get tired of me writing about how hot it is. Yes, yes, Wenatchee is always hot in the summer. However, this year, it has been exceptionally hot, like an oven. The past few weeks have each had several days of temperatures up to 106 degrees. You don't really see anyone around in the streets during the day, unless they are crazy....The early morning is wonderful, and late evening is very pleasant for a barbecue, a get together, or to do some gardening. I look out of my kitchen window during the day at my vegetable garden, longing to go over there and check things out, but there is no way that I can. When you walk in this kind of heat, you feel like you are cooking. My temperature gauge has&nbsp;been much busier than usual, going up into the hundreds during the day, and then back down at night. Mind you, even at nine and ten o'clock at night, recently, it has stayed about 90 degrees. Even with a breeze, the temperatures can be problematic. Because the hills are so dry this time of year, there is a great risk of fire. All it takes is a careless action of throwing a cigarette out of the window, or perhaps a fork lightning strike, and a hazardous fire is on our hands. The sky around Wenatchee has been hazy towards the North for a few days, which means that there is probably a sage brush fire or a forest fire somewhere close by. It is similar conditions to those of the Mediterranean where the fires are raging. It's a hot time, and full of danger.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Related vocabulary: a gauge, to rage, problematic, exceptionally.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The temperature gauge on my car said that it was 120 degrees. I don't think that is accurate.</p>
<p>The bull went into a rage when he saw the red flag.</p>
<p>The situation is problematic. Not everyone will be happy about it.</p>
<p>That boy is exceptionally talented. He plays the piano like a master.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Don't you just long for shade in the middle of summer? I do. Am I a whimp? Should I be tougher and able to put up with the heat? But heat, I think, is almost more difficult to deal with than the cold. At least when it is cold, you can put lots of clothes on. When it is boiling hot and you are only wearing a bikini, there is nothing else you can take off! You have to escape and find air conditioning. And just pray that the electrical connection doesn't fail. I can't imagine what it is like at the moment in Greece where it is so, so hot, and where the fires are so many, and out of control. What can be done? What could be done? How could a government ensure that those kinds of disasters stop happening. In our area, we have fires during the summer most years. One thing that I have seen put in place are the fire barriers. They are long areas of land that have been cleared of trees and shrubs, and which divide planted or forested areas into sections. They are just like wide, dirt roads. The object is to contain a fire. The wide, empty, dirt length stops fires blowing over into more planted areas. It works, in a preventative way. Another preventative measure that is quite common and inexpensive, is to clear forest floors of dead wood, which is often extremely dry and burns quickly. I remember hearing the news last year about fires in Greece which were believed to have been started deliberately. There was a huge reward for information leading to the arrest of the arsonists. I hope they were caught. They should spend the rest of their lives planting trees.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Useful verbs: to long for, to spend (time/money), to put up with, to clear.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I long for the cooler days. In a month they will be here.</p>
<p>We spent all morning together just walking and chatting. Then we went to the shops and spent all of our money.</p>
<p>I don't know how you put up with your neighbors. They are so noisy in the evenings!</p>
<p>The land was cleared of trees and bushes because an office building was going to be built there.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>This time of year the summer flowers are fully in bloom. In most gardens you can see different kinds of lillies, daisies, roses, and bulb plants. It's great! I am quite choosy about the kind of flowers I have in my garden. One which I have grown for many years is the Morning Glory. It is a climbing summer flower. It needs plenty of sun and growing space. It is perfect if you want to cover a fence, trellis, or an ugly wall. I grow them every year. Last year I grew some in a large pot that had a metal trellis in it. This year, I decided to grow a variety of them up one of our fences, and it worked beautifully. You can get several different colors and sizes of Morning Glory. The most common kind are bright pink, but they also come in blues. They are also quite strong, though they don't look like they are. They have curly, sticky stems that climb all over the place. When it is windy they manage to hang on and not break. The best thing about them, of course, is the flower. True to it's name, it gives new flowers each morning that only last for that morning. However, it gives many of them, and they are quite spectacular. Often people buy the shocking pink variety, but this year, I&nbsp; have blue. If you check out the photo on my blog page, you will see just how blue. It is really quite a treat to see a new set of flowers each morning, especially if you are not quite sure exactly what you will get.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>

<p>Exs:</p>
<p>Last year we didn't make enough money; this year we made plenty.</p>
<p>Those shoes are very common; you can find them in every store.</p>
<p>The climbing rose grew and became very heavy. Luckily it was supported by a strong, metal trellis. </p>
<p>Those candies are so sticky! After eating them, you have to wash your hands and your face.</p>
<p>I bought myself a piece of cheesecake. I deserved a treat.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong>.</p>
<p>Morning Glories, Morning Glories, ah, so beautiful. However, you have to be careful with them too. Early this summer, when I was planning on planting some, I bought several packets of seeds, and read the instructions. They recommended that seeds are soaked over night before planting. Why? Well, that helps the hard exterior to pop open and allow the seed to root. I followed the instructions, put them in a little tea cup half full of water, and put it on the kitchen window sill until the next morning. Sometime during the following day, I managed to plant them in two different places in the garden. I came in, washed my hands, and sat down and had a cookie. About an hour later, my throat started to feel very sore. About an hour after that, I found it difficult to swallow. I went to the bathroom and had a look at my tongue and throat in the mirror. To my horror, I saw that the inside of my mouth was covered in sore lumps. What on earth had I done? I tried to think back to the food I had eaten during the day, wondering if I had eaten anything unusual that perhaps had caused an allergic reaction. But, I hadn't eaten anything out of the normal. I suddenly remembered reading, however, that the seeds of Morning Glory have a toxic natural oil, and that you have to make sure that children don't swallow any. Well, that was it. After planting the seeds, I hadn't washed my hands properly before eating. It was a good reminder for me to be extra careful when dealing with seeds, no matter how beautiful the flowers are.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>This summer, my brother has come to visit from New Zealand. We are having such a fantastic time together. He is wonderful person, and also a complete goofball! That is an american expression for a person who jokes and fools about. He has a very dry sense of humor, but he can also make children laugh very easily. When we went to Lake Roosevelt recently, he travelled in the car with us. We chatted away, observed the countryside, talked about old times, and stopped a few times on the way to stretch our legs and have a drink. My children are not really used to travelling in the car for three hours at a time, and the car was really packed with luggage and beach equipment, so they got 'squirmy' as they say here. You know how a worm wiggles when it is uncovered, well that is squirming. They started to bicker and argue until it became unbearable. Well, my brother sprang into creative action. He taught the kids in a few seconds about pulling a 'museum face'. They each had to act like a statue, but a very wierd, ugly one. It instantly made them laugh and stop bickering. Fantastic! I just had to write a podcast about the museum face to help my podlisteners who have children. That's my excuse. Check out my brother's museum face; it is utterly goofy. Hey, this is my podcast after all. I can't be professional all the time. Enjoy the photo!</p>

<p>Sometimes driving in the car with the kids is quite difficult. Any of you who have children will probably understand. At times my kids will drive me completely crazy.

If I was a robot, and always responded the same way to their bickering, perhaps it would stop. If I would consistently talk reason to them and convince them that it is better to stay quiet, or work things out together, then bickering might become a thing of the past. The trouble is, I'm not a robot. I'm an emotional human being who sometimes acts differently from one day to the next. Sometimes my response is an easy, &quot; If you are all quiet, I will buy you a candy.&quot; Or, I get the guns out, &quot;I'll tell Dad about you being naughty in the car,&quot; or &quot;Don't even think about having a play date with your friend if you're acting like that!&quot; I have a catalogue of responses which vary in effectiveness. One thing I've found, though, that truly helps, is having help from another adult, especially if that adult is imaginative. My brother's museum face is a wonderful solution to the kids' bickering. It distracts them, it cheers them up, and it brings out their goofiness. If you see my brother's photo on my blogpage, you will understand that goofiness is definitely an inherited thing.</p>

This summer, my brother has come to visit from New Zealand. We are having such a fantastic time together. He is wonderful person, and also a complete goofball! That is an american expression for a person who jokes and fools about. He has a very dry sense of humor, but he can also make children laugh very easily. When we went to Lake Roosevelt recently, he travelled in the car with us. We chatted away, observed the countryside, talked about old times, and stopped a few times on the way to stretch our legs and have a drink. My children are not really used to travelling in the car for three hours at a time, and the car was really packed with luggage and beach equipment, so they got 'squirmy' as they say here.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The color yellow is very 'in' at the moment, mainly because of the Tour de France. It is a spectacular event that my husband and I follow every year. Infact, now that it is over, we are in mourning. &quot;What are we going to do now, Babe?&quot; I asked my husband this morning as we turned on the taped version (we are about eight hours behind France where we live). &quot;I really don't know...&quot; he answered, sadly. Happily for us, though, we have a DVR, so we have the whole tour recorded, and we can skip through all of the commercials in just a few seconds. What a relief! I can't imagine having to watch hours of the same commercials just in order to see the bicycle race. Anyway, we sort of celebrated Alberto Contador's win today, and Mark Cavendish's successful entrance into Paris, by going on a bicycle ride around one of the local parks. My husband is a serious cyclist, but I am just a beginner. I suppose I'm not particularly competitive; I don't really care about racing. When I ride my bike, I like to only push myself a little bit. All the straining and pain, I think, are overrated. I like to look at the trees and birds and enjoy the wind in my face. I would make a terrible professional cyclist. First of all, no one would sponsor me because I would lose all the time. Secondly, I just don't have the build for sprinting or climbing. </p>

<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Alberto Contador was quite incredible to watch this year. It is amazing what you learn about these competitive athletes by listening to the commentators over the course of three weeks. We have all heard about Lance Armstrong, the amazing physical animal that he is, overcoming horrendous cancer, and winning seven times. But did you know that young Contador also had quite a scare. Apparently, during a race, he collapsed. It was found that he had a brain haemorrage. He was immediately operated on, and had a titanium plate put in his head. It sounds awful doesn't it? Well, he is obviously fine now. Infact, he is so fine, that he has won three major tours this year: Il Giro D'Italia, The Tour Down Under, and the Tour de France. Three in seven months is really quite incredible. &quot;This is like watching a James Bond movie,&quot; says my husband every time we sit down to watch the Tour. You have the incredible athletes with thighs like tree truncks, flying up steep mountains at a rate that makes me feel dizzy. Then, you have the spectacular views of France, and all the historic information of buildings and towns. All that is lacking is a good gun fight and perhaps an explosion or two. But James Bond or no James Bond, I'm celebrating Contador's win. I am a half Spaniard, after all. My loyalties lie in that part of the world. I know the Spanish culture well, and I can guarantee that there will be huge celebrations all over the country. So, I will join the party from my little corner of the planet, lift a glass of Rioja, and say, &quot;Well done, Alberto!&quot;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>What sort of things do you like to do during the Summer. Are there any activities that you are particularly fond of? What about when you were a child? If I could sit down and chat with all of you, I would probably be able to write a long list of things that people like to do in the Summer months. Here, our time is mainly spent around water. It's really too hot to do anything else. It's too hot even to go for a walk. Yesterday I took my kids and my brother to a nearby riverbank. The beach area was just the right size for us. It was sandy, but had enough rocks and tree debris to keep the young ones entertained. We took the dogs; it would be a treat for them to be next to the river. Buckets and spades were an essential part of the trip. I remember when I was little, we always had buckets and spades around. They are so very useful. Castles and forts can be built by using them, but then, of course, they can carry water, pretty stones, and even slimey creatures. They can be used for standing on to help you get something that is out of reach. They can even be used as hats, if your head is small enough. Well, when I was little, I used buckets for just about everything, and my kids do the same. Our trip down to the riverbank became very creative and fun because of those simple, plastic tools.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>The fishermen fished quietly from the riverbank, and eventually caught a trout.</p>
<p>My two year old got into the flour bag and made a terrible mess; thankfully, the medicines are out of reach!</p>
<p>After the bombing, it took hours to clear the debris.</p>
<p>I was on the phone with my sister for two hours; we chatted about all sorts of nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, the weather turned out to be a bit overcast, and therefore cooler than normal. It was perfect weather for sitting on the beach. In between overseeing the dogs, making sure that they didn't run off, and watching a group of fish jump for flies, I observed my children constructing all sorts of sandy projects using their buckets and spades. Whenever they would get too hot, they would fill up their buckets with water and dump it on eachother. At times this was good, but at other times a fight would ensue, and I would have to quickly step in as referee to keep the peace. Then everyone would settle&nbsp;down and&nbsp;get on with their projects. Nobody wanted to build sandcastles, so they carved long channels that forked towards the river instead. When these were ready, they would fill up their buckets with river water, run up to the top of the channel, and start the waterfall. They did this countless times, and didn't grow tired. Only occasionally would the work stop to the sound of,&quot; Hey, where's my bucket?&quot; Everyone would look around, and invariably it would be found floating down the river. There would be a huge splash of bodies, and the thing would be retrieved. It would be handy to train the dogs to go after those floating buckets; mind you, it would be handy to have the dogs trained in any way at all! One of our dogs, Foxy, loves to swim and retrieve sticks from the water. Rosie, on the other hand, prefers to sniff around in the debris for mice and rabbits, one of which she almost caught. It was a great day! It was full of activity. By the time we came home, hosed everyone and everything down, and vacuumed out the car, I was exhausted. It was time to put my feet up and have a very needed cup of tea.</p>

			<title>Story time part 5, a Black history.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Story_5.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was dark by the time Thomas Black got home that night. He had lingered in the workshop, putting final details on cabinetry and tables. He had needed the time to be alone, and to digest Theo's words. He was disturbed by her account of the Whitcome tragedy, and by what he had learned about that family's misfortunes, resentment, and growing hatred over the generations from the time of Peter Whitcome. A curse was something that Thomas refused to believe in; it was fantasy, irrational. A man made his own way, good or bad, according to the Blacks. But something about the way Theo had spoken to him, the clarity of her eyes, the intensity of her voice, made him believe that there was danger in the village.</p>
<p>At dinner, he had shared his thoughts with Annette, his wife. "For God's sake love, tell the vicar and the police, and have done with it," she said, irritated that he had been carrying this concern. "Tom, it's not our business. This village is fine; nothing ever happens here. One incident and an old woman's words don't mean anything." She took up the dinner plates and put them in the sink. Leaning against the countertop, she folded her arms and looked at him,&nbsp;half smiling, " Don't tell me you need more adventure in your life.&nbsp;You'd look good in a Sherlock Holmes outfit."&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas stood up and pulled her to him, wrapping his rough, muscular arms around her waist. He chuckled, "Ay, and all the clues would lead to my wicked wife!" They kissed, and immediately&nbsp;he felt freer. He knew he would just by touching her. If he was reasonable, she was much more so, and he relied on that.</p>
<p>Later that night, he left the house to tell the police and the vicar what he had heard. He was going to hand over this stupid, complicated mess to the people who could deal with it, or dismiss it. The first place to visit was the Crowlies. He was the local policeman, wiry, efficient, and conservative, not much of a Sherlock Holmes, but suited to village life. Thomas expected the conversation to be short, and that he would be put at ease. If there was any more to be said, Crowlie could talk to Theo, after all, it was nothing to do with him. "I wish I'd been told all of this sooner, Tom," said Crowlie, sitting back in his chair in his home office. "We've had no amount of trouble with the Whitcomes since I can remember: fights, stealing, arson.." he trailed off. "What!" said Thomas, almost in a whisper, a sudden thump of forboding in his stomach. "Look Jim," he continued, "I don't know about any of this or&nbsp;the Whitcomes; this is the first I've heard. And somehow, trying to help, I've got involved. Now, I don't know if what Theo says is true, but I just want the whole thing laid to rest." "Well, don't we all Tom," replied Crowlie. "Ninety-five percent of good folk want the same. Look, I know Theo. She's the last truth teller of what's left of the Whitcomes. She's what's kept them alive, and out of the worst of it. But their generations have gone from bad to worse. The last of them are spoiled, selfish, and senseless." "So, there is danger to the village?" asked Thomas uncomfortably. "There's always danger to the village Tom. Don't be deceived, just because it's quiet and bonny. We're just good at keeping what goes on on the outskirts quiet." There was a long pause. "What has any of this got to do with me, Jim? Why did Theo come to me?" "So you haven't figured that one out yet, Tom," said Crowlie standing up and leaning towards Thomas. "It was a Black who sent Peter Whitcome to his grave."</p>]]></description>

But something about the way Theo had spoken to him, the clarity of her eyes, the intensity of her voice, made him believe that there was danger in the village.
At dinner, he had shared his thoughts with Annette, his wife. "For God's sake love, tell the vicar and the police, and have done with it," she said, irritated that he had been carrying this concern. "Tom, it's not our business. This village is fine; nothing ever happens here. One incident and an old woman's words don't mean anything." She took up the dinner plates and put them in the sink. Leaning against the countertop, she folded her arms and looked at him,&nbsp;half smiling, " Don't tell me you need more adventure in your life.&nbsp;You'd look good in a Sherlock Holmes outfit."&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas stood up and pulled her to him, wrapping his rough, muscular arms around her waist. He chuckled, "Ay, and all the clues would lead to my wicked wife!" They kissed, and immediately&nbsp;he felt freer. He knew he would just by touching her. If he was reasonable, she was much more so, and he relied on that.
Later that night, he left the house to tell the police and the vicar what he had heard. He was going to hand over this stupid, complicated mess to the people who could deal with it, or dismiss it. The first place to visit was the Crowlies. He was the local policeman, wiry, efficient, and conservative, not much of a Sherlock Holmes, but suited to village life. Thomas expected the conversation to be short, and that he would be put at ease. If there was any more to be said, Crowlie could talk to Theo, after all, it was nothing to do with him. "I wish I'd been told all of this sooner, Tom," said Crowlie, sitting back in his chair in his home office. "We've had no amount of trouble with the Whitcomes since I can remember: fights, stealing, arson.." he trailed off. "What!" said Thomas, almost in a whisper, a sudden thump of forboding in his stomach. "Look Jim," he continued, "I don't know about any of this or&nbsp;the Whitcomes; this is the first I've heard. And somehow, trying to help, I've got involved. Now, I don't know if what Theo says is true, but I just want the whole thing laid to rest." "Well, don't we all Tom," replied Crowlie. "Ninety-five percent of good folk want the same. Look, I know Theo. She's the last truth teller of what's left of the Whitcomes. She's what's kept them alive, and out of the worst of it. But their generations have gone from bad to worse. The last of them are spoiled, selfish, and senseless." "So, there is danger to the village?" asked Thomas uncomfortably. "There's always danger to the village Tom. Don't be deceived, just because it's quiet and bonny. We're just good at keeping what goes on on the outskirts quiet." There was a long pause. "What has any of this got to do with me, Jim? Why did Theo come to me?" "So you haven't figured that one out yet, Tom," said Crowlie standing up and leaning towards Thomas. "It was a Black who sent Peter Whitcome to his grave."]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>A Tour of Homes 7, in the refrigerator.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/fridge.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Now that it is hot, I think a lot about the fridge. What is in there that will cool me down? Actually there are things lurking in the back of the fridge that have been there for a while. It's time for a cleaning. We seem to go through gallons of juice and milk in these hot, thirsty days of Summer. But what about cold food?As I look in the fridge I can see what you probably see in your own fridge: a vegetable drawer at the bottom, a fruit drawer next to it, then lots of shelves with bottles of milk, yoghurts, cheeses, butter, wrapped meats, jars of various sauces and jams, and those wonderful leftovers. Out of everyone in my house, I think I'm the only one who loves leftovers. Sometimes I will bung a few of them together, add some spices, and make a leftover stew. You can't beat it! The other fussy individuals in the house will have to eat fresh food instead of trying my imaginative creations. But, cold is the focus at the moment. Whether it is a salad, a cold soup, cold cut meats or a dessert, it is what we are all looking for. I recently bought seven boxes of jello from the supermarket to make a dessert especially for the kids. It is quite a show piece if it is done correctly. It actually doesn't have a name, but it is like a seven layer cake, except it is made entirely out of jello. Perhaps you can follow the recipe and instructions with me, and make one for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Fridgey vocabulary: to lurk, vegetable drawer, leftovers, stew, cold cut meats.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>As I cleaned out the fridge, I found an old, moldy piece of cake lurking in a dark corner. I think it had been there for several years!</p>
<p>The vegetable drawer is stuffed with salad vegetables.</p>
<p>I still have some leftovers from the roast dinner: potatoes and meat.</p>
<p>There is nothing better than a beef and vegetable stew on a freezing winter day.</p>
<p>They had the most interesting cold cut meats: slices of salami, ham, roast beef, and bologna.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The seven layer jello dessert is a simple project, but it does take some time, as you will see. You will need:</p>
<p>7 packets of different flavored jello</p>
<p>1 large glass bowl</p>
<p>1 plastic or wooden mixing spoon</p>
<p>water according to the instructions</p>
<p>fruit and/or whipped cream (optional).</p>
<p>Making sure that the bowl is completely clean and free of dust, mix up the first packet of jello with boiled water (from a kettle or a saucepan). Make sure that the jello is completely dissolved. It speeds up the process if you add a few ice cubes to the mixture. Pour into the glass bowl and put immediately in the fridge. Go about your normal business. When the first layer of jello is just about set, repeat the steps for the second layer, making sure that it is cool enough to pour on the first layer without melting it. Put back in the fridge. Repeat these steps for the other five packets of jello. If desired, to make it more interesting and healthy, add fruit to some of the layers. When the final layer has been added, allow the dessert to cool until it is very firm. Take out and run hot water over the sides of the bowl in order to loosen it. Put a large plate over the bowl and quickly flip it upside down. Decorate with fruit and whipped cream on top.</p>
<p>This is a very popular dessert with children. Try to buy varying flavors that differ greatly in color. For example: raspberry (purple-red), then lime (green), then blueberry (blue), then lemon (yellow) etc etc.</p>
<p>If you try it, let me know how it turned out.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Related vocabulary: free of dust, dissolve, to go about one's business, firm.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>My new cleaner is fabulous. My house is completely free of dust for the first time ever.</p>
<p>The washing powder didn't dissolve, so when I took the clothes out, they had clumps of soap all over them.</p>
<p>Look, I'm really busy right now. Please, just go about your business until I'm available.</p>

			<title>The Homestead Cafe and art.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Homestead.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Today I will start at the end of a story to tell you a story. It was at the very end of our stay at Lake Roosevelt, that we stopped at an oasis. I say oasis because The Homestead Cafe is one of very few great restaurants in a&nbsp;remote area. There are not many shops or restaurants in the Lake Roosevelt area, so you have to bring most of the food you eat with you. It is also quite far away from any major towns. Though we had plenty to eat in the house that my mother had rented, our choices were limited.&nbsp;When you are living in someone else's place, sometimes it is hard to get used to the kitchen, as well. The coffee maker that was there was a mystery. The three of us: my mother, my brother, and&nbsp;I couldn't figure out how to turn it on!&nbsp;Now, trust me when I say that we are three intelligent individuals, but still, it's a bit&nbsp;worrying to&nbsp;admit that we couldn't do it. Anyway, after our relaxing vacation we headed out on Highway 2 back towards Wenatchee. On the way, we travelled through the little town of Wilbur. Right there on the main road was The Homestead Cafe, and it was breakfast time. As soon as we walked in, we felt at home. The interior was casual and very homestead-like, very woody and basic. It was clean and smelled like fresh food, a good sign.&nbsp;We had a big breakfast of gammon, eggs, hash browns, pancakes, and what seemed like gallons of fresh coffee. It was just what we needed. After travelling over miles and miles of flat wheat fields, the Homestead Cafe was truly an oasis.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;One of the things that I love most about going on vacation is the surprise factor. When we stopped in Wilbur to have breakfast, I had no idea that I would discover a fascinating local artist. She wasn't actually there, but many pieces of her art were on display in the Homestead Cafe. After chatting with our waitress, I learned that the local artist's name is Katie Densley, and she happens to be the mother of the owner of the restaurant. We ate breakfast in one room, and her art was displayed in the ajoining room. She paints landscapes and also makes sculptures out of black wire. The theme of her art showed that she very&nbsp;attached to Eastern Washington, the terrain, the seasons, and the climate. The cafe was the perfect setting for her art. Apparently, she has her own gallery in Wilbur, but unfortunately we didn't have enough time to visit it. It just goes to show that art is everywhere, even in remote, dry areas of Eastern Washington. One of the themes running through Katie Densley's art is the light. She shows the special colors of the setting sun on farm landscapes, and also the many abandoned farmhouses and little shacks are lit up beautifully in the evenings. It was quite a discovery.</p>

			<title>Fishing and surgery.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Fish_and_surgery.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Fishing seems to be a sport that you either love, or have nothing to do with. My father is a fisherman, and has been for most of his life. My husband also enjoys fishing during salmon season. It would be nice, though, if he caught a fish at some point.... Well, my kids love messing about in rivers and streams, as I'm sure most kids do. They have buckets and nets and kids' fishing rods. They also have the real thing. Infact, my youngest son, Robert, bought himself a tackle box with his pocket money. It is one of his treasures. Inside are various compartments for the little rubber worms, the shiny metal spinners, and the colorful floats. He proudly brought the box with him on our latest trip to Lake Roosevelt. I found it stuffed into the back of the car with the rest of the luggage. Well, it turned out that that little box was a very important part of the vacation. My brother took the three boys down to the beach each evening to fish. About the time that the sun was setting, the flies would start to come out, and the fish would start jumping. I would stay at the house with my mother and my daughter and play cards. The second to last evening, about the time that it was dark, I heard excited voices coming up the road from the beach. It was all the boys; they had caught a fish, and my goodness, they were celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Fishing vocabulary: spinners, floats, worms, to cast, hooks, the reel, bait, tackle.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>When we went fishing, the fish didn't go for the worms, but for the spinners.</p>
<p>After I bought my new fishing pole, I cast out, and immediately I caught a salmon.</p>
<p>I would have caught the fish, but the reel got stuck. It didn't turn because there was a knot on the line.</p>
<p>Our fishing trip was hopeless. We had brought all the fishing tackle but we had forgotten the bait!</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The fish was presented to me as if it were a box of treasure that had just been discovered. It was a rainbow trout, only about one pound in weight, but a great prize for the boys. They begged me to let them help clean the fish. &quot;No problem,&quot; I said, &quot;it's a good education.&quot; So, after washing the fish, we cut it open. Then the fascination for the insides of the fish could be seen on the childrens' faces. I asked them if they wanted to see what the fish had been eating. &quot;Yes!&quot; they cheered in unison. So I removed the fish's stomach and very delicately cut it open. Wow! It was completely full of flies. Infact, we could see that the fish enjoyed catching and eating one particular type of fly. They were very recognizable in the top of the stomach, and further down had become mashed and mixed up. It was very interesting. Then we continued to examine the intestines. The liver was obvious, but boring compared to the colon. I hope these details are not too disgusting for you, my dear podlisteners. My kids looked on in amazement while Robert ran the knife along the fish's colon and squeezed out the....um....the digested fish. &quot;Eww!&quot; they all said, like a little choir. That is the same expression as &quot;Yuck&quot; in the U.K. Well, we finished our gory examination, washed and wrapped the fish, and put it in the fridge. By the next morning, by the time the kids were awake, their uncle Richard had it on a plate, fried up with butter and lemon.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>

<p>When I asked the boys who had broken the vase, they pointed at eachother and said, &quot;He did it!&quot; in unison.</p>
<p>To make the potato dish, the vegetable needs to be boiled and then mashed.</p>
<p>The film was too gory. There was too much violence, and blood and guts.</p>
<p>The criminal was barely recognizable. He had disguised himself very effectively.</p>

			<title>Murder on the beach.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Murder_at_beach.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>As you&nbsp;can see, I'm back from my trip to Lake Roosevelt. We were there from Wednesday until Friday, and the time flew. It took a lot of preparation to get there; typically I overpacked some things and underpacked other things. For example: I took enough food to feed an army, but I forgot to pack toys or coloring pens for the kids, which are essentials for the evening when we have all returned from the beach. When we arrived, I opened the trunck * door, and saw that my children had thrown in fishing poles and nets, which I would have forgotten, and which happened to be very useful. The journey took about three hours. We travelled through countryside that is unusual for me: huge, flat wheat lands that seemed to go on forever. Then we passed through a massive, dry, rocky gorge. It was the type of place you imagine dinosaurs to be roaming around in. Finally, the countryside changed to more hilly and green. The trees were all pine as we approached the lake. It was beautiful, in a very Western, rugged way. After we unpacked everything, we went to the beach. The children ran and splashed, built sand castles and dug for pebbles and anything interesting. It was towards the end of the first day that one of my boys pointed to an unusual collection of objects piled in a shady area of the beach. Bones!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Preterite: fly&nbsp;(flew), forget (forgot), seem (seemed), go (went).</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The bird flew away from the hawk, and hid in a bush.</p>
<p>I forgot that I had left the car running. When I came out in the morning, the petrol and the battery had run out.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Beginners.
As you&nbsp;can see, I'm back from my trip to Lake Roosevelt. We were there from Wednesday until Friday, and the time flew. It took a lot of preparation to get there; typically I overpacked some things and underpacked other things. For example: I took enough food to feed an army, but I forgot to pack toys or coloring pens for the kids, which are essentials for the evening when we have all returned from the beach. When we arrived, I opened the trunck * door, and saw that my children had thrown in fishing poles and nets, which I would have forgotten, and which happened to be very useful. The journey took about three hours. We travelled through countryside that is unusual for me: huge, flat wheat lands that seemed to go on forever. Then we passed through a massive, dry, rocky gorge. It was the type of place you imagine dinosaurs to be roaming around in. Finally, the countryside changed to more hilly and green. The trees were all pine as we approached the lake. It was beautiful, in a very Western, rugged way. After we unpacked everything, we went to the beach. The children ran and splashed, built sand castles and dug for pebbles and anything interesting. It was towards the end of the first day that one of my boys pointed to an unusual collection of objects piled in a shady area of the beach. Bones!
Grammar notes.
Preterite: fly&nbsp;(flew), forget (forgot), seem (seemed), go (went).
Exs:
The bird flew away from the hawk, and hid in a bush.
I forgot that I had left the car running. When I came out in the morning, the petrol and the battery had run out.
My uncle seemed tired last night. I think he has a lot on his mind.
I didn't want to go to the beach; it was too hot. So I went to the mall instead.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>On the sixth of this month, I took my children to Seattle to go to the Pacific Science Center. We do not go to Seattle very often, so I thought that, now that it is summer, I should make the effort and make the three hour drive over the mountains to spend some time in that fantastic city. My children were so excited. Part of the journey was to pop in and visit my sister-in-law and her five children. Yes five! Phew! She's a smart lady; she has a nanny four days a week to help her with all the children and their busy lives. We arrived at their house at about one o'clock in the afternoon, chatted for a while, the kids played with their cousins, and then we left for the Science Museum. Three of the cousins came with us and the nanny, called Amy. I was relieved that Amy wanted to go also because I have no idea how to get around Seattle. It really helps to follow someone else who actually has an idea where they are going. I am sure that in future podcasts I will be telling you about areas of the museum that we visited; there was so much to see. However, the last section of the museum that we experienced was the butterfly sanctuary. It wasn't very big, but it was so, so beautiful. There were tropical type plants all over the place, lots of blooming flowers, protective netting walls, and most importantly, stunning butterflies fluttering around all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Preterite: to pop in/ out, to be, to chat, to come.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>My mother popped in to see me this morning to help me bake some pies.</p>
<p>I was ready to go to the shops early in the morning, but my children weren't.</p>
<p>We chatted nearly all night. It was so good to catch up with my friends.</p>
<p>My cousin came to visit us for Christmas. </p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>As we walked into the high, humid room, I breathed a sigh of relief. Most of the day had been exhausting for me, even though it was also fun. Bringing four kids on a three hour car journey over the mountain passes, trying to negotiate my way through a city that I don't know, and then going into a museum where they took off and ran in all directions like mice that had been let out of their cages, had just about finished me off. But, then we walked into the butterfly sanctuary, and it was all stillness and quiet. &quot;Oh, mummy look!&quot; I heard countless times as my kids would see a delicate, fluttering beauty float past our eyes just as if we were parts of the scenery. The &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahs&quot; that I heard reminded me of the &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahs&quot; from the night of the 4th of July. And the reasons were similar. Surprises of sudden beauty. There was a collection of a large, brilliant blue species, some tiny, pretty black and white ones, and a black and red beauty that I was really taken with. It was such a pleasure to be quiet and take in the sights. There were very strict rules to follow inside the room: no running, no touching the butterflies, no eating or drinking, and no leaving until we had been thoroughly checked. Why would we need to be checked? Because the butterflies have the habit of landing on people without them realizing, and if those people are not checked, they could walk off with a precious creature!</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief after the exam; it was something that I had been very concerned about.</p>

			<title>Independence Day.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Oh my&nbsp;goodness, we're all tired today. Thankfully it's Sunday, and there are not a lot of pressing things to do. Yesterday was the 4th of July, Independence day, here in the U.S. As you can imagine, it is an important and fun national holiday, and a great excuse to make a lot of noise. We started the celebrations, by going to a local golf club for lunch. My in-laws were there and three of our nephews. It was close to 100 degrees, so we were all pleased to jump into the swimming pool that overlooks the golf course. The children had a great time. There was also a barbecue. Hamburgers, hotdogs, baked beans, coleslaw, and tonnes of things to put all over the meat: onions, tomatoes, chilis, mustard etc etc. That and an ice cold drink hit the spot! I lazed by the swimming pool and watched the children splash about, giggle, and in the case of my daughter, squeal at a pitch that is not humanly possible. It was actually too hot for this english girl, so I jumped in the pool a few times to cool off. I 'hogged' the parasol, as they say here. That means that I absolutely made sure that I could be completely shaded; I was not about to be generous&nbsp;with the little bit of shade that was available. At about four o'clock, it was actually hotter than when we first arrived, so we headed home. I cleaned a few rooms, and my husband and our boys prepared the entertainment for the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Expressions: pressing, to hog, to hit the spot, coleslaw.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I have some pressing business today. I must get to the office early and be thoroughly prepared!</p>
<p>He hogged the whole sofa! He didn't let anyone sit on it!</p>
<p>I was really hungry before we got to the restaurant. Gosh, that fish and salad hit the spot. It was exactly what my body needed.</p>
<p>To make coleslaw you must do the following: shred cabbage and carrots. Add raisins, and mix with mayonnaise. It's that simple.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>As night fell, it became beautifully bearable outside. The harsh sunshine was no longer beating down on everyone, so friends, family, and neighbors started to gather in our cul-de-sac to let off fireworks. This is a job for the men, ladies. And it's no job for the faint hearted. Each of the men had a large box or several, of all kinds of terrifying looking explosives. Rockets, blasters, bangers, screamers, and, just for those of use who actually enjoy seeing something beautiful that doesn't go &quot;BANG!&quot;, some pretty, colorful fireworks. Chairs were lined up for people to relax and watch the show. There was pizza, cake, homemade icecream, and fresh cherries sitting on the back of a pick-up truck for anyone who fancied a bite to eat. So, one by one, the men put a firework in the middle of the empty cul-de-sac, lit it with a lighter, and quickly got out of the way. &quot;Boom! Bang! Crash! Flash! Boom!&quot; The noise went on and on. Some of the children would hold their ears, and the others just loved the noise, and jumped up and down with excitement. My daughter and her younger cousin wanted to stay in my house and watch from a window. I was actually pleased about that, as my head was throbbing from all the explosions. Supervision was the word for the night, I think. My sister-in-law, Lisa, watched the children like a hawk, making sure that none of them got too close to hot fireworks. In the dark, lots of accidents can take place, of course. But, thankfully, everyone was fine, and a lot of fun was had by all.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Vocabulary: cul-de-sac, faint hearted, to fancy, to throb.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The street where we live is not a through street, it is a cul-de-sac.</p>
<p>My neighbor is very faint hearted. She doesn't like loud noises, scary movies, or anything that moves quickly.</p>

			<title>A new harvest.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/harvest.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I really enjoy is gardening. I have a patch of vegetable garden in one of the corners of our back yard. It has four raised beds. Two of these are wide wooden boxes which my husband put together. In these I put a mixture of manure, compost, and soil, a perfect combination to grow healthy vegetables. The other two raised areas are just piles of earth, but still, they are packed with tomatoes, peppers, and raspberries. My two favorite raised beds are quite organized. They have rows of all kinds of vegetables which will very soon produce a harvest. Here's the list: beets, tomatoes, onions, peppers, strawberries, collard greens, carrots, and lettuces. And that's only the first raised bed. Then, in the second, I've got rows of green pole and bush beens, parsnips, and loads of sugar snap peas, or 'mange tout'. Now that everything is growing up nicely, I love to visit the area, pull weeds out, pick whatever is ready, and then just sit in the shade of the nearest tree and contemplate. My children help me sometimes with the watering and weeding, but most of the time I actually prefer to do it myself; it's the one area of my home that I seem to have control of!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Veggy vocabulary: parsnips, beets, collard greens, manure.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I love to have a roast dinner. Especially when those wonderful, white, winter parsnips are available.</p>
<p>Beets are a very&nbsp; healthy, colorful vegetable. But be careful! The purple juice stains terribly.</p>
<p>If you cut out the main stem of collard greens, boil them, then stir fry them in garlic and butter, you will have a meal from heaven. </p>
<p>It's handy having goats and chickens next door. I can ask our neighbor for some of the manure for my vegetable garden.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever eaten sugar snap peas? They are one of my favorite snacks. When they are in prime condition, they are green, crunchy, juicy, and sweet. Yummy! You can eat them raw or cooked. Chinese stirfries are especially good with them, as long as you don't overcook them. At the moment we have plenty growing in our vegetable patch, and only a small percentage have been harvested and eaten. A key to keeping the production up is to fertilize and give extra water just after picking the ripe ones. If you do that, the plants are strengthened to continue production. There are all kinds of tricks to getting the most out of the vegetables. My mother has always grown vegetables, and so she always has great advice for me and my garden. &quot;Lay the tomato plant down, as if it is in bed, when you plant it. The more the stalk goes underground, the more tomatoes you will get.&quot; Wow! Is that true? Well, it's worth a try. My intention is to eventually grow the majority of the vegetables that we eat, so I need all the advice I can get. One thing that I would love to have as part of my garden is a green house, or perhaps plastic house would be better, so my kids don't break it. We have such snowy, freezing winters that it is impossible to grow anything. I could lose myself planting seeds, transplanting, tending, and harvesting.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>More vegetable vocabulary: to tend, advice, transplant, percentage.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The lady tends to her flowers while her husband tends to the sheep.</p>
<p>My advice to you is to go out and get a job.</p>
<p>Yesterday he transplanted a sapling oak to his front garden. The next day, he had a hair transplant.</p>
<p>I will give fifty percent of the profits to the local orphanage.</p>

They have rows of all kinds of vegetables which will very soon produce a harvest. Here's the list: beets, tomatoes, onions, peppers, strawberries, collard greens, carrots, and lettuces. And that's only the first raised bed. Then, in the second, I've got rows of green pole and bush beens, parsnips, and loads of sugar snap peas, or 'mange tout'. Now that everything is growing up nicely, I love to visit the area, pull weeds out, pick whatever is ready, and then just sit in the shade of the nearest tree and contemplate. My children help me sometimes with the watering and weeding, but most of the time I actually prefer to do it myself; it's the one area of my home that I seem to have control of!
Grammar notes.
Veggy vocabulary: parsnips, beets, collard greens, manure.
Exs:
I love to have a roast dinner. Especially when those wonderful, white, winter parsnips are available.
Beets are a very&nbsp; healthy, colorful vegetable. But be careful! The purple juice stains terribly.
If you cut out the main stem of collard greens, boil them, then stir fry them in garlic and butter, you will have a meal from heaven. 
It's handy having goats and chickens next door. I can ask our neighbor for some of the manure for my vegetable garden.
Advanced.
Have you ever eaten sugar snap peas? They are one of my favorite snacks. When they are in prime condition, they are green, crunchy, juicy, and sweet. Yummy! You can eat them raw or cooked. Chinese stirfries are especially good with them, as long as you don't overcook them. At the moment we have plenty growing in our vegetable patch, and only a small percentage have been harvested and eaten. A key to keeping the production up is to fertilize and give extra water just after picking the ripe ones. If you do that, the plants are strengthened to continue production. There are all kinds of tricks to getting the most out of the vegetables. My mother has always grown vegetables, and so she always has great advice for me and my garden. &quot;Lay the tomato plant down, as if it is in bed, when you plant it. The more the stalk goes underground, the more tomatoes you will get.&quot; Wow! Is that true? Well, it's worth a try. My intention is to eventually grow the majority of the vegetables that we eat, so I need all the advice I can get. One thing that I would love to have as part of my garden is a green house, or perhaps plastic house would be better, so my kids don't break it. We have such snowy, freezing winters that it is impossible to grow anything. I could lose myself planting seeds, transplanting, tending, and harvesting.
Grammar notes.
More vegetable vocabulary: to tend, advice, transplant, percentage.
Exs:
The lady tends to her flowers while her husband tends to the sheep.
My advice to you is to go out and get a job.
Yesterday he transplanted a sapling oak to his front garden. The next day, he had a hair transplant.
I will give fifty percent of the profits to the local orphanage.

			<title>A refreshing park.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/A_refresh_park.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Grab your swimming trunks or your swimming suit and head to the nearest park to cool off this summer. Just up the road from here, a new park, paid for by Rotary, has been set up for the locals. It is in a residential area where there are lots of young families, so it is a perfect spot for kids to run around, play, and get rid of excess energy. The place is actually supposed to be a frisbee park. There is a large, oval, open area, similar to a valley, where people of all ages come and play with frisbees. Often dogs are there. Some of them are real acrobats. They jump expertly for the frisbee and return it to their owner. There is also a long cycling path all around the frisbee area. But the main attraction of this park is the huge water sprayers, a water cannon, and giant water flowers. When the temperature gets up into the nineties the children come out like bees, swarming all over. There are lots of squeals and screams, running around, laughing, and occasionally crying. In general, everyone has a great time getting wet.&nbsp;The parents usually avoid the water, and just sit and watch the goings on. However, every now and then, a giggling child will throw a wet piece of clothing at a mum or dad, just to make them share the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary:</em> to grab, residential, acrobat, to swarm.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>Quickly, grab the child before he runs out into the road.</p>
<p>This area of town used to be residential, but now it is commercial; there are offices everywhere.</p>
<p>He climbs the tree just like an acrobat; he can jump, bend, swing, and, flip.</p>
<p>The bees were swarming over the field. It was a scary sight.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>By the time we had arrived at the park, it was already full of people. I went there to meet up with my friend, Mijung, and her two boys. Two of my boys took bicycles, one took a ripstick, and my girl took her tricycle. For those of you who don't know what ripsticks are, they are similar to a skate board, but the two ends swivle in opposite directions, and that action drives the ripstick along. It's good exercise, very cool, and perfect for the frisbee park. They went around and around the park, heads down, helmets on, with look of concentration on their faces. But after a while they got hot. It was in the upper nineties, after all. So we headed over to the water area for them to cool off. Mijung and I didn't fancy getting wet, so we stayed in the shaded seating area, watching the children. After about a half hour, we heard some pleasant music. It was coming from an icecream truck. &quot;Hey mum, can we have one please, please!&quot; It had parked at the side of the park, and a line of children was forming to buy a cold treat. The little truck was actually painted like a cow, which was a cute idea. They brought their icecreams to the seating area and chatted with us until they finished eating. Then it was off to the playground area&nbsp;to climb and slide. They had cooled off enough, so they didn't need to go back in the water. It'll get hotter and hotter this summer, so there will be plenty of opportunies to come back and cool off.</p>

			<title>Father's Day.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Papas_day.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Father's Day is celebrated here in the United States on the twenty first of June. It is a day when special attention is given to fathers. Shops are filled with cards of all sorts, thanking the fathers and grandfathers for being great people. Young children especially celebrate this day. Just as with Mother's Day, in school, the children will read about families, make cards, pictures, paintings, and small gifts for their parent. Sometimes songs will be learned and sung in a special assembly for the parents. As with any holiday here, the commercial side of it is huge. You can see this reflected in the advertisements in the newspapers and on television. &quot;Father's Day sale at your local hardware store. All drills 50% off!&quot; Fathers are supposed to like and use drills more than anyone else, so it is a good time to advertise and encourage gift buying. Restaurants, hairdressers, clothing stores, and even golf courses advertise special discounts on gifts or services for these special guys.&nbsp;My husband&nbsp;gets hand made cards from our children, usually with a&nbsp;gift of&nbsp;milk chocolate, his favorite. The words of appreciation in the cards are very cute. They range anything from, &quot;I love you dad for&nbsp;playing baseball with me,&quot; to &quot;When I grow up, I want to mow the lawn just like you do.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Useful words: assembly, commercial, hardware, drill, discount.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The children put on a special assembly for the end of school. They sang songs, danced, and read about what they had learned.</p>
<p>This national holiday has become so commercial that I don't like it any more. It's all about spending money!</p>
<p>I need to make a trip to the hardware store. I need a lot of tools.</p>
<p>I need to make some holes in the wall to hang the curtains. Get the drill, would you please?</p>
<p>There is a wonderful sale in the local clothing store. All the clothes are at a 50% discount.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Warning: the next section of this podcast is fast and crazy. Don't panic, I will slow it down the second time&nbsp;so you can pick up some of the slang and humor. This dialogue is actually taken from the Father's Day card that my children bought for my husband. The two characters are called Yo-yo and Hoops. They are reading a checklist of the father's good qualities.&nbsp;Try to read the text while you listen, especially the second time when I slow it down. Good luck!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Ellensburg is a town that is about an hour and a half's drive from Wenatchee. If you take the main road towards Seattle, you will find it on the way. The town is situated in a very wide valley that is pretty and green, especially at the moment because of spring rains and snow melt. We spent&nbsp;this last weekend there because my second son,Cass,&nbsp;took place in the All Stars Championship tournament. It was all very exciting. There were quite a few other teams from different towns, all sporting their different colors. They all looked very smart. All the parents and other family members turned up in the seating areas with baseball hats, fold-out chairs, blankets, snacks, and lots of energy to cheer the teams on. The matches took place at a facility called the Rotary Park. Rotary had raised many funds to pay for this large area of fields to be converted into a sports ground for baseball and soccer. It was all very nicely done, neat, clean, and organized. Well, the matches took place, and our Wenatchee team got into the final. The boys were so excited! Oh, but the emotions were up and down. Sometimes the ball was hit well, and other times it wasn't. Sometimes the opponents' balls were caught out, and other times they were dropped. We parents cheered and moaned, moaned and cheered. Finally, the last inning came and went, and our team took second place. But well done to them! They had worked hard all weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Preterite practice: to spend time, to take place, to turn up.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time with our cousins this vacation.</p>
<p>The concert took place out in the open, near a forest.</p>
<p>The guests turned up an hour early; the party wasn't ready at all.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;One sight that you may be lucky enough to see near Ellensburg, in Kittitas county, is that of wind turbines. They have become a familiar feature in that area, and are giving the town the reputation of green and forward thinking. On visiting Ellensburg recently, I realised just why wind turbines are a good idea on the surrounding hills. The wind, out on the plains of the sports facility, was unyielding. It literally didn't stop. Spring, I know, in many towns, is windy. But the wind around Ellensburg is a power to be reckoned with. That is exactly why state incentives have pushed for the setting up of these giant, white wind machines. There has, of course, been some resistance to the project. Some locals believe that some views are ruined because of these great whirling towers. But, the question is, are they worth it? How much clean energy do they actually produce? Bearing in mind that the average U.S. household uses 10,000 kWh of electricity per year, a 5-MW turbine can produce more than 15 million kWH of electricity per year. That is enough to power about 1,400 houses. Excess electricity can be sold back to the national power grid (which is the national supply). Apparently, if the wind speed is 12 miles per hour or more, it is worth installing a wind turbine. It is certainly a growing trend here in the U.S. There is a lot a land on which turbines can be placed, and a lot of windy areas, like&nbsp;the West coast and Texas, where this energy can be produced. With the need for alternative sources of energy, these large, spinning statues are quickly becoming a welcome source of power.</p>

			<title>Tour of Homes part 6, Herbs and spices in the kitchen.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/herbs_and_spices.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back to The Tour of Homes. We are still in the kitchen, but today, instead of going over vocabulary related to furniture and appliances, lets get on with some cooking. Now, what is cooking without herbs and spices? They make our food so interesting! I have a variety in my kitchen cabinet, all in one place. Often people will have a spice drawer. It's a way to organize all of the spices so you can find what you are looking for immediately. Some of the dishes I cook are fairly simple and don't require herbs or spices, but the most interesting ones always need a few. My Spanish mother cooks a traditional tomato sauce which you may have read about. As far as herbs and spices, it has oregano, parsley, pimiento and chili powder. If you look further back on the blog page you will find a podcast all about it. Another dish that we eat often is a chicken and rice dish. I actually don't have a name for it, but if you listen more, you can learn the ingredients, and try it for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The ingredients you will need are:</p>
<p>2 cups of rice</p>
<p>3 cups of water</p>
<p>1/2 lb lean chicken breast</p>
<p>1 1/2 cubes of chicken stock</p>
<p>1 medium onion</p>
<p>3 tbs oil</p>
<p>salt, pepper, turmeric, and chili powder to taste</p>
<p>You start by&nbsp;peeling and chopping the onion into very small pieces, as small as possible. Cook on low heat in the oil, stirring occasionally, and cover with a saucepan lid. Do not allow to brown. On the chopping board, remove any skin from the chicken, and chop into very small pieces, slightly larger than the onion pieces. Optionally, you can cut into short slices. Stirfry with the onion until there is a slight browning. Add the dry rice and stir. Add water and chicken stock. Add salt, pepper, turmeric, and chili powder, reserving some turmeric and chili powder for the top. Stir thoroughly and let simmer with lid on top until rice is cooked. Do not stir while it is cooking. Every few minutes, check the water level, making sure that the frying pan does not lack water. Top up with water until rice is cooked. When cooked, sprinkle with more turmeric. Serve while hot or chilled.</p>
<p>This is the kind of dish that can be served as a side dish, with a salad, or even a main dish. If you can think of a good name for it, let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Related vocabulary: to brown, to stirfry, reserving, thoroughly, to lack, top up.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The mushrooms we ate last night were browned to perfection.</p>
<p>In my favorite chinese dish, about twenty vegetables are stirfried.</p>
<p>After I made the cake, I reserved some of the chocolate for shavings for the top.</p>
<p>We walked home in the storm. By the time we reached the house, we were thoroughly soaked.</p>
<p>I think, what this soup lacks, is salt.</p>
<p>At the service station I topped up the car with gas/ petrol.</p>

			<title>Scotland</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Scot.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Scotland forms part of the United Kingdom. It is the northern most country of the group, and takes up about a third of the overall territory. Its southern border is with England. On the east side, it borders with the North Sea, on the north and west sides with the Atlantic, and southeast with the Irish Sea. Scotland also has seven hundred and ninety islands. It is famous for the Highlands, a very mountainous area where you can find the highest mountain in the U.K, Ben Nevis, sometimes called The Ben, which is four thousand four hundred and nine feet above sea level. Many people visit and climb 'The Ben' every year. There are two ways to do so: a pony track, or the much harder seven hundred meter cliffs of the north face. Scotland is also famous for its lakes, or 'lochs', of which there are many. The most famous is Loch Ness where, legend has it, there is a monster. The Central lowlands are rich in minerals, and were the center of the industrial revolution of this land. The capital, Edinburgh is found here. Then there are the Southern uplands which are hilly with many valleys. Because of its location on the globe, Scotland is temperate and has oceanic weather systems. It is changeable weather. The western side is milder and sunnier because of the Atlantic Gulf Stream. The western highlands receive over 120 inches of rain every year, and certain, mountainous areas in the north experience a lot of snow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The history of Scotland is fascinating. The first settlers are believed to have built stone houses and communities about 9000 years ago. The first major invasion was by the Romans in the first century. However, the Romans didn't have a lot of luck with the scottish tribes who resisted them, first in the Highlands, and then in the Southern lowlands. The Romans built Hadrian's wall, a rock wall that still exists, partially in ruin, but that extends over the width of the northern most part of England. This was to establish control, and to protect the Romans against attacks from the scottish tribes. By the sixth century, the Kingdom of the Picks or Scotland was established, with English, Gaelic, and Norwegian settlers in the south, west, and north. The country was not yet united until about the thirteenth century. French and English influence because of immigration pushed back the Gaelic language from the south. After the last scottish king died, Alexander 3rd, and his only heir, England became involved, trying to claim a right to the land. This led to the Wars of Scottish Independence. In 1320 Scotland finally pushed out the English and formed the first declaration of independence which forced the English crown to accept their nationhood. Scotland continued to suffer wars with England, a civil war, its own James V1 king of Scots inheriting the crown of England, and then finally in 1707 the formation of the United Kingdom of Britian.&nbsp; Scotland now is self governing and has representation in the U.K governement.</p>

			<title>Travelling Sculptures.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Travel_sculptures.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>For a few years, the city of Wenatchee has been introducing sculptures to the towns people. Every now and then, as I am walking along, I will see a new one. Some of them have been bought by the local council, but others are on loan; they will be in our town for a few months, and then go to another town for a while. It is a great idea. It is also something that is quite unexpected. As you are driving along, or walking through a park, you can randomly see very unusual and often beautiful sculptures. The most recent one that I noticed in a local park is&nbsp;a humming bird. It is appropriate for this area as we have lots of those birds in the summer months. If you have enough of the right kinds of flowers and bushes, you will certainly have a tiny, winged visitor come into your garden. I have a butterfly bush which gets big every year. They love it. If you are very still and quiet, you can sit and watch this little, beautiful creature dart from one flower to another. Its wings beat so fast&nbsp;that you can't even see them. It is like a visit from a fairy; it's quite magical.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Verbs in present and past continuous</em><strong>: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Exs: </strong></p>
<p>They have been introducing art into the community.</p>
<p>She is wanting to find a second hand car; new ones are too expensive.</p>
<p>I (had been) was hoping to find a job immediately, but it took longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The other day, I went for a walk in the local park called Walla Walla. An interesting name, isn't it? It is actually the name of a town that is somewhere in this state, but quite far from here. It sounds as if it might be a native american indian name. Wenatchee is one of those names. Before settlers came this&nbsp;far west, there was a tribe of native american indians called the Wenatchi tribe. They lived&nbsp;nearby&nbsp;this desert valley, surviving on fish and mountain animals, such as deer, and smaller mamals. The Columbia river provided their water needs. Infact, the name Wenatchi means 'River that comes from canyons.' When the settlers came here, the indians were unfortunately dispersed, and, I believe, their tribe no longer exists. However, all over this state, you can find special land reserves for the tribes that still exist. There are also many museums, statues, and relics dedicated to the many different indian tribes of this state. In the nearby town of Cashmere, there is a museum with bone tools that are eleven thousand years old, showing that natives or nomadic tribes spent time here&nbsp;during&nbsp;the last ice age. There is another city, about an hour and a half away, that has a very native sounding name: Yakima. I think the original name had an accent, or an emphasis on the 'i', so the original word sounds like Yak<em>i</em>ma. It's fascinating what a name can reveal, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: settlers, tribe, native, to disperse, reserve, nearby.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>Many of the European settlers didn't know how to survive. They had to rely on help from the indians.</p>
<p>Their family is so big, it looks like a tribe.</p>
<p>She is a native of Norway.</p>
<p>The seeds of the plant disperse and become new plants quickly.</p>
<p>Just down the road from us is a nature reserve.</p>
<p>We don't have Italian restaurants in this town; there are two, though, in a nearby town.</p>

			<title>Splash Day.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Splash.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>The heat is definitely up, here in the eastern side of the North West. Even in the schools, cool activities are organised to keep the kids comfortable. Because this week is the last of the school year, Splash Day is one of the fun days available to the children. It is a day of putting on your swimming trunks and a spare t-shirt, and taking part in about 10 different water activities. Even though there is no swimming pool at the school, the playing field is organised into different stations where watery games are played. I went with my daughter to help out and take photos. We arrived after lunch, just in time to see the huge crowd of third through fifth graders line up and listen to the P.E. teacher give instructions. &quot;No jumping on other people in the little pools. Tidy up your station when I blow the whistle, and follow normal school rules.&quot; And off they went. It was all very well organised, with teachers and volunteers helping out. The kids spent about fifteen minutes at each station, had fun, got wet, and then moved to the next station.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: definitely, available, spare, volunteer.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>That&nbsp; boy is definitely the fastest runner in the school.</p>
<p>I don't need my car tomorrow, so it is available if you need it.</p>
<p>The kind gentleman helped me put the spare tire on my car; actually, he had his own spare tire on his stomach!</p>
<p>We need more volunteers at school to help in the classrooms.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Station one was the 'Slip and slide'. This is basically a long, wide, piece of plastic that has been sprayed with lots of water. To make things interesting, it can be placed on a hill, and you can always add soap to it if you want to make it more slippery. The children line up and then take turns running and jumping on it. Woosh! They can get up to quite a speed. Look out below! The next station was called 'Chicken Delivery.' The aim of the game is to run with a rubber chicken, as fast as you can, past a line of people on either side of the track. The people on either side have large, soft balls that they throw at you while you run. If you get hit, you have to sit down, and you don't get a point. Somebody else from your team has to run up, grab your chicken, and continue to the end. If you don't get hit, you get a point. It's great fun. All the children get very excited, and sometimes the balls get thrown quite hard. It's just as well&nbsp; that they are very soft. One of the other stations was the 'Water Balloon Station.' A willing victim sits in a chair with a water balloon hanging right over his head. The balloon is attached to a metal device that will pop the balloon if it is hit by a ball. The other children line up for a chance to throw the ball at the target. Most of the time, the victim (or, as we say the 'Guinea Pig') stays dry. But when the thrower has a good aim, splash! Cold water right on the head!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Useful verbs: to spray, to slip, to aim, to grab.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I had just sprayed some expensive perfume on, when I went outside and got sprayed by a skunk!</p>
<p>She slipped on a banana skin and broke her foot!</p>
<p>The gunman aimed his rifle, but he completely missed the target.</p>
<p>The thief (robber) grabbed my handbag while I was standing outside a shop. Lucky for me, I had my money in my jeans pocket.</p>

<p>The other day, I was driving along when I saw a man dancing on the side of the road. It wasn't something that I hadn't seen before. This man stands on the side of the main road and dances around waving a sign. This sign advertises pizza. The shop that he works for makes fresh pizzas by the dozen, and sells them for only five dollars each. Mind you, those pizzas are just plain old pepperoni. If you want anything special, like vegetables or chicken, you have to pay extra. It is an interesting sight, a man dancing away with earphones in his ears connected to an ipod, waving a big sign at the traffic. Infact, the other day, the temperature was very close to a hundred degrees. It was unbearably hot outside. Most people were staying in, out of the heat. Thank goodness for air conditioning! When it gets that hot, you stay inside a cool building, or a cooled car. You certainly don't go outside for very long, and if you do, you definitely don't dance. This man is quite incredible. And, you know, he does the business. Lots of people see his sign moving around, so a few feet further, they turn off the road, park the car, and go and buy a pizza or two.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Common expressions: by the dozen, away (to dance/ sing/ talk etc away), unbearably hot/ cold.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I have been receiving bills every day by the dozen!</p>
<p>The two lovers danced away into the night.</p>
<p>The restaurant was unbearably hot, but outside was unbearably cold.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>You know, the U.S is a highly commercial place to live. Everywhere you go there are obvious advertisements for something to buy, something to eat, or something to do. Our local pizza guy is a case in point. He must be one of the toughest men around. Not only does he have a job that keeps him moving, dancing all day, but he does it outside, in any weather, and in any season. That might not seem very drastic to you, but here in Wenatchee, the temperatures get to over a hundred degrees in the summer, and easily to below freezing during the winter. Since he first started working, I have noticed that he has lost weight and become quite muscular. He now also has a good tan. The other day, I drove past him and thought, &quot;He would make a perfect subject for a podcast.&quot; So, I turned into the parking lot that was right next to him, parked, and&nbsp; briefly asked his permission for a photo. He was very polite and agreable. Infact, he asked me how I wanted him to pose. I said, &quot;Oh, you can keep on moving if you want,&quot; so he did. He twisted and turned, and spun around&nbsp; and jumped. He is serious about his job. Either that, or he is addicted to it, and can't stop moving. Either way, I hope that he is paid well. His attitude, adopted nationally, would mean an end to the U.S. problem of obesity!</p>

			<title>Story time part 4, Theo.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Theo_story.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>After Thomas Black discovered the Whitcome grave, the church bell incident loomed large in his mind. He had been ready to dismiss the event entirely, but now he felt as though there was an intruder in the village, a prankster perhaps. Whoever it was, he was not welcome. The uncovering of the grave was deliberate, he was sure, and it had happened just when the village was settling back into its normal routine.</p>
<p>When Thomas walked into his workshop that same afternoon, Jeffrey Mullins, his head carpenter and delivery man, greeted him with, &quot;I see the ladies are chasing after you, boss.&quot; Thomas just made a quick questioning nod but said nothing. &quot;Oh, she was a beauty,&quot; continued Mullins with a stupidly wide grin, his teeth surprisingly white against his rugged, tanned face. &quot;Wasn't she Pat?&quot;&nbsp;he called to a man across the room who&nbsp;didn't look up from his work, but&nbsp;who replied&nbsp;in a monotone voice, &quot;Oh yeh, she was a beauty alright, if you like them old, fat, and ugly.&quot; Mullins cackled loudly and slapped his thigh. &quot;Someone came to see me?&quot; asked Thomas impatiently. &quot;Yep, she said she'd be in the cafe,&quot; said Mullins, turning over a table. &quot;Why couldn't she place an order with either of you?&quot; continued Thomas. &quot;It's not an order she wants boss,&quot; replied Mullins eyes wide theatrically, &quot;she's after you.&quot;</p>
<p>The cafe was empty when Thomas walked in. He could hear plates being stacked in the kitchen and a radio&nbsp;playing&nbsp;music. The room was warm, and smelled like fresh bread. A lady was sitting at a table in the far corner of the room looking right at him. He walked over, &quot;Ma'm, Thomas Black. You wanted to see me?&quot; She looked at him with beautiful, twinkly light blue eyes that searched his. &quot;I'm sorry to take you away from your work, Mr. Black. But I have something tell you that might interest you. The name is Theo, Theo Whitcome. Please would you join me?&quot; she said, offering him the chair opposite hers.</p>
<p>Thomas said nothing but sat down. &quot;I'm surprised we haven't met. I live on the outskirts of town; got a few acres with sheep and crops. It's a small farm, but it does me just fine. It used to be bigger mind you...&quot; she trailed off and looked out of the window. The afternoon sun accentuated the deep lines on her face and made her very grey hair glow. &quot;Yes, I'm a Whitcome. There's no problem with that. But the story about poor Peter is true, you know. He was jilted by the loveliest silly girl in town. Oh, it's no new story, and it happened more than a life time ago. But the heart of that poor young man broke so badly, it destroyed our family. It was the shame of it. It drove most of the Whitcome's away, what with the loss of business and having to sell most of our land. My parents stayed; they were second cousins.&quot; Thomas hung on her words. He had completely forgotten about work, and no longer felt any irritation. &quot;So it was you who uncovered the grave?&quot; he asked. &quot;The Whitcome's grave you mean?&quot; asked Theo. Thomas nodded. &quot;Ah! I know the fool who did that,&quot; she said banging the table. &quot;There could be more trouble coming to the village, Mr. Black. Do you have an ear that's ready to listen?&quot;</p>

			<title>A Tour of Homes Part 5, The Kitchen.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/ovens_and_sinks.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>What an important place the kitchen is. Two weeks ago we covered some of the basic areas of the kitchen; do you remember them? Where do we store the cups and plates? The cabinets of course. And, what would we use if we wanted to make a milkshake? A blender. Good; I'm glad you remembered. Well, how about where all the action takes place? All the washing of vegetables, hands, and dishes, takes place in the <em>kitchen sink</em>. There is an interesting expression in English about this item. A humorous way of saying &quot;everything&quot; or &quot;more than everything&quot; we say &quot;the kitchen sink&quot;. For example: I packed everything but the kitchen sink when we went on vacation.&quot; Obviously it means that the suitcase was packed with so many things, even unnecessary items.</p>
<p>Well, talking about the kitchen sink, there are many different materials one can be made out of: <em>stainless steel, enamel, and plastic</em>. The faucet or tap often has a spout that can turn the normal flow of water into a shower, or <em>an aerated flow</em>. This cuts down on wasting water, and often has a wider spread to touch more items than a narrow flow. The things we use in the sink are: <em>sponges, scrubbing brushes, brillo pads</em> (which are metal wool used for heavy duty cleaning of burnt on food), <em>bottle washers, and wash cloths</em>. We need all of these things to be well prepared for clean up. </p>
<p>Then there is <em>the cooker</em>, as we say in England. Here in the U.S, they generally call it <em>the oven</em>, even though that is just part of what it is. This is the most important <em>appliance</em>. On top, you have <em>the range</em>, with the heated rings. As you know, these can be either <em>gas or electric</em>. The oven is generally underneath. Sometimes, a separate <em>grill or broiler</em> (Am) is between the range and the oven, or the oven is multi-functional and will grill as well. A <em>warming zone</em> is often right under the oven. Here you can keep plates and larger dishes warm. The verbs that we use with the cooker are: <em>boil, heat (up), simmer (which means to cook on low), fry, stirfry, stir, grill, bake, and roast.</em> I'm sure there are more. I will let you know as I remember them. </p>
<p>Before we actually start cooking anything, we must do the all important <em>preparation</em>. For this we need a <em>chopping board, mixing bowls, spatulas</em>, <em>wooden spoons, kitchen knives, a whisk, a cheese grater</em>, a <em>carrot peeler, and measuring cups and spoons</em>. We can get the <em>cook</em> <em>book</em> out to follow a recipe if we don't remember what to do, or if we want to try something new. Now, do you fancy something <em>sweet or</em> <em>savory</em>? Do you have the necessary <em>ingredients</em>? How many people are you going to cook for? If you are lucky enough, you might have an oven that you can <em>preset</em>. That means that you put in a time for the oven to come on, so you put the food in it, go off and do something else, and when you are ready to come home and eat, voila, the food is ready. Oh, I'm in the mood to cook. I love to bake. I also love making <em>roast dinners</em> with loads of vegetables. Next time we visit the kitchen, we will make something together, but until then, I've got some washing up to do.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Useful expressions:</em> lucky enough, to fancy, generally, to cut down on, everything but the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to get the job even though the other candidates were more qualified.</p>
<p>I really fancy fish today. I think the supermarket gets a fresh load today.</p>
<p>That restaurant generally serves high quality food. Only once have I been disappointed.</p>
<p>I must cut down on sugar. I have dental problems, and have recently put on some weight.</p>
<p>Whenever my mother comes to visit, she brings everything but the kitchen sink in her suitcase.</p>

			<title>Music party.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>On Mondays, Domini has her music class after her normal preschool curriculum. It is an extra class that has been added on to the end of the morning, so children can learn a few things about the world of music. She has enjoyed it immensely this year. There are only a few children in the class, but they are all buddies, and they have certainly learned a lot. The teacher, Miss Laura, told us that the last day of class would be party day. Parents were invited to join in the fun and to see what the children had learned during the year. We sat in the sunny playing area of the school while teacher Laura got out all the goodies from her basket: cookies, apple juice, instruments, cards, and colorful scarves. She had everything planned. The children started by parading around, waving the scarves to&nbsp;a certain beat. Then she read a story about a bear which rhymed. Musical notes came next. And finally, the children told us about composers. We finished off the party with juice and cookies while we sat in the sun and chatted. Unfortunately, teacher Laura won't be back next year. I'm sure Domini will miss her. </p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Preterite:</em> to sit (sit, sat, sat), to get (get, got, got)* american = gotten, to tell (tell, told, told).</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>He sat and waited for the train, but when it came, he had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>I finally got the shoes I wanted. I had to wait until the end of the season for them to go on sale.</p>
<p>I told him to be careful with the china. Well, there's another plate in the bin!</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>My calendar has lots of check marks. They have been put there by my children who are counting the days until the long, long vacation starts. In many schools, teachers are wrapping up their classes and giving parties for the end of term. My daughter, who is still in preschool, had a party the other day. I was lucky enough to attend. It was an unusual party, a music party. She has been doing a music class once a week in her little preschool called Seeds. The curriculum was called Music and Me ABC. Each week the teacher read them stories that had something to do with music. They would move and dance to different types of music, and learn about music symbols, rhythm, and even composers. Sometimes, when I would turn up to pick up my daughter, they would still be finishing up the class. At the end of each class, they sing a &quot;goodbye&quot; song that has a great beat. Each child would be sitting on the floor, cross legged, swaying to the music, and singing along with the teacher. They would also have a special treat most weeks of being able to take home a percussion instrument. Great for the kids, - not so great for the parents!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary and phrases</em>: to count the days, curriculum, to turn up, to finish up.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>I am counting the days until the ballet. I can't wait to see it!</p>
<p>I am not very pleased with the school. It's curriculum is old fashioned and limited.</p>
<p>We were waiting at the restaurant for almost an hour! She turned up as we were leaving!</p>
<p>Please finish up the dessert. It won't keep until tomorrow.</p>

Each week the teacher read them stories that had something to do with music. They would move and dance to different types of music, and learn about music symbols, rhythm, and even composers. Sometimes, when I would turn up to pick up my daughter, they would still be finishing up the class. At the end of each class, they sing a &quot;goodbye&quot; song that has a great beat. Each child would be sitting on the floor, cross legged, swaying to the music, and singing along with the teacher. They would also have a special treat most weeks of being able to take home a percussion instrument. Great for the kids, - not so great for the parents!
Grammar notes.
Useful vocabulary and phrases: to count the days, curriculum, to turn up, to finish up.
Exs:
I am counting the days until the ballet. I can't wait to see it!
I am not very pleased with the school. It's curriculum is old fashioned and limited.
We were waiting at the restaurant for almost an hour! She turned up as we were leaving!
Please finish up the dessert. It won't keep until tomorrow.

			<title>Russia.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Russian_pod.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Two weeks ago we learned about Andorra, one of the smallest countries on the planet. Today, we will get to know a little about the biggest country in the world, mighty Russia. It measures over six and a half million square miles, and takes up an eighth of the Earth's land mass. Because it is so huge, its coastline boarders on fifteen seas, two of which are the Pacific and the Arctic oceans. It shares some of&nbsp;its&nbsp;boarders&nbsp;with&nbsp;thirteen other countries. There are about one hundred and forty two million people living there, mainly in European Russia, which is the part of the country that is closest to Europe. There you can find a concentration of cities such as the capital, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Stalingrad, and also those of southwestern Siberia. The climate in Russia is difficult to summarize. Because there are vast areas of land which are far from the sea, these areas have extremely cold winters and extremely hot summers, with spring and autumn being short. The coastal areas are more regulated by the sea breezes. Siberia, to the north, has an obvious arctic influence, and has only one month of summer in the far north. However, in its sunny southern area, there is a very large population, and successful farming.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to sum up history of such an enormous and ancient country as Russia in a simple paragraph, so I will just hit upon some of the major historical points. Russia, up until the sixth century, was inhabited by nomadic tribes. Peoples from Iran and Turkey settled in the south, but were overrun by Vikings who established power. In the tenth century, the Russian leader Vladimir was converted to christianity. For two hundred years, the Russian Orthodox Church thrived, until the Mongols took over. They were expelled in the fifteenth century and the first Tsar, &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; declared himself supreme ruler. The last of the Tsars, Nicholas the second abdicated and was assassinated in 1917, giving way to the Communist Party under Lenin. Russia then endured a civil war, huge losses in the Second World War, and then the Cold War. The Soviet Union was officially dissolved in 1991, and formed a Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia has the largest reserves of natural gas in the world, and is very rich in many minerals. Wealth is bringing transforming power, and infrastructural and social changes are being experienced as a result. This vast and rapidly changing country is closely watched by the rest of the world because of its 'super' status, influence, and modernization.</p>

			<title>A Foxy Chick.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Foxy_dog.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's time for a new dog. For the past year, we have been a one dog family. But, you know, our dog, Rosie, is a wildly social lady. She goes crazy any time she meets another dog, a cat, a mouse, or a bird, let alone a human. But, the trouble is, she's a pack animal like all dogs. They like to have company. During the day, when my husband is at work, the kids are at school, and I am out and about running errands, she is alone. She gets plenty of attention when we are back together, however. So, one of my sons nagged me into going to the pound for a visit. The whole family ended up going. After looking in the various rooms where dogs are kept, we concluded that there wasn't much to pick from. Most of the dogs were large, old, and of the type of breeds that have bad reputations. The poor creatures. I didn't want to imagine their fate; people usually want puppies, or at least a breed that looks cute. Anyway, just as we were leaving, one of the volunteer teenagers brought in a dog. They had just been outside going for a walk. I looked at her, and then looked again because she was a beautiful mix of colors, and looked very healthy and clean. My husband said, &quot;That's the one. It's a Blue Heeler.&quot; Needless to say, after a walk together and a play with the family, we made our decision.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Vocabulary: creature, to have company, breed, reputation.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The tiger is such a magnificent creature. It is beautiful <em>and</em> powerful!</p>
<p>It's time that you had some company. It's not good to be alone.</p>
<p>That breed of dog is too violent. I want one that is quiet and gentle.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>If, when you are learning English, you are lucky enough to visit an English speaking nation, one of the things you will notice is that people in those countries are crazy about dogs. &quot;A dog is a man's best friend,&quot; is the saying. And you will see them everywhere. It has become an obsession with a lot of people. Even in this town where I live, there are doggy grooming salons and a doggy hotel! Perhaps it shows the trend in an affluent society of having less children and more money to spend on entertainment. Dogs have always been valued in farming communities because of the work that they can do, and, to a certain extent, the protection they can provide&nbsp;for their owners. Intruders are warned off by barking, as are predatory animals like cougars and bears. But, dogs nowadays are certainly pampered in ways that are quite unnatural. Having a hair cut is one thing, but beauty pageants? Having their nails clipped is necessary, but a manicure? Or should I call it a pawicure? Well, anyway, if people want to spend all their money pampering and spoiling an animal, that is their business. I was just happy to find a suitable playmate for Rosie. We ended up calling her Foxy because she looks like a cross between a fox and a wolf. She is very intelligent, and has beautiful markings. And her coat is soooo soft!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Vocabulary: doggy hotel, to groom, trend, intruder.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>We are going on vacation next month, so we will leave our dog in a doggy hotel.</p>
<p>That man is poorly groomed. His hair is messy, his clothes are dirty, and he needs to brush his teeth.</p>
<p>The trend nowadays is to buy the largest house possible even if you can barely afford it. It is such a risk.</p>
<p>There was an intruder in the neighborhood last night. A police dog caught him!</p>

			<title>Memorial Day.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Memorial.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Memorial Day is a United States federal holiday that is observed on the last Monday of May. It is to remember all the soldiers that have died in the various wars around the world, even the&nbsp;Civil War which started in 1861 and ended in 1865. The tradition started in this country because of the Civil War, and was expanded after the First World War. Normally, people visit cemeteries and put flowers on the graves of loved ones, even those who weren't soldiers. The graves of soldiers are decorated with flags. It has become a tradition at 3pm local time, that a formal service of remembrance takes place. The President of the U.S will usually visit a famous cemetery and make a speech, and then all across the country, there will be similar services performed by officials of the local government. Though the official day for observing Memorial Day was May 30th, it has become a tradition of celebrating it early and making it into a three-day weekend holiday. Many people plan a short vacation get-a-way. The roads become very busy with families picnicking, travelling to different towns, and also flying to other destinations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: to observe, to expand, remembrance, cemetery, get-a-way.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>It is a tradition to observe that special day. We usually get together with friends and family for a barbecue.</p>
<p>Her waist has expanded quite a bit because she eats too many desserts.</p>
<p>Remembrance Day reminds us of the great sacrifices that some have made for us.</p>
<p>It was such a dark, windy night, that the couple didn't realize that they had stumbled into a creepy cemetery.</p>
<p>I need a get-a-way. Where can we fly cheaply just a few days?</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Seeing a cemetery filled with flags fluttering in the wind is quite a sight. It makes you stop and think. And that, of course, is the point to the day, to stop and think. In England we celebrate Poppy Day which has the same reason as Memorial Day. Poppy Day, however, is observed on 11th of November, as that is the day that the First World War came to an end. Other countries such as Canada and New Zealand also use poppies to observe this day. But why poppies? The reason we use poppies is because a soldier of the First World War, John McCrae, who was a canadian, wrote a poem called <em>In Flanders Fields</em>.&nbsp;Flanders fields were full of poppies, and so, that flower, being a meaningful blood red color, became adopted as the memorial flower. McCrae wrote the poem after witnessing his best friend die in the trenches. He actually threw the poem away, but another soldier found the paper and sent in to a London-based newspaper called Punch. The rest is history. Here in the U.S, the flag is the most well known symbol for Memorial Day because of the reunification of the United States after the civil war. It is very patriotic, but the sentiment behind the symbol is just as strong as the blood colored poppy.</p>

			<title>Story time, part 3.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Story_time_3.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Letters on the grave.</strong></p>
<p>Since the stranger's visit at Cranshawe's cafe, rumors were buzzing around the village. Was what he had said actually true? Who was he? How did he know so much about this old, sad story? And what had happened to Peter Whitcome's family?</p>
<p>&quot;You know, it's really about time we put this whole incident behind us,&quot; said Reverend Holtworth in his church office. Thomas Black had come by to tell him the latest rumors. He actually felt a bit childish reporting the stranger's tale, but, on the other hand, he felt that the vicar should know what was being talked about. &quot;I've no doubt some idiot was up there in the bell tower and disappeared before we got there. And now, well, you know village stories. They just get bigger and bigger,&quot; said Thomas appologetically, seeing a look of irritation growing on the vicar's face. &quot;Well, we've both got work to do, Thomas, but I appreciate you letting me know. I've got a regional meeting in an hour, and a wedding to do out of town this afternoon,&quot; said the vicar putting on his overcoat. &quot;I hear you,&quot; said Thomas, &quot;I've got orders up to my ears; business is good at the moment. We can hardly turn out enough cabinets; everyone seems to want them.&quot; He followed the vicar out of the church and to the parking lot. &quot;We've got a lot to be thankful for,&quot; said the vicar out of his window as he drove off. </p>
<p>Thomas stood and watched him leave. He considered him a good friend. The Black family had been church men for generations, vicars even. Thomas was the first to break that tradition. He had a passion for wood, and building, so as he was a straight forward man, he had set up his own business and done well. But he had an attachment to things of the church, and would help out where and when he could. He took a deep breath, taking in the view of the village that he loved so much. Everything was green or in flower, and the air was heavy with the smells of the season. As he turned his head to look at the trees in the graveyard, his eye caught a&nbsp;light, dry&nbsp;spot among the graves. He walked over and saw that a large clump of ivy had been pulled back from what looked like a very old grave. He bent down and wiped the earth away from the lettering. W-H-I-T-C-O-M-E. He stood up quickly, eyes wide, and he looked around, to see if anyone else was close by. It must have been a recent uncovering, because the ivy roots were not completely dry. </p>

			<title>A Tour of Homes, Part 4,  The Kitchen.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Tour_of_home_kit.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Where do we start with the kitchen? There is so much to talk about. Many people say that it is the center of family life. The kitchens that I will describe are those that I have seen and been in in England and the U.S. To start with, a kitchen will often have a water resistant floor: tile, wood, or vinyl. If you drop food or liquids, it's no problem. Just wipe it all up and wash with <em>soapy water</em>. <em>Cabinets</em> are a big thing here in the U.S. They are the cupboards&nbsp;and drawers that you find in the kitchen. I have noticed in the past few years, that the cabinets are quite a <em>status</em> <em>symbol</em> here. The kind of wood that you use, and the <em>stain</em> on the wood both determine the elegance of the kitchen. The most popular kinds of wood at the moment are<em> cherry</em>, <em>fir</em>, and <em>maple,</em> though the traditional <em>oak</em> is still used a lot as well. The hardware for the cabinets, the <em>handles</em> and <em>hinges, </em>also<em> </em>come in a variety of materials: <em>plastic, glass, bronze</em>, <em>brass, chrome, ceramic</em> and others. You can really <em>make a statement</em> with cabinets, or you can keep them simple and <em>functional. </em>The stain on a cabinet is a kind of permanent color wash. They are used to bring out the grain of the wood, and to add a touch of any color.</p>
<p>So, what do we put inside the cabinets? All sorts of things. Anything from the heavy kitchen equipment like the <em>food processor, the blender</em>, <em>the juicer, the slow cooker</em>, and <em>the waffle maker</em>. Then there are the <em>pots and pans</em> like<em> the frying pan</em>, <em>the wok</em>, <em>baking dishes</em>, and <em>casserole</em> <em>dishes</em>. If you know much about cooking, you will know that there are many other small pieces of kitchen equipment: <em>the sieve, the cheese</em> <em>grater, cake pans</em>, <em>the garlic crusher</em>, and the list goes on and on. <em>Cutlery</em> or the <em>silverware</em> are stored in the various drawers, and there is usually a separate drawer for the larger kitchen cultery, such as the <em>wooden </em>or <em>cooking spoons</em>, <em>spatulas</em>, <em>carving</em> or <em>chopping knives</em>, <em>serving spoons</em> and <em>hand held whiskers</em>. Gosh, we can certainly do a lot of cooking with all of this equipment. Of course, there is no point cooking unless we have something to put the food on. The <em>dinner plates</em>, <em>side/ salad plates</em>, <em>dessert&nbsp;and cereal bowls</em>, <em>glasses, cups, saucers</em>, <em>china</em>, and <em>wine glasses</em> all have to be stored in cabinets as well. </p>
<p>There is so much to talk about when we are in the kitchen. And we haven't even cooked anything yet! We will continue our Tour of Homes in the kitchen the week after next when we will spend some time talking about the main appliances that we use every single day, and the verbs and vocabulary that go with them.</p>

			<title>Andorra.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Andorra_ole.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Andorra is one of the smallest countries in Europe. It is high up in the Pyrenees. If you look at the map of Europe, you can see that it lies exactly between France and Spain. It is a very mountainous area that has spectacular views. Though it is snow-covered for six months of the year, summers are warm and dry. Its capital is Andorra la Vella. Its area is about 174 square miles, and its population is close to 80 thousand. Though Catalan is the official language, there are many French and Spanish speakers as well. The river Valira splits into two and flows south, traveling through valleys and gorges. Several things make Andorra very famous. First, it is a tourist destination. About 12 million tourists go there every year. Wow! That's a huge amount of income and traffic for a relatively small place. Most of the tourists go to ski. A lot of mountain climbing takes place all around, especially on the highest peak which is called Coma Pedrosa at just under 10 thousand feet. Its a healthy place to live! Infact, secondly, it is the country that has the highest life expectancy: 85 years.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: spectacular, official, to split, destination, peak.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The performance was spectacular! What music! What special effects!</p>
<p>Their marriage is not official. They still have to sign the papers.</p>
<p>Let's split (share) our company's profits.</p>
<p>The last destination of the tour is the castle.</p>
<p>The climbers went up one peak after another. They enjoyed the tremendous views.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The history of Andorra is interesting because of its geographical location. The original tribe of Andorra was apparently the Andosinos who lived in the area for thousands of years. In 1278, the government was shared between Spain and France. But then in the sixteenth century, control was handed over to France. However, in 1993, the first democratic elections were held, and the General Council of the Valleys was set up. Because Andorra is protected by both Spain and France, each has a representative on the Council. About one in five people there are Andorra citizens; the rest are mainly French or Spanish. Though tourism is the main source of income, and a tremendous one at that, there are others. Hydroelectricity is sold to Catalunya, and banking is also big business. One benefit of being a tourist in the area is that goods are tax free; it is a tax haven. Among the crops that are grown, tobacco is successfully turned into cigars and cigarettes. Many of the villagers are also farmers, having their cattle, sheep, and goats graze on the plentiful upland meadows.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Verbs: to hold (hold, held, held), to sell (sell, sold, sold), hydroelectricity, income, meadow.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The man was held at the police station all night.</p>
<p>Last year we sold a lot of household objects. This year, I don't know what we will sell.</p>
<p>The dam produces an incredible amount of hydroelectricity.</p>
<p>Finally our income has increased. It's about time!</p>
<p>We had a wonderful picnic in the meadow. It was full of wild flowers.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm interviewing Cass today. He's my second son, and he's nine years old. He's going to do something very interesting on Friday. &quot;What is it Cass that you're going to do on Friday?&quot; - &quot;Uh, we're going to do something called Run for Reading, and that's how we sponsor money&nbsp;for our school.&quot; - &quot;Oh, so you're raising money.&quot; - &quot;Yeh, we're raising money.&quot; - &quot;And, so it's like a running competition?&quot; - &quot;Uh, no.

And where are you going to run?&quot; - &quot;We're going to run in front of the school. And the laps, they're two hundred meters long.&quot; - &quot;Oh, okay.

We've done it for four years, kinder through third.&quot; - &quot;And has it been successful?&quot; - &quot;Yeh, it has.&quot; - &quot;Now, is it just the children who run?&quot; - &quot;No. Well, sometimes. But, during kind of like the middle the teachers come in and then they start running. Or usually they come in at the beginning.&quot; - &quot;Is it funny to see the teachers run?&quot; - &quot;Sometimes.&quot; - &quot;Now, who's the best teacher at running?&quot; - &quot;Um, he's called Mr. Hickenbottom, and last year he ran forty two laps.&quot; - &quot;That's fantastic.&quot; - &quot; It's a great way to raise money. Now how do you get sponsors?&quot; - &quot;Um, you ask your neighbors to get, - well, you give them a piece of paper, they sign it, and you ask them if they could sponsor money.&quot; - &quot;Fantastic. So they give you like a dollar per lap, or twenty five cents per lap, or something like that?&quot; - &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; - &quot;How much money, do you remember, did your school make last year?&quot; - &quot;Um, I think they made two thousand one hundred fifty something.&quot; - &quot;That's great for schools. Yeh. So are there other ways that the school raises money?&quot; - &quot;Um, there's one way that doesn't include activities. It's when you, it's like the same as run for reading, but you just have a paper that time, and you go and ask if they would like to buy cookies or pies or cakes. And if you sell them, then that's how you raise money for school.&quot; - &quot;Right. And do you get an award or a reward sometimes for getting sponsorships?&quot; - &quot;Everybody gets a small ribbon that says &quot;I love running&quot;, and it says, and well it's different kinds of colors, and it's a rainbow kind of color, and it shows a boy and a girl running together.&quot; - &quot;Right. And how about when you sell cookies, do you get any reward?&quot; - &quot;If we sell, let's say, fifty cookies, we would get, let's see, we would get, let's say, a really cool big ball that could bounce really high.&quot; - &quot;So, there's a variety of things you can win?&quot; - &quot;Right, well good luck for Friday Cass, thanks a lot.&quot;</p>

			<title>Dialogue with Doreen.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Doreen_interview.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Doreen is a neighbor of mine. She also happens to be a good friend. She lives just three houses away. We joke that my children have adopted her as another grandma. My two youngest children go and visit her all the time, and she makes sure that they come home with a treat of some kind. &quot;Now make sure that you use &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thankyou&quot;, and don't be asking for treats all the time,&quot; I tell my kids. But Doreen spoils them because she wants to. They cheer her up and make her laugh, so she enjoys their company. She is seventy-five and a recent widow. For a few years, she looked after her husband who was quite ill. Now, she is alone. However, she is very active. She loves to go bowling, go to church, and take her dog for a walk. She also happens to be from England. She was born and raised in the same city as the Beatles. Liverpool, of course! Though she has lost her accent, and sounds quite american, she still seems very english in many ways. She was a war bride. That means that she married an american soldier during the Second World War, and came to live over here. I'll introduce you to her, so you can hear a little bit of her story.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Common words and expressions</em>: happens to be, treats, to make sure, to spoil.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;My neighbor happens to be a teacher in the school where I teach!</p>
<p>During Halloween and Christmas there are too many treats around, - too much sugar!</p>
<p>Make sure you turn the car lights out, or the battery will go flat again!</p>
<p>Grandparents typically spoil their grandchildren.</p>
<p><em>Verbs and the preterite:</em> to look after, to be born, to lose, to marry.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>When I was in hospital, the nurses really <strong>looked </strong>after me.</p>
<p>They <strong>were&nbsp;born</strong> in California, but their mother <strong>was born</strong> in Geneva.</p>
<p>I had a terrible day yesterday! I <strong>lost</strong> my car keys, the mail man <strong>lost</strong> all of my letters, and then I <strong>lost</strong> my wallet!</p>
<p>&quot;I married my first husband when I was very young. But, I was quite old when I married my seventh.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Hello Doreen.&quot; - &quot;Hello. How are you today?&quot; - &quot;Really well, thanks.&quot; - &quot;Good.&quot; - &quot;Thanks for agreeing to this interview. I'll just ask you a few questions. How long have you lived in the United States.&quot; - &quot;Um, I came over on the General Patch. It took us about ten days on that ship. It was very nice. And that was in 1951.&quot; - &quot;So, not that long after the Second World War.&quot; - &quot;We were starting to do the cleaning up. You know, they had a lot of debris and bombed out places. I never got to go back and see it all done right away. I think it was 1982 when I went back.&quot; - &quot;Oh, so you were here for quite a while before you went back.&quot; - &quot;It had really changed a lot. Really nice though. New buildings and the old buildings were all washed. They used to be really black with the coal from the fires, you know. And they washed the old, old buildings. Yeh, they look really nice.&quot; - &quot;So, where did you first live when you came to the United States.&quot; - &quot;We landed in New York, and then we traveled to Denvo Kentucky. Um, then from there we went to Bloxy Mississippi. Um, and I really didn't like that. Too hot, too hot, too buggy.&quot; - &quot;Lots of mosquitos?&quot; - &quot;Lots of everything. Big bugs.&quot; - &quot;So you prefer&nbsp;Wenatchee?&quot; - &quot;I love Wenatchee!&quot; - &quot;Tell me, what is it about Wenatchee that you love?&quot; - &quot;I love the four seasons. I like the mountains, the streams, the rivers, the lakes. I love lake Chelan.&nbsp;That is a beautiful place.&quot; - &quot;And I've heard that you have a little place there on&nbsp;Lake Chelan, don't you?&quot; - &quot;Yes, it's up above. It overlooks Chelan on the south shore. And it's a little dream place.&nbsp;It was a dream for me forever. I&nbsp;said, &quot;I'm gonna save my money and buy a little place up there, 'cause we used to take the children to the little park up there, you know, the main road going in. And we'd get there and it would be pouring down rain, or cold and windy, and we'd be trying to make hamburgers on the little&nbsp;burger thing, you know,&quot; -&quot; A barbecue.&quot; -&quot;And then all of a sudden we'd......&quot; bark, bark&nbsp; &quot;That's okay.&nbsp;That's Scooty her dog. He's part of the interview too. How long have you had Scooty?&quot; - &quot;I think we've had Scooter probably about, um, nine years.&quot; - &quot;And how is he? Is he good company?&quot; - &quot;He's a very....good company and he takes real good care of me, 'cause he lets me know&nbsp;when there are bad people around.&quot; - &quot;He likes women, but he doesn't like men.&quot;&nbsp;- &quot;Absolutely does not like men.&quot; -&quot; Even if they are good men who come to help you around the house?&quot; - &quot;No, it doesn't make any difference. There's something about them that he, you know, he knows man and woman, and when ahhhh, watch out, you know, he goes right after the guys. It's not fair really because he (a male friend)&nbsp;is pretty good with him, you know.&quot; - &quot;Yeh. Well&nbsp;Doreen, that'll be the end of the interview, but I'm sure we'll be having lots more interviews in the future.&nbsp;Thanks so much.&quot; - &quot;Oh, I could tell you so much more.&quot; - &quot;Well, I'm sure my listeners would love to hear your stories.&quot; - &quot;Thankyou so much.&quot; - &quot;Thanks a lot, bye bye.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

			<title>Spring gardening dialogue.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Gardening_dialogue.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Spring makes Wenatchee come alive. Because there are so many flowering trees, like Dogwoods and Magnolias, the town becomes full of pink and white. There are also lots of orchards still; apple, pear, apricot, and cherry trees are grown in this area, so during the Spring, they too blossom. As we get more sun during the day, and the occasional rain, you see flowers popping out of the ground all over the place. During the weekends, as you drive through neighborhoods, the noise of lawn mowers fills the air, and men and women are in their gardens weeding, pruning, and planting. As you probably know, a lot of time and effort go into some gardens. It takes knowledge and planning to get the job done properly. I spoke to a local gardener who takes pride in his garden. Let's listen to what he has to say.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that there is a lot of work involved in keeping a garden up. What are some of the jobs that you have to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, in Spring I aerate the lawn which gets it ready for the Summer months, and the aerator puts little plugs in the grass, ah, that opens up the soil to fertilizer, water and air. So it gets the grass growing; it jump starts it in the Spring.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. And what about the trees? What kind of things do people have to do in the Spring?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Usually, prune the dead limbs, uh, shape the tree, so you'll prune certain limbs and some of the old wood off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right. And does that encourage new growth?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeh. It gets the new, younger wood growing. And, it just makes the tree look nicer, more presentable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay. And what about vegetables and flowers? Do you grow vegetables?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't, nor do I grow flowers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay. What kind of equipment do you use apart from an aerator and a lawn mower? Any thing else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; Well, a weed eater to cut down the weeds and trim the edges of the lawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that also what you use to cut the hedge and shape the hedge?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I use a multi-tool.&quot;</p>
<p>As you can see there is a lot of work and equipment involved in keeping the lawns and the gardens nice in this area.</p>

			<title>A Tour of Homes 3, the lounge/ family room.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/In_lounge.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Tour of Homes 3, the lounge/ family room.</strong></p>
<p>Join me again as we walk through a typical house, and observe all the every day objects that native speakers can name so easily. Before we get started, do you remember any of the vocabulary from the entry way and the powder room? Do you remember another name for an electrical socket? It's an outlet, isn't it. And what about the most important verb for using the toilet? To flush. I'm sure, if you make a list of the important vocabulary and think about it in your own home, you will soon know these words. </p>
<p>Well, let's get started with the lounge. I hope you realize that I had to tidy up my lounge before taking the photo for this podcast; that's how serious I am about you learning! The lounge is one of the places where we spend most of our time at home. Most&nbsp;lounges have quite a bit of furniture: a <em>sofa</em>, <em>arm chairs</em>, perhaps a <em>love seat</em>, a <em>coffee table</em>, <em>side</em> <em>tables</em>, <em>lamps</em>, <em>reading lights</em>, a <em>television</em>, and an <em>entertainment center</em> which includes a <em>dvd player</em>, <em>a stereo radio</em>, and maybe some kind of recording device like an old fashioned <em>video recorder</em> (that's what we still have). Windows either have <em>curtains</em> which you draw (to open and close), or <em>blinds</em> which you pull. To create a nice atmosphere, often homes will have <em>recessed lights</em> which are slightly hidden in the ceiling or in the walls. They create an indirect light which is softer on the eyes. </p>
<p>In these western homes, there tends to be collections of <em>magazines</em> and <em>books</em> on the coffee and end tables. Often the magazines are not read entirely; they are there to <em>flick through</em>. Usually, next to the chairs where the heads of the household sit, the all important <em>remote controls</em> will be within easy reach, on a side table, or in a <em>drawer</em>. This device is sacred. If it ever goes missing, somebody will be in trouble. If a wife innocently moves it from one table to another while she is cleaning, uh-oh, she's in trouble. That's how it is in the Wild West. To use the remote, you must know which <em>buttons</em> to push. Sometimes you must <em>select an option</em>, just like on a computer. Never forget to <em>replace the batteries</em> when the power is low. A <em>telephone</em> is found in a lounge. You talk in the <em>receiver</em>, you <em>dial </em>the numbers, and you <em>hang up</em> when you have finished your conversation.</p>
<p>Well, there is lots to remember about lounges. Obviously, some things that you find in the first rooms that I mentioned, you also find in the lounge, but you can make those assumptions for yourself. Electrical sockets or outlets, for example, would be found in this room, so I won't repeat an explanation of what they are. I hope that you follow me through the rest of the rooms of the house, and become an expert in the daily vocabulary of a native speaker.</p>

			<title>Story time part 2.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Story_2.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>History is uncovered</strong>.</p>
<p>It was a few days after the incident that Betsy Brompton came home from the hospital. The village was buzzing with rumors that she had lost her mind, or that she had made up the whole story. Anyone who knew Betsy didn't believe either. Nevertheless, homes, shops, and businesses were full of conversation about the church bell mystery. Reverend Holtworth and a regional Bishop paid Betsy a friendly visit shortly after her return. Again, the gossip shot around the village. The word &quot;curse&quot; was adding color to everybody's imagination, and since Betsy had uttered that word, the village had not been the same. In the pubs, stories of &nbsp;battles, tragedies, and romances that had taken place in the village flowed like&nbsp;the beer, and the more the beer flowed, the more dramatic and ridiculous the stories. But everyone wanted to believe them, of course. Nothing this interesting had happened in the village since the daughter of a wealthy, local land owner had run off with a clown from a traveling circus. </p>
<p>Since the vicar's visit, Betsy had told whoever asked her that she had not felt well that day, and so had imagined that the bells were ringing themselves. As for the word &quot;curse&quot;, well, she didn't remember saying it at all. She told everybody the same thing, and, though her story was consistent, nobody chose to believe her. It would be a disappointment to believe her story now. This mystery was far to juicy to give up. Perhaps Reverend Holtworth had had words with her about not stirring up panic or superstition in the village. Perhaps he had advised her to believe her new story. Either way, church was full&nbsp;the following Sunday. There wasn't an empty pew, and villagers were even standing at the back. The Rev. was delighted and surprised. The attendance had never been so good. His sermon was about God's order and how it should be reflected in our lives, how reason should control imagination.</p>
<p>By the end of the second Sunday, the church bell mystery seemed to have faded to simply an interesting episode. Mrs Brompton had gone back to work at the church, and though she looked over her shoulder more often, life seemed to be back to normal. But then he came to town. A stranger, who stopped in at Cranshaw's cafe on his way up north, upon hearing about the bells, told a story of the bell tower that took place exactly one hundred years ago. The few people in the cafe were silent as they listened. No one chewed, no one swallowed, no one even blinked. He said that a poor, shy bell ringer by the name of Peter Witcome fell desperately in love with a local beauty who promised to marry him. But she did so as a joke. When he discovered her cruelty, he rang the bells wildly and with such strength that the largest of them fell on him and squashed him as flat as a pancake. His family moved away, vowing that their son would be avenged, even if it took a hundred years. Silence hung in the cafe for several minutes after the stranger left. What would the village make of it all now?</p>

			<title>A family tradition.</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Today I thought about tomatoes. You know when you have one of those days when you simply have to eat something in particular. I went out to my vegetable patch this morning to see if there had been any progress with my tomato plants. Not much. They were still alive, green, and standing up. That's okay; it could be worse. Spring in Wenatchee is quite windy, so if you put out your store-bought plants too early, often they get blown over. But mine were fine, ever so slightly bigger than a couple of days ago. I can be patient. I planned my tomato crop carefully this year. Last year I grew several kinds of tomato plants from seed, and it was a disaster. The plants that grew the best were the Cherry tomatoes. They grew abundantly and everywhere. My children weren't keen on them. They gave some to the neighbors, threw some around the yard, and ended up playing tennis with them. My husband and I ate as many as we could, but we prefer the huge Beef tomatoes. They are not only huge, heavy and fleshy, but they also have a rich flavor. Eating one is like having a meal. I remember going to the open markets in Spain and buying kilos of these large, odd shaped vegetables, taking them home, cutting them in half, and eating them with salt. Mmm, I can't wait for Summer.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Vocabulary: vegetable patch, store-bought, to be keen on something, fleshy.</p>
<p><em>Exs:</em></p>
<p>Everyone in our neighborhood has a vegetable patch; we hardly need to go to the shops for food!</p>
<p>My brother is a carpenter. He doesn't like store-bought furniture, so he makes his own.</p>
<p>I'm really keen on gardening, but my favorite hobby is traveling.</p>
<p>Her baby is so fleshy! Look how chubby and cute he is!</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>My obsession with tomatoes led me to become creative in the kitchen. I think the good weather has made me reminisce about eating fabulous food in Spain. My mother 'invented' a recipe that is tomato based. We ate it often growing up in England. She is a spaniard, and so her cooking is very spanish. She uses garlic, onion, tomatoes, and red peppers as often as she can. Thank God for spanish mothers! It makes my mouth water, just thinking about her cooking. This recipe of hers is called 'Pisto'. If she is asked about it, she makes sure that you understand that it is spelled with an 'i'. &quot;It's nothing to do with Italy. It's not Pesto,&quot; she will say. &quot;Anyway, this kind of sauce could only come from Spain,&quot; she will add. She has every right to be proud of her creation. I even suggested to her that she market it. It would sell like hot cakes, I'm sure. You can use it as a pasta sauce, a dip (hot or cold), or a side dish for meat or fish. We could be rich and famous....or should we keep it as a family tradition, and pass the secret recipe down from generation to generation instead? Well, that's up to her; she's the boss. Anyway, I have had lots of practice making it, and tonight it turned out very well. I got the thumbs up from everyone at home. My kids even asked for seconds at the dinner table. It is made from onions, garlic, tomatoes, a little olive oil, and a few other things that I won't tell you. If you're not part of the family, then you're not privy to that all important information.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Common sayings: to sell like hot cakes; to be privy to&nbsp;..., &nbsp;to get the thumbs up.</p>
<p>Exs:</p>
<p>The new tennis shoes were so popular, they sold like hot cakes.</p>
<p>I don't know what will happen with the family's gold mine; I am not privy to that information.</p>
<p>The union worker got the thumbs up from everyone who heard his speech.</p>

			<title>Spain.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Espana.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>We continue our study of different countries of the world with Spain. This fascinating country makes up most of the Iberian Peninsula that forms the southwestern tip of Europe. Portugal is on its west, and France is on its northeastern border. Though Spain is famous for its beaches along its three coasts, the rest of the land is very varied. More than half of the land is hot and dry, in the central region called the Meseta. It is surrounded by several mountain ranges, from which come three very important rivers: the Tagus, the Douro, and the&nbsp;Guadiana. This country has many mountainous areas, from the Pyrenees in the north, the Sierra Morena, and the Sierra Nevada with its highest mountain, Mulhacen, at about 3,500 meters.&nbsp;About one tenth of Spain is heavily forested. These areas are found in the north where it is wetter. Farming and crop growing are, therefore, mainly found in the north. Spain is one of Europe's biggest producers of wine. Other major industries are: car manufacturing, steelmaking, shipbuilding, chemical manufacturing, and fishing. </p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The history of Spain is no less varied than its geography. It's position on the map has made it vunerable over the centuries to invasion. The Romans first subdued Spain in the third century BC. It remained a colony until, during the fifth century AD, the Visigoths (Germanic) from the north claimed Spain. During this time,&nbsp;Spain was Christianized. In 711 the Moors invaded from Africa and established an Islamic civilization that lasted six centuries. In the ninth century, invaders from the north started the process of expelling the Moors, which was completed in 1492 when the royals Ferdinand and Isabella from the north unified Spain as a Catholic country. That same year, Columbus, under Spanish sponsorship, &nbsp;reached the New World. Spain conquered much of Central and South America and other parts of the world, gained great wealth, and became a super power. This ended at the battle of the Armada against England.</p>
<p>For the past two hundred years, Spain has gone through tremendous changes: wars with France and the United States, loss of colonies, removal of the royal family, civil war, a fascist dictatorship, and finally the reinstating of the royal family and the establishment of a parliamentary democracy in 1978. Phew! That is a lot of history in a couple of paragraphs. The spaniards are known for their friendship, warmth, great food, and love of life, art, and music. Their historical turmoils, and all the cultural influences they have had, have produced a rich and colorful national culture.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Vocabulary: varied, vunerable, to claim, to expel, sponsorship, dictatorship, to reinstate.</p>
<p><strong>Exs:</strong></p>
<p>The school's curriculum is so varied; they have art, science, dance, music, and sports.</p>
<p>The baby Kangaroo is completely vunerable; it is tiny and defenseless.</p>
<p>He claimed that the car crash was the other man's fault; it was a lie.</p>
<p>They expelled the boys from school for destroying property.</p>
<p>I need sponsorship from someone to get money for this sports group.</p>
<p>Is this family a dictatorship, or can we all have a say?</p>
<p>The policeman was reinstated after he was found to be innocent.</p>

			<title>Bubbles and outdoor dialogue.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Burbujas.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dialogue.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Okay, we're interviewing Robert today about his bubble wand, and the other things that he likes to do outside. Okay Robert, what did you find when you came home from school today, that I had bought you?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;I found a bubble sword.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;A bubble sword. Okay. And how do you use it?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;You unscrew it, and then spin around, and then bubbles come out.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, okay. Is it fun?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Yeh? Have you had other kinds of bubble makers?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Uh-huh. One was a ma-, one was a hand-held, and one was a big gun.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;And how did the big gun work?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;You put the bubbles, you put the bubbles,&nbsp;you pour the bubbles into the gun, and then you shoot it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh right, so you pull the trigger. So, tell me, do you like the Spring? What do you like to do outside apart from blow bubbles? What else do you like to do?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;I like to play with my friends at school.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Yeh, and when you come home, what&nbsp;kind of things do you like to do outside, now that it's nice weather?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;I like to run outside, and go on the computer inside.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, okay. And do you have a bike?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Uh-m.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Yeh? And where do you ride your bike?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Uh, usually to the stop sign, usually to the stop sign and the trampoline.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh right. Okay.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Stop now&quot; (in a whisper).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;Well, thanks for the interview!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Because it's Spring, we spend a lot of time outside. We have even started to have barbecues on our deck. Often we will barbecue some steaks, chicken, or hot dogs, and have them with salad and baked potatoes. It is really a wonderful way to eat. The fresh air and the sunshine make the food taste even better. Mind you, it also depends on which way the wind is blowing. Our next door neighbors recently bought a miniature pony which lives in a triangular shelter right next to our hedge. It is a really cute animal, but when you are enjoying a mouthful of food, you don't want to smell horse manure at the same time. Thankfully, that doesn't happen very often. Now after dinner, the kids will run around in the garden and entertain themselves by playing different games. They have all kinds of equipment, from frisbees and balls, to chalk and bubble liquid. Blowing bubbles can be a bit tricky if you are small; it takes practice, good timing, and a bit of dexterity to get the maximum amount of bubbles. But, who doesn't love them? They make such a pretty picture, blowing around next to the trees and flowers. </p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Vocabulary: recently, manure, mouthful, tricky, dexterity.</p>
<p>Exs: This town is new to us; we moved here recently.</p>
<p>I mixed cow and chicken manure into the soil in my garden to help the vegetables grow.</p>
<p>Here, have some wedding cake. Take a big mouthful.</p>
<p>This project is tricky; if you don't let the glue dry properly, it will fall to pieces.</p>
<p>That boy has great dexterity; he can write with both of his hands and his feet.</p>

			<title>A Tour of Homes 2, The Powder Room</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Tour of Homes</strong>.</p>
<p>Welcome back to our tour where we discover each and every room and object in the home. Remember, if you can learn and remember this vocabulary, you will have the advantage&nbsp;of being able to use words and phrases that make you sound natural and in-touch. </p>
<p>The second room that you might come to after the entryway is the <em>powder room</em> or <em>spare bathroom</em>. Some homes don't have these, of course, but here in the United States, it is very common for new homes to have one powder room. For the sake of hygiene, the floors in the newer homes are not carpet. Do you remember the names of the other types of flooring? Tile, wood, and painted concrete; there are also plastic floors called <em>linoleum</em> which are great for cleaning. Any liquids or dirt spilt on linoleum&nbsp;are easily cleaned up.</p>
<p>So, what do you and I and almost everyone on the planet&nbsp;visit a few&nbsp;times a day? The <em>toilet</em>! What a magnificent invention! It is here that I get my greatest inspirations! Okay, let me get serious again. We sit on the <em>seat</em> which is located over the&nbsp;<em>toilet bowl</em>. The water that is contained near our backs is in the <em>water tank</em>. Then we have the all important <em>flush</em>. It even sounds like the noise it makes, doesn't it? Fluuushhhh! We need <em>toilet&nbsp;paper</em> or <em>toilet roll</em> which is held on a <em>toilet</em> <em>roll holder</em>. Then it's time to clean up. Move to the <em>sink,</em> reach&nbsp;for the <em>faucet or tap</em>, turn it on and wash your hands. You need soap and water. The soap can be a <em>bar soap</em>, <em>liquid soap</em>, an <em>anti-bacterial soap</em>, or perhaps a pleasant smelling <em>moisturizing soap</em>. You <em>apply the soap</em> or <em>pour it</em>, <em>work it into a lather</em> with a little water, <em>rub your hands together</em>, and then <em>rinse</em>. I do know that you know how to wash your hands, but the terminology of how to do it is, I think, important. Fluency with these everyday words and phrases will give you confidence.</p>
<p>After you've&nbsp;<em>dried off</em> your hands with a towel, you might want to look in the mirror, brush or comb your hair, brush your teeth, use some <em>dental floss</em> to clean between your teeth, or just admire yourself. Another thing that we use a lot of in the powder room is <em>air freshener</em> for obvious reasons.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, in a land far, far way....no, hang on a minute, that's no good. All stories start like that. How about we have something different for this story. Mmm, I know: Very, very recently, in a place that is close to where I live, something strange and fascinating happened. It is a tale of mystery, that has changed our village forever. It all started on a warm Spring Sunday. It was a glorious, lazy afternoon. Church was over, and people were relaxing on their porches and in their gardens; children were running around playing, and the sound of birds chirping filled the air. It was approaching three o'clock. The bell tower of the local church overlooked the whole village, and when the hour was chimed, the sound would ring out in a clear and familiar way. Today, however, it was different. At first, the bells rang rhythmically, normally; nobody really took any notice as the sound was so well known and expected. But, suddenly, there was a huge crashing of metal, like the bells were being thrown together. High notes and low notes were screaming in a violent, angry chaos. It went on and on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody looked up, stood up, and turned their heads towards the church on the hill. What on earth was going on? Who was up in the bell tower? Was this some kind of joke? A couple of men ran up the hill to see what was happening, but the angry noise continued until they were almost at the church door, when&nbsp;suddenly it&nbsp;stopped. Running out of the church, with a crazed look on her face, came Mrs Brompton, the church bell ringer and cleaner.</p>
<p>&quot;Help!&quot; she cried, her face pale, and her hair sticking up in all directions. &quot;Ooo, it's horrible! Just horrible!&quot; she yelled, grabbing the beard of one of the men, and shaking his head, as if to make him understand. &quot;Ow!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Meads, prying her hands off of his beard, &quot;Now, Mrs Brompton, what on earth is going on? What's happened?&quot; At those words, Mrs Brompton went very quiet, she wanted to speak but she couldn't. She grabbed Mr. Mead's beard&nbsp;again with one hand&nbsp;and tried to say something. &quot;....a curse!&quot; came out in a whisper, and, at that, her eyes rolled to the back of her head and she fainted, falling to the ground like lead.</p>
<p>After the ambulance took Mrs Brompton, the vicar and a group of men searched the church, every room, every nook, every staircase. They found nothing unusual. Even in the bell tower, nothing was out of place. The huge, metal bells hung silently, expressionless, but something about the room felt different. The group of men had assembled here again. Having found no clues at all, they automatically came&nbsp;back to the room where the chaos had started. They stood silently thinking. &quot;Oh, Mrs Brompton's off her rocker, I'd say,&quot; said Jeffrey Mullins with a wave of his hand. But his humor wasn't reflected in the other faces. The vicar, Reverend Holtworth, had a particularly serious expression; his face&nbsp;was grey, and his eyes were heavy with thoughts. &quot;It'll be nothing to worry about, I'm sure, vicar, &quot;said Thomas Black. &quot;I bet Betsy just had a funny turn and got tangled up in the ropes.&quot; But Rev.&nbsp;Holtworth said nothing in response. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was low in the sky as they left the church. The men headed down the path back to the village. Thomas Black stayed behind to talk to the vicar. Standing there, they could hear Jeffrey Mullins, &quot;The old bat has given everybody something to talk about, hasn't she?&quot; he said with a loud laugh, and the others joined in. Black and the vicar stood in silence for a few moments. &quot;I'm sure when we hear from Betsy it'll all turn out to be nothing,&quot; Black said as if asking a question. The vicar said nothing in response, but gave Black a weak smile and a quick nod, as if to reassure him. &quot;If you need anything, you know my number,&quot; called out Black as he headed down the path. The sun was setting now, and the birds had fallen silent. Rev. Holtworth stood staring at the bell tower, and uttered under his breath, &quot;There was nobody in the bell tower this afternoon.&quot;</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Once upon a time, in a land far, far way....no, hang on a minute, that's no good. All stories start like that. How about we have something different for this story.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Tour of Homes.</strong></p>
<p>What<strong> </strong>is the name of the first room that you come to when you walk into a house? It's the <em>entry way</em>. This room varies from house to house. Some are big; others are small. Either way, it is a space in the house which is used as an introduction to the rest of the house. In Western homes, the entry way is not usually an enclosed room. There could be several openings that lead to other rooms. We walk through the front door. There are many types of these: <em>solid wood, glass, a windowed door</em>, <em>double doors, arched doors</em>. And part of the door that is important for its style is the <em>hardware</em>. That is basically the metal parts: the <em>hinges</em> and the <em>door handle</em>. Occasionally there will be a <em>knocker</em> which is metal and with which you knock. Nowadays, most people have a <em>door bell</em> instead. These are the 'ding-dong' type, or an electric buzzer of some kind. </p>
<p>Often there is a <em>door mat</em> infront of the door, to wipe your feet on. You walk through the <em>doorway</em> and into the entryway. As you look around you will see a place to hang up coats, perhaps a <em>closet</em> or a <em>coat hanger</em>. Sometimes there is a <em>mirror</em> on the wall, and a long, slim table under the mirror which is elegant or, at least, decorated in some way. The entryways that I have seen have flowers in <em>pots</em> or <em>baskets</em>, <em>framed art</em> on the walls, and even <em>chandaliers</em> hanging from the <em>ceiling</em>. Often, there are photos of family members here and there.</p>
<p>The floors could be any of various materials: <em>wood, tile, carpet</em>, or even <em>painted co</em>ncrete. The most popular <em>rugs</em> that one tends to see on the floor are called <em>Asian, Indian, Persian, Traditional, or Native</em> of some kind. <em>Lighting</em> is important, of course, to create atmosphere, and so you don't crash into something and get hurt. So, apart from the occasional chandalier, there might be a <em>standing lamp</em>, or a <em>table lamp</em>, and some are <em>touch on touch off</em>, <em>clap on clap off</em>, or <em>plugged in to a timer</em>. The lamps usually have a <em>switch</em> that you <em>flip</em> or&nbsp;turn, or a button that you press. There are even hallway lights or <em>'night lights'</em> that one plugs into the <em>electrical sockets</em>, so when the other lights are off, you can still see the floor and where you are going. Electrical sockets or <em>outlets</em> are so useful, especially for plugging in the vacuum cleaner or decorations at Christmas time.</p>
<p>Some people keep their keys in the entry way, so it is easy and quick to pick them up on the way out in the morning. There are <em>key holders</em> of various types and shapes that do the job.</p>
<p>If shoes are taken off in the entry way, then they are put either on a <em>shoe holder,</em> on a <em>shelf,</em> or in a closet. A beautiful thing to have in your entry way also is a <em>chest.</em> This is a big box, usually made of wood, in which you can store anything you need. </p>
<p>My entry way is quite simple, relatively small, and empty. It has a mirror, a glass table (which, by some miracle is still&nbsp; in one piece), a standing lamp, and tile floors. Think about your entry way, and if you have words to add to this list, let me know.</p>

			<title>Plans for the podcasts.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/plans_for_the_podcasts_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>I love doing this podcast every week. What I enjoy most of all, is getting feedback from my listeners. Recently, some of my listeners have sent me E-mails asking how they can improve their English. It's a very good question. I think about how <em>I </em>can improve <em>my</em> language skills when I study French or when I practice Spanish. Being half spanish, I speak the language well, but I do realise that there are holes in my knowledge. How much do I really know? And, probably a more important question is: 'Do I know the most usable and natural sounding parts of the language?' In my effort to speak Spanish to my children, I find myself looking, time and time again, for words that I have never learned before. For example, the other day, one of my children was helping me in the kitchen. We were baking. Oatmeal, chocolate chip cookies are a great favorite in this house, and my two oldest boys are experts; they know the ingredients, the method, and even the cooking time. As we were talking, I wanted to say in Spanish, &quot; Get the sieve for the flour.&quot; Well, did I know the word for sieve? Unfortunately not. It made me realise that there are hundreds of ordinary, everyday words that we should know if we want to feel confident and also if we want to sound like a native.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Useful phrases: most of all, recently, time and time again, hundreds of.</p>
<p>Exs: My favorite holidays are spent in the countryside, but most of all, I enjoy hiking through forests.</p>
<p>I am usually full of energy, but recently I have felt so tired.</p>
<p>I asked the telephone company time and time again to come and check our phone lines, but they haven't yet.</p>
<p>At the concert there were hundreds of people.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>It's an exciting time for my podcast, my dear listeners, as&nbsp;I have decided to make a few changes. I am making these changes with both you and me in mind. Going to New Zealand has made me consider other countries that I have never visited. If it were up to me, I would go to every country on this planet, but obviously that is impossible. So, why don't you and I visit each country through my podcasts? Together we can get to know the geography, history, and culture of each unique country, and, perhaps, along the way, get a greater understanding of this wonderful planet that we share. It will be our way of traveling. So, every other week, or, as we say in England, 'every fortnight', I will bring you a brief but concentrated view of a particular country.</p>
<p>Another regular podcast will be called, 'A Tour of Homes.' Once every two weeks, I will walk with you through a typical home, from room to room, object to object, to really make sure that we know the ordinary and very useful words. Knowing this vocabulary makes you feel and sound confident. Just like when I was looking for the word 'sieve' in Spanish, I will spend a podcast or more in the <em>kitchen</em>, so one day, you will be able to look around your own kitchen, and say most things in English. </p>
<p>A third and final podcast that I will add to this list is 'Story Time'. Oh, I love stories. I also love to write them. Sometimes what I write becomes very silly, but, you know, that's okay. Being silly is a good way to learn a language. If it is funny, you will remember it much better than if it is boring, don't you think? So, expect stories of all kinds from Anna: goofy, scary, annoying even, but I promise you that they will catch your attention and improve your English.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Useful vocabulary: in mind, if it were up to ...., along the way.</p>
<p>Exs: I had my mother in mind when I bought those flowers; I knew she'd love them, they are her favorites.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, the bus driver would be fired. If it were up to the bus driver, he would be driving a limousine.</p>
<p>I walked with my cousin to the restaurant, and along the way, we discussed our plans for the next vacation.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; you say, &quot;she's going to talk about New Zealand again.&quot; Well, in a way I am. This part of today's podcast is about a perfect day in Christchurch. A day when I experienced many of the things I like most: good company, historic buildings, great music, quiche, gardens, and tea! Ah, what a dreamy day. It was one of my last days in New Zealand, my brother didn't have to work, so&nbsp;we decided to hang out in the center of town and enjoy ourselves.&nbsp;We walked around quite a bit, went back to visit the Botanical gardens again, and window shopped. I got hungry after a while, so&nbsp;we found a cafe just a couple of streets away from the main square. I ordered a quiche, a juice, and a pot of tea, and&nbsp;we chose a table outside. The weather was perfect, sunny, a slight breeze, and joyfully bright.&nbsp;We sat there and watched the world go by. Then a lady with very red hair who was standing on the sidewalk*started to sing. She sang jazz. Wow, she was good. She sang many songs that&nbsp;we recognized. She stopped often and played the saxophone. It was wonderful to sit and be entertained. &quot; Just think,&quot; said my brother, &quot;if you had a voice like that, you could travel the world and make the money you need by just singing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Preterite</em>: walk-walked, go-went, get-got, find-found, watch-watched, is-was, start-started, have-had.</p>
<p>Exs: She <em>walked</em> down the street, <em>went</em> into&nbsp;a shop and <em>found</em> a dark corner to hide in. She <em>watched</em> to see if the man was following her. He <em>was</em>. She <em>started</em> to panic. She <em>had</em> to find a way to escape unnoticed.</p>
<p>* Sidewalk (Americanism) = pavement (British).</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>While my brother and I were listening to the talented, red headed jazz singer outside the cafe in Christchurch, I remembered something. A chapter of my youth came to mind, and I was reminded of something I did in my teens. I must have been only 19 years old, and in college. I joined a rock band. One evening, in the college bar, I had met a very friendly group of German students. We chatted for a while, and then they told me that they were looking for a backing vocalist for their group.&nbsp;&quot;I'll do it!&quot; I said, not knowing&nbsp; at all just how much work was involved. Well, I tried out for the position, and they said that I would do.&nbsp;It was very exciting. I had never done&nbsp;anything like that before. I had an idea of fame, and lots of record contracts. Well, one of the&nbsp;young men on the group had met a music manager&nbsp;who&nbsp;<em>said</em>&nbsp;that he had been one of the managers for the famous Ozzie Ozborne. Mmm, I don't know if that was a good thing, but, at least it was a connection to the music world. He arranged for us to have three performances in different pubs around London.We actually got paid&nbsp;for it.&nbsp;I don't even remember what our group was called, but I do remember that we would dress in black, and look very cool. Our sound was not so cool, thanks, in part, to me. It wasn't until we played in my own college, in front of my friends and other students, that I realized that being a famous singer was not for me. It was very embarrassing. One of the electric guitar strings broke half way through the concert; I sang a very corny, romantic song that I had written, which sounded terrible. And, afterwards, when we listened to the recording, we laughed so hard that we cried. You could say that it was our final debut. There is no substitute for talent. So, we decided to stick to studying, and leave the singing to the naturally talented.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Preterite continued</em>: remember-remembered, remind-reminded, join-joined, chat-chatted, pay-paid, realize-realized, try-tried.</p>
<p>Exs: My friend reminded me to go to the acting audition. I remembered to practice my lines. I joined the line of other actors and we chatted nervously. Many had paid&nbsp;a lot to travel here. I realized that I just had to relax. I tried my best and got the part!</p>

			<title>A wild life sanctuary in Christchurch.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/kiwi2.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>I know that you podlisteners have heard about my trip to New Zealand, but, I'm afraid, you will have to hear more. There is much more to tell. One of the things that it is interesting to learn about when you go to another country, is the wild life. My brother, Richard, as well as being a teacher, is a photographer, and, as such, is a wild life fanatic. Every chance he gets, he will take a picture of a bird or another creature. In fact, it is not unusual to find my brother totally dressed in green and brown camouflage clothes, hiding in a bush in a forest, sitting for hours on end, waiting for an opportunity to take the perfect picture. He's a perfectionist, and his photos reveal that about him. He enouraged me to go with him to a wild life sanctuary just outside Christchurch to see some native and non-native species. We had a great time. One of the cutest things we saw was a Wallaby. It is just like a Kangaroo but much smaller. The ones in this sanctuary were quite tame. My brother was able to pet one of them, and it didn't seem scared at all. We walked along a quiet, forest-like path&nbsp; and saw lots of different birds and other animals. Then came the most special experience of the trip. A Kiwi sanctuary. They are nocturnal and very shy. It was quite a thrill to see one.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: camouflage, fanatic, sanctuary, species, native.</p>
<p>Exs: The soldier in the forest was dressed in camouflage, but we could see his red underwear.</p>
<p>My cousin is a fanatic about cleaning; her house is always spotless.</p>
<p>That church is a sanctuary; a safe, quiet place to think and pray.</p>
<p>There a many species of snake in this country. Some are even poisonous.</p>
<p>Some of the flowers in my garden are native of Nepal.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>I knew nothing about the Kiwi bird until I went to New Zealand. I didn't realize that it is a nocturnal bird that is completely defenseless. It doesn't fly, so if there are any predators near them, they don't stand a chance. Apparently, before the European settlers arrived in New Zealand, it was a country of birds. There were no predators of any&nbsp;kind, so the birds were&nbsp;safe. There are still no major predators like wild cats, bears, or wolves. However, with the settlers came rats and stoats, both of which eat birds and their eggs. This severely reduced the amount of Kiwis. Because they don't have sharp teeth or strong claws, they are weak in a fight. Also, they have a huge disadvantage of being flightless, so they can not escape. The poor things are sitting targets for the rats and stoats. But now, they are very much protected. All out war has been declared on their predators. Anyone who wants to kill a rat or a stoat at any time, is more than welcome. Also, science is being used to get the Kiwi numbers up and into full production. One of the small coastal islands that form part of the territory of New Zealand is being cleared of all rodents, and will be dedicated to the Kiwi. I think it is significant that such a gentle creature is the national symbol of this beautiful and humane country.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: predators, defenseless, rodents, disadvantage, a sitting target.</p>
<p>Exs: In this country, there are some pretty scary predators: Grizzly bears, and Cougars.</p>
<p>The poor little butterfly was quite defenseless against the spider.</p>
<p>I hate rodents; they carry diseases and are very aggressive.</p>
<p>Peter realized that his lack of humor was a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The duck was frozen on the pond; it was a sitting target.</p>

<p>Chess is a board game that my whole family likes to play. Even my youngest child likes to move the pieces around the board. She doesn't understand the rules at all, but copying us is fun. My mother bought us a beautiful chess set a few years ago. The board is actually a box, in which you find all of the pieces for both chess and drafts. They are made out of some kind of stone, a beautifully smooth stone that is cool to the touch, - probably soap stone. We spend ages playing against eachother. My husband and I rarely play together; it's usually one of us and the kids. It's a perfect game for long Winter evenings. We have a collection of other board games as well: Monopoly, Scrabble, Taboo, and other mathematical type games. Taboo is an interesting game, and great fun. The object of the game is the following: a word is read out loud to the players. It is a real word, though not normally used. Each player must invent a definition secretly. All the definitions are then handed back to the reader; they are shuffled, along with the correct definition, and then read out loud. Each person votes for the definition that he or she thinks is the right one. The reader, who knows which one is correct, must have a neutral face, or what we call a 'Poker face' while reading. It's a hilarious game that uses your brain, and reveals a lot about each player.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Verbs: to shuffle, to define, to play against, to read out loud/ silently, to reveal.</p>
<p>Exs: Before we play cards, could you please shuffle them?</p>
<p>How would you define the sky? Would you call it a place, or gas?</p>
<p>The local rugby team played against the favorites from the capital, and they beat them!</p>
<p>In class we are told to read silently to ourselves; the teacher reads out loud when she teaches.</p>
<p>The archeologists' spade broke through the earth to reveal the handle of a golden sword.</p>

<p>During my recent stay in New Zealand, I had the opportunity of spending time in the center of Christchurch. If you ever get the opportunity to go there, you must. It is like a huge garden town. Right in the center is an enormous park with a botanical garden in it, surrounded by historic buildings. The river Avon works its way through the whole city, and cuts right through the park. If you walk from the park to the cathedral, you will find yourself in a very large square, surrounded by shops, offices, and places to eat. It was here, one day, as I was looking for the tourist information office, that I found an enormous chess set. Each piece was about three feet tall. There were huge tiles on the ground which served as the board. As I approached, I realized that a game was being played; people were standing around watching and waiting. The strategy was very public. From what I could see, a group of three Argentinian young men were playing against a local man. It was their move, but they were stuck. They talked and gestured and moved around pointing to this piece and that piece, but still no ideas came. Because I speak Spanish, I felt comfortable enough to offer some advice which proved to be totally useless. I shouldn't have bothered. But, hey, I tried. So I said a friendly &quot;Adios!&quot; and left thinking, &quot;What a great way to bring people together in a public and beautiful place.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Verbs: to approach, to realize, to gesture, to feel.</p>
<p>Exs: A man approached me on the street and asked me to sign a petition.</p>
<p>I needed money immediately, but I realized that the banks were closed.</p>
<p>This awful man made a rude hand&nbsp;gesture as I passed him in the car.</p>
<p>I was feeling confident this morning, but just before the interview, I felt quite sick.</p>

			<title>Pruning time.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/pruning_time.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>The weather has finally changed from dull and freezing to warm and sunny. Everybody I meet when I go about my daily activities seems happy. Winter feels very, very long by the time we reach March. So, hurray for April! One of the greatest things to see at the moment is new growth. All over the garden there are signs of plants and flowers beginning to grow. Most of them are mainly underground, and just a little green is poking through the earth. Daffodils and bluebells have already flowered, of course; they are the typical early Spring flowers. Some people have loads of them all over their front yards; we don't. I'll have to buy some bulbs this Fall and get to work on that. Even the supermarkets have shelves full of different colored Spring flowers in different colored baskets and pots. The down side to this season is that there is lots of work to do in the garden. I don't mind it, though, as I am a gardener at heart. My husband does most of the hard work. This weekend, he worked like a mule in the garden. Because we have a lot of lawn, he had to hire a couple of machines to aerate and thatch the lawn. He then fertilized it. We have about an acre of land, so it took him most of the weekend! I just do the fun stuff, like plant flowers and vegetables, weed, and dig. Yes, I love to dig. I have inherited a love of gardening from my grandmother on my father's side. In our family, we all have strong backs and green fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Useful expressions</em>: Hurray for ......, to have green fingers, (I, you etc) don't mind, loads of .....</p>
<p>Exs: Hurray for Superman! He has saved us again!</p>
<p>I don't have green fingers at all; I only have houseplants, and I manage to kill all of them. My neighbor has really green fingers. She can grow anything and everything.</p>
<p>I don't mind if you finish all of the milk; just buy some more as soon as you can, please.</p>
<p>In the shop there were loads of bargains, and the whole shopping center was full of loads of people.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>This lunch time when I came home from picking up my little girl from preschool, there was a loud, mechanical noise in&nbsp; the neighborhood. It wasn't the usual moan of a lawn mower; it was much louder. I went out into the back yard and saw that some men were up in the neighbors' high trees with chainsaws. &quot;What are those men doing up there, Mum?&quot; asked Domini. &quot;They're pruning, by the&nbsp;looks of it,&quot; I replied. &quot;What's pruning?&quot; my daughter asked. &quot;They are cutting the trees.&quot; I replied. At this, Domini pulled a cross face, ran onto the lawn, and yelled, &quot; Hey, you bad men, you stop cutting those nice trees!&quot; &quot;It's alright, babe,&quot; I said quickly, &quot; I think the neighbor paid them to do it. The trees need a bit of a hair cut; some of the branches are too long.&quot; I was pleased that the noise of the chainsaws was loud enough to drown out the noise of my very loud daughter. As I looked at the men in the trees, I could just about make out that they were roped up. This enabled them to swing around from branch to branch, Tarzan style...., well, a very slow, heavy Tarzan style, and without the monkeys. They chopped and chopped, bringing down big limbs of the tree that is one of the biggest in the neighborhood. &quot;What a shame!&quot; I thought as a huge branch fell to the ground. But then a thought occured to me. This very old tree hangs right over my vegetable patch ; it's probably good for me that the weakest, old branches get cut off so they don't land on my head while I'm gardening!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> to prune, to yell, to drown out (noise), to enable.</p>
<p>Exs: I get confused about the best times to prune different plants,- some plants need it in the Spring, others in the Autumn.</p>
<p>He was so mad that he yelled for five minutes; when he finished, he realised that nobody was listening.</p>
<p>The dump truck's engine drowned out the noise of the awful music, thank goodness.</p>
<p>Having a regular babysitter enables me to go out and to participate in interesting events.</p>

			<title>Sunnies, tramping, and water down the plughole.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/sunnies_etc.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;It's very interesting going to another country and experiencing the culture, even if the people from that country speak the same language. Among English speaking nations, there are well known differences. Our accents are different, of course, and even expressions that we use are quite different from one country to the next. I picked up a few expressions when I was in New Zealand. 'Sunnies' is the name they give to sunglasses, which I think is very cute and cheery. Also, if you like to go hiking or walking, they call it 'tramping'. The word gives the action a different feeling. If you think about it, a tramp is a homeless person who wanders around, so 'tramping around' gives a feeling of being free and unattached. Well, I am interpreting the expression from the point of view of an English person. A person from the U.S, Ireland, or Scotland, might have a different interpretation. Another thing that I found out which is not an expression, but a physical fact, is that the water in the bath or shower goes down the plughole the opposite way compared to countries in the Northern hemisphere. How curious! Up here in the U.S it goes down the plughole in an anticockwise direction. In New Zealand, I noticed that in the shower, it goes down in a clockwise direction. It's one of the little differences that makes us all interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Useful expressions: even if.., among, from one....to the next, to pick up, a tramp, point of view.</p>
<p>Exs: Even if we go to the city, we won't have enough time to see everything.</p>
<p>Among my neighbors, Mary is the most friendly.</p>
<p>They passed the evidence from one member of the jury to the next.</p>
<p>From what he had said, I picked up that he didn't like me.</p>
<p>There is a tramp living under the bridge next to the park.</p>
<p>Well, I understand your point of view, Sir, but I do not agree.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;My time in New Zealand was very short, but, in that time, I picked up on the tremendous friendliness of the Kiwis, as the New Zealanders are known. They are a very laid back nation, not rushed and stressed. They are also very polite, and have endearing expressions. &quot;No worries,&quot; is a common expression that is used in many circumstances, such as when you ask for something, or as a way of saying &quot;You're welcome&quot;. While I was there, I listened carefully to try to see what it&nbsp;is about the Kiwi accent that makes it different from the English one. One main difference in pronunciation is in short words that have the letter 'E' as the main vowel, such as 'yes', 'bet', 'egg', 'pest', 'leg', and 'rest'. The vowel is pronounced like an 'I', so the words sound like 'yis', 'bit', 'igg', 'pist', 'lig', and 'rist'. Also, words with the long 'I' sound like 'I', 'I'll', 'sky', 'fly' etc sound like they have an 'O' next to the 'I'. So, a sentence like, &quot;Yes, I'll eat the rest of the egg,&quot; is pronounced, &quot;Yis, oil eat the rist of the igg.&quot;&nbsp; I was quite proud of myself for making that observation; I had never before been able to speak like a Kiwi or an Australian. Now, I can goof around at home and speak in a Kiwi accent to my family. It makes you wonder why different accents develop in the first place, doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Useful expressions</em>: in that time, to goof around, to make an observation. </p>
<p>Exs: I lived in Spain for a year, and in that time I ate lots of delicious food.</p>
<p>My children insist on goofing around in the supermarket.</p>
<p>That student is very good at making observations, even about the teacher making mistakes!</p>
<p><em>*Verbs in pluperfect</em>: </p>
<p>I <em>had</em> never <em>eaten</em> caviar before. I tried it at her birthday, and hated it.</p>
<p>He <em>had</em> never <em>been</em> polite, so when he said &quot;Please&quot;, I was surprised.</p>
<p>We had driven on the left all our lives in New Zealand, but then we moved to France and had to drive on the right.</p>

			<title>How ridiculous!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/ridiculous.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever been told something by a person of authority that made no sense at all? Or, have you ever been in a situation that made you wonder if someone was playing a joke on you? A few occasions spring to mind when I think of that question. The other day, my mother had her U.S citizenship interview. There were many questions to answer, and thankfully, the lady interviewing her was friendly. She tested her English, her knowledge of U.S. history, and she also looked at all the papers my mother had filled in. Then came the character history questions: &quot;Have you ever overthrown a government?&quot; the lady asked. My mother was shocked and amused at the same time. &quot;Sweetheart, I'm sixty-five years old. Do I look like I've overthrown a government?&quot; she replied. No, she doesn't look like she has overthrown a government, and I'm sure if she had, someone would have heard about it. The interviewer looked at her appologetically, and continued with other, similar questions: &quot;Have you ever been a drug traffiker? An arms dealer? A member of the Communist party?&quot; Of course my mother answered &quot;no&quot; to all of the questions, but she couldn't help but laugh. The poor lady was just doing her job, but what a ridiculous one!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Verbs</em>: Have you ever......? (very useful). To play a joke on someone.</p>
<p>Exs: Have you ever been to Miami? Has he ever paid for anything? Has it ever rained in the Sahara? Have we ever given her a reason to dislike us?</p>
<p>My brother always played jokes on me when we were growing up.</p>
<p>He was offended; they had played a joke on him.</p>
<p><em>Important vocabulary</em>: authority, something springs to mind, to overthrow, a dealer. </p>

<p>When I left New Zealand to come home, I had to catch a connecting flight in Brisbane, Australia. Thankfully, I didn't have to wait&nbsp;at the gate very long.&nbsp;After a while, one&nbsp;of the airport security guards announced to the group of us who were waiting, &quot;Could you all move back behind the security screen, as we are going to run an extra security check of the plane before you board.&quot; We all did so, only a few people complaining. Then came the time to move back to the gate. As we did, they checked our carry-on luggage. I only had one bag: just a weeks worth of clothes, and presents for the family. &quot;What's this?&quot; asked the man as he unzipped my bag. &quot;It's a candy snake; you know, a chewy one,&quot; I replied pointing to&nbsp;three others and a tarantula&nbsp;that I had bought for my children. &quot;You can't take these on the plane. New regulation: nothing that seems threatening to anyone.&quot; &quot;Are you serious?&quot; I asked with a smile. &quot;But it's obviously candy.&quot; &quot;Yes, I know Miss, but someone on the plane might not think so.&quot; &quot;Well, what about the tarantula? I think that's more scary.&quot; &quot;New rules, I'm afraid. You can only take them if you bite their heads off?&quot; &quot;You've got to be joking! My kids wouldn't eat them if I did that. Anyway, I bought them here in the airport,&quot; I said, seeing no sense in the situation. One of the guards went back with me to the shop where I had bought the candy and appologetically spoke with the shop owner. I traded the snakes for tarantulas and went back to the gate. As I arrived, one of the other guards informed me that because I had bought them in the airport, I could take them with me. So, I went back to the same shop and exchanged my tarantulas for snakes. What a performance. I appreciate people following rules and keeping us safe, but that was ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Important vocabulary</em>: security guards, a connecting flight, a weeks worth of ..., to unzip, a regulation, appologetically, a performance.</p>
<p>Exs: The security guards checked the plane before we took the connecting flight.</p>
<p>I have a week's/ month's/ year's worth of bills to pay.</p>
<p>It's a new regulation that everyone must unzip the bags.</p>
<p>The man appologetically cleaned up the soup he had dropped.</p>
<p>The dinner was a disaster. The food was burnt, I had a headache, and the guests got lost and never turned up! What a performance!</p>

<p>I'm back from a wonderful trip. Do you want to hear about it? Do you know anything about New Zealand? I'll give you some of the most important details. It is situated in Oceania which is in the Pacific Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere. It's population is about four million, so, it is not very populated. It is about one hundred and four square miles in size, spread out over two main islands, North and South, and a few smaller islands. English is the main language, though there is a second, native language of Maori, from the people of the same name. The Maoris arrived from Polynesia about a thousand years ago. They were hunter gatherers who lived off of the land and sea. In 1642 the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted* the land, then in 1769 Captain James Cook, the English explorer, landed. Many Europeans came soon afterwards to hunt whales and seals, others to farm and develop towns. Of course, there were conflicts and wars between the Europeans and the Maori over land. In 1840 the British crown gained control of the country, but still there are disputes over who really owns 'Aotearoa' which is the Maori name for the country. The Kiwis, or natives, are extremely proud of their country, especially of its natural beauty: the Snowy Alps, sunny beaches, massive fiords, volcanoes, lakes, forests, and quiet rolling hills. </p>

<p>I wish that I had had more time to discover the amazing land of New Zealand. In total, I only had about one week there, from arriving to leaving. I did, however, make the most of it. I whizzed around at 100 miles per hour, trying to see as much as possible. &quot;You travel really well, Anna!&quot; said my brother, observing me after I had been there for a couple of days. I had not experienced any jetlag, and I was determined that I wouldn't. I didn't want anything to spoil my treat! I spent two days in Christchurch, where my brother lives. What a beautiful city! It is like a spotless park. The Kiwis take pride in keeping their country clean, and they recycle just about everything. Then I flew South to Queenstown. I stayed at a Youth Hostel right on the lake which had 'The Remarkables', a line of mountains, to the side. I toured Fiordland which you can see a little of in my photo. Then, on my last day there, I treated myself to a helicopter ride over part of the Alps. Wow! Can anyone say spectacular? What views! We flew over dense forests that I have seen before in some of&nbsp; the Lord of&nbsp;the Rings. The whole experience was like being in a story book. My last few days were spent with my brother. We went sight seeing* to wineries, beeches, and even a thermal spa. I was sad to say goodbye to my brother, but after being in New Zealand, I fully understand why he has lived there for the past eleven years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: to sight see,&nbsp;to make the most of ..., to whizz around, spotless, to take pride, to treat oneself/ a treat. </p>
<p>** With the expression 'to sight see', the word 'see' only changes slightly with a change of tense. We never say &quot;I sight <em>saw</em>&quot; for the past. And it sounds awkward to use 'seen', as in &quot;Have you ever sight <em>seen</em>?&quot; It is best to use the past of the verb 'to go:</p>
<p>We went sight see<em>ing</em> all over the place. </p>
<p>Have you ever been sight see<em>ing</em>?</p>
<p>We will need to sight see some more before we leave this city.</p>

We went sight seeing* to wineries, beeches, and even a thermal spa. I was sad to say goodbye to my brother, but after being in New Zealand, I fully understand why he has lived there for the past eleven years. 
&nbsp;Grammar notes.
Useful vocabulary: to sight see,&nbsp;to make the most of ..., to whizz around, spotless, to take pride, to treat oneself/ a treat. 
** With the expression 'to sight see', the word 'see' only changes slightly with a change of tense. We never say &quot;I sight saw&quot; for the past. And it sounds awkward to use 'seen', as in &quot;Have you ever sight seen?&quot; It is best to use the past of the verb 'to go:
We went sight seeing all over the place. 
Have you ever been sight seeing?
We will need to sight see some more before we leave this city.
&nbsp;The Pluperfect:
Exs:They hadn't had enough time to study, but they took the test anyway.
He had lived in the South for twenty years, but he got married and has lived in the North for the past year.

			<title>Wild old ladies.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://acupofenglish.libsyn.com/wild_old_ladies_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>On my recent trip to New Zealand, I met lots of different people. In Los Angeles, where I waited to catch the plane to Aukland, I met three older ladies who were going on the same trip. We sat in the airport and chatted. They were very interesting. Each was retired, a widow, and interested in traveling. They told me that each year they take a trip somewhere new and go on a cruise. The cruises that they go on are organized especially for old people. I have never been on a cruise, but I imagine that it would be very comfortable. You can see a lot of coastline and islands easily, - no driving or walking necessary. Each day, their ship stops in a port somewhere, and they have the choice of getting out and exploring, or they can stay onboard and relax. I was surprised&nbsp; that they were willing to make such a long journey. The flight takes fourteen hours. If you have a good book, and watch several movies, it's not too bad, but still, it is exhausting. It's also hard to sleep when you are in a sitting position. But, I am not going to complain. I actually got the trip for free because of air miles.&nbsp;I think the three old ladies who I met were adventurous and brave. Good for them! Their bodies were not young, but their spirits were!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Useful vocabulary: recent, to catch a plane, cruise, no ... necessary, onboard, to be willing, air miles.</p>
<p>Exs: The recent James Bond film was not as good as the previous one.</p>
<p>We caught a plane this morning. We need to catch another one tonight.</p>
<p>This cake recipe is easy: only a few ingredients, and no mixing necessary.</p>
<p>I am only willing to fly to the reunion because I have accumulated air miles.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I don't remember the names of the three older ladies I spoke with in Los Angeles international airport, but I still feel that they made an impact on me. It is interesting being with people who are&nbsp;much older than yourself. In a way, they seem to be a world apart. It's probably because of the fact that they have accumulated so much more life experience than ourselves. I find older people fascinating because, more often than not, they are very sure about their feelings. &quot;You have to be who you are, and you have to live while you can,&quot; said one of the ladies wisely. Their eyes were young and lively, and their enthusiasm for the trip was obvious. They seemed very single minded. It was just the shell of their bodies that was old; they actually weren't. They had to take their time when they stood up, or bent over to get something from their bags. In fact, one of the ladies, who was quite bent over, took out, at one point, a huge bag of pills. I looked in horror as she checked that she had all that she needed. &quot;I hope that most of those pills are vitamins!&quot; I said, staring at the large, plastic, zip-lock bag. &quot;Oh honey, most of them are. But I need more the older I get. I had a prescription for my eyes, but now one is worse than the other, so each needs a separate medication...&quot; she went on about her different ailments. &quot;Gosh, I hope I stay in good shape as I get old,&quot; I thought to myself as I listened. Well, I will try my best. But, bearing in mind their age and physical condition, I have even greater admiration for these bony, wild, old ladies.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Useful vocabulary: impact, to accumulate, to bend (over), pills, vitamins, prescription.</p>
<p>Exs: The drought had a terrible impact on the whole city.</p>
<p>He accumulated so much wealth during his youth, that when he got older, he didn't need to work.</p>
<p>After the operation, he couldn't even bend over.</p>
<p>In my prescription, the doctor gave me pills that are too big to swallow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>Traveling is a passion of mine. I can't imagine staying in one place for many years without going off to explore another country. Well, I've done it! My brother has lived in New Zealand for eleven years. He has flown out to the U.S many times to visit me, but for all those years, I have never been to visit him. I have been busy. Having four children is a lot of work. However, now my children are old enough for me to have a break for a few days. I am looking forward to seeing something new and meeting new people. When you go abroad, you need to be organized. First, you must make sure that your passport has not expired. Without that, you won't get anywhere. Then, you must book your return flight. This can be done over the internet, of course, but you must know what you want. Do you want to fly during the day or at night? Do you need to be super comfortable with lots of leg room, or can you cope with being a bit squashed in a cheaper seat? And then there's money. How much will you need to take with you? If you plan on shopping, eating in nice restaurants, or buying gifts for friends and family, make sure that you take enough. All this preparation can be a fun part of the journey. Then the day of departure comes, and you have to ask yourself, &quot;Do I have everything? Am I missing anything?&quot; So you check and double check until you feel confident that you have everything. And you're off! Have a great trip! Take care, and have fun!</p>

<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>I remember when I used to travel with my family from England to Spain, what excitement I felt. Being on a plane is a huge thrill for children. Interestingly enough, the things that I remember most are the packages of milk powder that we were given with our parents' tea and coffee, and the tiny wrapped rectangles of soap that we would 'collect' from the bathrooms. These treasures were all over the plane, so it seemed. It's funny how children pick up on the details that adults barely register. Another thing that fascinated me was the curtain that separated the kitchen from the passengers. What a great mystery that was. It reminded me of something that&nbsp;you would find in a theater. I half expected a clown to jump out of it, or a magician to slowly open the curtain and start doing tricks. It was sufficient, though, for the stewardesses to appear and disappear, as they did. I would look with admiration at these pretty women, all well groomed and smelling clean. They always smiled, and wore make-up in ways that my mother never did. I wanted to be one of them. They made the flight go much quicker with their pleasant gestures and happy faces. Mind you, the flight from England to Spain isn't exactly long. A couple of hours and we were there. With my family so spread out around the world now, the flights are substantially longer. But, you know, I still love it. Though, &nbsp;it would be nice to have a magician jump out and entertain me.</p>

			<title>What a criminal!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/criminal.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>On the highways here in the United States you will find some signs that say, &quot;Buckle up! We love you.&quot; The message is to remind people to fasten their seat belts to stay safe. It's a good idea. Another thing that is available on the highways is free coffee. In certain areas on the long roads, there are places where you can stop to get a &nbsp;free cup of coffee. This helps to keep people awake when they drive at night. It saves lives, and also money. Another good idea. Today, as I was driving my kids to school, I noticed a lot of police cars . I passed one of their cars that was flashing. This was serious. Suddenly, a policeman on the side of the road waved me over. I opened the window and he said, &quot;Hi Ma'm, we're doing a safety belt check today.&quot; &quot;Oh, good idea,&quot; I said. &quot;Are all your children strapped in?&quot; he asked, looking in the car. I looked behind and saw that none of my three boys had their belts on. Oh great! My daughter did. I always strap her in. On the way to school, I always tell the boys to do up their belts, but obviously today they didn't. The policeman pointed out the problem. He asked me for my driver's license. Guess what? I had left my bag at home, so I didn't have my license either.&nbsp;He informed me that it is illegal to drive without the license. I actually didn't know that. Oh what a morning! The policeman was very kind, and let me go with just a small fine. The experience was a good reminder, and a warning.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Important vocabulary</em>: driver's license, seat belt, buckle up, to strap in/ to do up, illegal, message, sign, warning, reminder.</p>
<p><em>Verbs</em>: to remind, to guess, to strap in/ buckle up, to point out.</p>
<p>Exs: Please remind me to pay the bill tomorrow.</p>
<p>He guessed the answer; he didn't really know it.</p>
<p>Strap yourself in/ buckle up, we're going to drive on a busy street.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the speed limit in town is thirty miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;If you don't strap yourself in, I'm not going anywhere.&quot; That is something I say regularly to my three boys when we get in the car, especially when I tell them to put their seat belts on and they don't pay attention. They look at me with impatient eyes, as if they want to say, &quot;Mum don't nag us; it's too early in&nbsp;the morning.&quot; Well, sometimes I don't nag enough. This morning I got into trouble with&nbsp;the police for three of my four kids not being strapped in.&nbsp;The policeman&nbsp;was perfectly reasonable and calm, which I appreciated. If you get one in a bad mood, the situation could be more unpleasant than necessary. We live only a four minute drive from the school, so it is a temptation, I confess, to just get there quickly and to not double check the seat belt situation. Well, when I agreed with the policeman that their project was a good idea, he seemed surprised. &quot;Most people don't respond like that. We usually get a lot of excuses.&quot; There is no point being dishonest, is there? It's all about the safety of the children, so we should comply. I felt quite comfortable in the situation, even though I was the one at fault. Probably I was still too tired to imagine myself behind bars, or having to pay a huge fine. I hadn't had my morning coffee yet, so my imagination was not awake enough to scare me. Anyway, I don't have to wear a stripey suit and get locked up. Just a small fine is the only punishment. Let's all stand corrected!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> to pay attention, to nag, to appreciate, to be honest/dishonest/at fault.</p>
<p>Exs: I wish the students would pay attention.</p>
<p>He says that his wife nags him about his spending habits.</p>
<p>I appreciate all the hard work you have done.</p>
<p>He has to make a choice between being honest or dishonest.</p>
<p>When I'm at fault, I say so.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>My mother told me that when she was a young mother, my older brother would never leave her alone. He always wanted to be held. She would hold him even when she vacuumed. Clingy is the word. I was different. I always wanted to do my own thing and be independent. It is funny how different two children from the same family can be. I am preparing to go on a trip soon to New Zealand, so when I am gone, my parents-in-law will look after my kids and take them to school. My mother tells me how different things are now for mothers. In her day women just stayed with the children all the time. The expectation was that you didn't go off by yourself. Gosh, I'm glad things have changed. Now it is normal to &quot;have a break&quot; from the kids. It is normal practice to get a babysitter so you can go out and do something fun without worrying about the children. We fortunately have a wonderful babysitter. She lives opposite us; she could easily walk from her house to ours in her slippers in one minute. She is sixteen and happens to be a good friend of our children anyway. What a bonus! When it is time for my husband and I to go out on a Saturday or Friday night, we never have any trouble leaving. Even my youngest is so happy that 'Sammy' has come over to play, that she doesn't even tell me goodbye. </p>

<p>&quot;Mum, where are my shoes?&quot; &quot;Mum, can you play checkers with me?&quot; &quot;Mum, why aren't we having homemade macaroni and cheese instead of from a packet?&quot; &quot;Mum, what did you do with my Pokemon cards?&quot; Guess what this podcast is about....How many questions like these could you hear everyday without going crazy? I tell my children sometimes, &quot;It's just as well that I love you, otherwise I would throw you out of the window.&quot; I picked that one up from my mother; she used to say the same thing to me. Kids are amazing, wonderful blessings. And they are our future, of course.&nbsp;Though it&nbsp;sounds like a cliche, it is true. But, my kids, in particular, seem to have a talent for wearing their mother out. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining; I can't imagine life without my children. At the moment, I have enough energy to keep up with them, but sometimes I wonder. Today, I was on the phone to my credit card company. I will be taking a trip to New Zealand this Saturday to visit my brother, so I had to inform them of this. Anyway, the lady on the other end was asking me for some important information when, suddenly, my two youngest ran into the room and let off several blown up balloons. You can imagine the noise. I was immediately cross and impatient, so I barked at them to go away, &quot;For goodness sake you two, I'm on the phone!&quot; I appologized to the lady who chuckled and said that she has three kids, so she understands. Well, they did it two more times, and laughed their heads off loudly.&nbsp;I gave up and started chuckling aswell. It must have sounded like a circus over the phone. I actually managed to finish the call. At least the customer service lady had a good laugh.</p>

			<title>Car crash (of a different kind).</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>The other day, I was looking in the kitchen for a cookie. It was mid-afternoon and I was having a 'snack attack'. I opened the cupboard hoping to find a few oatmeal cookies (my favorites), or perhaps chocolate chip cookies. Unfortunately there were none, just a few crumbs where the last packet had been. I had nothing to dip in my cup of tea. I thought, &quot;Why don't I quickly make some?&quot; Immediately, I realized that I didn't have any chocolate chips; we were out of them. I didn't want to jump in the car and go to the shops just for a bag of chocolate; it would be easier to buy a packet of cookies. As I was thinking, I rememered an embarrassing accident I had many years ago because of chocolate chips. My husband was making cookies. &quot;Anna, we're out of chocolate chips. Can you run down to the store to buy some?&quot; So, I did. I parked the car, his pick-up Chevy truck, outside the supermarket, and ran in. There were just a few people in the store. I bought the chocolate and walked out towards the truck. It wasn't where I had parked. It was about five meters away, and right next to a car. There was a group of people around it. U-oh. I understood what had happened. I had not put the truck in 'park' before turning it off. So, when I was shopping, it had rolled backwards and hit a car. I was in big trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>

<p>So, you heard about my oops incident. It was a nightmare, truly. The funny thing was, I had just learned to drive, and I was very proud of my effort to go to the store by myself in this Chevy truck. I thought that I had done very well to drive on the other side of the road; in England we drive on the left. It was a pleasant *Autumn evening, already dark, and the supermarket was quite empty. I quickly found the cooking aisle, chose the bag of chocolate chips, and went to the cashier to check out. Over the loud speaker I suddenly heard, &quot;Could the owner of the green and tan Chevy truck please report to customer services.&quot; A bad, sinking feeling rose is my stomach, but I convinced myself that there must be one other person in the store who drove a green and tan truck just like ours. There wasn't. I finished with the cashier clerk and went outside to find the truck. I was horrified at what I saw. My truck had rolled backwards quite a few feet, and hit a parked car. At the time, a man was napping in the car, waiting for his wife who was shopping. Eek! The poor man must have had quite a shock. Fancy being hit by an empty car when you are parked in a parking lot! My first instinct was to walk straight past the two cars and the crowd that had gathered around them. But how could I do that? I had to confess, and&nbsp;call and let&nbsp;my husband know about the incident. That bag of chocolate chips ended up being a lot more expensive than ususal. That's why I prefer oatmeal cookies.</p>

			<title>An English confusion.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/English_confusion.wav]]></link>

<p>Some people say that it must be easy for me to live here, because of the language; it is the same as in England. Yes, that's right. But, there are some interesting differences. There are many sayings and spellings that are different. If you don't know the differences, you can get into trouble sometimes. When I first came here, I took my driving test. First, I took the written test. A man asked me afterwards if I had 'missed' any of the questions. I looked at him and said, &quot;Of course not, I did all of them.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;you're sure of yourself, aren't you!&quot; After talking a bit more, I realized that 'to miss' a question, in the U.S., means to get the answer wrong. In England 'to miss' means to not attempt to answer. The two meanings are very different. On another occasion, after meeting a group of people I commented that the lady was very &quot;homely&quot;. Most people frowned and said, &quot;No she's not homely at all.&quot; Again, after some confusion, and trying to explain myself, I learned that homely, in this country, means ugly. Oops! In England it describes a person who likes to be at home, makes pies well, does domestic things well, .... you get the meaning. Even though I have been here for seventeen years, I am still learning expressions that I have to be careful with......</p>

<p>&nbsp;Related vocabulary: saying, spelling, to get into trouble, to explain oneself, to comment, to frown.</p>

<p>One minute from my house, by car, is a large shop, Walmart. It is very convenient for me; I go there at least three times a week. I am constantly running out of basic essentials like milk, bread, cereal, and toilet paper. Well, I make my quick trips there, grab what I need, and leave. Occasionally, &nbsp;I will spend some time looking, browsing. It can be relaxing. The trouble is, when you browse, you are more likely to buy an extra something that you don't really need. The employees in Walmart are very friendly and helpful. One thing that I've noticed about them, is that there are many older people working there, people who look like they have been retired for a while. One day, when I was standing in line waiting for a cashier, I found myself observing the gentleman who was at the till. He was tall, elderly, and very polite. His hair was dyed black, so black that it was a blue black. His face was wrinkled, and his eyes looked almost closed. Then it was my turn. &quot;Hello, did you find everything that you were looking for?&quot; he asked, robotticly. &quot;Yes, thanks,&quot; I replied. &quot;The trouble is, I always buy too much,&quot; I continued. He looked at me, and then at his watch and said, &quot;It's ten forty-five.&quot; Oh, he must have misheard me. &quot;It's a lovely day, isn't it?&quot; I said just to make conversation. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said quickly, as if I had corrected him,&quot;well, I can put your stuff in paper bags instead of plastic bags.&quot; &quot;No, that's fine,&quot; I said, trying not to cause more confusion. I noticed that he was wearing a hearing aid. That explains it. I should speak louder. &quot;Could I borrow a pen?&quot; I said loudly as I took my cheque book out. &quot;No, we don't take American Express,&quot; he replied without looking at me. Hm, amazing that we could have two separate conversations, and somehow manage to get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Verbs: to grab (reg.) used commonly as to get, pick out etc.</p>
<p>He grabbed his coat and ran into the rain.</p>
<p>To browse (reg.). Ex: I browse the internet everyday.</p>
<p>To notice (reg.). Ex: I noticed the other day that she was crying.</p>
<p>To hear/ mishear (hear, heard, heard). Ex: I misheard the directions, so I got lost.</p>

			<title>Own the night.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Night_shroud.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>I have a very special friend who lives in the *neighborhood. She is seventy-five years old, and actually comes from England, just like me. She was a war bride during World War two. She is originally from Liverpool (where the Beatles came from), and still has a little bit of an accent, even though she has lived here for nearly sixty years. We chat on the phone every few days, talk about politics and families, and occasionally get together. She called me today for help. She had been sent an important package, but could not unlock the delivery box with the key that the *mail man had left for her. It was already late at night, but she was worried about not receiving her package. So, I went to her house to get the key. &quot;You're not going alone in the dark are you?&quot; she asked as I was leaving her house. &quot;Well, yes I am,&quot; I replied. &quot;Alone in the dark?&quot; she continued. &quot;Sweetheart, don't worry. I like the dark,&quot; I replied and went on my way. As I walked down her driveway, I realized that it really was dark outside. The temperature was a comfortable cool, and nobody was around. What I had said about the dark made me feel braver than usual. The words &quot;Own the night&quot; came to my mind, as if I was in a small adventure, moving through the darkness to get a secret package. </p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>

<p>Dark is the night. As black as night. The secrets of the night. Have you noticed how there is something sinister in many night-related sayings. Our imaginations go wild with the subject of the night. The world seems to completely change, if you think about it. We, as people, head toward rest and sleep. The sun, which is everywhere during the day, is no longer available, and shadows and the unknown take over. Even a different set of animals appear on the scene as the world darkens: owls, rodents and cats. All the other day time animals, like us, are sleeping. I don't seem to be too scared of the dark. I like to walk around in the back garden at night. It is so fresh and still. Everything feels so different when your dominant sense of sight&nbsp;is no longer useful. When I walked to the mailbox tonight, in the dark, it occured to me, that if you have the right perspective, you can feel comfortable and confident in the dark. You must own the night. I moved quickly to the mailbox while I thought of these things. Really, noone would see me unless they had a flashlight. If you walk quickly, you give an air of purpose and power. &quot;What is there to fear?&quot; is what your body is saying. I also have short hair, so, in the shadows I probably look like a man. Plus, I was carrying a sharp key and a cell phone. So, I was safe.&nbsp;I owned the night. I chose to see the night as a cloak that I put around me, and that I could move freely with. Our senses can be alive and sensitive at night, though we cannot see, and we can initiate and move effectively in this time that is not officially our domain. </p>

			<title>A robbery in town!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Rob_in_town.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Life in a small town is very quiet, some would say boring. However, one good thing about&nbsp;living here&nbsp;is that there is not a lot of crime. It is something that you get used to. On a few occasions, I have left my handbag in the shopping cart when I am buying groceries. It is not until I get home that I realize what I have done. Thankfully, the times that this has happened, I have been able to drive back to the supermarket and find the bag, still in the shopping cart. When I lived in London, that was not the case. Though&nbsp;most people are good, and mean well, you have to be careful. I suppose it is just one of the many differences between a big city and a small town. When&nbsp;a crime does take place here, it makes the front page of the local newspaper, The Wenatchee World, and the whole town talks about it. A couple of weeks ago, a friend of mine told me that there had been a burglary at a pharmacy in town. I don't often read the newspaper, so I was not aware that it had happened. I looked through our pile of unread newspapers and found the February 26th edition, and sure enough, on the front page was a picture of the suspect. The man has not been found yet; the police and crime task force are still looking, and have offered $1000 reward for information leading to an arrest. How exciting! I will keep my eyes peeled.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Related vocabulary</em>: crime, handbag, groceries, local newspaper, burglary, pharmacy, reward, task force.</p>
<p>*<em>Would</em>. Ex: Some would say that the governor is wise, but I think he is foolish. </p>
<p><em>To mean well</em>. Ex: They mean well, but they are very unhelpful.</p>
<p><em>(Not) the case</em>. Ex: The land was to be protected, but that was not the case.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>So there has been a robbery in town, a double one. It's&nbsp;a shock for the community, especially considering that everybody seems to know eachother. The reward has not been claimed, and so far there are no leads. Mind you, the picture in the newspaper is pretty awful. The suspect looks like an alien. I think if there was a creature like that in this town, he would be spotted immediately. Thankfully, no one was hurt in&nbsp;either robbery. It would be very scary to be the one behind the counter who has the gun pointed at his face. I would not like to be in his shoes. Perhaps the criminal will be caught by making some kind of mistake. They are human, so they are prone to errors, just as we are. There are stories of criminals who are not so bright, who give themselves away. Apparently, one man decided to rob a quick stop foodmart. The trouble is, he was on his lunch break from work, and he had forgotten to take off his name tag from his place of employment. As soon as he had taken the money and left, the cashier phoned the police and told them the name of the criminal and where he worked. The poor guy, how embarrassing! It must have been his first time on the dark side. It sounds like he was nervous and unprepared. Well, hopefully the embarrassment of the situation stopped him from ever trying it again. As they say here, &quot;If you don't want to do the time, don't do the crime.&quot;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>There are some special times in our lives when we come into contact with greatness, with people who have done great things. My husband experienced one of those special moments about a week ago. He had flown down to California with a couple of friends to watch the Tour of California. He was fortunate enough to have a friendly, business connection with Rabobank which is a major cycling sponsor. Because of this connection, he and his friends were able to travel in a Rabobank car close to the professional riders. They were able to get close to these famous athletes before and after the rides. One other thing that they did,&nbsp;was to ride some of the same routes as the professionals, but several miles behind them. This gave my husband and his buddies firsthand experience of the difficulty of this competitive sport. I think the trip will become an annual event, something to look forward to and to plan for during the year. I might go with him next year, even though I am not a cyclist. The tour obviously takes place along some beautiful countryside, so it would be worth going at least once. </p>

<p>&nbsp;What does it mean to be a fan, to be an enthusiastic follower of a personality or activity? Have you ever experienced the thrill of hero worship? It's quite common. My&nbsp;sons are fans of certain sports personalities and actors, and my daughter is a fan of Hello Kitty. My fifth child, my husband, also has certain idols, but he hides his enthusiasm better than the children. On his recent visit to the Tour of California he was lucky enough to see some of the big names in cycling like Lance Armstrong, Levi Leipheimer, and David Zabriskie. It was, of course, a complete thrill for him and his group of friends who accompanied him. I'm sure that being a fan shows a desire to have achieved that which we are admiring. The funny thing is, last year when he went to&nbsp;the Tour, they did actually experience being worshipped by fans. Let me explain. They had spent a large part of the day cycling behind the peloton,-a long way behind. Nevertheless, they crossed the finish line where fans were still applauding, yelling, and waving flags. Little did the fans know that these very late athletes were nothing to do with the race. So, my husband and his buddies were celebrated as professionals who had just completed the Tour of California. Cameras were flashing and devotional pats on the back were given. It was like an accidental dream come true. Hey, if you can't be a professional cyclist, you can always trick a few fans into believing that you are.....</p>

			<title>Brain rescue.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Brain.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Learning a foreign language can be a difficult thing. Any language has a huge amount of information. On top of that, there is also the pronunciation and fluency that need to be practiced. English can be a pain to learn. Even the word &quot;this&quot; is difficult to pronounce for a lot of people. So, what is the solution? The answer is accurate practice, and lots of it. I have been learning the violin for just over a year, and I can tell you that there is no substitute for accurate practice. My three boys, who are in elementary school, use different techniques to practice new information. My youngest boy, in particular, has started using flash cards. They are rectangular pieces of thin card, each with a word written on it. You look at one at a time and try to read the word. It is a very simple system. Some people don't like to use it. It never suited my two older boys,&nbsp; but my youngest loves it. Another system that works, especially for children, is to write&nbsp;about things that they are familiar with but in a very funny context. Apparently, humour, repetition, and familiar details all help a person learn. So, when you are practicing English, try to create sentences with those three ingredients. You'll have fun at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: information, practice, pronunciation, substitute, technique, accurate, rectangular, square, circular, triangular, humour* (Eng. sp.), familiar, on top of that.</p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> to write (write, wrote, written). The rules were written in stone.</p>
<p>To start + gerund. Exs: I have started using a new shampoo. It's better!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He started driving really fast; we were all very scared.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>What can we do to rescue our brains? What on earth do I mean? Do our brains actually need to be rescued? Well, apparently, yes. As we get older, we tend to forget details. Sometimes our long-term memory is better than our short-term memory. Have you ever walked into a room to get something and forgotten why you went there? Being over occupied is sometimes to blame. Women typically get that way when they are pregnant. Two other reasons for forgetfulness are anaemia and tiredness. They say nowadays that mental exercises are the key to keeping a young, fresh brain. Have you tried any? Crossword puzzles can stretch your word abilities, and your problem solving skills. One activity that my mother enjoys is Sudoku. You are probably familiar with it. You have to place the numbers one to ten in ten lines without having any duplicates. It can be very taxing.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Beginners.
Learning a foreign language can be a difficult thing. Any language has a huge amount of information. On top of that, there is also the pronunciation and fluency that need to be practiced. English can be a pain to learn. Even the word &quot;this&quot; is difficult to pronounce for a lot of people. So, what is the solution? The answer is accurate practice, and lots of it. I have been learning the violin for just over a year, and I can tell you that there is no substitute for accurate practice. My three boys, who are in elementary school, use different techniques to practice new information. My youngest boy, in particular, has started using flash cards. They are rectangular pieces of thin card, each with a word written on it. You look at one at a time and try to read the word. It is a very simple system. Some people don't like to use it. It never suited my two older boys,&nbsp; but my youngest loves it. Another system that works, especially for children, is to write&nbsp;about things that they are familiar with but in a very funny context. Apparently, humour, repetition, and familiar details all help a person learn. So, when you are practicing English, try to create sentences with those three ingredients. You'll have fun at the same time.
Grammar notes.
Related vocabulary: information, practice, pronunciation, substitute, technique, accurate, rectangular, square, circular, triangular, humour* (Eng. sp.), familiar, on top of that.
Verbs: to write (write, wrote, written). The rules were written in stone.
To start + gerund. Exs: I have started using a new shampoo. It's better!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He started driving really fast; we were all very scared.
Advanced.
What can we do to rescue our brains? What on earth do I mean? Do our brains actually need to be rescued? Well, apparently, yes. As we get older, we tend to forget details. Sometimes our long-term memory is better than our short-term memory. Have you ever walked into a room to get something and forgotten why you went there? Being over occupied is sometimes to blame. Women typically get that way when they are pregnant. Two other reasons for forgetfulness are anaemia and tiredness. They say nowadays that mental exercises are the key to keeping a young, fresh brain. Have you tried any? Crossword puzzles can stretch your word abilities, and your problem solving skills. One activity that my mother enjoys is Sudoku. You are probably familiar with it. You have to place the numbers one to ten in ten lines without having any duplicates. It can be very taxing. Another way to stretch your brain is to undertake an activity which is very different from anything that you have ever done. If you are musical, then perhaps you could try a new physical activity. If you are very physical and sporty, maybe learning about computers would be a good way to make your brain cells grow. Believe it or not, this podcast has stretched my brain a little. Let's hope its effects will last.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>The other day I was walking by my children's bedrooms, when I saw a sign on one of the doors. It said, &quot;Domini and Robert, DO NOT ENTER!&quot; One of my two oldest boys had become impatient with sibling intrusions. Sometimes they walk into their bedrooms and find a terrible mess. Colouring* pens often will have their tops missing, so they will be dry. Lego creations are in pieces on the floor, and, some things are just missing. Hudson and Cass, the oldest boys, get furious. They storm into their siblings rooms and create another kind of trouble. I, of course, being their mother, have to get involved to sort out the fights and the conflict. Oh, for peace and quiet!. Well, now my six year old is learning how to write, so he also puts signs on his door. We have three doors with 'Do not enter' signs. My little girl doesn't know how to write, so, I suppose, she still feels free to be the intruder and mess maker. One day, there was a big commotion upstairs, with lots of screaming and running. I ran up to see what was going on. It turns out that Domini had stolen one of my son's favourite*toys that he had had since a baby. He was chasing her to get it back. It was like an episode on Tom and Jerry, the cat and the mouse. I think it is about time that I left some notes myself.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>*Colour/ colouring</em> and favourite are English spellings. U.S spellings miss out the 'u'.</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: the other day, sign, door handle, lock, key, mess, peace and quiet, intruder/ intrusion, impatient, conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;This place feels like a prison,&quot; complained my husband one day. He had caught his foot on a metal gate that I had put up between the kitchen and the dining room. The gate is for the dog, to keep her in or out. It is a necessary evil that is supposed to make life easier for everybody. The trouble is, the gate is small, and my husband is large. We have a similar situation upstairs. My two older boys have, according to them, precious possessions, intricate legos that took a long time to build, and other breakable objects. So, because there had been so many incidents of little siblings sneaking in their rooms and wrecking the place, we put locks on the doors. Everything worked for a while. Unfortunately, it didn't last long. Both boys left the keys to unlock their doors locked inside the rooms, along with the duplicate keys. Oh dear. It was time to get the tools out and huff and puff, and bash and bang, until we managed to take off the door handles completely. Well, they haven't had locks for a while now, and wreckages are taking place in the bedrooms. Today a little friend of my daughter came to play. He sneaked into Hudson's room and poured his lizzard's food all over the carpet. A few people were not happy about that. Needless to say, I have locks on my list of things to buy.</p>

			<title>The Ring of Power.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/anillo_of_power.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>To be a film 'buff' is to be a film enthusiast; a person who loves to watch films and who follows film production quite closely. I am a film buff, but a choosy one. There are certain films that I love, and others that I cannot stand. A film series that I have followed closely is The Lord of the Rings. When the first of the three films came out, it was immediately popular. The films are based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkein who was British, but born in South Africa. The genre of his books is fantasy. At the center of the books is a fight between good and evil. The story is set in a place called 'Middle Earth', a fictitious country with incredible countryside. The films were directed by Peter Jackson in New Zealand, where he comes from. If you watch the films, you will see why New Zealand is the perfect Middle Earth. There is a huge variety of landscapes in that small country. The incredible Alps, large rolling grasslands, rocky hills, and wind swept valleys are all places where the filming took place. I never get tired of watching the movies; infact, I have watched them so many times that I know a lot of the dialogue by heart. I also have the music score from the films. When my family find me watching the films or listening to the music, they just roll their eyes and say, &quot;Oh, she's at it again.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary:</em> fantasy, historical, drama, adventure, romance, war film, documentary, cinematography, dialogue, play, special effects, script, themes.</p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> Past perfect: I have watched that film many times. We have watched his moves very closely; he is suspicious. They have played tennis so much in their garden that they have worn the lawn thin.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes my children give me little gifts. They are often items that they have made at school, a picture, a collage, occasionally a bracelet made out of paper or beads. The other day, though, my oldest son gave me a metal ring that he had acquired from a friend of his. He had traded a small toy&nbsp;for it. He presented it to me with great pride; he knew that I would like it. It was a replica of the 'ring of power' from the Lord of the Rings. My kids know how obsessed I am with the trilogy, so this gift was quite meaningful. I wore it with pride for a few weeks; I even showed it to a few people. I noticed, however, that my finger was developing a brown patch under the ring, so I promptly took it off. I didn't want to get poisoning from a cheap quality paint. Anyway, it made me think about the concept of having a ring of power. I suppose it is an age-old idea, possessing an object that gives supernatural power. What would you do if you had one? Would you bring about world peace, or world domination? Would you help all of the needy people, or oppress them? Would you replant all of the rainforests, or chop them down and turn them into toothpicks? There would be lots of decisions to make and, I'm sure, lots of tempation to resist. Life could be a lot more comfortable, though, couldn't it? What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> to present, to resist, to acquire, to trade, to wear (wear, wore, worn), to suppose.</p>
<p><em>Would: </em>pronounced the same as 'wood'. Easy to use; simply place infront of infinitive. Exs: I would go to the doctor if I were you. She would help you if you asked. They would get a new car if they could afford it.</p>

<p>Do you love to shop? Some people are addicted to shopping; they love to go out and buy things. Others enjoy window shopping, which is safer&nbsp; for your wallet. I am not a big shopper; I have to love something before I am willing to buy it. However, window shopping is a great past time. You don't even have to take any money with you. It can be fun to see what shops have to offer from the outside. Nobody inside the shop can put pressure on you to buy anything, and if the weather is nice, you can hang around for as long as you like. I came across a shop the other day which looked very interesting. It was a hat shop. Obviously, it was full of hats. But these hats weren't just ordinary hats; many were extraordinary. The window wasn't very big, but it was full of hats of all different colors and shapes. As I looked through the door, I could see that the shop was long and narrow, and from the floor to the ceiling it was full of hats on shelves. There were very elegant hats, party hats, crazy hats, warm hats, and even historic looking hats. The people inside the shop were trying them on and laughing as they looked at eachother. It must be a very fun place to work, seeing people amused all day long.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>When I was a student in London, I bought a hat one day&nbsp;in&nbsp;Camden Town. I still have it, though I haven't worn it for years. It is a light, comfortable hat that is black and has golden sequins all over it. Right at the front, above my forehead is a golden elephant. It is quite an eye catcher. Sometimes when I am organizing my closet, I will come across it. It takes me right back to London, the sights, sounds, smells, and experiences of being a student in that great city. When I first moved out to the United States, I became a teacher in a local High School. One day, everybody in the school was allowed to dress up, so, amongst other things, I wore my hat. It got a lot of attention, and my students became curious about where I had bought it. It is surprising how one piece of clothing can tell a story. I suppose what we wear does reflect something about our personality, our choices, perhaps our preferences. Well, I wear many other hats now, but they are figurative, not actual hats. Some of the hats I wear are: wife, mother, podcaster, language student, bill payer, and world citizen. I like my hats; they are the ones that I have chosen. I look forward to a variety of new ones that I will pick up in the future.</p>

			<title>You must love the verb 'to be'.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Verb_to_be.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>When you learn English, the verb 'to be' can be a bit of a problem sometimes. It is irregular, so it doesn't follow a regular pattern. But, that is okay. Lots of verbs in English are irregular. I am, you are, he is etc should be familiar if you are serious about learning the language. And, what about the past tense, was and were; do they drive you crazy? Don't worry, any language learner will sympathize. Let's try a few sentences. It's a good idea to read the text and listen at the same. </p>
<p>Hello, <em>I am</em> your English teacher. How <em>are you</em> all? The snow <em>was</em> heavy today and <em>there were</em> several accidents on the road; I thought that class <em>would be</em> canceled, but <em>it wasn't</em>. <em>Was </em>your homework okay? <em>Isn't it</em> nice to understand verbs? <em>It wasn't</em> always easy, <em>was it</em>?

When you learn English, the verb 'to be' can be a bit of a problem sometimes. It is irregular, so it doesn't follow a regular pattern. But, that is okay. Lots of verbs in English are irregular. I am, you are, he is etc should be familiar if you are serious about learning the language. And, what about the past tense, was and were; do they drive you crazy? Don't worry, any language learner will sympathize. Let's try a few sentences. It's a good idea to read the text and listen at the same. 
Hello, I am your English teacher. How are you all? The snow was heavy today and there were several accidents on the road; I thought that class would be canceled, but it wasn't. Was your homework okay? Isn't it nice to understand verbs? It wasn't always easy, was it? I know that your text book isn't cheap,but it is a good one. The other books were very expensive; this one isn't confusing either. My other students aren't as far ahead as you are; they weren't happy with their test results. Yours were the best.
Do you see that with a bit of condensed practice, you can get used to this little but important verb?

			<title>A trip to Leavenworth.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Leaven.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>About half an hour away from where we live is the town of Leavenworth. It is a fairly small place, near very tall mountains and lots of forests. Nearby is a river called 'The Icicle' which is popular with tourists, kayakers, and campers. It is the perfect spot for a day trip. We chatted on the way, so the journey seemed short. When we got there, it was cold and dull, but the color of the shops and people walking about gave a cheerful appearance. We went into a restaurant that had exposed brick walls, large mirrors, and greenery everywhere. It was cozy and busy. Just right. We had a delicious meal of crepes filled with vegetables and a creamy sauce. The food disappeared quickly. And then it was time for dessert. My mother had creme brulee, and I had yet another crepe, but this time stuffed with banana, chocolate, and cream. I haven't eaten like that for a long time! What a treat, and what a lovely time I had with my mother. After lunch, we spent about an hour wandering around this touristic town. One of our favorite shops was a high quality gift shop that sold, amongst other things, German Cukoo clocks. They were very expensive, intricate, and they made a lovely, soft tick-tick noise. We didn't buy anything, but we had fun just window shopping.</p>

<p>If you have ever been to Leavenworth, you would say that it is a fascinating creation. Let me explain what I mean when I say 'creation'. It was first established as a town around 1892. The Great Northern Railway had its headquarters there, and there was a large sawmill which was used for the logging industry. However, when the headquarters were moved to Wenatchee, the town suffered economically. People lost their jobs and left. The big turn around came in the 1960's when an initiative to reinvent the town was agreed upon. It was to be transformed into a mock Bavarian town. The experiment worked; the buildings had facades put on them, and the tourists started to visit. It was a success. Now it receives hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. There are seasonal celebrations, like October-fest and the Christmas lighting ceremony, which bring in floods of tourists. There is even a Nutcracker museum which houses five thousand nutcrackers. What an amazing adventure it must have been to turn a run down town into a tourist attraction. The surrounding countryside gives it an authentic Bavarian feel, and even though the buildings are obviously not original, the town has the pull of a center of entertainment.</p>

<p>Black, red, green, light blue, silver, orange, swords, lazers, helmets, shields, flying machines, underwater vehicles. The list could go on. What do these words refer to? Bionicles. They are a type of lego. You can buy them in boxes to put together and admire. The idea is based on an advanced civilization in which are found good and bad creatures. There are a couple of films about them, and, of course books. There is even an encyclopedia of the bionicles and bionicle terms. It is really quite fascinating. I have a son who is crazy about them. He started building legos when he was very young, and has worked his way up to these guys. When he gets a lego set, he will build it immediately. But, then he takes it all to pieces and builds something different. I think he is very creative. Sometimes he will put all of his bionicle figures together in a row, his brothers will do the same, and they will have a huge battle. Who knows who will win? They all have super powers, special protection, extra senses and cool weapons. It is fantasy at its most powerful.</p>

I tried to build Bionicles with my son once, just to be a good, involved mother, but after a few minutes he told me that he'd rather do it himself. It's obviously not my domaine or expertise.

			<title>Which medicine do I take?</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>How are you feeling? Are you well? I hope you stay well for the rest of the year, but that is not likely, is it? We all get ill sometimes. Here in the United States, people use the word 'sick' to mean ill. That word in the UK means vomit, so it is important to know which word to use. It is wonderful to be healthy, to feel strong, to have energy to do lots of activities and to think clearly. However, when we are ill, which is common, it is certainly not wonderful. The common cold typically gives us symptoms like: a runny nose, a cough, and perhaps a temperature. The flu can make us feel even worse. Aches and pains, fatigue, headaches, and nausea are things we have to deal with. The best thing to do is to get good rest, sleep, and lots of fluids. It is a great thing that our body can fight illness very well. Sometimes, though, if we have an infection, we will need medicine. Antibiotics are useful at killing infection, but we should only take the minimum amount necessary. Too much will make them ineffective. So, eat your fruits and vegetables, sleep a lot, exercise, and stay well!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Useful expressions</em>: the rest of the..., unlikely/not likely, healthy, strong, energy, common, certainly, typically, even worse/better, the best thing to do is/ the worst thing to do is, however/though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;There is a famous film called 'Mary Poppins' in which a magical nanny sings a song called 'A spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down'. I suppose she is right. Some medicines are downright ghastly. Thankfully, I don't have to take them very often, and even if I do, I don't. I'm not what you would call a pill-popper, a person who enjoys the drama of illness. For me, it's a complete waste of time. Mind you, illness has it's place, for sure. It can certainly make you stop and think. Being generally strong and healthy can make one feel invincible and in control, whereas a bout of sickness certainly makes one remember our fragility and mortality. But, right now, I don't want to be too morbid. In retrospect, illness, and everything related, can be quite funny. The other day I was in the walk-in-clinic waiting to see a doctor. I felt awful, and, as is usually the case, I had to wait for quite a while. Well, I had the opportunity to people watch. There was an old man with a terrible cough; I didn't sit near him. There was young man with a bad limp, obviously from a recent accident. And then, a person with his head almost completely bandaged up. He looked like he had escaped from a museum of Egypt. A poor lady rushed in crying, holding her wrapped, bloody finger up high. She had chopped the end of it off. Oooo! I certainly couldn't feel sorry for myself anymore. And what a sight we were! Gosh, it's nice to feel well again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>My children love Scooby-Do. I love Scooby-Do. In fact, I have not met a person who does not like it. The happy gang of friends consists of: Shaggy, Scooby, Wilma, Daphney, and Freddy. They travel around in the 'Mystery Machine' and get into scary escapades. During their adventures, they meet monsters, ghosts, and other creepy creatures who they must try and escape from. It's not too scary, most of the time. The villains always turn out to be people who are dressed up. At the end of each episode, one of the gang unmasks the bad guy. There is always a happy ending. I was a child in the '70's, so I also used to watch the series. And the style of that era is still seen in the dress and music of the famous five. Of course, there is a lot of humor. Shaggy and Scooby-Do are cowards who will only get involved in an investigation if they get 'Scooby snacks'. They eat enormous amounts of food whenever they can, even strangely combined foods, like chocolate covered corn on the cob! Scooby-Do is definitely a staple cartoon for my children. If they fight or are grumpy, I put one of the videos on, and suddenly, everyone is happy.</p>

			<title>Hmm, what do you think?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/art_hmmm.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Art is all around us. There are many forms of art, such as paintings, sketches, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, stained glass windows, and even wood burning. Art is a personal thing, also. If somebody loves to grow flowers, their work in the garden could be considered art. Life without art would be very dull and quite strange. Think about never seeing pictures or photos in buildings. No statues, no water fountains, no interesting details. And what about fashion? You could say that fashion, hair styles, make-up etc are forms of art because they are personal tastes to do with color and shape. Music is a huge subject that is related to art. It makes you think, doesn't it? When someone is very good at being creative in some way, people say that he is &quot;an artist&quot;. My recent visit to a bakery made me realize that baked goods can also be works of art. Let me know how art is important to you, my listeners. Drop me a comment or an E-mail, and I will share your thoughts in a future episode.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Could be considered</em>: His language could be considered rude. His interview went well; he could be considered for the job.</p>
<p><em>Art vocabulary</em>: paint, paint brush, shade, form, style, arts and crafts, exhibition, genre.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The other day, I found myself gazing at a painting, and enjoying the contact that my eyes&nbsp;were making&nbsp;with the work. Nothing more. Something about the arrangement of the colors and their differing tones, pleased a part of my brain, and had me not wanting to look away. That's how it is with art. In the deep recesses of our grey matter, just left of the hypocampus, is the art appreciation gland, better known as artemilikus. Every time a person is in contact with art that appeals to him or her, it is stimulated. Well, okay, I just made that one up. But, my point is, we humans can get transfixed by any kind of art without understanding why it is so satisfying and important. The picture on this post is the kind of art that I love. Impressionistic? Perhaps. Modern? Maybe. Well, I'm sure many influences have flowed into the mind of the artist, Majka Sadel, but the end result is that it just is. So, hmm, what do you think?&nbsp;Is it a&nbsp;river reflecting in the water? A busy street on a rainy day? It could be. Though its title is 'Cityscape', it could be, and conjure up, anything for any person.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Useful&nbsp;vocabulary</em>: Arrangement, differing, recesses, appreciation, gland, impressionistic, influence, to be in contact.</p>
<p><em>Verbs</em>: to gaze (reg.), to make (make, made, made), to flow (reg.), to conjure (up) (reg.).</p>

			<title>D'Anjou bakery.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Danjou.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>The D'Anjou bakery is a special place to visit that is located quite close to Wenatchee. A quick drive on the highway, past the town of Cashmere, will take you to this place of delights. If you are not careful, you will miss the turn-off, so you need to keep your eyes peeled. I drove there the other day to meet a lady who works in the bakery. She is from France. I wanted to introduce myself, and practice a bit of french. We had a very pleasant conversation and exchanged phone numbers, but then she had to get back to work. I had some time to spare, so I bought three yummy pastries and a coffee. I sat down, relaxed, and looked around the room. It is similar to the inside of a log cabin. The style is relaxed, and reminds me of European cafes. People came and went as I drank my coffee; everyone seemed cheered by walking into the place. I don't eat much candy, but what I love to have instead is some free time, a good coffee, and a freshly baked pastry. There's nothing better!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Located</em>: Spain is located South of France. The rescue team located the man. Scientists have located where the ship sunk.</p>
<p><em>Exchange</em>: They exchanged glances; I think they like eachother. There is a student exchange program in our school.</p>
<p><em>To get back to</em>: I had to get back to studying. I have to get back to the ironing. They had to get back to the hotel. * Multiple meanings - to return to/ to continue/ to dedicate oneself to.</p>
<p><em>Useful expressions:</em>Quick (sometimes means short), keep your eyes peeled (ouch!), spare time (extra time).</p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> To drive (drive, drove, driven), to buy (buy, bought, bought), to come (come, came, come), to go (go, went, gone).</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Atmosphere. What is it when you think in terms of a great place to be, where you feel comfortable, relaxed, interested, and inspired? Are you lucky enough to have anywhere like that close by? Well, I'm a lucky person. The D'Anjou bakery is a discovery, or, at least, feels like it. If olde worlde appeals to you, not over done I might add, but subtle and self explanatory, as olde worlde should be, then, you might just like it too. I'm an olde worlde gal myself. I miss, at times, the sense of rich, deep history in buildings around me. It's comforting. To walk down a&nbsp;street where history unravels itself at each step, and the buildings seem to tell their stories of people and events, places you in the middle of a story book that happens to be real.&nbsp;Newness and plastic can be quite repulsive. So, with these feelings in mind, I go to the D'Anjou bakery and smile. What can I say? It's a little fix. Good coffee brings people back, of course. Even when they vow to give the stuff up, they are helplessly hooked. And then there are the baked goods. When made with quality ingredients, easy on the sugar, liberal with the cream and butter,&nbsp;eating them is&nbsp;like absorbing a piece of fine art. But I have said too much. I've given away my vice. Bakery? What bakery?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Are you musical? Which instrument do you play? There are so many to choose from: piano, flute, vioin, guitar, trumpet, drums and percussion instruments. I could go on and on. It can be fun to play an instrument, especially if you practice enough to become good at it. I started to play the violin last year. There are many pieces of music that I love which have main violin parts. Two of my favorites are Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings. I can lose myself in the music. I take a class once every two weeks. My teacher told me that it is important to practice every day. I try to,&nbsp;and when I do, I can see that I am improving. However, if I go for a week without practicing, my playing certainly does not improve. And if you play the violin badly, it sounds terrible. I suppose it is like all hobbies; you get better and better with practice. The hard work does pay off. My children are taking piano and guitar lessons, and we hope that next year, at Christmas time, we can all play carrols together. Perhaps we could play for my podcast listeners too.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Related vocabulary</em>: woodwind instruments, stringed instruments, percussion instruments, concert, piece of music, composer, to practice (reg. verb), hobby.</p>
<p><em>Questions</em>: Are you musical? Is she sporty? Are they flexible? Are we ready? Is it necessary?</p>
<p><em>Future: </em>We hope that next year we can (will be able to) play together. They think that, in three years, they can (will be able to) buy a house.&nbsp;&nbsp;*Will be able to is grammatically accurate, but 'can' is commonly used.</p>
<p><em>To go for</em> (time) <em>without: </em>If I go for a week without practicing, my playing sounds terrible. We went for a month without milk. She had gone for several months without paying her bills.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to being musical, my family is just starting out. My children are signed up to take their first piano and guitar lessons, and I have been playing the violin for only a year. But, I suppose, it is never to late to start, especially if you are willing to put the time and the practice in. The violin is quite a complex instrument. Not only do you have to position your fingers correctly to create the notes, but the bow has to move just right to create the right tone. If you are uptight or badly positioned, it can sound horrendous. So, needless to say, practicing is one of our family's routines. Any time, after the kids come home from school, you can hear sounds of guitar, violin, or mini organ echoing through the house. And, believe me, it often doesn't sound good. Even the dog will move away to another room to get away from the racket. But, it is all good. With practice comes progress; progress leads to skill, and skill should sound good at some point or other. I'm trying to encourage my busy husband to take up an instrument also. He tried the violin when he was in Kindergarten, but after several months, his parents couldn't stand the squeaks and grinds any more, so he was obliged to stop. The poor guy, he could have become a great violinist. Mind you, being a parent myself, I know the value of some ear plugs. At this stage, I think I will be using them quite a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: notes, bow, echo, squeaks, grinds, progress, skill, to stand (to not stand) something, to be willing, ear plugs.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Announcement: &quot;The cold weather is back.&quot; Why would I say that in the middle of Winter? Surely, it has been cold since the beginning of the season? Well, not exactly. We had a break for about two weeks, when it stopped snowing and warmed up. How wonderful! I love the snow, but I do love to see the green grass again, and feel the warm sun on my skin. Yesterday, however, the real Winter weather returned. The air is moving down again from the North. It is icy. A tiny amount of snow fell during the day. Everything was cold and quiet again outside. Well, we went to bed, thinking nothing more about the weather. When we woke up it was freezing in the house. Our heater had broken down. Before the kids woke up, I built a fire in the fireplace, and my husband brought in an electric heater from the garage. That helped to warm the rooms so I could get the children off to school comfortably. I even turned the oven on for a short while to heat up the kitchen. It was, actually, a bit exciting, like we were camping. When things like that happen, it makes you appreciate electricity and how it makes life easy.</p>

<p>I had a flash back this morning. I remembered my father's house in Scotland, and how he chooses to heat it. It is a&nbsp;two hundred year old building that used to house monks. The kitchen, as in many old farm houses, is central to the house. Though there are fireplaces in each room, the kitchen fireplace is active most of the day, and highly useful. Dad's routine in the morning is to get a fire going, using scrunched up newspapers, small bits of wood, and then logs. The heat quickly fills up the kitchen dining area. Then, the water tank, which is located somewhere above the fireplace on the second floor, heats up and provides plenty of warm water. Of course, my father and his wife have electrical heating and all the modern amenities, but they choose to have fire as a main heat source. Their previous house, in the South of England was the same, but two hundred years older. They renovated it, putting in radiators which were heated by the fireplace. It all worked really well.

Announcement: &quot;The cold weather is back.&quot; Why would I say that in the middle of Winter? Surely, it has been cold since the beginning of the season? Well, not exactly. We had a break for about two weeks, when it stopped snowing and warmed up. How wonderful! I love the snow, but I do love to see the green grass again, and feel the warm sun on my skin. Yesterday, however, the real Winter weather returned. The air is moving down again from the North. It is icy. A tiny amount of snow fell during the day. Everything was cold and quiet again outside. Well, we went to bed, thinking nothing more about the weather. When we woke up it was freezing in the house. Our heater had broken down. Before the kids woke up, I built a fire in the fireplace, and my husband brought in an electric heater from the garage. That helped to warm the rooms so I could get the children off to school comfortably. I even turned the oven on for a short while to heat up the kitchen. It was, actually, a bit exciting, like we were camping. When things like that happen, it makes you appreciate electricity and how it makes life easy.

<p>Are you scared of anything? Spiders, perhaps? Monster masks? Being high up on a cliff's edge? Most people are scared of something. I'm sure that if you think long enough, you will be able to name something that spooks you or gives you the 'creeps'. I know some people who do not like to be in small spaces or places where there are too many people. That is called claustrophobia. I thought of this word today because some workmen came to my house to work in the crawl space. The crawl space is an area under the house. It is so low that you cannot stand up in it. Often it is unfinished, so there is just hard earth on the floor, and the walls are unpainted, just concrete. Water pipes and electric cables can be found in a crawl space, so it is a useful place to have if you need to fix one of them. I felt really sorry for the three men who worked under our house; they did a fantastic job, but they had to do it on their backs. When they came out, they were really dirty and exhausted. They must be so happy when their work is finished.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: unfinished, unpainted, incomplete, exhausted, crawl, scare, spook, the creeps.</p>
<p>*<em><strong> 's</strong></em>&nbsp; Exs: Mary's car is being repaired. The children's bedroom is a mess. The people's voice has been heard. The Jones's have invited us to dinner.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#000000">Advanced.</font></strong></p>
<p>Last Summer, I had the opportunity to go to Scotland with my two oldest boys for a family reunion. My father had rented a Landmark Trust property which happened to be a castle. My brother flew in from New Zealand, relatives came up from London, and we all met up at this remotely located, beachside, crumbly looking castle. Wow! What a place it was! It had a spiral, stone staircase, creaky wooden floors, and even turrets at the top. It had been built in the fifteen hundreds, but recently renovated to be very liveable. No phones, no television. Surrounded by a misty forest and overlooking the beach, you can imagine, it was the ideal place to catch up with eachother and to have adventures. One of the games that we loved to play was 'Sardines'. It is similar to hide and seek, but only one person hides and everybody else has to seek. As people find the hider, they stay quietly with him until only one person is left. Now, if any of our group happened to be claustrophobic, that person would have had a problem. The castle had false panels that led into secret rooms, nooks and crannies gallore, and even a real, small dungeon. We squeezed our way in together, trying not to giggle as our numbers grew. At times it was hard to breathe in those tight, dark places. It was no problem for the spiders whose webs were often left on our hair. I could go on, but I don't want to give you the creeps.....</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Well, I can't believe that it is that time of year again. How sad. It is time to take down all of the Christmas decorations and to put them away in boxes. Usually, people do that a few days after Christmas, around the first week in January. But, I love decorations. Some of my friends laugh at me because we have five Christmas trees. Nearly everywhere you go in our house, you can find a tree. But now, even I realize* that it is time to put away the trees, the ornaments, the lights, and the extra bits and pieces that I have all over the house. Outside is different, though. The lights that I have put on the pine trees have to stay for a while. My reason, well, Winter is dark, and sometimes gloomy. So, why not have some pretty lights outside to make the neighborhood look cheerful throughout the Winter? For now, though, it is time to get out the packing boxes, fill them up, and put them in storage where they can sit quietly for another year.</p>

<p>Useful expressions: Though = however/ but. Very useful addition to a sentence. Inside/ outside, gloomy, storage, packing boxes.</p>
<p>Realize = realise in British english.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The thought of putting away something beautiful and not seeing it for a whole year isn't really appealing to me, especially when the days are short and often gloomy. If I were a disciplined person who followed tradition, there would be no Christmas decorations in the house because they would have been put away straight after New Year's Day. What can I say? I have a penchant for anything that smacks of Noel. Yes it is true, once I kept the decorations up until April. Yes, it is also true that we have not one Christmas tree but five. And yes, once, when I was teaching High School, I kept a miniature Christmas tree up in my classroom until June....say no more; I obviously have a problem. Anyway, this year, one of my resolutions is to put my family's concerns about my sanity to rest, and get the decorations put away before February. I have scattered evidence of my new way of thinking all over the house: storage boxes. No, they are not filled yet, but their presence shows my willingness to get on with the job. Us addicts need to take baby steps. I will get there eventually. I'm sure that ninety nine percent of the stuff will be packed and stored away within a couple of weeks. The one percent? Um.....perhaps I'll indulge myself with a tiny trinket still in the house until, say, July......</p>

<p>Today was a very special day here in the U.S. Do you know what the special occasion was? It was the inauguration of the 44th President, Barack Hussein Obama. It is a time of excitement. Everybody wants to see changes. We all wonder what Obama will do. Will he change the politics in Washington? Will the economy improve? Who knows? Time will tell. The inaugural ceremony is an important tradition. It is a huge celebration; a time to welcome the new President and to say goodbye to the previous one. Do you think that George W. Bush is sad to leave the Oval office and to retire? Perhaps. I think that it must be a relief to retire after being in such an important position for eight years. Phew! It makes me feel tired just thinking about it!</p>

<p>Yesterday and today were auspicious and significant days for U.S. history. Yesterday was Martin Luther King day. It is a national holiday to celebrate that great&nbsp;civil rights leader who forged a deeper, more equitable national conscience about civil justice. And today was the inauguration of Barack Obama. What a tremendous ceremony and celebration it was. Talk about expectation and hope becoming almost physical as the event took place. High hopes have been placed on the shoulders of the new President. But, does he represent more than racial progress in this country? One would hope so. The economy needs to turn around before too many become unemployed. Is this achievable in one term of office? Obama said throughout his presidential campaign&nbsp;that it would take years to correct the underlying errors of government that have led to this financial crisis. This seems to be the main concern; it is uppermost on people's minds. The health service and national security are also huge issues that will be dealt with. I cannot even begin to imagine how taxing and exhausting the job of President must be, especially if you are a person of conscience. How could you detatch yourself sufficiently from work to remain sane, yet remain in-touch and sensitive enough to be an effective change maker? There is no doubt that Obama faces huge challenges, but hopefully he has the strength of character needed to meet those challenges honestly.</p>

<p>Some people say that the weather is changing all over the world. Do you believe that? What do you think? I'm not sure if it is true, but sometimes the local weather does something unusual. Here in Wenatchee, the weather is normally very regular: very hot Summers, very cold, snowy Winters, and short warm Springs and Autumns. No shocks, no surprises. Well, this year has been a little different. A couple of weeks ago, a warm wind blew up from Hawaii. It blew all night. For twenty-four hours, all you could hear was the woosh of the wind and 'drip, drip, drip' of melting snow. The grass and bushes are green again, and we have had no new snow. Instead, a thick fog has appeared. For some days it has been so thick that the traffic has had to move very slowly. It is quite a change for this town; everybody is talking about it. My dog is happy because she can go for walks without getting icy paws. It is a relief for local pets, but you drivers be careful!</p>

<p>Having lived in London, I am quite used to fog. Please don't think that it is always foggy, though. There are plenty of days when the air is perfectly clear and sunny. Also, because it rains often in England, the air after the rain is quite clear. Because England was a large producer of coal, it was burned in every city. The mixture of smoke and fog would make what is called 'smog' or 'pea soup'. In 1956, however, a Clean Air Act was passed which prohibited the burning of coal in public areas. Consequently,&nbsp;London's air is much cleaner. Also the buildings have been cleaned of the dark residue that had been left by the coal smoke. I have been to some countries where there is still smog in certain cities: Los Angeles has bad smog, and so does Mexico City. Fog, on the other hand, is not a health threat. It is simply another type of precipitation. Actually, I think that it is a beautiful phenomena. It certainly conjures up ideas of mystery and romance.

Some people say that the weather is changing all over the world. Do you believe that? What do you think? I'm not sure if it is true, but sometimes the local weather does something unusual. Here in Wenatchee, the weather is normally very regular: very hot Summers, very cold, snowy Winters, and short warm Springs and Autumns. No shocks, no surprises. Well, this year has been a little different. A couple of weeks ago, a warm wind blew up from Hawaii. It blew all night. For twenty-four hours, all you could hear was the woosh of the wind and 'drip, drip, drip' of melting snow. The grass and bushes are green again, and we have had no new snow. Instead, a thick fog has appeared. For some days it has been so thick that the traffic has had to move very slowly. It is quite a change for this town; everybody is talking about it. My dog is happy because she can go for walks without getting icy paws. It is a relief for local pets, but you drivers be careful!
Grammar notes.
Questions: Do you believe that/ this? Exs: Can you believe it? Don't you believe me? 
Verbs: This year has been very different. Exs: This year has been the best so far for the corn harvest. She has been ill for three months. All the castles in France have been renovated.
To have to. Exs: I have to study more. I had to clean the kitchen last night. You will have to wait. They had to practice for the concert all year. We have had to fix the floor several times.
Useful vocab and expressions: people say that, normally, a couple of, instead, it's a relief, be careful!
Advanced.
Having lived in London, I am quite used to fog. Please don't think that it is always foggy, though. There are plenty of days when the air is perfectly clear and sunny. Also, because it rains often in England, the air after the rain is quite clear. Because England was a large producer of coal, it was burned in every city. The mixture of smoke and fog would make what is called 'smog' or 'pea soup'. In 1956, however, a Clean Air Act was passed which prohibited the burning of coal in public areas. Consequently,&nbsp;London's air is much cleaner. Also the buildings have been cleaned of the dark residue that had been left by the coal smoke. I have been to some countries where there is still smog in certain cities: Los Angeles has bad smog, and so does Mexico City. Fog, on the other hand, is not a health threat. It is simply another type of precipitation. Actually, I think that it is a beautiful phenomena. It certainly conjures up ideas of mystery and romance. Perhaps that is why so many great writers and poets have come from England.....

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. is definitely a shopping culture. There are so many things to buy, and so many advertisements on television that it is hard to not buy. Unfortunately, my children see the advertisements on television, and think that they need all of the toys. &quot;You have plenty of toys,&quot; I say to them all the time. They have toys in their&nbsp;bedrooms, in the&nbsp;lounge, and even in the kitchen. But still they think that they need more toys.&nbsp;For Christmas, Domini, my daughter, got a huge, mechanical dog called Biscuit. She had begged me for it. Well, perhaps it wasn't a good idea. The toy is amazing, though. It makes all kinds of noises; it sits and lies down, moves its paws and tail, and even pants. However, Biscuit's magic must have disappeared because the kids don't play with it at all. They did for two or three days. Now it is in a corner with other unwanted toys. Perhaps I should wrap it up and save it for another child's birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Useful expressions</em>: It is hard to (not) .... <em>exs</em>. It is hard to say &quot;no&quot;; it is hard&nbsp;to not&nbsp;laugh; it is hard to drive at night; it is hard to not get angry.</p>
<p>Perhaps it wasn't the best idea. More exs. Perhaps, it was for the best. Perhaps it wasn't the right time. Perhaps it was a mistake.</p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> To beg (reg); to buy (buy, bought, bought); to wrap (reg); to save (reg).</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever regret having bought something? In retrospect, I have a mental history of objects that I acquired at some stage, usually with enthusiasm, only to wish later that I had never bought them. Yard sale finds are definite objects of guilt. When I first discovered the practice of yard saling, it became an indulgence, and soon the bric-a-brac, or &quot;junk&quot; as my husband calls it, started piling up at home. &quot;Oh, but this is sooo useful,&quot; I would say, after spending a few dollars on a wobbly coffee table. &quot;I just need to fix the legs and give it a lick of paint...&quot; The fate of the coffee table was, of course, to be resold in my own yard sale a year later. It wasn't always the case, though. A few items have been put to good use...I actually can't remember which ones at this moment, but I'm sure there are some somewhere in the house. The latest 'oops' of comercialism in this family was the buying of Biscuit, the giant, mechanical dog. It does everything apart from making the tea and driving the kids to school, and of course it is fluffy. My older kids told me that it's a bit scary, sort of crazy and robotic. Either way, it is sitting in a lonely corner with the other unwanted toys that cost too much. Do you think that I could accidentally, on purpose, make it disappear? Maybe Ebay is the solution....</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Snow keeps us busy. It needs to be moved and removed. If it is not moved, life becomes difficult. Cars, trucks and buses have difficulty driving along the streets and up the hills if there is too much snow. Around our house the snow builds up higher and higher. A few nights ago it snowed all night. It was silent, beautiful, and non-stop. When we woke up in the morning, we were quite surprised at the height of the white stuff. We felt surrounded. After my children went to school, I got out the snow blower to clear the&nbsp;driveway. Usually my husband does that. But, it really needed to be done. I carefully read the instructions and started up the motor. It was noisy, but fast and effective. The whole thing took me about one hour. When I had almost finished, I saw something infront of me. It was a deer. It was very close and looked quite calm. It was a female. It walked past and looked at me. Then it went on its way. What a beautiful surprise on a snowy day.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Regular verbs</em>: to remove, to build (up), to snow, to clear, to finish, to look.</p>
<p><em>Irregular verbs</em>: to have, to become, to wake up, to feel, to do, to take, to go.</p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: busy, difficult, up hill, higher, a few, snow blower, driveway, fast and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Because the snowy Winter lasts for about four months here, animals who normally live in the surrounding mountains come down into town to find food. Food is scarce up in the hills for animals like the deer. It is plentiful for them, however, in the town. Hedges, bushes and other plants provide all the meals they need for the Winter, plus they have sheltered, wind-free gardens to bed down in. Us gardeners are generally not too happy about our prized plants being gobbled by these night time eaters, but, that's just how it is. Generations of deer have come and gone through this town. They are so plentiful that they actually become a nuissance. As we drive through&nbsp;the snowy neighborhoods, we have to keep a careful watch for deer families crossing the roads. Often, a little one will be found bounding along a side walk or hesitating right in the middle of the road. The other day, while I was snow blowing our driveway, a doe calmly walked right past me. She completely took me by surprise. She looked as comfortable in the&nbsp;neighborhood as I feel. Off she went, without even checking over her shoulder to see if I was following or&nbsp;could cause a threat. She knew better. I was the&nbsp;one caught off guard. Another magical occurance that comes with the season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We keep busy in the Winter. We play in the snow and do sports, but there are other things to do inside the house. Because we live in an older home, there are projects to do. These are small changes that need to be made to the house. Why do we do these things? Well, for improvement, of course; to improve the house and how everything works. My husband's project this Winter is to move the laundry room from downstairs to the upstairs. It sounds simple, doesn't it? Well, there is alot involved. For it to be a success, we need the help of an electrician and a plumber. The electrician works with the wiring and electricity. A plumber works with all of the water pipes. The new laundry room will be where three closets were. And a mud room will be where the old laundry room was. It will take, perhaps, two weeks, and then, hey presto, it will be ready. It will make life quite a bit easier for me, so when it is finished I will definitely celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Comparative adjectives</em>: old, older, oldest.</p>
<p><em>Verbs</em>: to do. Exs: Why do we do these things? Why did you do that? When will they make dinner?</p>
<p><em>Useful vocabulary</em>: to be a success; wiring (wires); plumbing; laundry room; closets; hey presto.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong></p>
<p>When you buy an old house,&nbsp;it is often&nbsp;necessary to do some renovating. That is the case with our house. By European standards, what I'm used to, this house is not old at all. It is thirty years old. However, in this part of the world, the houses are made mainly out of wood, and so it is easy to knock down walls and have a bit of necessary mess for the goal of having a more efficient house. My husband enlisted himself to &quot; get it done&quot;, and has been at it for several days now. It started out with all sorts of banging and crashing, followed the next day by loud electric saw noises, more banging, and then loads of dust. I was impressed. I like a bit of destruction every now and then, as long as it is controlled. Well, the project is taking place. Walls have come down, and new ones have gone up in different places. My youngest boy helped to pull down some of the sheet rock, which made him feel very manly and useful. So what will be the end product? A new laundry room. I know, it doesn't sound very exciting, does it. But for me, a domestic goddess, it is a must, a more efficient place where the necessary evil of laundry will take place.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>In this part of the world, we need to heat our house for three quarters of the year: Winter, Spring, and Fall. Of course, now is the time of year when the freezing temperatures outside make us turn up the heat inside. It is so nice to get cozy, and there are so many different ways. Sometimes we light a fire, sometimes we put on woolly clothes, and other times we snuggle up together. The other day I walked into the kitchen where our puppy spends a lot of time. I found her lying on her bed with a best friend. Both of them were wrapped in a cozy blanket. They looked like two puppies, and the one I know best was asleep. It was a cute picture, so I took a photograph. After playing outside in the icy&nbsp;weather, you warm up and feel sleepy. Shh, don't wake up the puppies.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Useful expressions</em>: a quarter, a half, three quarters; to turn up the heat; wool, cotton, silk, nylon, fleece (all common materials); to wrap (presents/ oneself in clothes).</p>

In this part of the world, we need to heat our house for three quarters of the year: Winter, Spring, and Fall. Of course, now is the time of year when the freezing temperatures outside make us turn up the heat inside. It is so nice to get cozy, and there are so many different ways. Sometimes we light a fire, sometimes we put on woolly clothes, and other times we snuggle up together. The other day I walked into the kitchen where our puppy spends a lot of time. I found her lying on her bed with a best friend. Both of them were wrapped in a cozy blanket. They looked like two puppies, and the one I know best was asleep. It was a cute picture, so I took a photograph. After playing outside in the icy&nbsp;weather, you warm up and feel sleepy. Shh, don't wake up the puppies.
Grammar notes.
Useful expressions: a quarter, a half, three quarters; to turn up the heat; wool, cotton, silk, nylon, fleece (all common materials); to wrap (presents/ oneself in clothes).

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>This is a busy time in the US for many people, especially for those who celebrate Christmas. It is a time for buying, buying, and buying. After we have bought or received presents, we realize that our homes will have more stuff in them. Do we need all of this stuff? Will the children play with their new toys for more than a week? How about selling somethings? There is&nbsp;a buy and sell website called Craig's list where you can sell all kinds of things. A friend of mine told me about it. She sold many things. She even sold a broken sofa! &quot; You can sell anything on Craig's list,&quot; she said to me. So, I tried it. I took a photo of a tv, a microwave, and a pair of roller blades. A&nbsp;few days later I had sold the first two things. I couldn't believe it. That was fast. I am still waiting to sell the roller blades, though. You are not interested, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Verbs: to buy - we buy, we bought, we have bought, we had bought.</p>
<p>To receive - we receive, we received, we have received, we had received.</p>
<p>To need - do we need this stuff? Do you need all of this?</p>
<p>To sell - she sells, she sold, she had sold, she was selling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>What do you do with your spare things? After you have outgrown certain objects, after they have served their purpose, where do they go? In this country, if you don't want to throw the object away, you have&nbsp;a few other options. You can give the item to one of many charitable shops, such as Goodwill, or the Salvation Army, where they will be sold inexpensively to whoever is not too fussy about buying second-hand goods. Another thing that a lot of people do here is to have a yard sale. Yard, here, means garden in England. And so a yard sale is an informal sale of household, garden, sporting, and craft goods. Usually they are laid out on tables, the clothes hang from racks, and miscelaneous objects are here and there in boxes or propped up against the walls. Treasures can be found, actually, but you must be willing to search and be patient. Hosting a yard sale requires some work and forethought. Sometimes it is worth it, if you advertise sufficiently. I have been to some yard sales where I have been able to load the car up with wonderful finds. At other times, I have walked away empty handed and disappointed. Craig's list is now very popular, and in many ways, easier than having a yard sale. I have already managed to sell a few unwanted things from my home, and so, I've caught the bug. The roller blades that some friends gave me are still hanging around; nobody seems to want them. Perhaps if I take a super attractive photo and ask for just a few bucks, I will some day be able to sell them. There must be somebody out there somewhere who desperately wants them......insn't there?</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/snowy_time.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>White, white, white, that is mostly what I see these days. But, it is a beautiful white. It is a white that covers everything outside: houses, cars, streets, trees, even the thinnest sign posts. It is a white that brings quiet with it. Snow is, of course, like a blanket; it covers and it quietens. Now, in the morning, instead of hearing the busy 'swush' of cars and buses going to work and school, we hear nothing. Even the snow plough is quite quiet, until it lowers its plow and scrapes along the icy road. The big white blanket also brings entertainment with it, lots of entertainment. You can ski, sled, or just goof around in the snow. The children bundle up in lots of warm clothes for play time; if they don't, they will pay for it later with icy toes, fingers and ears.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: sign post; to quieten = to make quiet; instead of; snow plough; to scrape; entertainment = activities that are enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>There is a bird house just outside our kitchen window which sits, pretty as a picture all year long, reflecting the changing seasons. In Spring, it is a flurry of activity, with noisy, twittery birds who seem like complete maniacs in constant motion. And, oh, the noise! For a light sleeper, like myself, it is a challenge to control myself enough to not pull out the bird house just to get some peace and quiet. Mind you, whenever I am tempted to get rid of the thing, I see what a haven it is for our beautiful, dainty feathered friends. I couldn't possibly! Well, the babies grow, learn to fly, and leave the nest, and before you know it, the house is empty again. As the seasons change, many of the species of birds that live here, fly South for warmer climates. A few stay and brave the long Winter. They are adept at finding just the right spots for building nests and finding food. We help them along by putting seeds out for them, but I think that they would probably manage by themselves. As the snow quietly covers everything day after day, the little house gets more and more insulated. I think it will be a part of our garden for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Vocabulary:</em> a flurry = lots of activity; twittery = noisy bird chirping; maniac = crazy; a haven = a place of refuge; dainty = delicate; to brave something = to put up with (especially weather).</p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> to be able: I couldn't possibly!</p>
<p>Ex: Have some more cake. Oh, I couldn't possibly.</p>
<p>To be adept at something&nbsp;= to be very good at something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This morning was an ordinary morning. I woke the kids up. &quot;Wakey, wakey,&quot; I said gently to them, as usual. I brought the two youngest their breakfast drink that they like to drink in bed. They are spoilt, I know. The oldest two get themselves up and ready. They make their lunches, get their backpacks, play a little with the dog, and then it's time to get in the car. Today was a bit different, though. The car didn't start. Uh-oh! What had happened? Maybe a light had been left on last night, so the battery had no power. Well, I found the battery charger, hooked it to the battery, and plugged it in. We waited, waited, and waited. Finally, there was enough power to go. I called the schools to say why we were late. No big deal! The kids had extra time to play&nbsp;and to watch Tom and Jerry. Sometimes plans must change.</p>

Everyone was in a good mood as well, which is a great plus on a school day. We got in the car, as usual, I turned the key, as usual, and ...silence. Not even a click, click. Uh-oh, a flat battery. Well, that wasn't in my plan for this morning. Okay, what should I do? In the garage is a battery charger that you can plug into a socket. Perfect. I carefully, very carefully, hooked everything up, responsibly avoiding electrocution, and waited. Gosh, each time I tried to start the car I only got a happy little click, click, click. So, I called the schools to explain our delay. I did some laundry. I even did this podcast. The kids didn't mind hanging out at home a bit longer; they played with the dog and with the Wii. Well, finally, the battery was charged. We were saved. We had regained our connection to the world. Hurray! So, off to school with no excuses.</p>

			<title>Seed cones for the birds.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/feed_birds.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>In our area, some birds will stay for the Winter. They make their nests cozy , fluff up their feathers, and search for food every day. But, they have a problem. Because everything is covered with snow, it is hard to find food. It is too cold for insects to be out and about, and most seeds on the ground have been covered up by Winter's blanket. Berry bushes make great meals for the birds, but something that we, and many other people, do every year, is to put out seed cones. You mix together bacon fat, seeds, and nuts, if you want those also. Then, you tie a string onto a pine cone, spread the mixture all over it, and put it in the freezer. When it is hard, you hang it from a tree. Then, sit back and watch the birds fly to it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's good to look after cute, flying friends.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Verbs</em>: to make (make, made, made). To make a nest/ mess/ the bed/ a basket ( in basket ball) etc.</p>
<p>To search for = to look for. To cover up = to cover completely. </p>
<p><em>Related voca</em>bulary: to hang up; to spread; to tie a string (shoe lace); pine trees, pine cones, branches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>One thing that keeps us entertained in the Winter is doing crafts. It seems to be a therapy of sorts that distracts us from the cold, dark evenings. Approaching Christmas, at home, as well as in school, the children will make all sorts of crafts: stars, nativities, gingerbread houses, and photo frames, to name but a few. One thing that we try to do each Winter, is to make seed cones for the birds. We have pine trees in our yard which drop alot of pine cones during the year. We collect them. We use them in our fire place to start fires, and also to hang on trees to feed the birds. I collect bacon fat in a bowl over a few weeks. It looks quite disgusting, but it really serves a purpose. On a plate we mix the gross looking fat with seeds and non-salty nuts. Then we spread the mixture all over pine cones to which we have already attached a string. Off to the freezer they go, to harden. Then, we hang them from trees all over our yard, especially those that are next to a window. That way we can sit inside and watch the scene develop. Once one bird has found the food, word quickly spreads. Within minutes their is a crazy fluttering of wings, little bodies hovering, fighting, chirping. It's a Winter feeding frenzy, and great entertainment!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p><em>Important expressions</em>: Approaching (a time); to serve a purpose; off to ... = common expression when going or taking something somewhere. Ex: Off to the dentist for you, boy. Off to your kennel, spot. I'm off to the shops. Off to the mud room with those dirty boots!</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: seeds, nuts, to chirp, to hover, to flutter, a frenzy, crafts, therapy, to distract, nativity, gingerbread house, to name but a few, gross, disgusting.</p>

Approaching Christmas, at home, as well as in school, the children will make all sorts of crafts: stars, nativities, gingerbread houses, and photo frames, to name but a few. One thing that we try to do each Winter, is to make seed cones for the birds. We have pine trees in our yard which drop alot of pine cones during the year. We collect them. We use them in our fire place to start fires, and also to hang on trees to feed the birds. I collect bacon fat in a bowl over a few weeks. It looks quite disgusting, but it really serves a purpose. On a plate we mix the gross looking fat with seeds and non-salty nuts. Then we spread the mixture all over pine cones to which we have already attached a string. Off to the freezer they go, to harden. Then, we hang them from trees all over our yard, especially those that are next to a window. That way we can sit inside and watch the scene develop. Once one bird has found the food, word quickly spreads. Within minutes their is a crazy fluttering of wings, little bodies hovering, fighting, chirping. It's a Winter feeding frenzy, and great entertainment!
Grammar notes.
Important expressions: Approaching (a time); to serve a purpose; off to ... = common expression when going or taking something somewhere. Ex: Off to the dentist for you, boy. Off to your kennel, spot. I'm off to the shops. Off to the mud room with those dirty boots!
Related vocabulary: seeds, nuts, to chirp, to hover, to flutter, a frenzy, crafts, therapy, to distract, nativity, gingerbread house, to name but a few, gross, disgusting.

<p>Well, the snow is finally here. It came two days ago. From now on, it will be snow, snow, snow for about three months. My two little ones wanted to go sledding. I took them to a local park. There were a few people already there. All the children had plastic sleds. There were happy faces everywhere. Parents, holding cups of hot coffee, stood around chatting. It was great. My two youngest slid down the hill a few times. The trouble is, the wind got colder and colder. Little toes and fingers got colder and colder. Noses turned red, and lips turned blue. I finally said,"That's it, we're off. It's too cold. Let's go home and get warm." There will be many more days of snow and sledding. For now, though, I think tonight will be a perfect night for an open fire.</p>

<p>Well, when you've got to play, you've got to play; or should I say,"When you gotta play, you gotta play." That means, come rain or shine, heat or chill, you've got to get outside and play about. My two youngest children insisted on us sledding today, even though it was perishingly cold. I obediently bundled everybody up efficiently, or so I thought, and off we went. The poor kids sat like Michelin men in their car seats as we drove to the park; they could barely turn their heads to look out of the window. Anyway, we got there, and joined in the whizzing kids who were lining up at the top of the hill, and flying down with colorful smiles, and,"ooh" and "woah!" After a while, though, my children slowed down and started to look pale with cold. We decided to go back to the car and drive to pick up some hot "curly fries" at the nearest fast food drive-through. On the way home, my six year old boy took off his coat and boots to 'warm up'. To my horror, he had no top on, and no socks. I'm not surprized he got cold. He is quite hot blooded normally, probably because he is so active; but this was ridiculous. From now on, all the kids will get a thorough inspection, army style, before they are allowed out.</p>

<p>Recycling is something that I do willingly. My children know all about it. At school the teachers tell them about how to not be wasteful, and how they&nbsp;can become involved in recycling. About every two weeks, my daughter and I load up the car with our large recycling boxes. One has glass jars, another metal cans, another has cardboard, and the last has plastics. It has become a real habit. If we don't do it, our garage will be full of garbage. Just think what a huge amount of things we throw away, when we could be recycling it all. It's alot of stuff! It makes me happy to think that we can save many trees, and help to keep the air and water clean if we make the effort to recycle. In most towns there are areas or large containers where you can take materials that you don't need anymore. It's a great idea.</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: recycling, waste, wasteful, involved, dumpster, garbage, materials, effort.</p>
<p><em>Verbs:</em> to do (do, did, done); to know (know, knew, known).</p>

<p>It's funny, in retrospect, how you can become absorbed in an activity without realizing. I wish sometimes that I could see myself more objectively, as others do. I say this, because, I believe that often we could catch ourselves doing good, a good that we don't recognize anymore. Take recycling, for example. It has become, out of necessity, a bi-monthly habit in our household. If we didn't do it, our dumpster would get twice as full as it already does. It is truly amazing how many materials we use and throw away. Often, they pass through our house without even showing signs of use or damage. And out they go! Well, all this useful stuff, thankfully now is being transported down to the local recycling center. I usually do it with my daughter. She is only four, so it is like a game for her, as most things are. She loves to throw the plastic bottles into the huge, metal containers. Children love to throw things around, and often get into trouble for it. But there, it can be encouraged; and they love it. Occasionally, a fellow recycler is doing his or her duty down there, with whom I will exchange a smile or a hello. It's as if, without knowing eachother, we have some good things in common. I'm glad that it has become a normal activity for my kids, a little easy well-wishing for the earth.</p>

			<title>The Nutcracker.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Nutcracker_2.wav]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>One of my boys collects nutcrackers. Do you know what they are? They are very colorful, soldier dolls. They have become popular in the United States around Christmas time. You can find them in all sizes. Cass, my son, has a few small ones, and one big one. In the stores I have seen a variety of huge ones also, in different colors, and different uniforms. Sometimes they have a theme, like music, or nationality. One store has a packet of several nutcrackers, each one dressed in a national costume from a different country. I suppose they are called collectibles, just like snow globes, stamps, or keys. I have already finished my Christmas shopping, but I know that my son will be happy if he finds a new, shiny nutcracker in his stocking on the 25th of December.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>

<p><em>Related vocabulary:</em>soldier, doll, costume, uniform, nationality, country, tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The other day I was browsing through the newspaper when I came across an announcement that the Nutcracker ballet was coming to town. It was going to be in town for only a few days, but what an exciting event! My husband and I had been to a spectacular performance of the Nutcracker in Seattle a couple of years ago. It was quite a modern rendition of the ballet, but just as jaw-dropping as the traditional performance. I think that my children are ready for exposure to such an artistic event. Perhaps we could make a real evening of it, dress formerly, go to a nice restaurant, and end up at the ballet. And, even though our town is small, we are beginning to get very good performers and artists visit and show their tremendous talent. My kids have all heard Tchaikovsky's music, but to see the ballet, if they can sit still that long, would give them some great insight into the volume of creative work from around the world that we can enjoy. Perhaps it could become a family tradition.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Do you know what a Pointsettia is? It is something that grows in the ground and is sold here in the United States at Christmas time. It originates&nbsp; from Mexico and Central America. Often when you go into a supermarket, they are the first things that you see, along with the fruit. The plants look like they have huge flowers, but actually, the colors come from leaves, not petals. You can find Pointsettias that are pink, red, white, and mottled. Not many flowers grow in these areas at Christmas time; gardens and farms are dormant because of the cold. So, truck loads of these flowers are transported from Mexico and Central America to our supermarkets, by the thousands. Christmas trees are a very special part of Winter, but Poinsettias are a pretty, traditional touch to the season's decorations.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Verbs</em>: to grow (grow, grew, grown).</p>
<p>Ex: Carrots grow well here. They grew well last year. They are grown nearly everywhere.</p>
<p>To come (come, came, come).</p>
<p>Ex: He comes from China. They came to our house yesterday.&nbsp;Has Santa come down the chimney yet?</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: along with, actually, often.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>You have probably noticed by now that I am a Christmas fanatic. The snow, the decorations, the traditions, and the actual meaning of Christmas, are all cherished by my family. Well, there is a little part of this season which definitely puts an annual smile on many faces. The Poinsettia. You can pick them up just about anywhere this time of year. Even the craft stores sell fake ones. They come in quite a variety of colors: red, pink, white, and mottled. A recent fashion has been sprayed Poinsettias; so now, they even come in sparkling blue and purple. That's not exactly my cup of tea; I prefer the natural colors. The flower was introduced to the United States by the first ambassador to Mexico, Joel Robert Poinsett. Legend has it that two poor children, Maria and Pablo, wished to decorate a local nativity scene with presents. They brought only weeds, and were picked on and humiliated by the other children. Then, suddenly, miraculously, the weeds burst into color, forming the shapes of stars. Their humble gift had been accepted and blessed. Love and well meaning triumphed. Poinsettias as a result are also known as the 'Flower of the Holy night.'</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Do you enjoy shopping? Do you do it very often? Are there many shops where you live? Here in Wenatchee, a small town, we have a few shopping areas. Some stores are well known; others are privately owned, small businesses. I like shopping when I have plenty of time. Sometimes, though, it is stressful. One of the most stressful days to shop is the day after Thanksgiving. Most stores have big sales. The word is BARGAIN. On every shop door you can see numbers: fifty percent off, seventy five percent off, even ninety percent off! Because the sales are so good, most people do their Christmas shopping. They can save a lot of money. The main problem is that there are too many people. Crowds, noise, traffic, pushing, tired children crying, oh it's a crazy day. It is a part of this culture, the way people live here, but, I must say, it can be quite stressful.</p>

<p>Have you ever been around so many people that you felt trapped? It's a feeling called claustrophobia. It is unpleasant to say the least.

I also discovered a secret weapon that defended me against the onslaught of noise and stress. My iPod.

Do you enjoy shopping? Do you do it very often? Are there many shops where you live? Here in Wenatchee, a small town, we have a few shopping areas. Some stores are well known; others are privately owned, small businesses. I like shopping when I have plenty of time. Sometimes, though, it is stressful. One of the most stressful days to shop is the day after Thanksgiving. Most stores have big sales. The word is BARGAIN. On every shop door you can see numbers: fifty percent off, seventy five percent off, even ninety percent off! Because the sales are so good, most people do their Christmas shopping. They can save a lot of money. The main problem is that there are too many people. Crowds, noise, traffic, pushing, tired children crying, oh it's a crazy day. It is a part of this culture, the way people live here, but, I must say, it can be quite stressful.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday. It is a tradition that is very important for most Americans. It is a yearly celebration that reflects on history. Americans celebrate this special day in remembrance of the first settlers from Europe, the Pilgrims. They suffered during the first years of living here. The Winter was very cold; there was very little food. Many of them died or got sick. Those who survived were helped by the Native Indians. They were shown how to grow native foods, and how to look after themselves. As a result, they gave thanks to God and to the Indians for their survival. Thanksgiving gives us an opportunity to think of the good things that we have in our lives. Most people get together with family or friends to have a big turkey dinner or lunch. It is a time, also, when children learn in school about the beginnings of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Useful vocabulary: yearly = annual; in remembrance = to remember; native = of the present country; the beginnings of something = how something started.</p>
<p>Verbs: to suffer (regular verb) = suffered in the preterite; 'was' and 'were' ex: The Winter was cold; they were helped. To die (died in past); to get sick (got sick in past).</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The day of Thanksgiving, twenty-two people came to my house for lunch. It was a little crazy, but, on the other hand, it was a delight. The people were all family: my mother, in-laws, nephews and nieces. The ages ranged from sixty-nine to two. Thankfully we have enough room to cope with so many people. We spruced up the house a couple of days before, rearranged furniture and tidied up. Of course, I put a huge turkey in the oven to cook for about five hours. Everybody who came brought a dish or two of food, so the preparations for me were not overwhelming. Before we ate, the oldest of the family, my Father-in-law, said a prayer of thanks for all the good things, or 'blessings', in our lives, and then we dove into the food. Plenty is an appropriate word for this holiday. The plenty from the harvest comes to our table and is enjoyed. Cornucopia, or a horn of plenty, is a symbol related to Thanksgiving. Afterwards, we had an open fire, we lit candles; the kids played and ran around making all kinds of noise and mess, and the adults sat and chatted. There was always someone making an extra trip into the kitchen for 'round two' or 'round three' of desserts. I resisted the temptation, but I certainly lingered over my pumpkin pie and cream.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Useful expressions: on the other hand; to spruce up s.t.; a dish (of food) * it is often not necessary to mention the food; a 'dish' implies food.

<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>It gets dark here in Wenatchee at about four thirty in the afternoon now. My children often ask me what the time is, or whether they need to get ready for bed, when it is still early. It can be a little confusing. One thing that I like to do quite soon in the Winter, is to put Christmas lights up on the trees outside the house. They are so pretty. Also, the children play outside longer when there are different lights outside. Some of the businesses in town have already decorated their buildings and landscaping. It encourages people to keep shopping. We have lights of many different colors. My favorites are green and blue. Some people in our neighborhood really go to town with the lights. Infact, there is a competition held every year for the best decorated house. People drive around the town to 'Christmas light spot'. They drive up to and admire the prettiest houses.</p>

<p>I must be a big kid at heart, because this time of year is special for me. Obviously, with Thanksgiving and Christmas around the corner, there is a lot of preparation and decorating. The dark nights and lack of sky light are compensated for by all the twinkly lights in town. Some neighborhoods look like Las Vegas. It can become a real show piece, and, at the very least, a cheery sight to view from a car. We usually start the festivities early, by decorating the trees outside. You can hear the "Oooh", and "aaah", from adults and children alike when they see the lights. When a pine tree is decorated with green, it glows magically. And when it is covered with blue lights, it has a cool, mysterious shine. I think that most people appreciate the beauty of the lights. There is work involved in putting the lights up, though. It can be a tricky job. In fact, many people end up in the emergency room because of falls from ladders or electrocution. Well, I hope that won't be my fate this year; I will be extra careful. Just you wait until my trees are decorated. There will certainly be pictures on this web site of all the colors and twinkling lights.</p>

<p>Having four children is wonderful, but it can be a lot of hard work. Sometimes, I find myself in the car driving all over town taking the kids to different activities. Two have swimming, so the younger two have to come along. Sometimes, my daughter, the youngest, will fall asleep in the car on the way to the swimming pool. That is actually a good thing. But then, what do I do with my third boy who is wide awake and wanting to do something interesting? Well, if we drop the boys off at the pool and then go to the mall, my girl willingly wakes up, and she and her brother get to play. They play on the stationary vehicles and have a gum-ball each. Their favorite vehicle is the icecream truck that is very cute, plays music, and has flashing lights. There is also a helicopter, a four-wheeler, and a horse. It is a real treat for them. The trouble is, they never want to leave.</p>

<p>Being a parent can sometimes be a bit of a balancing act, especially if you have more than one child. We all know that it is good for children to be involved in sports and other hobbies, but the more kids you have, the more running around you have to do. It is simple multiplication. Talking to mothers in this area has shown me that, often, the car becomes the mother's best friend. By sheer necessity the vehicles that tend to be a man's domain, become transformed by a woman's touch. It is inevitable if a woman finds herself in a car very often, then she will exert an influence upon it. Suddenly, it will be cleaner than usual. It will probably smell like lemon, lavendar, or pine. There will also be an organized stash of tissues, hand sanitizer, cream, mascara, cds, and small healthy snacks. Perhaps even a magazine or two will be slipped into a seat pocket for a quick read while the lady is waiting for a game to finish. In between dropping off and picking up children, a quick escape to the mall with the youngest can be made. It's only fair, after all, that they have some fun while the older siblings play their sports.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Keep fit, even when it's cold</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Winter is just about here in Wenatchee. The air is cold; we have heavy frost most mornings. Thankfully, the days are still quite sunny, even though they are short. What do children do in the afternoons, after school, to keep fit? Even after a long day at school, they still need to exercize. Swimming is a great sport. When it is too cold outside, children can swim comfortably in a warm swimming pool. Two of my boys take lessons. Their coaches teach them to swim well, moving their arms and legs properly to be effective swimmers. When they started lessons, they splashed around a lot. Now, after a few weeks, they move smoothly and quickly through the water. A bit of coaching can make a big difference! Another thing that has increased is their appetite. After their swimming sessions, they are starving and usually ask for a big, juicy hamburger or some tacos.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Related vocabulary</em>: heavy frost, heavy snow, heavy rain. To keep fit = to exercize. To swim (swimming); to bike (biking); to run (running) etc. A coach = a teacher and trainer of a sport. A lesson/ class/ a session.</p>
<p><em>Verbs</em>: When they started lessons, they <em>splashed</em> around a lot = same as imperfect, 'they would splash around a lot' (they were in the habit of splashing around).</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>As the cold, dark season of Winter approaches, it is very tempting to stay at home where it is warm and cozy. The trouble is, we all need exercize. This time of year is also when, traditionally, we make more comfort foods which tend to be heavy and rich. It is not a bad thing in itself. Most people crave these things in the Winter, as if we were bears fattening ourselves up in preparation for a long sleep. But, we don't hibernate; we are certainly conscious and active through the Winter. It is important, therefore, to stay fit and healthy by exercizing. It is good for our moods as well. Swimming is a great sport. It is one of those activities that you can enjoy at any age. After a bit of training, you can improve your stroke, breathing, and speed. It is a wonderful way for children to release pent-up aggression. I think that there is a sort of primordial comfort in warm water as well, maybe a memory of the womb. I'm sure this Winter I will be found leaping in and having fun.</p>

Related vocabulary: heavy frost, heavy snow, heavy rain. To keep fit = to exercize. To swim (swimming); to bike (biking); to run (running) etc. A coach = a teacher and trainer of a sport. A lesson/ class/ a session.
Verbs: When they started lessons, they splashed around a lot = same as imperfect, 'they would splash around a lot' (they were in the habit of splashing around).
Advanced.
As the cold, dark season of Winter approaches, it is very tempting to stay at home where it is warm and cozy. The trouble is, we all need exercize. This time of year is also when, traditionally, we make more comfort foods which tend to be heavy and rich. It is not a bad thing in itself. Most people crave these things in the Winter, as if we were bears fattening ourselves up in preparation for a long sleep. But, we don't hibernate; we are certainly conscious and active through the Winter. It is important, therefore, to stay fit and healthy by exercizing. It is good for our moods as well. Swimming is a great sport. It is one of those activities that you can enjoy at any age. After a bit of training, you can improve your stroke, breathing, and speed. It is a wonderful way for children to release pent-up aggression. I think that there is a sort of primordial comfort in warm water as well, maybe a memory of the womb. I'm sure this Winter I will be found leaping in and having fun.
Grammar notes.
Useful expressions: it is tempting to...; the trouble is.....; ... in preparation for....;
Verbs: to crave; to hibernate; to train; to improve; to release.
Related words: to splash, a stroke, sport, speed, to leap (in/ out/ around).]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A gargantuan doll.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>The other day, my mother came to visit with a special present. It was something that she had bought at an auction. She often buys presents for my children; she's their grandmother, so she spoils them. It was a special gift for my daughter. I had no idea what it could be. When she showed it to me, I couldn't believe my eyes. It was the biggest doll that I have ever seen. It is bigger than my daughter. It's hair is long and curly, and it wears a frilly, pink dress. The dress will probably fit my daughter in two years! Well, she loves the present. However, my boys told me that it frightens them. What scares them about a doll? It's size.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>When my mother told me that she had a surprize for my daughter, I thought, " Oh, the ususal cute little dolly or some art supplies". Well, I was wrong. Very wrong. This gift has stretched the boundaries of what I thought my mother was capable of. Apparently, she had been to an auction and bid on an expensive doll. Nobody else bid for it, so the starting price went lower and lower until it was very affordable. She was very excited to tell me about her acquisition, but she had a glint in her eye that made me wonder if martinis had been served at this auction. The cute, little, delicate doll is, in reality, a five foot, heavy giant of a doll. Should we even call it a doll? My daughter loves it. However, my three sons, even my ten year old, are scared of it. Since it has been in the house, they have all insisted on sleeping in the same bedroom. They expect it to come to life in the middle of the night to terrorize us all. The huge, frilly dress makes her even more terrifying. What was my mother thinking? It's not a toy I can accidentally on purpose drop into the dumpster; her limbs are so big, they would stick out, to the horror of the neighbors. Perhaps I could leave her on a park bench. Any suggestions?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A choice of puppies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>We have a dog. It is a female. Her name is Rosie. We all love her very much. However, I think my children would like another dog. Actually, it would be nice for Rosie to have a playmate. The children spend quite a few hours in school and only play with Rosie later in the day and at the weekend. One good place to find a dog is the Humane Society. This is an amazing place. Animals that have been abandoned or who are unwanted find a home here. They are fed, exercised, given medicines if they need any, and put up for adoption. The public can go and visit the animals and buy them for a low price. I am happy that there is a place like that for the poor animals that nobody wants. Humane means treating living things well and with respect.</p>

<p>My children roped me into going to the Humane Society today. It's not as though I don't like the place, it's just that my children seem to rope me into doing lots of things lately. I am actually very pleased that we have a Humane Society in our town. We have been considering getting another puppy as a playmate for our dog Rosie. So, of course, on the way there, everybody was talking with excitement about the kind of dog we should get and when. As we walked in, we saw, immediately infront of us, a set of cages for cats. Big, medium and small were laying around looking feline and soft, their kittens playing rapidly with toys and bits of paper. We were allowed to pet a few of them. They seemed so tiny and fragile compared to our dog. Next, we were off to the kennels. There were three rooms with individual dogs in each. Again, the variety was huge. Some of them were lively and loud, while others had sorrowful, self pitying eyes and quiet demeanours. It made you wonder what their experiences had been. We played with a couple of puppies, sibblings, but they were too strong and boisterous for us. It was time to go, but I know that it is only a matter of time until we return.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The mouse hole on the stairs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Our house has one flight of stairs that goes up to the bedrooms. There is a small landing half way up. This area is in the middle of being decorated. I have taken down some wall paper, and soon the walls will be painted. As I was looking at the torn wall paper, I found a hole in the wall. And, do you know what was next to the hole? Two pieces of cheese. I didn't put them there. So who did? I think I have the answer. My children have great imaginations and they love animals. We read them stories about animals and animal adventures all the time. They also have videos that show animals who are almost human. My suspicion is that someone is hoping that a mouse family is living in our walls. I'm not sure if I would like that! But what stories we could tell!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Related vocabulary: A flight of stairs = a staircase; a landing; animal adventures; imagination; stories.</p>
<p>Verbs: to take down/ put up wall paper. To have a good imagination.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Recently I have found cheese missing from the fridge. It is not that unusual, of course, having four children who are growing fast and able to help themselves to food in the kitchen. But, what is unusual is where I have found the missing cheese. On the landing, half-way up the stairs, next to a hole that sits right above the carpet is where the cheese has been moved to. Hmmm. Why there? It is imagination that has driven the kids, which one in particular I'm not sure, to coax out Beatrix Potter mice from the walls. Wouldn't it be fascinating to see a family of mice run out and grab the cheese, leave a thankyou note, and pop back into their safe hole! These mice are inteligent, of course. They can not only write, but they also know how to sew, play instruments, and have parties. Didn't you know that? At least, that is what the stories that we read to our children say. Perhaps it would be not only a cute experience for my children, but a useful one for me. If these creatures are so inteligent, we could make friends, and then they could help me with the laundry or do some ironing. Wait a minute, let me get some more cheese.....</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Do you have gas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>What kind of a question is that? Are you talking about my body or my car? Well, actually, I am talking about your car. Gas, or petrol, as it is called in England, is a big subject at the moment. Driving a car has become really expensive. Oil prices all over the world are high. Many people have stopped using their cars and are going to work or school by bus or by bicycle. Many cars in the United States are big and use alot of gas, so, in order to save money, some people are selling their vehicles and buying smaller ones. It is a good idea. Oil comes from many countries, but mainly the Middle East, Russia, and Venezuela. Perhaps the oil prices will come down soon. Millions of people hope so.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Verbs</em>. Present continuous has -ing ending. Exs: talking, driving, using.</p>
<p>Tens/ hundreds/ thousands / millions of + subject. Ex: millions of people.</p>
<p><em>Useful expressions</em>: all over the world/ place/ country etc; to go by bus/ train/ airplane/ car/ bike/ boat etc.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>It is quite depressing to pay a fortune every time you fill the car up with gas. But that is the circumstance for now. Everyone is feeling it. The high gas prices have made most people rethink their budgets and their real need for driving. When gas was cheap, it was easy to make a quick trip to the store just to buy an item or two. Not anymore. Planning ahead to buy most things in one place has become a priority for more and more people. It makes sense. Why waste money and time? A little forethought can prevent the losses. Alternative energy sources like biofuels, and electricity from solar, wind, and thermal energy, seem very attractive at the moment. Wouldn't it be wonderful to clean up our air and water supplies, and have cheaper energy? I suppose it is just a question of time until we have these energy sources at our disposal. There is, apparently, still an awful lot of gas available to us. Will we, as nations, invest in these 'smart' choices, or will we first wait until the oil has run out?</p>

			<title>The turning leaf.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/turning_leaf.pdf]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The turning leaf.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>Are there many trees where you live? What kind are they? Do their leaves change color and fall this time of year? We have many different trees in this valley. Naturally, most of them would not be here because it does not rain very much. However, this whole area is irrigated, so trees, plants, and grass can grow. In my garden there are many trees. Most are deciduous which means that they loose their leaves in the fall. It is a beautiful sight. As I look out of the window, I see yellow, orange, red, brown and pink leaves in the trees and on the ground. Now that the frost comes every early morning, the leaves look like they are covered in powdered sugar. The ground is crunchy, the air is cold and still. What a magical time!</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Questions</em>: are there..? are they..? do their leaves..? *Verb first, then subject. Further examples: Does he sing? Are you okay? Is it raining?</p>
<p><em>Many</em> and <em>much</em>.</p>
<p>Many usually used with plural subjects, exs: many trees; many children; many people (singular but plural implied).</p>
<p>Much used with negative verb&nbsp;or singular subject. Exs: He didn't have much luck; they don't have much sugar in the store.</p>
<p>Useful words and expressions: Naturally, however, what a sight (beautiful/horrible etc), what a .... (boy, sight, nightmare, surprize etc).</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The other day, when I dropped my daughter off at preschool, something tiny but sparkly caught my eye. It was a pair of frozen leaves on the grass, just outside the school. The pattern of their edges came to my attention, as they are maple leaves. Each leaf has between five and seven serrated looking triangles pointing out in a star-like fashion. The frost had dulled the true color of the leaves, but had, at the same time, added a soft, crystal covering, subtle like a lady's veil. The frost is a morning phenomena which melts away as the sun gets higher in the sky, so it is small treat, on a cold day, to see such a pretty picture. I suppose&nbsp;this time of year really signifies the end of a season, and a necessary death of a part of nature. But what beauty we see in the passing of one season to another! As the leaves twirl and flutter to the ground, they are&nbsp;butterflies playing, dancing around and through the serious and motionless trees. A similar contrast is seen in the bright bursts of Autumn sun which soon give way to dark clouds and shorter days.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Pluperfect</em> tense: subject + had + past participle, exs: the leaves had fallen; the time had come; they had driven there etc.</p>
<p><em>Metaphors</em>. Exs: The leaves are butterflies; he is a pig; she is an angel.</p>
<p>Useful expressions: To drop a person off/ to pick a person up; ...came to my (anybody's) attention; at the same time; to give way to.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The turning leaf.
Beginners.
Are there many trees where you live? What kind are they? Do their leaves change color and fall this time of year? We have many different trees in this valley. Naturally, most of them would not be here because it does not rain very much. However, this whole area is irrigated, so trees, plants, and grass can grow. In my garden there are many trees. Most are deciduous which means that they loose their leaves in the fall. It is a beautiful sight. As I look out of the window, I see yellow, orange, red, brown and pink leaves in the trees and on the ground. Now that the frost comes every early morning, the leaves look like they are covered in powdered sugar. The ground is crunchy, the air is cold and still. What a magical time!
Grammar notes.
Questions: are there..? are they..? do their leaves..? *Verb first, then subject. Further examples: Does he sing? Are you okay? Is it raining?
Many and much.
Many usually used with plural subjects, exs: many trees; many children; many people (singular but plural implied).
Much used with negative verb&nbsp;or singular subject. Exs: He didn't have much luck; they don't have much sugar in the store.
Useful words and expressions: Naturally, however, what a sight (beautiful/horrible etc), what a .... (boy, sight, nightmare, surprize etc).
Advanced.
The other day, when I dropped my daughter off at preschool, something tiny but sparkly caught my eye. It was a pair of frozen leaves on the grass, just outside the school. The pattern of their edges came to my attention, as they are maple leaves. Each leaf has between five and seven serrated looking triangles pointing out in a star-like fashion. The frost had dulled the true color of the leaves, but had, at the same time, added a soft, crystal covering, subtle like a lady's veil. The frost is a morning phenomena which melts away as the sun gets higher in the sky, so it is small treat, on a cold day, to see such a pretty picture. I suppose&nbsp;this time of year really signifies the end of a season, and a necessary death of a part of nature. But what beauty we see in the passing of one season to another! As the leaves twirl and flutter to the ground, they are&nbsp;butterflies playing, dancing around and through the serious and motionless trees. A similar contrast is seen in the bright bursts of Autumn sun which soon give way to dark clouds and shorter days.
Grammar notes.
Pluperfect tense: subject + had + past participle, exs: the leaves had fallen; the time had come; they had driven there etc.
Metaphors. Exs: The leaves are butterflies; he is a pig; she is an angel.
Useful expressions: To drop a person off/ to pick a person up; ...came to my (anybody's) attention; at the same time; to give way to.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Goodbye Spooks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Halloween was 31st of October. It is a huge holiday here in the States. It is celebrated in many other countries, and sometimes has a different name. It has become more popular through the years. Shops sell lots of Halloween costumes,&nbsp;candies, and decorations. Jack-o-lanterns are, of course, a main image of Halloween. A large selection of them of all shapes and sizes, made out of different materials, are available in the stores. We had real Jack-o-lanterns, plastic, and ceramic ones. My children dressed up, as most children did. My daughter was a pig, and my three sons were: Darth Vader, the Scream, and the Black Angel. They don't sound friendly like the pig, do they? It was great fun, though. We all went around the neighborhoods saying, "Trick or treat." When the children got home, they counted their candies, as if it were treasure. They, of course, had far too much.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>All shapes and sizes</em> can describe things or people.</p>
<p><em>Lots of</em> ..... is a more everyday use which means <em>many.</em></p>
<p><em>A large selection =</em> a wide selection.</p>
<p>Useful words: though, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>My husband threw&nbsp;our home-grown pumpkins in the dumpster yesterday. They were moldy and had collapsed. They had been our Jack-o-lanterns for&nbsp;a couple of weeks. I'm not sure that they had managed to 'spook' anyone. Perhaps they were thrown a courtesy double glance by an occasional passer-by. The neighbor's cat had a good sniff at one of them the other day, then walked away, uninterested. The time for Halloween and spookiness has gone. The costumes that mothers hunted for have been put away in closets, and the scary masks have been boxed up or given away. Now the calendar, shown by what is on sale in the stores, points to Thanksgiving, closely followed by Christmas. Some stores display holiday paraphinalia four months or so before the actual day. It's ridiculous, really. Of course, it is driven by materialism and commerce, but it makes me feel as though I cannot enjoy the moment; I always have to rush towards some other event instead of being content to experience normal, non-holiday days. So, here's to those spooks that decorated our house for a while. Let's hang on to their comical and odd images for a while before we rush into the next holiday.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Guy Fawkes Day</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>November 5th is an important day in England. It is called Guy Fawkes Day. We have fireworks and big bonfires every year to celebrate parliament in our country. Guy Fawkes was a criminal. He tried to blow up the government and the king. He didn't do it. The police caught him and arrested him. This happened in 1605. The children make a figure out of material, they put it in a public place, and they ask for money. They spend the money&nbsp;on fireworks or candies. It is a fun holiday for everyone, especially because the nights are dark in late Fall. Each town and village has its own bonfire which is huge, and the people come from their homes, watch the fireworks, and eat baked potatoes. Then the 'Guy' is burned on the fire. What a tradition!</p>

<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>"Remember, remember the fifth of November,</p>
<p>Gun powder, treason, and plot."</p>
<p>These are the first two lines of a saying we have to celebrate the capture of Guy Fawkes in 1605, and the saving of the Houses of Parliament and King James 1st. I suppose it is a true story. It has certainly been celebrated and enjoyed for four hundred years. Apparently, shortly before the gunpowder was lit, Guy Fawkes, who was standing guard, was spotted and arrested. He was tried, found guilty, and executed. I will spare you the gory details. And so, we celebrate the continuance of government, the monarchy, and democracy. I feel great nostalgia at this time of year which is partly because of this special day. Each town and village would build a huge pile of wood in a public park or field. Then, as soon as it was dark, the people would start coming from their homes. The streets and alleyways would empty as the wide body of shadows would slide down to the field. You couldn't see anyone's face until the bonfire was lit. I remember feeling the warmth coming from this enormous, sun-like burning mass. Then, sparklers would be handed out to the children, so we could swirl them around for a few minutes, and be absorbed by their brilliance. Children find these moments magical, of course. It is not until we are adults that we realize the significance of this piece of our culture, and that it is exactly this kind of celebration that makes each country unique.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Elections are over</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Tuesday&nbsp;was the fourth of November, election day. Many people went to vote. They chose the person they wanted for President. There were two choices: John McCain and Barack Obama. The two men have been campaigning for more than a year. They have been traveling all over the United States, telling people about why they want to be President, and what they can do for the country. They must be tired now. They must also be very excited to find out who has won the election. The man who wins will be President for four years. Then he can try again to be President, one more time. You can vote when you are eighteen years old. There are two ways to vote. On election day, you can go to a 'voting booth' which is a place where a person gives you a paper, you put your name on it and then vote. Or you can send in your vote by mail a few days before election day. I voted by mail. We will find out on Thursday who is the next President.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Related words: to vote, to campaign, election.</p>
<p>Present continuous: They have been traveling, they have been campaigning. <em>More examples</em>: I have been working; she has been typing.</p>
<p>Adjectives: They are tired, excited, nervous, exhausted, happy, ill etc.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Finally election day has come and gone. It is a relief that it is over. The two presidential candidates have been campaigning for almost two years. I don't know how they could keep up that pace for so long. They obviously are convinced that the race is worth it. Well, we will find out on Thursday who will be the head of the country for the next four years. The public has shown many emotions on television and through the media during this presidential race. Hope, anger, frustration, and nervousness are just a few of the emotions that have been demonstrated by people writing or speaking. Obviously everyone hopes that the best person for the job will be chosen. But how do we know who the best person is? Can we tell by what he says? Can we tell by his experience in politics? What about the people who will help him? Do we know enough about them to understand if they are trustworthy and honest? I suppose, as with most jobs, we will find out after whoever is chosen has been working for a few months. As the saying goes, 'Time will tell'.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>And the rain came down</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday it rained most of the day. Last night&nbsp;it rained all night. And now, this morning, it is still raining. It doesn't often rain in this valley. Wenatchee is called a desert, and I suppose it is. However, about this time, in November, the rain comes. Sometimes it stays for a few days. It prepares us, and the ground, for the snow. At the end of November the snow comes. It stays for about four months. Some people who live in rainy Seattle get tired of the rain, but here, it is a treat. Children can put on their rubber boots and splash in the puddles. Getting wet isn't a terrible thing. You can always get dry afterwards. But you do need to be prepared: rubber boots, a long coat, and, perhaps, an umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>To rain is a regular verb: it rains, it is raining, it rained, it was raining, it had rained.</p>

<p>Useful words: However, sometimes, about, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Drip, drip, drip, pitter, patter, plop. These are the sounds that I have heard on the roof and all around the house for the past two days. It has rained consistently, even during the night. For me, it is pure nostalgia. Being from England, I am used to puddles, drips, drops, and splashes. As a child, I played in the rain, went to school in the rain, watched the rain from steamed-up windows, and even built forts in the rain. English kids don't let a little water get in the way of their fun. Mind you, Seattle gets much more rainfall than England. My Sister-in-law who lives there, told me that, in the Winter, they can get a whole month of non-stop rain.&nbsp;Now that might be too much even by english standards!&nbsp;It certainly is a transformation for our valley that would be totally dry were it not for irrigation. The&nbsp;low clouds, dull light, and&nbsp;soft sounds of the&nbsp;droplets falling everywhere, together create a story-like setting.

<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>The other day when I picked my children up from school, my oldest boys handed me their school pictures. Once a year, as in most schools, the children have their photographs taken. It adds some importance to the day, as most children want to look their best. They will choose their clothes the night before, as they wish to look especially smart. Well, their photos were a success, but something that Cass, my second son, said made me think, "Mom, technology is amazing! A friend of mine had a chicken pock in the middle of his forehead when they took his photo, but the photographer erased it with his computer!" Wow. Things really have changed since I was their age. We went on to have a discussion about technology in my youth, or, as they consider it, "in the olden days".... No, I didn't have a cell phone; neither did my parents. Our televisons were big and bulky, and we listened to music on the radio, or we played it on records. In fact, when the first Pac Man and Ping Pong computer games came out, every one was amazed. It is fascinating to see the speed with which technology is improving, and to think of what will be considered 'normal technology' by my children when they are my age.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Verbs: to pick up (someone) / to drop off (someone). To have a discussion <em>doesnot</em> mean to have an argument. To erase = to rub out. To consider something normal / abnormal.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The upcoming elections</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>With the upcoming elections just around the corner, the United States is abuzz with discussions, arguments, accusations, and predictions. I think that it is actually a good thing. Whenever people get together and air their opinions in a civilized manner, a lot can be accomplished. Many people, I have found, particularly in rural areas, do not talk regularly about politics, or critique political agendas. Perhaps they are too caught-up in personal affairs to give the news and the issues the time. Following national, political events takes time, and so, it seems to follow that if people are too busy, they will generally be uninformed. That is precisely why I say that the political 'buzz' is a good thing.Unfortunately the candidates, John McCain and Barak Obama, have not exactly been the examples of civility and good manners towards eachother. One would hope that they could demonstrate to the country how to politely disagree, and perhaps even find common ground. Is that idealism, pie in the sky? I hope not. I would have thought, that with the whole world watching, the candidates would show the greatest dignity, and spend more time talking about issues rather than pointing a negative finger at eachother. What do you think?</p>

I am glad that what I think can add to the country's destiny. In England, where I come from, we have a similar election process, but we do not have a Presidential race.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the ways in which my family and I relax during the evening is watching movies. It is more an occasional treat than a daily activity. Life in a big family is very busy, and often there is very little time to sit down, let alone to watch a film. But when we do, we love to snuggle up together after a good meal and watch something exciting or inspiring. Spiderman is one of our favorites. Of course it's fantasy, but why not? My second oldest boy used to be a fanatic. He had the costumes, the legos, and, of course, the comics. For Halloween he was Spiderman; for one of his birthdays the theme was, well, you guessed it, that same hero. He even practiced the Spiderman 'moves'. It is incredibly cute to see a little boy of six or seven years try to whip around the house like the man in red. We recently watched the latest addition to the Spiderman saga; the mind boggles at the new 'bad guys' with all their different physical characteristics, powers, and reasons for being evil. At the conclusion of the movie, the children will jump around, happy and relieved that the 'baddies' got what they deserved, and that justice triumphs. Even for adults, it's an easy way to feel empowered to improve the state of the world.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Don't step on my shadow</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced</strong>.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed just how bright the sun can be in Autumn. The angle of the sun, or perhaps its proximity to the earth, seems to make the sunlight intense, in a way that is different from Summer. As we were walking home today from the mailbox, my son, Robert, said, "Don't step on my shadow, mum!" I looked at the shadow that he and his bicycle cast on the ground, and I realised that, at least for a few weeks, I had been missing the clearly&nbsp;defined, dark shadows all around. Children pick up on these things, of course. They are more likely, than us adults, to notice anything that is close to the ground. At school they play games with shadows during recess. One in particular is 'Shadow tag'. The person who is 'it' has to chase the rest of the group and 'tag' someone's shadow; that person then becomes the tagger. Then, as the day draws to a close, the shadows lengthen and take on a slightly sinister look, which, again, gives children an opportunity to play and imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Mailbox (americanism) = post box; to realize (americanism) = to realise; recess = playtime; tag = catch.</p>
<p>To cast used in 'to cast a shadow', and also in 'to cast doubt on something.'</p>
<p>To pick up on something = to realise or notice something.</p>
<p>To take on a look = to become in appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>Shadows are interesting things. They can be fun to play with, especially for children. In Autumn, the bright sun helps to create strong looking shadows everywhere. Children often play games with shadows. In films and books we find shadows mentioned; they stir up our imaginations. As the sun goes down, and it starts to get darker, the shadows stretch and stretch, and become very long. It looks a little scary and odd. To see a long shadow of a person move can be quite spooky. Children are very creative and playful, and shadows are things that they can use to have fun.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>Rosie is the name of a member of our family.&nbsp;She is a&nbsp;female who does not quite reflect the beauty of her name. She is scruffy, hyper-active, and demanding. Yes, you've guessed; she is our dog. A boarder terrier is the name of her breed. They are highly intelligent dogs used for 'ratting', which means seeking out and destroying rats. As such, their coats are wiry, their teeth are big, they are small enough to fit down vermin holes, and they have a passion for digging. The first time I gave her a bone, she immediately headed for the privacy of a spot in the garden, knawed her prize for almost an hour, and then proceeded to bury it. I observed her for a while, fascinated at her powerful instincts that were triggered by the bone. Rosie is so much a part of our family, yet she is so different from us. Her greatest delights are to simply be with us, and to have an occasional bone. If only humans were so easy to please!</p>

<p>Do you have a dog? We do. Ours is still a puppy, a female. Her name is Rosie, like the flower. She doesn't look like a rose, though. She is black and brown, she has black eyes, and is a very curious pup. My children love to run and play with her. She is learning to pick up a ball or a stick when we throw them. She doesn't always bring them back, however. She is a part of our family now. She makes us laugh, and we love to hug and pet her. We also have two lizards, a bearded dragon, and a frog. Our house is full of life. Actually, my children and my husband make more noise than the animals, - and more mess! It is fun to have pets. Even us adults can learn a lot about animals, their needs, and how fascinating and different they all are.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Advanced.</strong></p>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is gardening. I suppose I must have inherited the gardening gene, because, apparently, on my father's side, my grandmother had tremendously green fingers. That is what we say in England for someone who is adept and experienced at growing flowers and vegetables. In the United States, the expression is to have 'green thumbs'. Now that the seasons have changed and Winter is approaching, gardening mainly entails tidying up around the still-blooming Autumn flowers, raking leaves, digging up the last of the vegetables, and collecting seeds. The latter is my favorite. Seeds are everywhere, and what an incredible, potent piece of nature they are! If you are patient and selective, you can gather enough for next year to propagate a field full of color. You can actually become a designer of next year's garden. What a thrill!</p>

<p>I love to work in the garden. Being outside is both healthy and fun. The colors of the flowers and vegetables can be very beautiful. Now is Autumn, so many plants are producing seeds. They are small but very powerful things. I collect them. Why do I do this? Well, next year I will use them in my garden. I don't need to buy seeds if I have so many already in my back yard. My children will help me plant them. We will talk about the plants that will grow, and also how to look after them. This is a fun activity for the whole family.</p>

One of my favorite hobbies is gardening. I suppose I must have inherited the gardening gene, because, apparently, on my father's side, my grandmother had tremendously green fingers. That is what we say in England for someone who is adept and experienced at growing flowers and vegetables. In the United States, the expression is to have 'green thumbs'.

			<title>Chicken soup</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/Pollo_sopa.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Advanced</strong>.</p>
<p>As the seasons change from Summer to Autumn, a certain recipe that I use starts to appear more often. Chicken soup. Ah, what a concept! It has been used for centuries&nbsp;by people who are ill; runny noses, coughs, and aches and pains disappear as this special liquid is digested. It's simple, hot deliciousness warms up our bones and makes us feel comforted, like babies being wrapped in warm blankets. In fact, comfort is exactly what it is, a comfort food, like macaroni and cheese, or meat and potato pie. But there is something extra special about this soup. Grandmothers swear by it; some even say that it has magical powers. All I know is that the combination of chicken stock and thin pasta noodles is an endearing childhood memory.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Autumn is replaceable with Fall(americanism).</p>
<p>Useful expressions: aches and pains, exactly, extra special.</p>
<p>Verbs with <em>prepositions</em>: to swear by, to warm up.</p>
<p>All I know&nbsp;is that (colloquial) =&nbsp;in conclusion, as a summary, to sum up.</p>
<p><strong>Beginners.</strong></p>
<p>When it is cold outside, I feel like having something warm to eat. Many people get coughs and colds when the weather changes from warm to cold. Sometimes, children have to miss school for a day or two because they are sick. There are medicines that you can buy to help you feel better. One thing that always makes me feel better is a bowl of chicken noodle soup. It is magic! I feel warm and happier when I eat it. You can buy it in cans, or packets, or you can make it yourself. Either way, it is delicious, natural medicine that chases away our colds and flus.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes</strong>.</p>
<p>Opposites: cold/ hot, warm/ cool.</p>
<p>To feel ill = to feel sick(americanism)</p>
<p>Common illnesses: cough, cold, runny nose, sneezes, fever, aches.</p>
<p>Useful expressions for writing: sometimes, either way.</p>

			<title>Celebrate pumpkin time.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/acupofenglish/pumpkin.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Beginners</strong>.</p>
<p>Pumpkins, pumpkins, big, fat, and round. Children love them, and adults too. They grow all Summer; turn color from green to orange. Some stay small, but others get bigger and bigger. I have some in my garden. One, two, three, four. One for each of my children. They will be Jack-o-lanterns with eyes, noses, and mouths. Do you like our Mr. Pumpkin in the photo? What do you think? Is he friendly or scary?</p>
<p><strong>Grammar notes.</strong></p>
<p>Verbs which are <em>regular</em> in the <em>present</em>: to love, to grow, to get, to like, to think.</p>
<p>I love, you love, he loves, we love, you(pl.) love, they love.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced</strong>.</p>
<p>Oh, it's pumpkin time in the North West. October gives a touch of magic to our little town of Wenatchee. The colors of Autumn begin to appear here and there, and, though the days are getting shorter, they are sunny and still. It is the perfect time for contemplating nature. Perhaps there is enough sun this month to ripen up my tomatoes that are bulging and heavy, but, unfortunately, still green. The vegetable gardens in this area are quickly coming to an end, as Mr. Frost makes his quiet visit each morning. "Keep growing Mr. and Mrs. Pumpkin!" say my children as they visit our pumpkin patch. These huge, orange beauties, lying around in fading leaves, are almost human. But, why do children love them so much? Jack-o-lanterns, of course! And my favorite, pumpkin pie, yum!</p>
