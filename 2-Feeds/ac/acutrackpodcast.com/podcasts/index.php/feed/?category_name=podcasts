			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, we talked about the <a href="http://www.acutrackpodcast.com/podcasts/index.php/2008/01/24/17-manufacturers-perspective-hd-dvd-vs-blue-ray/">high definition DVD format war between HD-DVD and Blu-ray Disc</a>. At that time, it was unclear which format would be the winner. Today it&#8217;s clear that the war is over and Blu-ray Disc or “BD” is the high definition DVD format of choice going forward.</p>
<p>This was a major victory for Sony, especially in light of their failed attempts to position BetaMax, miniCD, miniDVD, and memory stick as de-facto standards for those technologies. Understandably, Sony wasted no time in ramping up on the BD tools for authoring, license/royalty protection, and package branding.</p>
<p>Today we are once again joined by Acutrack EVP Asheesh Barman to walk us through the specifics of what Blu-ray is and how the manufacturing process works.</p>
