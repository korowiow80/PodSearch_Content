			<title>The Cherry Blossoms</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the-cherry-blossoms]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's Cherry Blossom Time! We've been spotting more of these colorful blossoms this spring, all over the country, than we have any other year. The custom of celebrating their appearance comes from Japan, so we bring you a Japanese story that is supposed to explain how the tradition got started.</p>
<p>We're back in our old stomping grounds in Northern California, after a long and eventful drive from Arkansas, mostly on (sometimes muddy) backroads- including historic Route 66. Our adventures included horseback riding in Oklahoma, exploring the ruins of a 400-year-old mission in New Mexico, and stopping in the old mining town of Oatman, Arizona where wild burros roam the streets. And in Tehachapi, California, we visited <a target="_blank" title="Ostrich Farm" href="http://www.indianpointranch.com/">Indian Point Ranch</a>, a prime producer of ostriches, and fed some of Big Bird's distant cousins.</p>
<p>Now we're having the last few performances of our current production, "World Tales", and getting ready for our next show.</p>
<p>Happy Listening!<br />Dennis (Kindly Man, Mean Man, Prince) and Kimberly (Narrator, Kindly Woman, Mean Woman, Dog)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This familiar German tale popularized by the Brothers Grimm is given a new treatment by students from Forest Heights Elementary in Harrison, Arkansas. That's right - we let someone else do the performing while we just directed. These bright youngsters not only supplied all the voices, they supplied all the dialogue, which they improvised on the spot. It all happened in a podcasting <a target="_blank" href="http://activatedstorytheatre.com/workshops.html">workshop</a> we conducted at Forest Heights, one of three schools we appeared at in Harrison.</p>
<p>We come to you from Hot Springs, Arkansas, where we just performed for the many-eth time at the Garland County Library. We had an excellent turnout, including a wonderful family from Austin, TX who have been listening to our podcasts for some time. Great to meet up with them!</p>
<p>We also discuss our visit to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.helenkellerbirthplace.org/">Helen Keller's birthplace</a> in Tuscumbia, AL and our attendance of the "Resonant Objects Workshop" at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.puppet.org/">Center for Puppetry Arts</a> in Atlanta.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago, pigs were clean. At least in India. And then once upon a time drastic measures were called for.</p>

			<title>The Four Dragons</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the-four-dragons]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year! That's a bit late for American listeners, but it's a little early for Chinese listeners. Because Chinese New Year (aka Lunar New Year) is celebrated this year on Jan. 23 (Year of the Dragon). The exact date varies considerably from year to year (It will be Feb. 10 next year.) because it's based on a different calendar system.</p>
<p>Anyway, the dragons knew when to come visit us, just in time for Dragon Appreciation Day (Jan. 16th) - all four of them, appearing in our Chinese story "The Four Dragons", which we even named after them. Being skittish around dragons because of their more sinister character in Western folklore, we wouldn't dare <em>not</em> name it after them. It's a tale about how four dragons in very ancient times tried to persuade the Jade Emperor (the supreme god of ancient Chinese folklore) to send water to earth because the people were enduring a terrible drought.</p>
<p>We come to you from Myrtle Beach, SC, where we spent a day chasing and battling a dragon at <a target="_blank" title="MagiQuest (sound on site)" href="http://magiquest.com/">MagiQuest</a>, an interactive electronic fantasy adventure that you just have to see for yourself sometime. There are many different quests and adventures you can go on, collecting (virtual) objects with the aid of your magic wand, which you get to take home with you. It's like helping to create and act in your own fairy tale.</p>

			<title>The Strasburg Fairy</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the-strasburg-fairy]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This fairy tale from Germany offers a fanciful explanation for why we decorate Christmas trees. It comes from Germany, one of the two countries where the tradition originated (the other was what was then called Livonia) about 450 years ago. But it was based on older customs and traditions going back to ancient Egypt. And we discuss the surprising history of Christmas trees.</p>
<p>We're coming to you from Greenville, SC where we've become rather familiar with Christmas trees lately. And we relate our recent adventure doing an activity that we normally don't associate with this time of year: whitewater rafting at the fabulous U.S. National Whitewater Center in Charlotte, NC.</p>
<p>We hope your holiday season is a big splash.</p>

			<title>The Baker's Dozen</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the-baker-s-dozen]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>"The Baker's Dozen" is a holiday story from the Dutch settlers of upstate New York, about a stubborn baker who learns an invaluable lesson about generosity. The story commemorates St. Nicholas Day (Dec. 6) a day to honor a legendary figure who also figures prominently in another holiday later in the month.</p>
<p>Many people would be surprised to learn that St. Nicholas was a real person; and they'd be even more surprised to learn where he came from. He lived in the Fourth Century on the island of Lyra, which was then owned by Greece but later became part of Turkey. He was a rather small fellow who apparently had a broken nose. About a thousand years ago, his bones were smuggled to Italy to protect them from invaders, and they've been kept there ever since. But just recently, the Turkish government requested that Italy send them back so they can be put to rest in the place where he was born.</p>
<p>Nicholas was well known for his generosity, which included the habit of leaving coins in people's shoes - thus the tradition of gift-giving in December. Many legends arose around him, and his fame spread to other countries. Among the Dutch, he became known as Sinterklass, which later became the English Santa Claus, and the legends about him blended with traditions from Norse mythology, including the use of reindeer. Dutch settlers in America celebrated St. Nicholas Day by eating cookies shaped like him.</p>
<p>We come to you from Winston-Salem NC, after spending October enjoying the beautiful foliage and the haunting season in Massachusetts, and sending time with our son Zephyr in Rhode Island. And we tell you about our most recent ziplining adventure and our pilgrimage to Mayberry.</p>
<p>Happy Listening,</p>

<p>We come to you from New Jersey, where the floodwaters from Hurricane Irene have receded just in time for us to end our summer library season - much later than usual, even though we started much earlier than usual.</p>
<p>We discuss our recent trip to New York City, where we took a bus tour of Manhattan and saw "Billy Elliot" on Broadway. The show still has us tapping our feet!</p>

			<title>Lin Po Po</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/lin-po-po]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Lin Po Po&rdquo; is often called the Chinese Red Riding Hood, as it features a wolf masquerading as a grandmother. But it also bears similarities to other popular European tales, notably The Three Little Pigs. We offer it especially for Grandparents' Day (Sept. 11) and Chinese Moon Festival (Sept. 28). Not only is the story from China, and not only does it involve a grandmother, but even the moon makes a cameo.</p>
<p>We come to you from Dedham, Massachusetts as we wind down our summer tour. We recently took an introductory class on the flying trapeze at Jordan's Furniture store in Reading, Massachusetts. Yes, a furniture store. Jordan's has several outlets in New England, and they're unlike any other furniture stores you've admired rocking chairs in. Practicing what they call &ldquo;shoppertainment&rdquo;, each store offers something unique to entertain the visitors.</p>
<p>The store in Reading is the only one to offer trapeze lessons, operated by the Trapeze School of New York which, obviously, also has several locations. For nearly 2 hours, we were swinging from a trapeze with the greatest of ease and doing back-flips in mid-air. We even got to do some catches. And we can't wait to try it again. Ready...Hup!</p>

			<title>The Two Princesses</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the-two-princesses]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>The Two Princesses </em>is a folktale from India that you probably haven't heard before, but listening to it, you may get a sense of deja vu. There are many similarities between this story and about half a dozen other stories that you definitely are familiar with. See how many of them you can name. Put your answers in the comment section or call our hotline (800)429-6576 so we can play your answers on the next podcast.</p>
<p>We recorded this podcast in Pennsylvania, having just performed at the library in Williamsport - our first time there since 2004. While in Williamsport we dropped by the Little League Museum, beside the baseball stadium complex where the Little League World Series is played. We also saw the Grit building, which still bears the name of the legendary good news newspaper, though its offices were relocated to Kansas several years ago after 111 years in Williamsport.</p>
<p>And we talk about the fantabulous City Museum in St. Louis, where we spent a blissful day climbing the walls. And the tunnels. And the airplanes. And the strange, twisting crawl spaces in abundance. Not to mention sliding the slides (one of them ten stories tall), swinging on the swings, watching a circus act, and all manner of marvels guaranteed to make you forget about the real world for a while - even root canals.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Rumplestiltskin&rdquo;, as told by the Brothers Grimm, is one of the classic fairy tales about a supernatural creature who comes to the aid of a damsel in distress and demands a stiff payment (classically a first born child) unless the damsel can guess his name.</p>
<p>We come to you from northern Arkansas near the White River (which we mistakenly call the Buffalo River, which is not far away) after having performed at a series of libraries in the area. We also volunteered to help with the <a title="Joplin blog entries" href="http://activatedstorytheatre.com/travel/?s=Joplin">clean-up after the disaster in Joplin, Mo</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a title="A!S Tour Schedule" href="http://activatedstorytheatre.com/schedule.html">summer tour</a> is well underway, having started in the Reno, NV area in May, where we encountered snow. And now we are sweltering in the Midwestern summer. We always did go in for variety.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This month we bring you the Italian folktale Misfortune, about a young woman who has just that, and is called just that (she's called Misfortune, not Just That) thanks to a mean hag who follows her around, lurking in the shadows, and undoing everything the girl tries to do. Until Misfortune confronts her misfortune.</p>
<p>We come to you from Reno, NV, one of our perennial stops on the tour. When we open our new production here this month, it will be about the dozenth time we've appeared at the Washoe Co.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The Twin Brothers&rdquo; is a story from the former Czechoslovakia about two brothers who looked a great deal alike, and therefore were sometimes mistaken for each other. This is a motif that many writers have used, including of course Shakespeare. And as in most of these narratives, the brothers help each other out &ndash; or in this case, one rescues the other, aided by a magic sword and a talking fish. Doesn't every set of twins have those?</p>
<p>We come to you from Arkansas, fresh off our treks to Nashville and St. Louis with our son Zephyr along much of the way &ndash; he provides a guest voice on this podcast, just like the old days. We talk about our adventures wall climbing in Nashville, and attending a haunted attractions convention in St. Louis. And Zephyr brings us up-to-date on the new literature-inspired attraction at the amazing place where he works.</p>

			<title>The Boy Who Sought the North Wind</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the-boy-who-sought-the-north-wind]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This Norwegian Folk Tale is being presented especially for this harsh winter and in preparation for the windy March to come. It involves a motif common to many folktales: a young traveler is taken advantage of by an innkeeper twice, but the third time proves the charm.</p>
<p>We come to you from Chattanooga, TN, having made our way from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXOH3DT6lu8">Charleston</a>, SC., where we saw the Confederate submarine <a href="http://www.hunley.org/">H.L. Hunley</a> (the first submarine to sink a ship in battle, which occurred in 1864) and the <a href="http://www.charlestonteaplantation.com/">Charleston Tea Plantation</a> (the only tea plantation in North America).</p>
<p>From there, we went to Atlanta, and saw the former <a href="http://www.margaretmitchellhouse.com/">home of Margaret Mitchell</a>, a pioneering female journalist and author of the classic novel "Gone With the Wind". We also toured the <a href="http://www.puppet.org/">Center for Puppetry Arts</a>, which showcases puppets old and new from all over the world, ranging from shadow puppets to puppets constructed from found materials to classics like Punch and Judy to the latest hight-tech animatronic contraptions. Needless to say, there is a great deal of coverage of the extraordinary career of Jim Henson.</p>
<p>Just west of Georgia is the rustic retreat of <a href="http://www.historicbanningmills.com/">Historic Banning Mills</a>, which has a fantastic <a title="Watch K&amp;D zipline" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu-hMABlh8E">zip-lining</a> course, and we were blissfully walking and zipping along among the clouds (almost) for several hours.</p>
<p>And here in Chattanooga, we've toured two caves (<a href="http://www.rubyfalls.com/">Ruby Falls</a> and <a href="http://www.raccoonmountain.com/">Raccoon Mountain</a>) and the famous <a href="http://www.seerockcity.com/">Rock City</a>, and took a ride up (a mile up) the side of Lookout Mountain on the <a href="http://www.ridetheincline.com/">Chattanooga Incline Railway</a>. And oh yes, how could we pass up the <a href="http://www.internationaltowingmuseum.org/">International Towing and Recovery Museum</a>?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>"The Man Who Dreamed of His Fortune" is a story from the "1001 Nights", otherwise known as the "Arabian Nights", a collection of folktales that can be traced back more than 1000 years. These tales have many parallels in many other cultures, and this one is no exception. In fact, it is strikingly similar to the Japanese tale we call <a title="Act!vated Folktale" href="http://www.activatedstorytheatre.com/folktales/buzz.html">"Follow the Buzz</a>", which has been a popular part of our repertoire in the past.</p>
<p>We chose this story especially because Jan. 13 is Make Your Dreams Come True Day, and Jan. 15 is the birthday of Martin Luther King, who made the landmark "I have a dream speech". Of course, nowadays his birthday, or at least his legacy, is always observed on a Monday.</p>
<p>We come to you from Greenville, SC, where we have been holed up for the past month or so and dodging the snowstorms that have brought traffic (both on the road and in retail establishments) to a halt. We are preparing for our next performances in Goose Creek (near Charleston), before moving on to Tennessee.</p>
<p>Happy Listening!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/twelve-men-went-fishing]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Twelve Men Went Fishing&rdquo; is a noodlehead story about the English village of Gotham, which was supposedly inhabited entirely by fools. But the rumor was not entirely deserved &ndash; these &ldquo;fools&rdquo;, as is often the case, were much wiser than they appeared. In fact, there is a legend that Gotham got its reputation because once upon a time the king was thinking about building a home there, and the residents didn't like that idea because of all the problems it would cause (probably higher taxes, among other things). So they had a plan: when the king came to scope it out, they all behaved as insanely as they could to discourage him from settling among them. And the ruse worked, but it also earned their town a lasting reputation as one big madhouse.</p>
<p>In any case, this is one of the many amusing stories that have come down to us about the place. Nowadays, we are familiar with Gotham as a nickname for New York City, especially since Batman renamed the Big Apple as Gotham City. There's actually a connection with the old English folktales: Washington Irving, who thought Manhattan was inhabited by fools, nicknamed it Gotham in an issue of his magazine <em>The Salmagundi Papers.</em></p>
<p>We come to you in North Carolina, on our way to South Carolina, after touring New York and New Jersey. Before which we spent autumn in New England, visiting our son Zephyr in Rhode Island (we interview him on this podcast) and performing at Halloween haunted attractions in Rhode Island and Connecticut.  And now, like birds, we're heading south for the winter.</p>

			<title>Thor and Thrym</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/thor-and-thrym]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When you hear the thunder roll across the heavens, you're hearing Thor, the blacksmith of the gods, wield his hammer in Asgard. So said the ancient Scandinavians, and they told of a time when his thunder was stolen by the lord of the giants, an unpleasant fellow named Thrym. Like the Greeks and Romans (who also had blacksmith gods named Hephaestus and Vulcan respectively), the Norse folk acknowledged a hypothetical race of giants who were separate from and often antagonistic to the gods. And in this case, Thrym's thuggish theft of Thor's thrifty hammer threatens to throw a wrench into the thunder. But Thor comes up with a classic and rather comical ruse to get it back. Will he succeed? Tune in and find out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We come to you from New Jersey, where we recently put in some time <a title="Break Up the Routine, Volunteer" href="http://activatedstorytheatre.com/travel/2010/09/break_up_the_routine_volunteer/" target="_blank">volunteering at Cerebral Palsy of North Jersey</a>, assisting the patrons of the center with an art project called &ldquo;Brush with the Masters&rdquo;. The idea in this series of projects is to encourage them to create art in the style of certain famous artists. The day we went was Andy Warhol day, and we assisted them in adding color to black and white photographs of themselves, then affixing those photos to posterboard in a repeated series somewhat like Warhol's portrait of the Beatles or a soup can. Great fun &ndash; Thor himself couldn't have produced better art than they did.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Happy Listening,</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/DamonPythias.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Greetings! We're finally back on schedule with our first podcast since May when we were in Reno, about to set out on our summer tour. And now here we are, 3000 miles, dozens of performances and a new rear axle later. We come to you from Philadelphia, the birthplace of the U.S. And the "City of Brotherly Love" Which seems like an appropriate place to present a story about friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damon and Pythias&rdquo; is a Greek legend about two friends who were even closer buddies than Damon and Affleck. It was reported by many ancient authorities as being a true incident that occurred sometime in the 4<sup>th</sup> Century BCE in Syracuse, during the reign of the tyrant Dionysius the Elder. Regardless of how much truth there may be to the story, it has come to symbolize the ultimate friendship, to such an extent that Shakespeare alluded to it as such in Hamlet.</p>
<p>We offer this tale on the 18<sup>th</sup> anniversary of our departure from San Francisco and embarking on our extended tour of duty across the U.S. And while our trek hasn't been as ill-fated as that of Pythias, it has had its adventures and misadventures. Here's to the next 18!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Rip.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s our 100th podcast! And we&rsquo;re celebrating 22 years of performing. So we thought it was appropriate to bring you the story of &ldquo;Rip van Winkle&rdquo;, since he spent 20 years sleeping &ndash; which is exactly the opposite of what we and our audiences have been doing.</p>
<p>Long before science fiction writers got their hands on the concept of suspended animation, there was Rip van Winkle, created in 1818 by American author Washington Irving. Actually, created isn&rsquo;t quite the right word. Irving, who was known to borrow the themes for his classic tales from folktales, did likewise here. His yarn about a man sleeping for a long period of time and then awakening to find the world drastically changed is similar to stories to be found in Germany, China, Japan, Israel and Ireland among other places.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/King_Birds.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>He may not exactly look like the cock of the walk, but the sparrow is officially the King of the Fowl &ndash; at least according to this folktale from India. But he paid a price for the foul behavior he exhibited in acquiring his crown. We present this story with the aid of guest stars Mike and Patricia, birds of a feather who tell us all about the pet cockatoos they&rsquo;re so proud of and the peacocks that roam around the neighborhood.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in Los Angeles and vicinity, catching up with a whole flock of old friends, some of whom we haven&rsquo;t seen in years. Thanks to one particular family we know, we were able to become seagulls for a few days, living on their boat at the Long Beach marina. Nothing like having the waves rock you to sleep at night!</p>
<p>One bird that has been on the wing for quite some time now is the eagle, the character in our Zuni story we call &ldquo;Coyote and Eagle&rdquo;. We recently had a chance to perform it for a group of storytellers in Phoenix, who put together an evening of story swapping especially so we could participate while we were flying through. Needless to say, our own eagle made quite an impression when she squeezed through a tennis racket.   And for a bird&rsquo;s eye view, it&rsquo;s hard to top the Sandia Tramway in Albuquerque, the longest aerial tramway in the world. It took us WAAAAAY up to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJIb7v27Oq0">Sandia Peak</a>, which was covered with snow that was being heartily enjoyed by a few late-season skiers.</p>
<p>And now, we&rsquo;re back in our old aerie of California, where we&rsquo;ll be exercising our talons &ndash; er, talents, for the next few weeks. Hope to catch you at one of <a>our shows</a>!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Kipling.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The Elephant's Child&rdquo; is a tale from Africa, adapted from Rudyard Kipling's mangled English version in &ldquo;Just So Stories&rdquo;. It's one of various and sundry animal fables from various and sundry cultures explaining how various and sundry animals ended up with various and sundry unique physical features.</p>
<p>We come to you from Birmingham, AL., where we are touring to present performances at the Emmet O'Neal Library in the Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook.</p>
<p>While searching for a <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">geocache</a> in the suburb of Irondale, we stumbled upon the landmark Irondale Cafe, otherwise known as Fried Green Tomatoes. Actress/novelist Fannie Flagg used to eat here as a child &ndash; her aunt once owned the place &ndash; and it inspired her to write the best-selling novel &ldquo;Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe&rdquo;, which was made into the popular movie &ldquo;Fried Green Tomatoes&rdquo;.  Naturally, we had to return for lunch. The options are limited for vegetarians, and as is often the case with Southern cuisine, everything is smothered in grease. But all in all it wasn't bad; authentic Southern cornbread is a delicacy you just can't get anywhere else. And the signature dish? Dennis give the fried green tomatoes a thumb almost completely up, while <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asOKKHhnWRw">Kimberly's was more or less horizontal</a>.</p>

But all in all it wasn't bad; authentic Southern cornbread is a delicacy you just can't get anywhere else. And the signature dish? Dennis give the fried green tomatoes a thumb almost completely up, while Kimberly's was more or less horizontal.
Happy Listening!  Dennis (Narrator, Ostrich, Snake, Crocodile) and Kimberly (Narrator, Elephant, Hippo, Giraffe)

			<title>Frog and Antelope</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/antelope.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The Frog and the Antelope&rdquo; is a Native American story from the Kootenai (or Kootenay) tribe about a race between, appropriately enough, a frog and an antelope. It's one of many such race tales from many different races of human being, such as Aesop's &ldquo;The Tortoise and the Hare&rdquo;. In this case, however, the race is won by trickery rather than pluck and perseverance, so perhaps it doesn't illustrate very sportsmanlike conduct. On the other hand, the trickery is used to give a braggart his comeuppance.</p>
<p>We chose this tale because at the moment many different kinds of races and athletic contests are taking place in Vancouver, British Columbia for the 2010 Winter Olympics. And guess what? The Kootenai tribe, in addition to being located in Montana and Idaho, also has roots in British Columbia.</p>
<p>We'd love to be in Vancouver now &ndash; we loved the city and BC itself when we visited a few years ago &ndash; but it's been quite chilly enough where we have been for the past few weeks: the Sunshine State. And on this podcast we tell you about our recent exploration of The Everglades, including an overnight canoe trip to an island just offshore. We speak of it as one of 1000 purported islands in the system; actually the number should have been 10.000 (yes that's TEN thousand)!</p>
<p>We hope you have a gold medal month.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!  Dennis (Frog) and Kimberly (Narrator, Antelope)</p>

			<title>Hans in Luck</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Hans.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Hans in Luck&rdquo;, a German tale from the Brothers Grimm, is as loaded with irony as its title character is loaded with material possessions that people would normally consider a blessing, but in his case prove to be burdens. His situation reminds us of our own; having left the stationary lifestyle behind years ago, we ironically feel much richer for not having so much &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; to weigh us down.</p>
<p>We present the story with the assistance of guest performers who've also discovered this. They are attendees of the annual Families on the Road (FOTR) rally. (We recorded this podcast in a laundry room at a campground jammed with excited people, which explains the ambient sound &ndash; a euphemism for background noise.) It was a very successful event, indeed the largest such gathering ever, with 21 families in attendance.</p>
<p>For the second time, we held the rally at Jetty Park, Port Canaveral, FL. This is an excellent location not only because it's right on the beach (within site of the NASA shuttle launch site) but also because it's right beside the cruise ship terminal, so we could watch the huge cruise ships pull out, including the Disney line. Among the fun activities the campers enjoyed were a relay race on the beach, a tie-dyeing session, a gross science session, a screening of the movie &ldquo;RV&rdquo; on an outdoor inflatable screen, a bonfire, and a performance by Act!vated Storytellers.</p>
<p>Happy Listening!<br /><br />Dennis (Goatherd), Kimberly (Horse)<br /><br /> Kelby Evans(Hans), Dylan DiMichiel(Narrator), Connor Evans(Peasant with cow), Jayden Dudley (Narrator), Adrian Dudley (Narrator), Sage Bove(Cow), Christian DiMichiel (Scissors Grinder), Rita DiMichiel(Narrator), Pete "Dutch" DeMichiel (Master), Courtney LaPointe (Goose Woman, Narrator), Kati Evans (Goose), Zachary Godwin (Narrator, Grindng Stone, Well)</p>

			<title>The Rainbow Crow</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/rainbow_crow.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The Rainbow Crow&rdquo; is a Native American nature myth from the Lenni Lenape tribe of New Jersey. It's quite unusual for a nature myth in that it simultaneously explains the origins of four phenomena: fire, the rainbow, the crow's black feathers, and the crow's croaky voice. It bears striking similarities to the Zuni story that we call &ldquo;Coyote and Eagle&rdquo;, as well as to the Greek myth of Prometheus.</p>
<p>We thought it would be an appropriate offering for the winter solstice, since it also deals with the first time the animals had seen snow. That's rather hard to imagine, since they were living in the Northeast, but there's a first time for everything.   We come to you from a place where we probably won't have to worry about snow this holiday season: Florida. We'll be here through the end of January, and our tour will include a performance in Miami. If you decide to fly south for the winter, or you're already down here, swing on by!</p>
<p>Happy Listening! <br /> Dennis (Narrator, Owl, Great Spirit) and Kimberly (Crow, Coyote, Turtle and generic critter)</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Batcha.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>To mark the beginning of winter, we present &ldquo;Batcha&rdquo; a dragon story from the region formerly known as Czechoslovakia (it recently split into Slovakia and The Czech Republic). A shepherd strays away from home, discovers a serpents' lair, sleeps all winter like Rip Van Reptile, suffers the consequences of breaking a vow, takes a wild ride, and still gets home in time for dinner.  <br />We come to you from Delaware, en route to Florida for the winter. And we catch you up on what's happened during the two months since our last podcast, including Halloween in Salem, <a href="http://urban-interactive.com/overview">Urban Interactive</a> in Boston, and two days of adventures in New York City.   <br />In the Big Apple, we saw Bon Jovi perform during a &ldquo;Today Show&rdquo; telecast, attended a taping of &ldquo;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&rdquo;, and attended a fun Broadway performance of the classic musical <a href="http://www.finiansonbroadway.com/">Finian's Rainbow</a> a hilarious modern fable featuring a leprechaun and lots of singing and dancing.  <br />We also watched the Veterans' Day Parade (which included Hollywood legend Tony Curtis) and ran into the purveyors of <a href="http://www.myachi.com/">Myachi</a>, a toy for all ages. We first encountered them in Florida nearly <a href="http://activated-storytellers.com/travel/Typical/January2003.html">7 years ago</a>! <br /> <br />Happy Listening (and beware of dragons and leprechauns)  <br />Dennis (Batcha, Serpent King, Wizard) and Kimberly (Narrator, Wife, Dog</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Especially for the arrival of the autumn equinox, alias fall, we bring you “Moonlight Over Cassia Peak” a nature myth from China explaining the abundance of cassia trees around Lingyin Temple in the Wulin Mountains. The version we have borrowed presents the legend as a tale within a tale.</p>

<p>
We come to you from Fall River, MA, where we gear up for another haunting season in Salem. We've completed our 21st summer season, which took us from Monterey, CA to Medford, MA. Along the way, we performed for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Xh3r2hotU">American Library Association's</a> annual conference on behalf of Scholastic Books (held in Chicago this year) and biked the Katy Trail in Missouri. And Dennis began writing about some of our travel adventures for <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-17701-North-American-Destinations-Examiner">examiner.com</a>.</p>

<p>
Oh yes, and we have a guest star this time who's hardly a stranger to our podcasts or our shows: our son Zephyr, who now lives in Massachusetts and hadn't done a podcast with us since January.</p>

Happy Listening!

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Tailor.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&quot;The Brave Little Tailor&quot; is a tale popularized by Disney, who rather appropriately cast Mickey Mouse in the title role. Disney got it from the Brothers Grimm, who got it from several European folk traditions. It's an inspiring story about how a little guy can defeat a mighty giant (or even several of them) with cunning and courage, as well as a cautionary tale about the dangers of tooting your own horn. It will be one of the stories featured in our new production <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/multicultural.html#tt">&quot;Triumphant Tales; Stories of Creative Conquest&quot;</a>. This version is specially edited for the podcast, and features the guest voices of our nephew Joey (age 15) and our niece Jenny (age 12). We hope the end result leaves you in stitches.<br/><br/>We also talk about our recent drive and bicycling adventure down the Pacific Coast, traveling from Seattle through Oregon and past California's own giants, the monumental redwoods.<br/><br/>You'll hear us make a reference in the podcast to working on our set in the garage; but no, no, no that does not mean that we have a house somewhere. We're still on the road fulltime, just as we have been for the past 17 years. But we do know other people who have houses, including Kimberly's parents. And it's their garage where we typically have our marathon production week every May/June.<br/><br/>Now we're off and running on our <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/schedule.html">21st summer season</a>. Beginning June 11 in Monterey, CA, we literally tour from coast to coast this year, ending the season in Medford, MA. We hope to catch you somewhere along the way!<br/><br/>Happy Listening!<br/>Dennis (Narrator, Giant), Kimberly (Tailor), Joey (King) and Jenny (Giant)<p style="font-weight: bold;">Comments and folktale requests 206-426-0436.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[&quot;Trittil, Littil and the Birds&quot; is a story from Iceland about an adventurous young man who outwits a troll, and of course wins his good fortune.

			<title>When April Went to Visit March</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/when_april_went_to_visit_march.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>“When April Went to Visit March” is a story from the Ukraine about the seasons, or rather about one season, and how it can be unseasonable, especially in a chilly climate like the Ukraine. The months of spring are appropriately personified to reflect the weather that typically accompanies them: harsh March, airy April and mellow May. Except sometimes May may show the traits of March, so this tale offers a fanciful explanation.</p>
<p>We come to you from Sacramento, California, where we are doing a series of library performances for National Library Week. And we're doing stories especially appropriate for Earth Day, which the Sacramento County Library System is commemorating with a green theme.</p>
<p>And speaking of spring, we recount our recent visit to Saratoga, WY, which has a hot mineral spring that anyone can bathe in free at any time, year-round. But while we were there, we encountered some snowy weather, as we did during the entire month of March, which seemed to be anticipating the venting of a great deal of wrath toward May.</p>

<p>Happy Listening!</p>

			<title>The Boo Brothers</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Boo_Brothers.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[“The Boo Brothers” is a story of sibling rivalry, virtue triumphant, and unorthodox horticulture from Korea. It parallels many stories, including one from the Appalachian region of the U.S. sometimes known as “Gol Golly Gee”, involving one or more individuals who refuse to help someone in need and then meet their downfall, as contrasted with a more noble person who takes the time to be of help, and is rewarded with riches and having a folktale named after them.<br/><br/>We come to you from Colorado City (in Colorado, natch), after having driven from Florida in a very short time. <br/><br/>Along the way, we stopped in Mobile, AL to attend part of the Mardi Gras festivities. Many people don't realize it, but Mardi Gras has been celebrated in Mobile even longer than it has in New Orleans. The festival in Mobile dates back as far as 1703, and the tradition of a parade dates back to about 1830 when one particular merry fellow got one going spontaneously, and the other folks in the community decided it was too much fun not to repeat. This year's celebration actually got underway last year, with events held back in November. But the party began in earnest in January, a month before Mardi Gras itself. And during that month, there were no fewer than FORTY-TWO parades. We missed forty of them.<br/><br/>We also spent some time in Taos, NM, in the heart of ski country. The town of Taos is rich in history, being among other things the home of legendary scout Christopher “Kit” Carson—the house he lived in is now open for tours. But even more historic is the home of an entire tribe of Native Americans: the Taos Pueblo, which was built at least 600 hundred years ago, and quite possibly 1000 years ago. It's still home today to about 150 tribal residents who still live, as their ancestors did, without electricity or running water. <br/><br/>Like the Pueblo, the entire town of Taos is constructed of adobe buildings. It was a fascinating place to spend a weekend, but we're relieved to be out of the snow.<br/><br/>Happy Listening!<br/>Dennis (Narrator, HungBoo, Monsters) and Kimberly (Narrator, NolBoo, Wife, Bird, Monsters)<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments and folktale requests 206-426-0436.</span><br/></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Long before Marvel Comics created Spiderman, a spiderman was created by the Ashanti tribe of western Africa. The frequent trickster (and sometimes victim of other animals' tricks) has appeared in many aliases, and in many other parts of the world, including the Caribbean, Central America and the U.S. Sometimes he appears as a spider, sometimes a man, and sometimes both. In the Southern U.S., “he” sometimes turned into Aunt Nancy. In our story for this month, he retains his original name and gender, even though he has been transplanted to Jamaica, mon. And alas, it's another one of those cases (like “Anansi Goes Fishing”, which we're currently <a href="http://activated-storytellers.com/schedule.html">performing on tour</a>) where he ends up on the short end of the storytellers' stick.</p>
<p>We thought an Anansi story would be particularly appropriate for Black History Month, otherwise known as February. (In Great Britain, it's celebrated in October.) The month, which was originally just a week, traces its roots back to 1926, when prominent historian Dr. Carter Woodson began crusading to remedy the way his fellow African-Americans had been neglected in the history books. February is also the anniversary of the Fifteenth Amendment granting African-Americans the right to vote, and the swearing in of Hiram Revels as the first African-American member of the U.S. Senate. And February contains the birthday of the early civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois, who along with Dr. Woodson, helped found the NAACP in 1909—during, would you believe it, the month of February. And you thought this month was just for presidents, groundhogs and chocolate.</p>

We come to you from Western Florida, a state in which we've been sojourning for the past couple of months.

			<title>How Coyote Stole Fire</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Pod_87.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Coyote is a prominent recurring anthropomorphic character in the folklore of many Native American tribes, particularly in the Southwest. He is generally portrayed as a trickster, a semicomic hero who gets the better of some of the other critters. (He didn't get his comeuppance until the Twentieth Century, thanks to the Roadrunner.) Our current stage production, “Creepy Crawly Critter Tales”, features a yarn about how the Coyote and the Eagle attempt to rescue the sun from a band of kachinas (spirits) who have stolen it. But in our podcast story for this month, it is the Coyote—aided and abetted by a few animal sidekicks—who steal something: namely, fire. This tale, although it involves animals, has strong parallels in the myths of many other cultures about the heroic figures who first brought fire to humankind: Prometheus among the Greeks, Maui among the Polynesians and Loki among the Norse, for instance.</p>

<p>We come to you this month from Orlando, Florida, where we've assembled quite a cast of guest stars. We're joined by our son Zephyr, his girlfriend Cassia from Massachusetts, and their friends Amylynn from Chicago, Lani from Denver and Emily from Michigan. And as long as they were coming to Orlando long enough to do the podcast, we decided to dig up something fun for them to do. The best we could come up with was seven days at the Disney theme parks. Sorry, guys.</p><p>Happy Listening!</p>

			<title>The Elves and the Envious Neighbor</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/ElvesAndNeighbor.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The Elves and the Envious Neighbor&rdquo; is a story from Japan that we bring in especially for the holidays. Not that it's a holiday story, mind you. But it does feature elves, and indeed elves who give a gift... by taking something away!  It also features a Scrooge-like character driven by greed and envy. In some respects, it's similar to &ldquo;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&rdquo;.    We come to you from Tallahassee, Florida, where we don't exactly expect to have a white Christmas. But it still looks very like that season around here, because we're surrounded by Fraser Firs, Canaan Firs, Scotch Pines and White Pines, oh my. We're babysitting a Christmas tree lot at the Tallahassee Mall, where we have the  unheard-of opportunity to remain parked in one spot for more than a month&mdash;with free electricity thrown in to boot&mdash;as we start making preparations for next summer's tour.    Yes, we've been away from the podcast universe for a while&mdash;since August, to be exact. And we bring you up to date on what's been happening in the meantime, including our fun, fascinating, productive October in Salem, where we met up with the <a href="http://ourloudfamily.com">LOUD Family</a>, the subjects of the TV miniseries &ldquo;Six for the Road&rdquo;. And we answer that burning question on everyone's mind: where in the world is Zephyr?    By the way, did you know that you can <a href="http://www.noradsanta.org/en/home.html">track the progress of Santa's sleigh</a> online on Christmas Eve? We've been doing it for years. Amazing what they can do with radar these days.    To all of you from all two of us, we wish you the happiest of holiday seasons, and a fantastic 2009.    Happy Listening!   Dennis (Man, Neighbor and Elves) and Kimberly (Narrator, King and other elves)</p>

			<title>The Legend of the Rollright Stones</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Rollright.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Stonehenge, Easter Island and the Old Stone Mill. What do they all have in common besides being situated on islands? They're all mysterious stone structures that have generated all kinds of colorful legends. The first two date to ancient times, the third to Colonial or possibly even Viking times. In the old days, folks were fascinated by rock formations that were even remotely out of the ordinary, and their imaginations ran wild, weaving fantastic stories about how such formations used to be giants, animals or spirits. It is one such formation that inspired our story on this podcast, "The Legend of the Rollright Stones".</p>
<p>We present this tale without benefit of Zephyr, who's in Oregon attending Not Back to School Camp, an annual gathering for homeschoolers. We come to you from North Attleboro, south of Boston.</p>
<p>Our story selection was prompted by our recent visit to Newport, RI (our first time ever to go there, and it isn't often that we visit a place for the first time anymore), where we saw the nation's oldest synagogue, the nation's oldest lending library, and Fort Adams Park, site of the annual Newport Folk Festival, which has showcased such legendary talents as Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger (a co-founder of the event) and Joan Baez. Oh yes, and we also saw the Old Stone Mill, the third stone oddity mentioned above. Nobody knows who built it or when or why, but there has been speculation that Norsemen under Leif Erickson erected it when they allegedly dropped by a millennium ago &ndash; its style is similar to that of certain Scandinavian churches. Another popular theory is that it was built as a mill by Rhode Island colonial governor Benedict Arnold, great-grandfather of the more famous (and infamous) individual bearing that name. (Supporters of the Viking theory point out that even if Arnold did use it as a mill, that doesn't mean he built it, and it could have been much older.) Still another hypothesis is that it was a watchtower constructed or used by a Portuguese explorer around 1500. Hey, maybe all three are sort of true.</p>
<p>We breezed through Newport on our bicycles as part of a 10-day bike marathon, starting from Norton, MA, then proceeding to Plymouth, Cape Cod, southern MA, then Newport and back up to Norton. We covered more than 320 miles in all, spending the nights in a tent and buying food at produce stands. What a great way to see the country! As long as you don't run over any big rocks.</p>
<p>Happy Listening!</p>
<p>Dennis (Farmer, Villager), Kimberly (Narrator, Fairy, Villager) and Zephyr (Marcel Marceau impersonator)</p>
<p>P.S. Apologies for the audio quality of the past two podcasts. We've had major technical gremlins, which we've been struggling to put back into their cages. Hopefully, all will be peachy keen next time.</p>

			<title>The Jester and the Straw Roof</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the_jester_and_the_straw_roof]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>"The Jester and the Straw Roof" is a trickster tale from India about a poor man who gets his due by exercising his wits - in effect, by playing a joke on someone rich and powerful, which is appropriate, since this individual is a joker by trade. But we trade the traditional concept of a court jester for the persona of Batman's nemesis The Joker, as interpreted by the late Heath Ledger, and ably imitated by our resident mimic Zephyr. We also are aided and abetted this week by our friend Cassia, since we come to you from her hometown in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>We talk about the tour that Dennis and Zephyr took of Valley Forge National Park, just north of Philadelphia. During the winter of 1777-78, Gen. George Washington and his men took a very different kind of tour of this property, a military stand to fight back the British invasion. It was a harsh winter and the troops worked under extreme hardships, often having inadequate clothing and little food.</p>
<p>Even Washington had it rough, sharing cramped quarters, with several members of his staff - although he certainly was better off than the troops. At least he was in a fine old house with servants and a comfortable bed; they on the other hand, slept in crude little log huts - or on the ground while they were constructing these!</p>
<p>We were able to see some very accurate replicas of these huts, and they looked anything but inviting, in any kind of weather. We also toured Gen. Washington's painstakingly restored house on the Schuylkill River, furnished just as it might have been when he was using it, down to the pens and papers on the desk.</p>
<p>We also mention the alternating days of bike touring that Kimberly and Dennis have been doing from Valley Forge to Bristol, CT, getting in as many as 65 miles a day - often on very hilly terrain. At least the soldiers never had do that!</p>
<p>Happy Listening,</p>
<p>Dennis (Maharajah), Kimberly (narrator), Zephyr (Jester/Joker) and Cassia (the wife)</p>

			<title>Stone Soup</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/stone_soup]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>"Stone Soup" is not only a popular folk tale with variants in many cultures and countries, it's also become a proverbial expression of sorts -- not to mention the name of a popular magazine for children. In some versions of the tale, the cornucopian object might be a nail, a button, or even an axe. And in some versions there is only one miserly individual involved, as opposed to a whole village. But there is something particularly resonant about the image of getting nourishment from a stone, and even more so about being able to feed an entire community, even if it involves a little deception.</p>
<p>One reason for the story's endurance is that it can be interpreted in a number of ways. There's the concept, for instance, of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. There's the importance of pitching in to help your neighbors -- it takes a village to feed a village. There's the principle of making something from nothing, or at least being productive in difficult times. And of course there's the motif of applying psychology to encourage cooperation -- prompting people to contribute by appealing to their pride in creating a desirable outcome, rather than just telling them their efforts are needed (somewhat similar to Tom Sawyer's trick with the fence.)<!--
<p--> We come to you from the outskirts of Philadelphia, where we've returned to perform again at the Free Library of Philadelphia. Zephyr rejoins us after spending a couple of weeks in Winston-Salem, while Dennis and Kimberly report on their recent visit to Pennsylvania's capital city, Harrisburg, where they took a pleasant bike ride on a 20-mile loop that took them one of the finest nature preserves they've ever seen.</p>
<p>Happy Listening! <br />Dennis (Soldier, villagers), Kimberly (Narrator, Villagers), Zephyr (Villagers, including the Joker)</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA["Stone Soup" is not only a popular folk tale with variants in many cultures and countries, it's also become a proverbial expression of sorts -- not to mention the name of a popular magazine for children. In some versions of the tale, the cornucopian object might be a nail, a button, or even an axe. And in some versions there is only one miserly individual involved, as opposed to a whole village. But there is something particularly resonant about the image of getting nourishment from a stone, and even more so about being able to feed an entire community, even if it involves a little deception.
One reason for the story's endurance is that it can be interpreted in a number of ways. There's the concept, for instance, of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. There's the importance of pitching in to help your neighbors -- it takes a village to feed a village. There's the principle of making something from nothing, or at least being productive in difficult times. And of course there's the motif of applying psychology to encourage cooperation -- prompting people to contribute by appealing to their pride in creating a desirable outcome, rather than just telling them their efforts are needed (somewhat similar to Tom Sawyer's trick with the fence.) We come to you from the outskirts of Philadelphia, where we've returned to perform again at the Free Library of Philadelphia. Zephyr rejoins us after spending a couple of weeks in Winston-Salem, while Dennis and Kimberly report on their recent visit to Pennsylvania's capital city, Harrisburg, where they took a pleasant bike ride on a 20-mile loop that took them one of the finest nature preserves they've ever seen.
Happy Listening! Dennis (Soldier, villagers), Kimberly (Narrator, Villagers), Zephyr (Villagers, including the Joker)

			<title>The Peacock and the Crane</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>"The Peacock and the Crane" is one of Aesop's fables, and (surprise) it has a little lesson to teach: namely that it's wiser to make good use of the skill you have than to boast or make a display of yourself. The peacock has long been a symbol of vanity and ostentatiousness, and it may have been Aesop who started that tradition. NBC seemed to have had something else in mind, however, when it adopted a peacock for its network logo during the early days of color programming.</p>
<p>We come to you, minus Zephyr, from West Virginia, where we are having a busy week during our summer library tour, helping youngsters "Catch the Reading Bug" (that's the theme of the summer reading program for many of the nation's libraries this year). Our first West Virginia performance was in Point Pleasant, so named because it is a pleasant point at which the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers come together.</p>
<p>Up until 42 years ago, the town was best known as the site of the first battle between Native Americans and European settlers, which occurred here in 1774. As usual, the Natives (led by Chief Cornstalk) got the worst end of it. There's an impressive mural of the battle painted on the wall that runs along the riverfront by the national park that commemorates the event.</p>
<p>Okay, that was the town's old claim to fame. But in November 1966 it was the site of the reputed appearance of a strange creature that came to be known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothman">Mothman</a>. He stood about 8 feet tall and looked like a cross between a human and a moth. He may have been of extraterrestrial origin, or he may have just been the Reading Bug. Or he may have been someone's hyperactive imagination. We can't know for certain, because he did not strut around like a peacock, but hid in the dark like a moth. But whatever he was, he is now folklore, and that's where we come in. There is a life-size statue of him in downtown Point Pleasant, so you can form your own theories. And be thankful that it wasn't you who ran into him.</p>

As in the British story "The Cat and the Mouse", which is based on the cumulative list motif, similar to the nursery rhyme "The House That Jack Built".

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Rough_Skinned_Girl.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>"The Rough-Skinned Girl" is a Native American story told among some of the tribes in the Great Lakes region of the U.S. and Canada, particularly the Miq-Mak and Algonquin tribes. The title (Oochegeaska in Miq-Mak) also can be translated as "Burnt-Skinned Girl". This is one of innumerable versions of the Cinderella motif found around the world; but in this case the similarity is more than coincidence. Natives apparently heard the popular French tale, as related by French trappers, and adapted it to their own culture.</p>
<p>We present the story with the aid of our guest star Mary, who's been a friend all her life (literally -- she attended Zephyr's first birthday party when we lived in San Francisco). She spent 10 days traveling with us under battle conditions, joining us in Reno as we were frantically trying to get our new show together, accompanying us on our 2000 mile dash to Arkansas, then aiding and abetting us during our show's first two performances in Hot Springs and Conway, AR. What a trooper.</p>
<p>But once the pressure was off, we managed to have some fun, absorbing the local color along historic Bath House Row in Hot Springs, where we also attended an open mic poetry reading at The Poets Loft, the longest running open mic poetry night in the world. Mary wasn't content merely to observe, but also got up and read one of her own poems, followed by her a cappella rendering of "Goodnight Irene" in Japanese.</p>
<p>We also spent an evening at The Brauhaus listening to the music of our friends The Itinerant Locals. And in Little Rock we took Mary to the Clinton Library and Central High School, site of the landmark 1957 school integration conflict.  Now she's off to The Bay Area again, and we're off again on another summer tour. See you there!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>"The Donkey and the cucumbers", a simple little folktale from India, is somewhat similar to Aesop's fable about the fox and the crow, a warning that sometimes crowing too loudly will cause you to have to eat crow later.

We know, there's already been a book by that title. But this one, by the same author (John Javna, assisted by his teenage son and daughter), is not just a revised edition of that bestseller, but a whole new volume that addresses the realities of the Twenty-First Century more effectively. We're recommending it not just because John's a friend of ours, but because it's an informative and important book.<br /><br />Happy Listening!<br />Dennis (Washerman and Watchman), Kimberly (Narrator), Zephyr (Fox) and Cassia (Donkey)</p>

But this one, by the same author (John Javna, assisted by his teenage son and daughter), is not just a revised edition of that bestseller, but a whole new volume that addresses the realities of the Twenty-First Century more effectively. We're recommending it not just because John's a friend of ours, but because it's an informative and important book.Happy Listening!Dennis (Washerman and Watchman), Kimberly (Narrator), Zephyr (Fox) and Cassia (Donkey)

			<title>The Princess and the Pea</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Princess_Pea.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>So how did you sleep last night? Did a lump in your bed cause you to toss and turn? If this is ever a problem, you should be grateful that you're not as delicate as the princess in "The Princess and the Pea", the story we present this week. This tale was written by the celebrated Danish author Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), although he probably based it on a genuine folklore motif. First published in 1835, the story was immediately popular and has been translated, adapted, retold and mangled many times over the years. In 1959 the musical adaptation "Once Upon a Mattress" opened on Broadway and became a smash hit, further popularizing the tale. And more recently, a fractured version called "The Princess and the Bowling Ball" appeared in "The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales".<br />As usual, however, we do not fracture this story, though we may bruise it a bit. We always stay faithful to the original plot, while injecting and infecting it with our own colorful style and humor that will appeal to contemporary audiences. We enact this story with our special guest Sarah, one of our "adopted daughters" who's spending a week on the road with us. She's both a fellow homeschooler and a fellow RVer. And no, our story choice was not inspired by her own sleeping habits. She is not a princess, and in fact could probably sleep on a bowling ball.<br />With Sarah in tow, we're having a busy April performing in Northern California; we've been particularly in demand for National Library Week. We've been revisiting our roots in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we originated nearly 20 years ago. And where, once upon a time, Kimberly was in a production of "Once Upon A Mattress".<br /><br />Happy Listening!<br />Dennis (Prince), Kimberly (Princess, Royal Attendant), Zephyr (King, Other Princesses) and Sarah (Queen, Other Princesses)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Aesop, according to tradition, was a Greek slave who flourished around 550 BC and told many fables, i.e. tales with a moral at the end. Many of these tales had animal characters, and many were actually much older than Aesop. In other words, if Aesop actually lived, or even if he didn't, he borrowed other stories in addition to possibly making up some of his own; additionally, it appears he wrote new stories long after his death, as many stories attributed to him were picked up from later generations and other cultures. We herewith present one of the stories he may have written during, before or after his lifetime, a simple fable about self-reliance that we, as you might notice, have embellished just a bit.</p>
<p>We thought this story appropriate for the moment, because it deals with vehicle problems of a sort, and we've just experienced vehicle problems of many sorts driving from Albuquerque to Las Vegas. We include a special guest, Zephyr's friend Koree, who is visiting us for a few days from Arizona. We include an account of our stay in the Glitz Capital of the world, where Zephyr attended a haunted attraction convention, and the prices are high enough to spook anyone.</p>

			<title>Why the Bat is an Outcast</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/BAT.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The poor bat has an evil image that it doesn't deserve. Because it's active at night, and hides in dark places like caves, and has a rather sinister appearance, it has inspired fear for ages. And Dracula wasn't exactly a helpful public relations person, either. But in fact bats are quite harmless, unless they have rabies -- which would put any critter in a bad mood.<br/>In Nigeria, folks long ago tried to explain the bat's reputation with a little story to account for its status among living things. In our version it's called, appropriately, &quot;Why the Bat is an Outcast&quot;. It points out that bats don't appear to fit in with either birds or &quot;animals&quot; (i.e., mammals), though it has characteristics of both -- and by being reclusive, appears to be shunned by both. Scientists, of course, tell us that bats are indeed mammals, a sort of flying rat. But they're harder to keep as pets.<br/><br/>We encountered only one bat recently when we walked through the caves at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, and it was dead -- and encased inside a stalagmite! This was inside the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/cave/planyourvisit/lower_cave.htm">Lower Cave</a>, an optional tour that had us Indiana Jones-ing down a slope while hanging on a rope, descending three ladders, and then walking around with headlamps on our helmets. That's the real way to see a cave! Well, actually the real way to see a cave is in its natural lighting -- total darkness, which we also saw for about 5 minutes.<br/><br/>On our way to Carlsbad, we spent a day in Abilene, TX, where we stumbled upon the <a href="http://www.nccil.org/">National Center for Children's Illustrated Literature</a> (NCCIL) and talked to executive director Sarah Mulkey. She told us all about the Center's mission of exposing the public, and particularly children, to the original artwork of prominent children's book illustrators. The current exhibition features Gerald McDermott, who illustrated some of the stories that we've performed in the past -- and will be performing again.<br/><br/>Happy Listening,<br/>Dennis (Bruce the Bat), Kimberly (Birds &amp; Beasts) and Zephyr (Narrator)&nbsp; <br/>]]></description>

			<title>The Dreaming Tree</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Dreaming_Tree.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dreams play an important role in many tribal cultures, providing a revered source of advice, enlightenment and law. Our rendition &quot;The Dreaming Tree&quot;, a considerably &quot;trunk-ated&quot; version of a folk mini-saga from Brazil, illustrates how seriously indigenous peoples take this nocturnal activity. It also makes use of the tree as a symbol of wisdom, a motif common to many folk traditions. And there's a reminder that even a good thing can be carried to dangerous excess.</p>


<p>This story about a potent tree seemed especially appropriate because we recently got a very good bird's eye view of some very nice trees, not to mention beautiful Snake Creek (which we just mentioned) at <a title="Historic Banning Mills" href="http://historicbanningmills.com/">Historic Banning Mills</a>, near Whitesburg, GA. It's called Historic Banning Mills because historically there were mills here (textile, paper, wood and others), and the ruins still stand. But now there's a rustic lodge up on the hill overlooking the creek, a serene location for a romantic getaway, a conference, or a wedding. At certain times of the year, the place is also abuzz with all manner of outdoor activities, including hiking, horseback riding, golf, skeet shooting (what did those poor skeets ever do to us?) and kayaking. And there's a very intriguing-looking ropes course on the grounds -- or rather in the trees. (If you don't know, a ropes course is a series of physical obstacles that involve climbing, designed to challenge your courage and tenacity and resourcefulness. If you don't know the ropes when you start, you'll learn before it's over.)</p>

<h2>Zipping Through the Treetops</h2>

<p>But the piece de resistance is what they call the <a title="Zip Line" href="http://historicbanningmills.com/canopy.html">Canopy Tour</a>, a guided walk through the treetops on bridges too narrow even for ballerinas (though Kimberly did a pretty decent <a title="More zip line photos" href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/travel/Typical/Feb08.php#zip">impression of one</a>) and even, in some cases, a single cable. But oh yes, we almost forgot. There are also four ziplines, which are cables stretched from trees and/or towers on which the truly daring and/or truly insane soar at speeds up to 60 m.p.h. at altitudes of up to 220 feet. And you don't even need a pilot's license. It was the most exhilaratingly terrifying experience we've had in ages, and we can't wait to do it again -- this time with Zephyr, who was off in Massachusetts at the time.</p>


<p>The Inns at Historic Banning Mills, and the Canopy Tour, are family owned and operated, by some right friendly folks. We highly recommend this place. (Note: When you visit their <a title="Historic Banning Mills" href="http://historicbanningmills.com/">website</a>, we recommend the multimedia tour, which uses an exquisite arrangement of a haunting Civil War-flavored waltz to provide a perfect mood for the slide show.)</p>

			<title>Don't Ever Look at a Mermaid</title>

            <description><![CDATA[&quot;Don't Ever Look at a Mermaid&quot; is a story from England and vicinity, about a mermaid's infatuation with a mortal man; and like last week's story, it entails humans, or in this case, humanoids, assuming animal form. The mermaid motif, which is particularly common in Europe but also crops up in other cultures around the world (including Native American), may have inspired Hans Christian Andersen to write &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; -- which in turn inspired Disney, as so many stories have, to put the same title on a very different story. In this version, the mermaid seems to represent temptation, which, like the mermaid herself, never completely goes away but reappears every so often.<br/><br/>We bring you this story from icy, storm-ravaged Arkansas, where we're visiting friends and relatives (not necessarily in that order). But we're recapping some of our adventures in sunny Florida, specifically the two <br/>occasions when we donned snorkels. The first was at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/bisc/">Biscayne National Park</a> near Key Biscayne, the only national park that is almost completely underwater. We saw some coral, a few fish, a couple of lobsters (uncooked, of course) and the largest seahorse we've ever witnessed.<br/><br/>The second time, we were at Crystal River, where we bathed with a few manatees who, like the humans who marvel at them, vacation in The Sunshine State at this time of year. Having learned our lesson from Key Biscayne, we rented wetsuits along with our kayak. The water was crystal-river clear, and we were able to get within a few feet of <br/>these incredible beasts, who generally stayed quite still on the bottom but occasionally swam right by us. We can understand how sailors might have mistaken them for boulders, but mermaids??<br/><br/>As you may have noticed, this is a bonus podcast, wedged into our biweekly schedule because there's been just so much material to cover lately!<br/><br/>Happy listening,<br/>Dennis (Hans), Kimberly (Mermaid, Wife, Dog) and Zephyr (Narrator)]]></description>

			<title>Saving Spring / FOTR edition</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Saving_Spring.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Saving Spring - a folktale</h2><p>&quot;Saving Spring&quot;, a Scandinavian folktale, is one of numerous stories from around the world dealing with the cycle of the seasons -- such as, for example, the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone. &quot;Naturally&quot;, since this particular tale comes from Scandinavia -- a region that consists of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (sometimes Finland and Iceland are lumped with them as well) -- should revolve around a harsh winter, which is something they get a lot of in those parts.</p>
<p>But we're not getting it in the parts where we currently are. This podcast was recorded at Port Canaveral, Florida, where the cruise ships leave from and come back to -- including the Disney line and the Carnival Line. We could watch these enormous vessels depart in the afternoon, floating by so close that we could just about touch them with a fishing pole.</p>
<h3>Families On The Road</h3><p>We were there for the third sort-of-annual sort-of-rally of <a href="http://www.familiesontheroad.com">Families on the Road</a> (FOTR), an online community of families who live on the road full-time. And the folks who came to this one truly fit the bill. And there were oodles of them, too -- at least 15 families, making this by far the best-attended event yet of this kind. And we of course made use of as many extra voices as we could round up to be guest stars on this podcast. When you got talent like this, you gotta use 'em!</p>
<p>We crammed about 25 people into one RV to record this episode. Below are some of the families we interviewed (in no particular order):</p>
 <ul><li>The Davis Family (Stephanie and Kayla)</li><li>The Evans Family (Kati, Auvi and Conner)</li><li> The Elliot Family (Sue and Savannah) </li><li> The Whitcomb Family (Tim, Sue, Tyler and Natalie)</li><li> The Miller Family (Lara and Joey)</li><li> The Smythe Family (Deb and Jonathon)</li></ul>
<h3>CAST in order of appearance</h3><p>Announcer ..... Abby Bennett<br/>Narrators ...... Zoe Evans, Dennis Goza, Kimberly Goza, Cindy Whitcomb<br/>Mayor .......... Tim Whitcomb<br/>Oscar ..... Zephyr Goza<br/>Greta ..... Auvi Evans<br/>Wolf ..... Conner Evans<br/>Animals and Crowd .... an RV full of FOTR<br/>Guard #1 and #4 ..... Tyler Whitcomb<br/>Guard #2 ..... Gayle Bennett<br/>Guard #3..... Cindy Whitcomb<br/>Winter ..... Chris Elliot<br/>Spring .... Sue Elliot</p>
<p>Happy Listening!<br/>Dennis, Kimberly &amp; Zephyr </p>

            <description><![CDATA[&quot;The Fisherman and His Wife&quot; is an old story that comes from the British Isles, among many other places, and in many other forms. (Notice how it's always something like &quot;The Fisherman and his Wife&quot; instead of &quot;The Wife and Her Fisherman&quot;? There's no doubt that sexism abounds in folklore.)

Bet you've encountered one of those at some time.<br/><br/>We get some very capable help this time around from Zephyr's friend Cassia, making another appearance as guest performer. She's visiting us from Massachusetts, spending five days with us at Fort Wilderness, the Disney campground adjacent to Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL. She and Zephyr are spending a day exploring each of the four theme parks, and they give us a report on the two they've hit so far-- namely, Animal Kingdom and Epcot. (Next on the agenda are Magic Kingdom and Disney Hollywood Studios, formerly known as Disney MGM.) <br/><br/>And this podcast was recorded on National Appreciate a Dragon Day, so if there's a friendly dragon in your neighborhood, give it a hug for us.<br/>Happy Listening!<br/><br/>Dennis (Narrator), Kimberly (Fish/Dragon), Zephyr (Husband) and Cassia (Wife) <br/>&nbsp;<br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Podcast Recommendation: </span><a href="http://www.ninakimberly.com/" style="font-style: italic;">Nina Kimberly The Merciless</a><br/>]]></description>

			<title>The Tragic Fate of Jack Sparrow</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Jack-Sparrow.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[It's Jack Sparrow getting into trouble big time. No, we don't mean
Johnny Depp (although Zephyr gives a big nod to him in his
performance of the character); the folks at Disney have a habit of
borrowing from older sources, and it's quite likely that the name Jack
Sparrow came from this African-American tale related by noted author
Joel Chandler Harris. A simple fable about the dangers of gossiping and
meddling in other peoples' affairs, this story is included among
Harris' writings about the fictional character Uncle Remus, a sort of
African-American version of Aesop. An accomplished folklorist who heard
these charming animal yarns from slaves when he was a teenager working
on a plantation, Harris has come under fire in more recent times for
the racist overtones in his heavy usage of southern black dialect and
also for the very name Uncle Remus -- &quot;uncle&quot; was a demeaning term
sometimes applied to slaves by their owners. But hey, he lived in
racist times; and in view of that, his tone was perhaps far less
insulting than it might have been.
<br/><br/>Harris was born in 1848 in Eatonton, GA., which we just happened to
pass through on a Sunday morning in December, so we couldn't pass up
the Uncle Remus Museum, with its statue of Brother Rabbit (&quot;Br'er&quot;
Rabbit) in the yard. The museum, which features mementos from the life,
times and work of Harris, is housed in a building comprised of two
former slave cabins joined together. (You can see the seams on the
sides.) It's on the property once occupied by the family of Joseph
Sidney Turner, the &quot;Little Boy&quot; in the &quot;Tales of Uncle Remus&quot;.
<br/><br/>We also dropped in at the <a href="http:///">Laurel and Hardy Museum</a>
in the hometown of Norvell &quot;Oliver&quot; Hardy, Harlem, GA. This town is so
proud of its celebrated native son that the water tower sports a
picture of him and his skinny partner, Stanley Jefferson -- who gave
himself the shorter name of Stan Laurel so it would fit on signs
better. This pair of comedy titans made over 100 films together of
varying lengths over a period of about 30 years, and were also the best
of friends. And they had a major influence on virtually every comic
performer to come afterward -- including, no doubt, us.<br/><br/>
Happy listening,
<br/>Dennis (Narrator and Fox), Kimberly (Rabbit) and Zephyr (Jack Sparrow, natch)]]></description>

these charming animal yarns from slaves when he was a teenager working
on a plantation, Harris has come under fire in more recent times for
the racist overtones in his heavy usage of southern black dialect and
also for the very name Uncle Remus -- &quot;uncle&quot; was a demeaning term
sometimes applied to slaves by their owners. But hey, he lived in
racist times; and in view of that, his tone was perhaps far less
insulting than it might have been.
Harris was born in 1848 in Eatonton, GA., which we just happened to
pass through on a Sunday morning in December, so we couldn't pass up
the Uncle Remus Museum, with its statue of Brother Rabbit (&quot;Br'er&quot;
Rabbit) in the yard. The museum, which features mementos from the life,
times and work of Harris, is housed in a building comprised of two
former slave cabins joined together. (You can see the seams on the
sides.) It's on the property once occupied by the family of Joseph
Sidney Turner, the &quot;Little Boy&quot; in the &quot;Tales of Uncle Remus&quot;.
We also dropped in at the Laurel and Hardy Museum
in the hometown of Norvell &quot;Oliver&quot; Hardy, Harlem, GA. This town is so
proud of its celebrated native son that the water tower sports a
picture of him and his skinny partner, Stanley Jefferson -- who gave
himself the shorter name of Stan Laurel so it would fit on signs
better. This pair of comedy titans made over 100 films together of
varying lengths over a period of about 30 years, and were also the best
of friends. And they had a major influence on virtually every comic
performer to come afterward -- including, no doubt, us.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Libby.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've just concluded our month of being a family of four rather than three; for the month of October and even for a piece of November, we &quot;adopted&quot; Zephyr's friend Libby from the San Francisco Bay Area. This week, rather than bring you a story as usual, we catch you up on what we've been up to during the busy three weeks (Yes, three. Yikes!) since our last podcast. And Libby gives her impressions of what it's like to be a fulltime traveler. Well no, she doesn't really do impressions of us, but she does tell of her experiences with us.</p><p>

It was a fairly busy time for our business, so we went to a number of schools; but one of the more memorable schools was a red one-room schoolhouse that only tourists enter these days. Its most famous visitor ever was not a person but an animal -- specifically a lamb. And the lamb's owner was a little girl named Mary. No, we're not kidding -- that little poem, one of the most famous in the world, was inspired by a true incident, and not even names were changed to protect the silly. This schoolhouse, built in 1792, was once attended by young Mary Sawyer, who secretly brought her pet lamb to school and hid it under her desk. Just how you'd keep that a secret is beyond us, but it definitely depends a great deal on the silence of the lamb. And this one didn't cooperate for long -- when Mary went to the head of the class to recite something, the lamb stopped being sheepish and made so much noise that Mary was no longer able to pull the wool over the teacher's eyes. The rest of the class was delighted, including John Roulstone, who was visiting from another community. Later, he scribbled down the first few lines of the soon-to-be-famous verses and handed them to Mary. In 1877, the little snatch of doggerel (sheeperel?) would provide the first words ever recorded on a phonograph -- recited by none other than Thomas Edison himself.</p><p>

The schoolhouse, which is open for tours during the summer (we just missed the season, but we were able to to peer into the window at its period furnishings) originally stood in the nearby town of Sterling. No, it didn't crawl or slide to Sudbury; it was moved in 1923 by none other than Henry Ford to its present location, a very fitting neighborhood for popular lines of poetry. Such as &quot;I shot an arrow into the air./ It fell to earth I know not where.&quot; Or &quot;Beneath a spreading chestnut tree/ The village smithy stands.&quot; Or &quot;into each life some rain must fall&quot;. Or &quot;ships that pass in the night&quot;. Or &quot;I heard the bells on Christmas Day&quot;. Or &quot;This is the forest primeval.&quot; Or &quot;Listen my children, and you shall hear/ Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.&quot; All of these are from poems written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882), who had a strong 
association with another building just a few yards from Mary's lamb's schoolhouse.</p><p>

It's the Wayside Inn, which Longfellow immortalized in his collection of narrative poems entitled &quot;Tales of a Wayside Inn&quot; (1863), including the celebrated verse version of Paul Revere's less than stellar ride, which Longfellow Hollywoodized into an epic achievement. The inn has been in operation since 1716, making it reputedly the oldest operating inn in the country. Many of the rooms have been preserved as they might have appeared nearly 3 centuries ago. Well mostly, restored is probably a better word than preserved, since the property was heavily damaged by a fire in 1955, revealing for the first time in ages a stairway that had been sealed off, and is now open to public viewing.</p><p>

From Sudbury, we headed to Salem for Halloween, hoping to land jobs at a haunted attraction as we did two years ago, and we scored. Zephyr was in hog heaven doing a Capt. Jack Sparrow impersonation. As always, we camped at Winter Island, the former Coast Guard Station that has been converted into a public park and campground.</p><p>

And before Libby abandoned us to head home to California, we took a train excursion to the Big Apple to catch a Broadway show. And then our &quot;daughter&quot; left the nest, and we're back to &quot;normal&quot;, if that word ever applies.</p><p>


Happy Listening,</br>
Dennis, Kimberly, Zephyr &amp; Libby</p>

			<title>The Grateful Sparrow</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the_grateful_sparrow]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we present the Japanese fable &quot;The Grateful Sparrow&quot; (otherwise known as &quot;The Tongue-Cut Sparrow&quot; in a harsher version), a cautionary tale about greed and gratitude. </p>
<p>We come to you from Pennsylvania, with our special guest star Libby, Zephyr's friend from the San Francisco Bay Area. A glutton for punishment, she's spending the entire month of October touring with us, to get a taste of the glamorous life.

</p>
<h2>Amish Farm and House</h2><p>We report on our visit to the <a href="http://www.amishfarmandhouse.com/">Amish Farm</a> and homestead in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a preserved two-story dwelling open for public tours. In the heart of a busy shopping and tourist district, the Amish attraction sits right smack next to a Target store. But step inside, and you quickly forget that you're in the Twenty-First Century. A knowledgeable guide explains the facts of the Amish lifestyle and answers your questions -- and there were some interesting questions from our inquisitive tour group. The 15-acre farm, which was opened for public tours in 1955, features a stone farmhouse built in 1803 and a one-room schoolhouse opened for tours last year.</p>
<h3>Field of Screams</h3><p>

But the reason we were in Lancaster to begin with was so Zephyr and Libby could &quot;work&quot; (i.e. volunteer) at <a href="http://www.fieldofscreams.com/">Field of Screams</a>, which many consider the premiere haunted attraction in the country. (If you build it, they will scream.) Every October, this place comes alive with the sounds of ghouls and goblins and patrons getting their wits scared out of them. The complex features two haunted houses, a haunted hayride, and a special &quot;Little Screamers&quot; section for the younger ones. And it is, we can attest, an extremely popular place. </p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Niagara.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Traditionally, Native Americans have enjoyed telling myths about how various natural phenomena originated. And &quot;naturally&quot;, the members of the Seneca Tribe (part of the Iroquois Confederation) were greatly impressed by Niagara Falls, as millions of visitors have been in more recent times. <br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Niagara Falls</span><br/>This week, we bring you our wacky version of the tale we call &quot;Niagara&quot;, which is perhaps the best-known account of how this majestic landmark came to be. It's certainly more poetic than the scientific version of a huge glacier trucking through 10,000 years ago, and it also features an important theme about the hazards of greed and the importance of revering nature.

Niagara apparently comes from a Seneca word, but nobody's certain which word or exactly what the name means -- our favorite version is &quot;thundering water&quot;. Originally located about 7 miles north, near Lewiston, NY and Queensland, Ontario, Niagara Falls moved southward to its present location over the years due to erosion. (Yes, you read that right: these waterfalls are nomadic, just like us!) There are three waterfalls in all, although the smallest one, Bridal Veil, is the Cinderalla of the group, tucked behind an island where most people don't even see it. There's Horseshoe Falls, which is 173 feet high and 2600 feet wide, and American Falls, which is 70 feet tall and about 1100 feet wide. (American Falls was taller until 1954, when a massive rockslide deposited some enormous boulders at its base. Hmmm... it was sort of like the Native American story.) Fed by the 35-mile long Niagara River -- one of the few rivers on this continent to flow north -- Niagara Falls drops 100,000 cubic feet of water per second over the cliffs in peak season.

We reminisce about our past visits to this splendid sight, including our first time during a very harsh winter, when the falls were surrounded by ice and snow. <br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maid of the Mist</span><br/>And we talk about our excursion this time on a <a href="http://www.maidofthemist.com/">Maid of the Mist</a> boat, one of the vessels that have been taking tourists out to the bottom of Horseshoe Falls since 1846. In 1960, one of these boats rescued a 7-year-old boy who was swept over the falls, the first person ever to survive such a fall without protective gear.

Other foolhardy folk have made the plunge over the years in barrels, and some have survived -- one 63-year-old woman did so in 1901. One man survived the feat, spent 6 months in the hospital recovering, and later died from injuries sustained when he slipped on an orange peel in the street.

On this podcast, we also discuss Zephyr's latest jaunt to North Carolina to perform with his band; and how in his absence mom and dad took a bicycle ride to Canada.<br/>Happy Listening!

			<title>Johnny Appleseed</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/johnny_appleseed]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[He roamed the country barefoot sleeping under the stars, in clothes he made from sacks, with a cooking pan on his head. Everywhere he went, he planted apple seeds, gave things away, took care of animals, and made friends. He was John Chapman (1774-1845), better known as Johnny Appleseed, a legend in his own time, and still a legend today. 

Despite living a life of philanthropy, simplicity and voluntary poverty, Chapman left behind an estate of apple nurseries worth millions -- and he would have been even richer if he hadn't been so careless in his bookkeeping. We recount some of the tales told about him, most of which were in fact true.

<br/>Another man who became a living legend was author Mark Twain, whose footsteps we have traced around the country over the years. Recently we were back in one of his old haunts, Hartford, Connecticut, where he had a colorful and fabulously elaborate mansion built in which he and his family lived for some 17 years while he wrote his masterpieces. You can tour the bedrooms, the dining rooms, the drawing room and the billiard room, which have been restored in painstakingly authentic detail.

			<title>The Legend of Scargo Lake</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the_legend_of_scargo_lake]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Lake Scargo in Dennis, MA (on Cape Cod) is the home of a colorful Native American legend about how the Lake came to be -- one of many such Native tales about the origins of natural phenomena and landmarks. Princess Scargo, daughter of chief Sagem of the Bobuset tribe, is presented with four little fish by a suitor, and the rest is the stuff of legend. Today, you can find descendants of these silvery fish (no, not silverfish) in Scargo Lake. And you can get a good look&nbsp;at the Lake, and the surrounding territoryterritorty, by climbing Scargo Tower in East Dennis. Not a terribly high structure, but it's located atop the highest point on the Cape, so the view is pretty impressive.</p>


<p>But we got a look at an even more impressive tower, which affords an even more impressive view: Pilgrim Monument, the 252-ft. monolith in Provincetown, right on the tip of the Cape. The tower commemorates the arrival of the Pilgrims in November 1620, when they hammered out the groundbreaking Mayflower Compact. The cornerstone was laid in 1907 by Pres. Theodore Roosevelt for this controversially designed&nbsp;structure modeled after the Torre del Mangia in Siena, Italy, and construction was completed in 1910.</p>


<p>We biked to Provincetown from Nickerson State Park, a distance of about 35 miles, and stayed at a campground just outside town in our teeny tiny tents. Then we used our bikes to explore this colorful little seaside resort with lots of historic buildings, the largest percentage of Portuguese population in the country, and also the largest percentage gay population. Although the year-round census is only 3500, it explodes to 50,000 during the summer. </p>


<p>There are three resident theatres in this town that was once the home of playwrights Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neil, as well as novelist Norman Mailer.</p>


<p>Happy Listening!</p>

			<title>The Little Red Hen</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the_little_red_hen]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>“The Little Red Hen? is an English fable based upon repetition, like many of the other stories we’ve done. In this case, the barnyard animals learn the importance of industriousness – that only those who share the labors also share the rewards. </p>
<p>We chose this story in part because Zephyr came back to us with streaks of red in his hair – from Not Back to School Camp in Oregon. He attended a weeklong session there at the end of last summer as well, and had a great time and met some great new friends that he’s been in touch with since then. <a href="http://www.nbtsc.org">Not Back to School Camp</a> is an opportunity for homeschooled teenagers from across the country to get together and exchange experiences, talents, creative projects and annoying habits. There’s even a prom just like a regular school (Not. Well, there is really a prom, but we can't vouch for the rest.)</p>
<p>While he was away, mom and dad caught a ferry from Cape Cod to Martha’s Vineyard, an island about 20 miles offshore that’s long been a favorite vacation resort for politicians (including, of course, the Kennedys) and other celebrities. In the seventies, MV residents started a petition to have the island become our 51st state – but as of now, it’s still officially part of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>We spent two days biking around the island, and stayed at a campground with our tiny tent. (There was nothing tiny about the camping rates, nor anything else on the island.) In the town of Oak Bluffs, we saw the Flying Horses, the oldest continuously operating carousel in the U.S., having been built in 1876. And we thought WE’D been going around in circles for a long time!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Like the familiar tales of “Rumpelstiltskin? and “Lohengrin?, the Nigerian animal yarn called “The Hippopotamus and the Tortoise? deals with a character (the hippo) whose name is a secret, and another character (the Tortoise) who successfully guesses it.&nbsp; The consequences of the successful guess vary from story to story, but in this case, it results in the hippo and his descendants finding a new habitat to inhabit.</p>
<p>We recorded this story with guest stars Joey (age 13) and Jenny (age 11), who are our nephew and niece respectively; and Ellie (age undetermined) who’s our “adopted daughter?.</p>
<p>We were in Sacramento for our second cross-country flight in less than a month, this time for the <a href="http://hscconference.com/kids.html">Homeschool Association of California Conference</a>.</p>
<p>And what a great conference it was! We presented a well-attended performance in addition to workshops on writing, sign language, physical comedy, mask making and reflections on our 15-year odyssey across America. Our programs were met with enthusiastic response, and we also had a good time attending other presentations. There were a fire twirling demonstration, a rocketry demonstration (you know how cool kids think it is to see things blow up), a skygazing session with large telescopes set up in the courtyard, a swing dance class, a dance for the teens, and a jam session for aspiring musicians, among other activities. We very much hope to return next year!</p>
<p>Our apologies to Libby, Hannah, Melia, and Molly, who did some great work on the FIRST version of this podcast, which we recorded with them before they all left the conference. And then, due to technical difficulties…</p>

            <description><![CDATA[&quot;Orpheus&quot; is a Greek myth about a musician who was so good (or so &quot;awesome&quot; in contemporary musicians' lingo) that he truly inspired awe in all living creatures. Unfortunately, his talent didn't help build his patience any, and it proved to be his undoing when he had an opportunity to rescue his wife Eurydice from tragic death.<br/><br/>We chose this tale mainly because of Cerberus, the three-headed dog. What does this have to do with anything? Well, the three headed dog appears in one of the Harry Potter books -- only he's given the name Fluffy. And this isn't the only bit of folklore and mythology that J.K. Rowling borrows. There's the phoenix, the fabulous bird that is reborn out of its own ashes; the hippogriff, which is similar to the griffin, which she also uses. And in the story of Orpheus, as in Harry Potter and many other stories, the serpent is used as a symbol of evil.<br/><br/>So what does this have to do with anything? As if you didn't know, this past week marked the release of the seventh and final book in the series. And we, of course, were in line at midnight to buy our copy like millions of other folks.<br/><br/>Were you surprised when you found out in an earlier book that Remus Lupin was a werewolf? Well, you wouldn't have been if you'd been as familiar with Latin as Rowling is. The name provides two very strong clues: &quot;Lupin&quot; is from the Latin word lupus meaning wolf (if something is wolf-like, it is said to be lupine) and Remus was the brother of Romulus, after whom Rome was named. According to legend, the two boys were raised by ... wolves! (This also inspired the story of Tarzan.) In this episode, we discuss these Latin clues, as well as some of the other mythology in Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Our special guest this week is Zephyr's friend Cassia from Massachusetts; she spent a couple of days living with us and got a first-hand look at the glamorous life of a touring actor.<br/><br/>Happy Listening!<br/><br/>Dennis (Orpheus), Kimberly (narrator and Cerberus head), Zephyr (Charon, Hades and Cerberus head) and Cassia (Eurydice and Cerberus head)&nbsp; <br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[&quot;The Elves and the Shoes&quot; from Holland is one of the simple but charming little accounts of the interaction between humans and elves, who were always playing pranks (the elves, that is -- although the humans may have done so as well).

The factory is still here, of course, pumping out the enticing aroma of coacoa all around. So is Hershey Park, which he also developed, although it has grown into an amusement park with some of the most thrilling rides around. (We're especially fond of the coaster called Great Bear.) And there's a visitors' center called <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/chocolateworld/">Chocolate World</a>, which offers a Disneyesque ride through a simulation of the factory, except with singing dairy cows. <br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Hershey used their vast fortune to improve the lives of the less fortunate, and they were especially dedicated to assisting disadvantage children. To that end, they established <a href="http://www.mhs-pa.org/">Hershey School</a>, which occupies 10,000 acres and currently has a student body of 1100.

This doubtlessly is derived from an older African fable in which it is a talking stool that scoffs at the notion of a yakkity yam.<br/>We present the story with -- well, we don't really present the story at all.

And he places the action long ago in a galaxy far, far away, giving him a chance to do some of his best character voices.<br/>We come to you from Maryland, after the three of us have been reunited in Washington, DC.

And Kimberly and Dennis finish the account of their leg-thrashing bicycle tour from Pittsburgh to DC, including a stopover in Harpers Ferry, WV, where John Brown staged his famous raid in 1859, an event that may have sparked the Civil War.

            <description><![CDATA[
<p>John Henry is one of several larger-than-life American
heroes associated with specific occupations, like Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan, Old
Stormalong and Febold Feboldson. But the incident depicted in the many versions
of the John Henry ballad actually may have occurred in some fashion. There's
just no way to know when, where, how and wherefore. But it's nice to believe
there's some to truth to this parable about people being stronger than the
machines they create. One reason it's so difficult to trace the mists of myth
is that John Henry is a common name, and it appears to have been especially
common among African-Americans working on the railroads. According to one
version of the tale our hero was a former slave, and in another version, he was
a prisoner rented out as a laborer. The town of <st1:city>Leeds</st1:city>,
<st1:state>Alabama</st1:state> claims to be the site of the famous
episode, but so does <st1:place><st1:city>Tackett</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>West Virginia</st1:state></st1:place>, which even has
erected a statue of the most famous hammer-wielder since Thor. There's also
more than one Big Bend Tunnel; but there's only one C&amp;O Railroad.<o:p></o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">There's also one <st1:place><st1:placename>C&amp;O</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Canal</st1:placetype></st1:place>. Or at least there
was. Well, the canal's still there, but it's no longer canaling. Begun on <st1:date>July 4, 18</st1:date>24, the
canal was planned to extend all the way from D.C. to <st1:state>Ohio</st1:state>
(thus the name <st1:city>Chesapeake</st1:city> and <st1:placename>Ohio</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Canal</st1:placetype>)
but was halted at <st1:place><st1:city>Cumberland</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>MD.</st1:state></st1:place> During the period of
operation, this shallow waterway ferried coal, grain and other freight on boats
pulled by mules. Crews working on these boats sometimes brought their families
along on these slow journeys, making them the 19th century equivalent of RV
families.<o:p></o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Today, the canal, is a national park, and it's paralleled by
a <a href="http://www.bikewashington.org/canal/index.php">bicycle path</a> 184 miles long that we've been wanting to trek on out Treks for
a long time. With a week off during our busy summer schedule (because of,
appropriately, the Fourth of July) and with Zephyr off in North Carolina again,
Dennis and Kimberly decided this was the time to do it, even though it means we
have to alternate days, and thus each only do half the route, son one person
can drive the RV along too.<o:p></o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">But wait! We didn't have to settle for just one trail. We
discovered another one in <st1:city>Pittsburgh</st1:city> (<a href="http://www.atatrail.org/">YRT</a>) that
connects with the C&amp;O in <st1:city><st1:place>Cumberland</st1:place></st1:city>.
And our last show before the break was in <st1:city><st1:place>Pittsburgh</st1:place></st1:city>.
So instead of divvying up a mere 184 miles, we're doing 330. There now we feel
more akin to John Henry.</p>

			<title>The Three Wishes</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the_three_wishes]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&quot;The Three Wishes&quot;, a European tale that comes to us by way of The Brothers Grimm, is one of many stories dealing with the well-known motif of wishes coming true -- including &quot;Aladdin&quot;, for instance. In this example, a rash and foolish waste of opportunities leads to regretful results in the end. (It reminds us of people who win the lottery but end up broke.) But in the process, we learn about a comical usage for a string of sausages.<br/><br/>We discuss two places that demonstrate how wishes can come true, especially for smaller children: the Children's Museum of Indianapolis and COSI, the science museum in Columbus, Ohio. We drove through both of these cities this past week on our way to Pennsylvania, and we've spent a good many hours in both museums, particularly when Zephyr was younger.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://www.childrensmuseum.org/">Children's Museum of Indianapolis</a> is a four-floor affair, and has been called the largest children's museum in the world. Every Halloween, the museum mounts an imaginative haunted house, built around a different theme every year. This is where Zephyr got bitten by the haunted house bug (or was it a vampire?) at age 9.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.cosi.org/">COSI</a>, on the site of the old Columbus High School (the front facade of which is still preserved) is one of the biggest and best science museums in the country. But we liked it even better back when it featured &quot;Adventure into the Unknown&quot;, the archeology-inspired (think Indiana Jones) interactive exhibit that sent kids and kids at heart scampering to uncover clues, solve riddles, and find the ultimate treasure -- which turned out to be some very useful advice on the art of problem-solving. It was all done in a very detailed, moodily lighted, inspiring atmosphere. Oh, why are we telling you all this when you can't go attend it anymore? Well, maybe you could pressure the museum to bring it back.<br/><br/>And this, by the way, is our 50th podcast! Phew!<br/><br/>Happy Listening,<br/>Dennis (axe swinger), Kimberly (sausage woman) and Zephyr (Narrator, elf) Goza<br/><br/>P.S. We recommend another podcast favorite of ours &quot;<a href="http://listen2me.libsyn.com/">123 Listen to Me</a>&quot; produced by family from South Africa.]]></description>

			<title>Half-A-Chick</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/HalfaChick.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[He thought he was the cock of the walk, but this overly vain fowl cries foul when he truly turns vane--i.e. becomes a weathervane. It's &quot;Half-A-Chick&quot;, the curious Portuguese fable about the consequences of arrogance. One of the curious things about this story is that the main character is an oddball. Okay, nothing unusual about that; plenty of stories have leading characters who are misfits. (Cinderella, The Ugly Duckling, Harry Potter, etc. etc.) But you'll notice that such characters almost always turn out to be noble and virtuous despite the way other people ridicule and mistreat them. In this case, just the opposite happens -- Half-A-Chick has a double-sized ego, and meets his downfall because of it.<br/><br/>This week, we come to you from the heart of the bustling resort town of Hot Springs, Arkansas. (Technically, it's called <a href="http://www.nps.gov/hosp/">Hot Springs National Park</a> -- the entire city of 35,000 residents plus hordes of tourists is a national park!) We recorded next to the Visitors' Center, beside one of the many fountains where you can fill up jugs with 143 degree mineral water that's been brewing for 4000 years before spouting from the 47 springs around here. We were right there on &quot;Bathhouse Row&quot; which at one time sported several trendy bath houses and health spas that were frequented by such notable visitors as Al Capone. Today, these structures are preserved as historic buildings, but only one remains in operation as a bath house-- although other bath houses can be found at some of the hotels in town. We mourn the Libbey Memorial Physical Club, the truly unique establishment we luxuriated in on out last trip here. Nothing else like it in Hot Springs or anywhere. (Read about our previous visit to the <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/travel/Summer2002_hot_springs.html">Bath House</a>)<br/><br/>At our performance at the Garland County Library, we met another boy named Zephyr! Moreover, his parents are performers too. That night, we watched their hilarious oom-pah rendition of various American pop songs and originals at the Brauhaus German restaurant. Zach and Cheryl, who moved here from Seattle, call themselves The <a href="http://www.polkayoureyeout.com/">Itinerant Locals</a>, and they have quite a memorable sound!<br/><br/>After Hot Springs, we wrapped up our tour of Arkansas with an experience that can be duplicated nownere else in the world: we went digging for diamonds in the <a href="http://www.craterofdiamondsstatepark.com/">diamond fields</a> near Murfreesboro. We didn't find any of the precious gems (an average of about 2 per day are found there - infact a big one was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=3251749&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312">found by a 13 year old</a> not too long ago) but we had a great time playing in the mud!<br/><br/>Happy Listening,<br/>Dennis (the Spark), Kimberly (the Water) and Zephyr (Half-A-Chick) Goza<br/>]]></description>

			<title>The Greedy Brothers</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/GreedyBrothers.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Row, row, row, your boat... well actually we were paddling canoes and kayaks, but we did go gently downstream for the most part--except for Zephyr, who had a kayak crackup. We were canoeing on the beautiful Buffalo River in northern Arkansas, with vessels and gear provided by <a href="http://www.dillards-outfitters.com">Dillard's Ozark Outfitters</a>, a family operation near the town of Yellville, where we opened our summer season.<br/><br/>The Dillard Family is quite a presence in this region, and the Dillard name crops up everywhere. And it's been that way at least since the 1920's, when two Dillard Brothers opened up the now-defunct Dillard's Ferry, the site of which was the endpoint of our excursion. It was a 10.5 mile jaunt, which took us about 5 hours, a gallon of water and several ounces of sunscreen. And we figured 5 hours was just barely enough to get into the &quot;zen&quot; of the experience. How we envied the scout troop we encountered who were spending an entire week on the river!<br/><br/>Our story this week is &quot;The Greedy Brothers&quot; from India, a fable about family relations and the wisdom of fathers - just in time for Father's Day!<br/><br/>Happy Listening,<br/>Dennis (Father), Kimberly (brother) and Zephyr (Napoleon Dynamite brother) Goza <br/>]]></description>

			<title>The Three Brothers</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/ThreeBrothers.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In the spirit of family businesses, which we have been celebrating lately (and one of which we've been operating for years) we present some family monkey business: &quot;The Three Brothers&quot;, a nonsense tale from Italy. If you look really hard for the point of this story, then you're really missing the point of this story. Celebrity voices have been impersonated, though not necessarily imitated.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Dutton Family</span><br/>One family business we encountered this week was the <a href="http://http://www.theduttons.com/">Dutton Family</a> operation in Branson, MO. When you think Branson, you probably think country music, and if so you'd be partially correct, but certainly not entirely. There are plenty of hillbilly song and comedy revues in town, but there are also many other types of entertainment as well. This little city of about 6000 people also features a Ripley's museum (What tourist town doesn't?) and an extensive exhibit of Titanic artifacts housed in their own building-- a reduced scale, half-segment ship-shaped (and presumably ship-shape) building colliding with an ersatz iceberg. There's a troupe of Chinese acrobats appearing in town, and at the Dutton show we attended, there was a preview of a Samoan fire-dancing performance.<br/>Even the musical acts themselves are richly varied. There's a rock'n'roll revue, a Beatles tribute, and one of the countless knock-offs of &quot;Riverdance&quot;. Many famous singers have opened their own theatres here, including Bobby Vinton (Oh, how Kimberly's late grandma adored Bobby, a fellow Pole) and Andy Williams -- yep, he's still kicking, and his Moon River Theatre, it appears, is still full and flowing.<br/>Which brings us back to the Duttons. We went to their show expecting essentially bluegrass or something along those lines, but we were very pleasantly surprised. There was some country music, of course (it's hard to leave it out in Branson) but the songs they performed were classics like &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;, rather than the over-commercialized ear candy that often passes for country these days. We were also delighted by their rendition of the tongue-twisting Hank Snow staple &quot;I've Been Everywhere&quot;, which very well could be our theme song. But the program also included classical music (which actually is what they cut their teeth on), pop, ethnic, a touching tribute to veterans, and even Broadway, including a suite from &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; with rather elaborate set and costumes. Toss in some jaw-dropping razzle-dazzle musicianship (it seems to be in their genes to be able to play just about any instrument behind their backs) and some side-splitting humor, and you have a show guaranteed to please even Oscar the Grouch.<br/>And the theatre isn't the only thing the Duttons (all three generations of them) have going for themselves; their inn is right behind the theatre, and their cafe is right next door. Oh yes, and if you appreciate homemade fudge, you've found paradise.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Happy Listening, <br/>Dennis (Larry), Kimberly (Curly) and Zephyr (Moe)<br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

			<title>The Drummer Boy</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/The_Drummer_Boy.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&quot;The Drummer Boy&quot; is our story this week, and no, it's not a Christmas Story. It's a possibly true tale from The Civil War about a young man who receives a valuable lesson in tolerance and forgiveness. And by the way, the drummer on our soundtrack gets an assist from Daniel Wilcox, the drummer in the rock band to which Zephyr belongs.<br/><br/>We recount not only our experiences with many significant Civil War sites over the years, but also our recent visit to <a href="http://lhf.org/">Living History Farms</a> in Urbandale, Iowa. This complex sprawling over many acres features both indoor and outdoor exhibits and demonstrations, including an Ioway Indian Farm from around 1700; an 1850 settlers' homestead; a farmhouse from 1900; a farming museum; and an entire recreated village from around 1875. The latter includes an elaborately detailed bank, newspaper office, milliner's shop, and other businesses. And since we were visiting the facility on Memorial Day, we also witnessed a procession down the center of town to the cemetery, where a ceremony was held honoring veterans in general and particularly those of the Civil War. And this was followed by a baseball game, played with rules and uniforms from a bygone era when there were no gloves, no multimillion dollar contracts, no unsportsmanlike behavior, and no bloated egos.<br/><br/>Strolling about Living History Farms (well, you're transported part of the time by a dusty tractor-drawn trolley), you get to ask questions of guides in period costume, and see how our ancestors lived up close. You can see their tools, their livestock, their buildings, and when we were there we had plenty of opportunities to witness how lunch was cooked on an open fire by various pioneers from several different eras. Zephyr even had a chance to help out on the farm, dumping a bucket of corn into a one-horse-power grinder. Somehow, we don't think he was persuaded to make a career of it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Zephyr, he figures prominently in another tale we spin this week. And this one, unfortunately, is quite true. Or perhaps fortunately, since it ended well--namely with everyone getting a good laugh.<br/><br/>Happy Listening<br/>Dennis (Narrator, General Lyon), Kimberly (Mother, soldier) and Zephyr (Drummer Boy, rest stop attendant)<br/><br/>P.S. We found another podcast by another family you might enjoy &quot;<a href="http://dancingwithelephants.libsyn.com/">Dancing with Elephants</a>&quot; <br/>]]></description>

			<title>The Snow Maiden</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Snow_Maiden.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&quot;The Snow Maiden&quot; is a tale from Russia that symbolizes the determination to find hope and cheer in the long harsh winters. In some versions, there is an additional motif about the importance of trust and the dire consequences of not trusting - somewhat similar to the German legend of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, among others. It was such a version of this story that we included in one of our productions 16 years ago, when we were just touring the San Francisco Bay Area. Zephyr, of course, was a baby at the time, and we hired other performers to round out the cast. For this production, our additonal performer was 8-year-old Megan Cohen, the first homeschooled child we ever met.<br/><br/>Well, for this podcast, we are fortunate enough to have another very talented youngster fill the role: Devon Wood, a 10-year-old Iowan whom we met last year when we did a residency at her school. She and her mother and aunt drove many miles to see us perform this week at a school in Altoona, Iowa. We wanted so much to use Devon's talents on our podcast that we recorded it ahead of schedule, before we'd even outlined a script. No problem: she can improvise with the best of us, and everything you hear her say just came off the top of her head.&nbsp; <br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bicycling Capital</span><br/>We also discuss our recent visit to Sparta, Wisconsin, which bills itself the Bicycling Capital of America. In addition to being the home of the world's largest bicycle, the town is the site of the intriguing <a href="http://www.bikesparta.com/trailsandattractions.htm">Deke Slayton Memorial Space and Bike Museum</a>. Space and bicycles in the same facility?? Hey, why not. Weren't Wilbur and Orville bicycle mechanics?<br/><br/>Deke Slayton, one of the Mercury 7 astronauts, grew up in Sparta and attended Sparta High School. Alongside memorabilia of his distingusihed career, you can view some really incredible speicmens of bicycle design from the entire history of the critter, including some about which very little is known. See an ice skating bike with a blade insted of a front wheel, a lawnmower bike with mower blades up front (the Huffy), a velocipede, a Draisine, and other contraptions too numerous to mention. (And this is only half the museum's collection--the others are in storage!) <br/><br/>Oh yes, and there's a delightfully dreadful bike safety film from 1963 called &quot;One Got Fat&quot;, which has kids riding bikes wearing hokey monkey masks and tails, and meeting their demise one by one when they ignore various safety rules. (The tenth rider in the group, the only human, follows the rules and survives, and is therefore able to gorge on the lunches of everyone else--thus the title.) It's amazing to think this film - narrated by the superannuated Edward Everett Horton, who among other things narrated the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons - was actually shown to school students, some of whom it may have traumatized for life. But as a kitschy relic, it alone is worth a visit to the museum.<br/><br/>And we mustn't forget the gift shop, in which you can purchase bicycle-shaped pasta. How could we possibly pass that up!<br/><br/>Happy Listening!<br/>Dennis (the narrator), Kimberly (Marfa) and Zephyr (Vasili) Goza<br/>with Devon Wood as the Snow Maiden<p>P.S.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Golden_Goose.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>&quot;The Golden Goose&quot;</b> is a story from the Grimm Brothers about the charms of innocence, and how the gift of laughter is sometimes the most valuable and rewarding asset of all. We present it with the aid of guest performers the Krucks Family from the second annual rally of <a href="http://www.familiesontheroad.com">Families on the Road</a> (FOTR), held this year in the resort town of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.</p>

<h3>Wisconsin Dells</h3><p>Wisconsin Dells is officially the water park capital of the world, and we took advantage of one of the indoor water parks, as those outdoors are not yet open for the season. We also played a couple of rounds at some of the town's numerous miniature golf courses.</p>

<p>We visited the <a href="http://www.tommybartlett.com/TBE.html">Tommy Bartlett Exploratory</a>, a hands-on science museum that features one of three editions of Mir, the Russian space station that stayed in orbit above the earth for 10 years. The one housed here is one of two still in existence, and you can actually go aboard it! Nearby is the arena for the Tommy Bartlett Show, a spectacular 90-minute stunt production that features boats and water skiing.</p>

<p>No visit to Wisconsin Dells would be complete wihtout a tour of <a href="http://www.wizardquest.net/">Wizard Quest</a>, a unique indoor theme park/ scavenger hunt that challenges your wits and powers of observation. You have 90 minutes to free 4 virtual wizards (The wind wizard is called Zephyr--how cool is that) by solving riddles--the answers are cleverly concealed in the exhibits. Fun for all ages as you discover secret passages and compartments, slide down chutes and wrack your brains.</p>

			<title>The Proof in the Painting</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://activated.libsyn.com/the_proof_in_the_painting]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&quot;The Proof in the Painting&quot; is a tale that originated somewhere in Europe--we haven't been able to trace its exact origin, so if you have any information on that point, please let us know. The title is our own creation, and it is of course a play on the old saying, &quot;The proof of the pudding is in the eating&quot;, because the story illustrates how the best way of judging success may not be the most obvious.<p>We're coming to you from Fox Lake, Illinois, where Kimberly rejoins us after returning from two weeks in Reno. Dennis and Zephyr, meanwhile, have returned to the Chicago area from the Detroit area, where Dennis took a little trip to Windsor, Ontario, and Zephyr
spent three packed days (and nights) at HauntCon 2007.</p><h3>Haunted Attraction Convention </h3><p><a href="http://www.hauntcon.com/">HauntCon</a> is the annual convention and tradeshow for the haunted attraction industry, of which Zephyr is an enthusiastic
accomplice. He's worked at a number of noted (or notorious) haunted houses, even dragging mom and dad into the act a couple of years ago in Salem, MA; he also designs his own haunts, of course. </p><p>This event featured an exhibition of the latest props and
gizmos, movie screenings, seminars and a costume ball that featured vampires, ghouls and demons milling about in the hotel lobby among the (hopefully) amused business travelers. Zephyr also participated in a tour of the world's largest (and possibly other
kinds of -est) haunted house, the four-story Erebus in Pontiac. </p><p>Happy

			<title>The Baker and the Judge</title>

            <description><![CDATA[&quot;The Baker and the Judge&quot; is a story that has been told many times, perhaps most notably by the great French writer Francois Rabelais in his epic masterpiece of satire &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;. But it may have originated in Israel, and in one version of the tale, the judge in question is the legendary King Solomon, who also is reported to have offered an unusual solution to the problem of two mothers quarreling over the same child.<br/><br/>We bring it to you from Chicago, where we've been holed up for the entire month of April--well, except for Kimberly, who's spent the past week visiting her parents and grandmother in Nevada. This is the first podcast that Dennis and Zephyr have done on their own.<br/><br/>Why did we choose this particular story? Well, if we must have a reason, let's say we did it because Rabelais gave us the word &quot;gargantuan&quot;, and that describes the Sears Tower in Chicago, which we visited this past week. It's the tallest building in North America, and for 25 years it was the tallest in the entire world. The 110-story titan stands 1450 feet tall, with the antennae on top adding another 275 feet for a total of 1725. The structure is actually a cluster of nine towers of various heights, with only two going the distance (The base is laid out like a tic-tac-toe board!) One of the designers allegedly illustrated the concept to a colleague by pulling cigarettes out of a pack at different lengths. And you thought those things were utterly worthless!<br/><br/>We also saw another famous tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Well, not exactly. We saw its twin, the Leaning Tower of Niles. Well, okay, so it's only a half-size twin. It still is a close enough copy to save us airfare to Italy. Standing 94 feet tall with a tilt of 7 feet off center (as opposed to the original's 177-ft. height and 15 and a half ft. tilt), the Leaning Tower of Niles was completed in 1934, only 700 years after its famous lookalike.<br/><br/>And we visited another building in Chicago, the Old Post Office. Normally, there's not much interesting about it, but this week it was the location for the shooting of a scene from the new Batman movie. We didn't arrive in time to to see any filming, but we were able to get a glimpse of the set, which represented Gotham National Bank.<br/><br/>Happy Listening!<br/><br/>Dennis (Narrator and Sniffer), Zephyr (Baker and Judge) and Kimberly (mime)<br/>&nbsp;]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[&quot;Acqua alle funi!&quot;. It's Italian for &quot;water to the ropes&quot;, and it's taken from a story about taking a courageous stand and speaking up when everyone else is afraid. It's a tale rather similar to The Emperor's New Clothes, but this one is true.<br/><br/>It happened in the Sixteenth Century in Rome, when Pope Sixtus the Fifth decided to have an enormous obelisk moved to a new location in St. Peter's Square, under the direction of architect Domenico Fontana. A worker named Bresca di Bordighera exhibited a great deal of courage and perhaps saved many lives. His descendants are still honored today.<br/><br/>We learned of this story while visiting Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., just outside Chicago. Founded in 1967, Fermilab (named after Nobel Prize winning Italian physicist Enrico Fermi) is a huge research complex dedicated to studying the composition of matter with the aid of &quot;particle accelerators&quot;, which smash subatomic particles so scientists can get a look at their innards.<br/><br/>Fermilab occupies 10 square miles formerly occupied by farms, and by the defunct village of Weston. Some of the barns and other buildings have been preserved to use for storage and social events.<br/><br/>Also in Chicagoland, we visited Ahlgrim Acres, a funeral home in Palatine. Wait a minute? Why on earth would we go to a funeral home? Why, to play miniature golf, of course. No joking; for the past 42 years, the basement of this establishment has featured a 9-hole miniature golf course, as well as shuffleboard, ping pong, pinball and other amusements. All open to the public, free of charge! And it's a very challenging and fun golf course, designed in a haunted house motif, complete with spooky sound effects.<br/><br/>Happy Listening!<br/>Dennis (Domenico Fontana), Zephyr (Bresca) and Pope Kimberly the First and Last.&nbsp; <br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's story is &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, an immensely popular folk tale that first appeared in print in France bout 250 years ago. Like most popular folk tales, the story has many versions in many different cultures. It has inspired a number of novels, plays, films, a TV series and a Nintendo game (Donkey Kong). The most successful film adaptations were the 1946 French movie directed by Jean Cocteau, and the 1991 Disney musical edition. &quot;King Kong&quot; was also based on this legend.</p><p>The Disney animated feature, of course, has been transformed into a successful stage musical, and we recently attended an outstanding production of it at the Little Theatre of Winston-Salem, featuring some of Zephyr's friends in the cast.</p><h3>D.E.A.R.</h3><p>Drop Everything and Read! On April 12th stop what you are doing and read for 5 minutes to celebrate <a href="http://www.dropeverythingandread.com/">Drop Everything and Read</a> day.</p><p>Zephyr, by the way, has finally left North Carolina and caught up with us in Chicago, just in time to complete Act!vated Storypark, a new fun activity feature which will be on our website (soon!) based on some of our folk tales, and created with Roller Coaster Tycoon.</p>Happy Listening,<p>Dennis (father), Kimberly (Beauty) and Zephyr (the Beast)</p>]]></description>

			<title>The Ghost and the Rock</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/gettyghost.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;The Ghost and the Rock&quot; is our retelling of storyteller <a href="http://www.positivetales.org/">Jim Flanagan's</a> retelling of a ghost story about <a href="http://www.nps.gov/gett/" rel="tag">Gettysburg</a>. We met Jim at a PTO Convention in Valley Forge, and he allowed us to use this tale, called &quot;The Shadow in the Back Yard&quot;, from his book &quot;The School of Scary Stories&quot;. This little yarn, which takes place in the present,but involves a classic ghost story motif, makes an important point about respecting and preserving history.</p>


<h3>Bicycling through History </h3><p>And history was very much a part of our experience this week in Pennsylvania, as we (Dennis and Kimberly) took in about 80 miles of territory on our bikes while Zephyr was practicing and performing with his band in North Carolina.</p>


<p>First, there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Forge" rel="tag">Valley Forge</a> itself: we toured on bikes through the park where General George Washington's troops spent a miserable winter in 1777-78 defending the area from British invasion. Although Washington himself, and his wife Martha, were considerably more comfortable in the house that served as the army's headquarters, and which today is open to the public.</p>


<p>Then we pedaled from the town of Plymouth into downtown Philadelphia and had our lunch by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Hall" rel="tag">Independence Hall</a>, where delegates spent a sweltering summer in 1776 hammering out the beginnings of the new nation. The Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution were all signed in this picturesque building that recently guest-starred in the movie &quot;National Treasure&quot;. We also dropped in to visit the fabled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Bell" rel="tag">Liberty Bell</a>, just across the street.</p>


<p>On to Lancaster, where we joined our first ever group bicycle tour for a quaint ride through the countryside, past many Amish farms.</p>


<p>And then there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Battlefield" rel="tag">Gettysburg</a>, the site of another important military operation in another landmark war, nearly a century after Valley Forge. And whereas the soldiers at Valley Forge had to deal with insufficient clothing in a bitterly cold winter, the soldiers at Gettysburg wore stifling wool uniforms in the middle of July. It was the bloodiest battle of the Civil War, killing about 50,000 troops. No wonder there are so many ghost stories in the area. And with those wool uniforms, no wonder the ghosts are so restless!</p>


<p>Happy Listening,</p>

            <description><![CDATA[&quot;What Other People Think&quot;, a story from the Grimm Brothers, warns about the dangers of paying too much attention to naysayers. It's a yarn that can be found in many variants in many cultures, usully with hilarious results.<p>We perform this tale with the aid of some special guest stars: Wylie, Nash and Trina, all teenage friends of Zephyr's in North Carolina, as we spend a couple of weeks in and around Winston-Salem and Greensboro.</p><h2>Winston-Salem</h2><p>Winston-Salem is the combination of the cities of Winston and Salem, which joined forces in 1913. Salem was settled in 1766 by members of the Moravian sect, who are still active in the community. This part of the double municipality includes Old Salem, a living history center that features many historic buildings that have been preserved/ restored/ whatever they do to them.</p><p>And (shhh!) it may be a well-kept secret, but if you're an avid cyclist and you do some poking around, you'll find an excellent scenic bike trail around Salem Lake, as we did.</p><p>Happy Listening. </p><p>Dennis (the Dad), Kimbery (the Donkey) and Zephyr (the Son) Goza</p>]]></description>

			<title>Clever Tom and the Leperchaun</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Leprechaun.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree&quot;... It's been the title of a hit song, and a popular saying associated with several folk-type stories about returning convicts, soldiers and others. It probably inspired the current custom of posting stickers of yellow ribbons to show support for troops. But chances are it all started with an Irish tale about a leprechaun. And it may originally have been a red garter rather than a yellow ribbon. (Come to think of it, did you know that leprechauns themselves originally were dressed in red rather than green?) This week we present &quot;Clever Tom and the Leprechaun&quot;, a classic yarn about a fellow who thinks he's about to snag the treasure of one of the Wee Folk, but is not quite as clever as he thinks.</p>


<p>We come to you from Montgomery, Alabama, a city rich in history. Currently the state capital, it was also the site of the first Confederate White House. It was the home of country music legend Hank Williams, and legendary novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. (While stationed here in the army in 1919, Fitzgerald met his future wife Zelda--an encounter that inspired his short story &quot;The last of the Belles&quot;).</p>


<p>But it was the city's role in the civil rights movement that really secured its place in modern history. In 1955, a 42-year-old seamstress named Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man, as African-Americans were expected to do at that time (a refusal motivated in part because she'd had a previous incident with the same driver), and after being arrested, agreed to become a guinea pig for a court case testing the city's segregation of the buses. The arrest sparked a year-long boycott of municipal buses, and a civil rights drive headed by a 26-year-old Baptist minister named Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>


<p>Happy Listening, <br/>Dennis (&quot;Tom&quot;), Kimberly (Narrorator) and Zephyr (the &quot;Leperchaun&quot; - catch him if you can!)</p>

			<title>Tappin the Land Turtle</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Tappin.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do they give tornadoes names as they do tropical storms? We'd like to propose the name Tappin for the tornado that we recently dodged in Alabama.</p>



<h2>Tappin the Land Turtle </h2><p>&quot;Tappin the Land Turtle&quot; is an African-American fable about a turtle whose family was hungry because times were so hard. But he noticed that the uppity eagle had plenty of food for his babies. So he asked the eagle about this, and enlisted the eagle's help in finding more food. But when he incurred the eagle's displeasure, he ended up on a magical adventure that brought him even more abundance than he'd anticipated.</p>



<p>It's a tale that goes back to the days of slavery and incorporates several reminders of that era: the hunger, the separation of &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; classes (the turtle and the eagle) and the dream of a life of plenty, symbolized bt the cornucopia-like dipper. In some versions of the story, Tappin returns to the Sea King and receives an enchanted cowhide, which, as it turns out, whips everyone (like the overseer on a plantation) and causes the markings on Tappin's shell, like those on every turtle thereafter.</p>



<h2>Hiding from Tornadoes in Alabama </h2><p>We thought about this story because we were rather like a turtle ourselves when the tornado whipped through. We'd just performed a couple of shows in Ozark, AL., and heard that severe storms were on the way. Keeping abreast of the developments by listening to the radio, we realized that the twister would bypass us, but we could get hit by hail. So we took refuge under the canopy of a car wash--our own turtle shell. (But we weren't the only ones who got this idea.)</p>



<p>We were thoroughly impressed by the work done by the staff of local radio station <a href="http://www.wkmx.com/">KMX</a>, who handled the crisis calmly and efficiently, providing up-to-the-minute information and putting in some very long hours. Visit the station's website for the local take on the disaster, and some information about how you can contribute to relief efforts.</p>



<h3>George Washington Carver Trivia</h3><p>We also talk about Dr. George Washington Carver, a former slave who settled in Alabama and became one of the world's great scientists, despite not even obtaining a high school education until his twenties. How many products did Dr. Carver derive from the peanut? The <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/travel/Typical/Mar07.html#peanut">answer</a> may astonish you!</p>



<p>And be the first to hear the news about an upcoming Roller Coaster Tycoon project that Zephyr is working on for the web site.</p>



<p>Happy Listening, </p>



<p> Dennis (Eagle/King), Kimberly (Narrator) and Zephyr (Tappin) Goza</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Celebrating Read Across America Week</h2><p>We're in Georgia, but we're talking about Springfield, Massachusetts, home town of Dr. Seuss--some of the things and people he saw there growing up figured in his books, thinly disguised. Mar. 2 is his birthday, so we wanted to pay tribute to him by performing one of his stories. Unfortunately, we can't afford the royalties; so we opted instead to do a Seuss-like story: Robert Browning's verse retelling of &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;. Like a Seuss book, the tale features colorful characters, animals, a fanciful plot, a valuable lesson, and most important of all, catchy and light-hearted rhymes.</p>
<h2>Pied Piper of Hamelin</h2>
<p>The Pied Piper legend is much older than Browning, dating back to 13th Century Germany. The earliest known reference to it is a depiction on a church's stained glass window around 1300. It includes a likeness of the notorious musician and a group of children, and apparently refers to a real tragedy that either caused a number of children to lose their lives or leave the city. (It may have been a flood, an avalanche, or a plague. Or the piper may have been a real person who actually lured them away. Nobody knows.) The story has been popular for ages, and has been the subject of at least eleven films, beginning in 1903.</p>

<p>Robert Browning (1812-1889) was, like his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning, one of the great poets of the Victorian Era. His line &quot;Grow old along with me, the best is yet to be&quot; was borrowed by John Lennon for his song &quot;Grow Old with Me&quot;. Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) wrote the famous line &quot;How do I love thee? Let me count the ways&quot; to her husband. Browning's version of &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot; was written in 1842.

Pied Piper of Hamelin
The Pied Piper legend is much older than Browning, dating back to 13th Century Germany. The earliest known reference to it is a depiction on a church's stained glass window around 1300. It includes a likeness of the notorious musician and a group of children, and apparently refers to a real tragedy that either caused a number of children to lose their lives or leave the city.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Goldilocks.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot; is not really a folk tale? That's because it was written, at least in its present form, by the English poet Robert Southey (1774-1843) although he may have based it on an actual folk tale of some sort. In our version, which is based on his, Goldilocks is a Valley Girl and Papa Bear is a hippie. And does anybody really eat porridge?</p>




<p>We come to you from Orlando, Florida, where Zephyr has made his umpteenth venture into Disney MGM and Disney's Animal Kingdom. In the latter, he rode the brand new ride Expedition Everest. He also made his presence known for the first time at Universal Orlando, devoting a day each to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. (His offical judgment is that the Spiderman ride is &quot;officially awesome&quot;.)</p>




<p>Meanwhile, mom and dad had a brand new experience at SkyVenture, a training facility for skydivers. They didn't jump out of any planes, but they did float on a column of air and felt like Spiderman for a few minutes.</p>

			<title>Amaterasu</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Amaterasu.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we present the Japanese folk tale of Amaterasu, a goddess
who was in charge of the sun, and went to hide in a cave when her
feelings were hurt, taking the sun away with her. How did her siblings
coax her into returning and bringing back the sunshine? Find out in
this, one of many, many tales of catastrophic floods and storms from
many cultures throughout the world.</p>


<p>We chose one of these stories for this week because we just paid our
first visit to New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina hit. We found the
city itself in pretty good shape, but in St. Bernard Parish, the
destruction is still jaw-dropping 16 months after the disaster.</p>


<p>We were in town to volunteer with <a href="http://www.habitat-nola.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a>, expecting to
wield hammers and saws in the reconstruction of damaged buildings.
Instead, we were hooked up with a partner program called <a href="http://www.toy-tia.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Toy_Industy_Foundation/Play_Helps/Play_Helps.htm">Play Helps</a>,
created by the Children's Museum of Manhattan to use the arts as
therapy for children traumatized by 9-11. We spent a couple of days at
Andrew Jackson Elementary School (formerly Andrew Jackson High School)
having fun playing with musical instruments and playing with the
students who were playing with them. We also participated in a family
fun night at the school, and made up a theatre/sports game for the
occasion.</p>


<p>We worked with a retired gentleman named Danny, who, like us, is a
<a href="http://livingwithintention.spaces.live.com/default.aspx?_c02_owner=1">fulltime RVer</a>. He demonstrated for the kids a Native American flute and
a Tibetan singing bowl. It was, we hope, reassuring for the students to
meet folks like us who live in an RV by choice, since most of them have
been living in FEMA trailers out of necessity.</p>

<p>Happy Listening,</p>

			<title>Pecos Bill</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Pecos.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Who was the tallest, strongest, most &quot;Texas&quot; tall tale hero of them all? Why, it was Pecos Bill.</p>
<h2>Pecos Bill</h2>
<p>In the heyday of the cattle drive, when cowboys would gather around the campfire after a hard day's work, they might entertain themselves by outdoing each other in spinning whoppers. Pecos Bill grew (and grew, and grew) out of those informal contests; and many fantastic deeds and adventures were attached to him. In our version of the narrative, we relate how he was lost on a cross-country&nbsp; trip as a baby and raised by coyotes, then rejoined the human race as a cowboy. At this occupation, he earned a name for himself by inventing the lasso and taming a cyclone. And then there was his legendary courtship of Slew-Foot Sue.</p>

<h2>Texas</h2>
<p>During the past week we crossed the Pecos River, and we even passed through Pecos, Texas, where we had a rehearsal next to the West of the Pecos Museum and the National Rodeo Hall of Fame--which was established here because Pecos was the site of the world's very first rodeo, back in 1883. (The word &quot;rodeo&quot; comes from the Spanish word meaning &quot;surround&quot;, which is what cowboys did a lot of.)</p>

<h2>Families on the Road</h2>
<p>We also attended a gathering in Dallas for <a href="http://www.familiesontheroad.com" title="FOTR">Families On the Road</a> (FOTR) a nationwide group of RV'ers (and often homeschoolers) who stay in touch online. The gathering was held at the clubhouse of the Dallas KOA. And the following day we drove to Houston and visited the <a href="http://www.freerangefamily.com/" title="Free Range Family">Free Range Family</a>, a homeschooling family who are preparing to go on the road fulltime--and who attended two of our performances last year while they were living in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Happy Listening, </p>
<p>Dennis (cowpoke), Kimberly (Slew-Foot Sue) and Zephyr (&quot;Bill&quot;)</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/SpiritWife.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h2>The Spirit Wife</h2><p>&quot;The Spirit Wife&quot;, a legend from the Zuni tribe of New Mexico, parallels the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. It tells of a young man whose wife has died, and he goes on a quest to reclaim her from the land of the dead, with the aid of some enchanted animals. He does succeed, in a way, but he also pays a heavy price for his impatience. We present this story in the style of an old-fashioned movie trailer.</p>
<h2>Albuquerque, New Mexico</h2>
<p>This week we tell of our recent stay in Albuquerque, during which we performed at the brand spanking new Rio Rancho Library, took a chilly 20-mile bike ride that passed through Old Town, and toured the National Atomic Museum. We learned some interesting facts about radiation, saw a quaint display of atomic medical quackery, and viewed a film about the development and use of the bombs that devastated Japan. We also talk about the exhibit honoring the Navajo &quot;code talkers&quot; during World War II.</p>

<p>Happy Listening!</p>

			<title>Simple Ivan</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Ivan.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we bring you the Russian folktale &quot;Simple Ivan&quot;, one of our perennial favorites, and part of our newest production, &quot;Quizzical Quests&quot;, which we opened this month. Onstage, we act out this story in pantomime. But since pantomime is rather difficult to see in a podcast, we've added vocies and more narration.</p>

<p>&quot;Simple Ivan&quot; is one of the classic &quot;noodlehead&quot; stories, with variants found in many cultures. (Ivan is the Russian equivalent of John or Jack.) Ivan is lazy and likes to just sit at home staring at the wall, so to trick him into going outside to get some exercise, his mother tells him that he might find some money. He takes the bait and goes out on an excursion, but doesn't find money; instead, he has a series of encounters in which he meets people under different circumstances, and doesn't know how to behave. He returns home after each incident, and explains to his mother what happened. She advises him what he should do, and he follows her advice on his next outing, but finds his newly acquired behavior to be totally and hilariously inappropriate for the next situation he discovers.</p>

<p>Although we are in Albuquerque this week, we discuss our experiences last week in Las Vegas, where we opened our new production. We try to wrangle some of the secrets out of Zephyr that he learned on his backstage tour at &quot;Star Trek: The Experience&quot;. (He stays tight-lipped.) We also recount our delightful evening watching Penn and Teller's show; and Dennis recalls when he first saw them, then as two-thirds of a trio, performing in San Francisco in 1980.</p>
<p>Happy Listening,</p>
<p>Dennis, Kimberly (mom) and Zephyr (Ivan) Goza<br/> </p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/IronDragon.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h2>The Iron Dragon </h2><p>We're in Las Vegas, but we're talking about Reno and the Sierras. That's because this is our first podcast in three weeks, as we took a couple of weeks off during the holidays. So this week, we catch you up on what we were doing during that time - namely visiting Kimberly's parents in Reno and working feverishly to get our newest production ready. Don't think for one minute that we were taking a hoiday vacation - although we did manage to sneak in a skiing excursion to the Sierras.</p>
<p>And since we've spent some time lately in and near the California Gold Rush country, we bring you a story from tht region, a tale told by Chinese immigrants who helped build the railroad. We call it &quot;The Iron Dragon&quot;, and it involves a group of laborers who come over to seek their fortune and instead find very harsh and dangerous working conditions. Several of them die on the job and one of the deceased workers returns in spirit form to haunt his comrades. They decide that in order to give rest to the souls of their fellow Chinese laborers, they must undertake a special construction project on the side.</p>
<p>A wonderful illustrated version of this story can be found in the book The Iron Moonhunter by Kathleen Chang (San Francisco: Children's Books Press, 1977).</p>

Don't think for one minute that we were taking a hoiday vacation - although we did manage to sneak in a skiing excursion to the Sierras.
And since we've spent some time lately in and near the California Gold Rush country, we bring you a story from tht region, a tale told by Chinese immigrants who helped build the railroad. We call it &quot;The Iron Dragon&quot;, and it involves a group of laborers who come over to seek their fortune and instead find very harsh and dangerous working conditions. Several of them die on the job and one of the deceased workers returns in spirit form to haunt his comrades. They decide that in order to give rest to the souls of their fellow Chinese laborers, they must undertake a special construction project on the side.
A wonderful illustrated version of this story can be found in the book The Iron Moonhunter by Kathleen Chang (San Francisco: Children's Books Press, 1977).
The Iron Moonhunter (Fifth World Tales)Happy Listening,
Dennis, Kimberly and Zephyr Goza

			<title>The Gift of the Magi</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/magi.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The wanderer has returned, to continue wandering with the rest of us. Zephyr just got back from his 10-day jaunt to North Carolina, where he recorded a mini-album with his <a href="http://myspace.com/asimpledisaster">punk rock band</a> in Winston-Salem. He brought along a rough cut of the disc, and we play a brief excerpt from it on the podcast. He rejoins his parents in the San Francisco Bay Area, our old stomping grounds, where we've been stomping longer in recent days than in years - and indeed more time than we've spent just about anywhere in years. But after a performance at the Mitchell Park Library in Palo Alto, we're ready to hit the highway again.</p>
<h2>The Gift of the Magi </h2><p>This week's story is &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;, which is appropriate for two reasons. First, it is of course a classic Christmas Story; and after a 3-month buildup, Santa is just about ready for his yearly cruise. Additionally, the author of the story, William Sydney Porter (better known by his pen name of O. Henry) was a native of the same area Zephyr has been visiting. He was born in Greensboro, N.C. (where the band's drummer lives) in 1862 and died in 1910. During the last few years of his life, he wrote fiction at a whirlwind pace, and became famous for his trademark surprise twist endings, such as the one in &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot;. (He also, incidentally, coined the term &quot;banana republic&quot;.) It's likely that the character of Della in this story was modeled after his first wife, who died of tuberculosis, from which he also suffered.</p>
<p> Dennis shares his favorite Christmas story, an incident he read about in the news two or three years ago, and recalls as best he can, despite being unable to find the details anywhere. If anybody has any info on this story, please pass it along to us. </p>
<p> And as we make it clear in our podcast, we extend happy holiday wishes to everyone, regardless of their religion, customs, or brand of holiday cheer - or lack thereof. See you in 2007! </p>
<p>Happy Listening,</p>
<p>Dennis (the narrator), Kimberly &quot;Della&quot; and Zephyr &quot;Jim&quot; Goza </p>

			<title>The Swan Maiden</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/SwanMaiden.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Lake Chabot </h2><p>High above the East Bay town of Castro Valley, California - just a few miles across the bay from San Francisco - is Lake Chabot Campground, part of the California State Parks. It's one of the few campgrounds available in the S.F. Bay Area, and just about the only reasonably priced one. So we've stayed there often during the years, and have many colorful memories of the place, some of which we'll share on this week's podcast. Dennis and Kimberly are spending a few days at this campground (while Zephyr is in North Carolina recording with his band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/asimpledisaster">A Simple Disaster</a>) to focus on getting the new productions together.</p>

<h2>The Swan Maiden </h2><p>Since we are encamped overlooking a lake, we thought it would be appropriate to bring you the Swedish folktale of The Swan Maiden, about a hunter who sees three beautiful swans alight at a lake, and then before his eyes they remove their feathery cloaks and become beautiful young maidens who swim in the lake. Later, they put their feathers back on and fly away. He falls in love with the youngest of the swan maidens and can't get her out of his mind. So on the advice of his mother, he goes back to the lake and awaits their return, whereupon he steals the youngest swan's feathers, so she cannot turn back into a swan. She agrees to marry him (what other answer could you possibly give to a guy who steals your feathers?) and for a time it seems they are living happily ever after. But ultimately, the hunter pays a heavy price for &quot;clipping the wings&quot; of a free creature.</p>

<p>This story has parallels to many other tales, including Swan Lake (the basis for the Tchaikovsky ballet) and Lohengrin (the inspiration for the Wagner opera - what is it with composers and swans, anyway?) as well as several other variants-some involving other types of fowl-from China, Japan and India. There's even a similar story in The Arabian Nights. </p>

			<title>Rapunzel</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Rapunzel.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Alcatraz</h2><p> Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay was a notorious federal prison from 1934 to 1963, and a military prison and military base for many years before that. On a return trip to our old hometown of San Francisco, we finally took a tour of The Rock, beginning with a ferry ride from Pier 33. Once on the island, we participated in ranger-led tours (the island is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area) and an audio tour that told us about the prison's colorful history - including a riot in 1946 that left 3 guards and 2 inmates dead. On hand was Darwin Coon, who was an inmate here from 1959 to 1963, to promote his book &quot;Alcatraz; the True End of the Line&quot;.</p>


<h2>Rapunzel</h2><p>This week we present the Grimm Brothers story &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, one of the best known fairy tales in the world, and one of the central plots in the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. The story involves a woman who craved greens from a neighbor's garden so strongly that she was willing to give up her firstborn child for them; and the neighbor, unfortunately, was quite willing to take the child. This epitome of a nightmarish neighbor also happened to be an evil sorceress who imprisoned the girl (whom she named Rapunzel) in a tower, climbing up to see her by way of Rapunzel's long, long hair. But even a tower can't keep her away from handsome princes foreverâ�¦</p>

<h3>Upcoming Public Performances</h3><p>They are live and they are free (thanks to your public libraries and community centers)</p>


<ul>
<li>Dec. 20th in Palo Alto, CA</li>
<li>Jan. 17th in Rio Rancho (near Albuqurque), NM</li><li>Feb. 1st in Laurel, MS<br type="_moz"/></li>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/3Pigs.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h3>Disneyland</h3><p>What better way to spend a Thanksgiving than by going to Disneyland? Well actually there must be dozens of better ways. The place was packed like a glass slipper on the foot of Cinderella's stepsister. But that didn't deter Zephyr and his &quot;big sister&quot; Ellie from spending a full day there, and we do mean a full day - from 9:00 a.m. until nearly time for the RV to turn back into a Thanksgiving pumpkin. They found the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; ride to be totally remodeled to pay homage to the movies that pay homage to the original version of the ride. The newly revamped Space Mountain was also back in operation after too long in inoperation, and the Haunted Mansion was given a complete makeover for Yuletide. </p>
<h3>Santa Monica and Venice </h3><p>A couple of days later, we took a stroll, for the first time ever, from the Santa Monica Pier (where we rode the roller coaster) to Venice Beach, soaking up the colorful atmosphere of street performers, arts and crafts vendors and inline skaters skating in anything but a line. </p>
<h2>The Three Little Pigs </h2><p>For no particular reason, we decided to present &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; this week, or as we call it, &quot;The Pee Little Thrigs&quot;. That's because we thought it would be fun to tell the story in spoonerisms, a type of slip of the tongue (or &quot;tip of the slung&quot;) that involves switching the first letters between two words. Thus, &quot;hung out the flags&quot; becomes &quot;flung out the hags&quot;. Spoonerism was named after Rev. William Archibald Spooner (1844-1930), an instructor at Oxford University. Telling fairy tales laced with spoonerisms was popularized by comedian Archie Campbell (1914-1987), writer and star of the TV series &quot;Hee Haw&quot;; it was also used by the dwarf Doc in the Disney classic &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot; (more correctly Dwarfs). Hey! We knew there was a logical reason we decided to do it this week!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>It's Cool to be Kind!</h1><p><strong>Welcome to our ThanksGIVING episode!</strong> This week we are focusing on putting the &quot;giving&quot; in Thanksgiving and spreading Random Acts of Kindness. </p>

<p>Last week we talked about the <a href="http://www.roadtripnation.com/">Green RV</a> in which college students travel the country, usimg their life on the road to find their road in life. This episode expands on that as we talk about the <a href="http://www.extremekindness.com/">Extreme Kindness Tour</a>. In 2002 four young men from Canada decided to hit the road on a 3 month Extreme Kindness Tour. Find out about what they did to promote kindness and &quot;pay it forward&quot;. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Check them out at <a href="http://www.extremekindness.com/ek/kindness/index.html">ExtremeKindness.com </a>where you'll find their blog, information about their tour, a schedule of upcoming appearances, a counter to log kindness and some video clips from their tour.</li>
</ul>

<p>We've also got some other stories about people who have made a difference in the world by focusing on &quot;paying it forward&quot;, including Larry Stewart of Lee's Summit, Missouri who decided at Christmas time in 1979 to take $200 out of his bank account and anonymously pass it around to those who were less fortunate than himself. He has been known only as the &quot;Secret Santa&quot; as he continued his giving spree throughout the years, giving more and more. He is now dyeing of cancer and has decided to reveal his identity so that others may continue his legacy. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/us/19santa.html">His story</a> was in the news this week.</p>

<p>Also find out a bit about Podcamp West; and Zephyr tells his tale about his run-in with mall security while trying to give out &quot;Free Hugs&quot; in Massachusetts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>More about <a href="http://www.payitforwardfoundation.org/home.html" title="Pay it Forward Foundation">Pay It Forward</a> and <a href="http://actsofkindness.org/">Random Acts of Kindness</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Lion and the Mouse </h2><p>In the spirit of giving and doing for others we bring you the Aesop fable about the unlikely acts of kindness between a lion and a mouse. A mouse promises to help the fierce lion if only the lion won't eat him. But how will the mouse repay the lion? </p>

<h3>Folklore and Philanthropy Lesson Plans </h3><ul>
  <li>If you'd like to extend the connection between folklore and the spirit of generosity with your children or in the classroom be sure to visit <a href="http://www.learningtogive.org/">LearningtoGive.org</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Round II of the Podcast Pickle Storytelling Contest </h2><p>Thanks to those who voted in round I of the Pickle Tales Storytelling Contest. THANKS to you we've made it to round II and have been issued a new challenge!

            <description><![CDATA[<h1 align="center">Define your own road in life!</h1><h2>Road Trip Nation</h2><p>We're revisiting our roots and catching up with old friends in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we stopped in at San Jose State University to attend a presentation about Roadtrip Nation, a PBS program that dispatches teams of 3 college students to travel the country for 6 weeks in a green RV exploring career options by interviewing prominent personalities in business, entertainment, law, public service, and other fields. The team of students we met today interviewed the CEO of Starbucks and leaders of other well-known businesses, as well as stand-up comic Wanda Sykes and talk show host Wendy Williams. And their experience on the road this summer has given them valuable insight into what directions their own lives should take.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.roadtripnation.com/">RoadTrip Nation</a></li><li><a href="http://www.roadtripnation.com/PBS">On PBS </a></li></ul>
<h2>MuLan</h2><p>This week, we present a story about someone else who had to courageously forge her own path: <em>The Song of Mu Lan</em>, a folk tale from China. (Which we've been performing onstage as part of our production &quot;<a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/shows.html">Daring to Dream</a>&quot;.) It's the saga of a teenage girl who disguises herself as a man in order to join the army and fight in place of her ailing father, thus preserving family honor. And according to tradition, she served her country extremely well and even became a high-ranking officer.</p>
<p>We don't know for certain whether <em>The Song of Mu Lan</em> is a true story, but it was written as a poem about 1500 years ago. The name &quot;Mu Lan&quot;, which is translated as &quot;Magnolia&quot;, means literally &quot;wood flower&quot;, a very appropriate name for a person who appeared as delicate as a flower but turned out to be as durable as wood.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's National Geography Week and Children's Book Week, November 12-19. And we have just the tale to celebrate both occasions: Hansel and Gretel (a la Lemony Snicket meets Wizard of Oz). </p>
<p>We are back in San Jose, having been to Sacramento to appear on the ABC-affiliated show <a href="http://www.sacandco.net/">Sac and Company</a> and to Modesto to perform at the library this week. We'll tell you a bit about the inner workings of a live TV show. And right now Zephyr is helping pull apart <a href="http://www.callsonmanor.com/">Callson Manor</a>, the haunted house he worked at last week, while we babysit the property at night. </p>

<p align="center"><em>Please check back for more information and links November 13th. </em></p>
<h2>Hansel and Gretel</h2><p>Hansel and Gretel get ditched in the woods and have to escape an evil hag who lives in a sweet house and find their way back home. In our version they meet a few other storybook characters who give them some bad directions along the way.</p>
<h3>National Geography Week </h3><p>We've been traveling full time since 1992 and have had more than our share of bad directions. Nowadays, we use GPS, computer map programs and Google Maps on our cell phone to get where we are going. But way back when we started touring, we had to rely on people to give us directions. It's amazing we got anywhere! Hardly anyone knows the name of the streets in their hometown. And we have repeatedly scratched our heads after hearing &quot;Well, you turn left at the old Jones place and if you come to the train tracks you've gone to far!&quot;. And &quot;Just turn right at the corn field.&quot; We'd like to point out that we are in Kansas and surrounded by cornfields but don't have the heart. </p>
<p>So bottom line, study those maps and read those street signs so you can help someone find their way. And if you want to get anywhere, learn your geography and how to use a GPS! Or else you will have to leave some bread crumbs!</p>
<ul><li>Rescources for <a href="http://www.mywonderfulworld.org/gaw.html">National Geography Week</a> </li></ul>
<h3>Children's Book Week </h3><p>Zephyr has been reading the entire &quot;<a href="http://www.lemonysnicket.com/">Series of Unfortunate Events</a>&quot; to mom and dad this month. And in this episode Dennis recounts his encounter with Daniel Handler (a.k.a. Lemony Snicket). </p>
<p>Reading out loud is an excellent way to celebrate Children's Book Week. We hope you'll celebrate by following a map to your local library to see what special events they have planned. And while you are there, check out some childrens' books. Especially in the folktale section (Dewey Decimal 398.2). </p>
<p>And be sure to get a copy of <em>&quot;Tales from Under the Crevice&quot;</em> or the sequel <em>&quot;Tales from Under the Nook&quot;</em> by our resident young author Zephyr Goza at your library or bookstore, or online at <a href="http://www.crevicetales.com/">CreviceTales.com</a>.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Isis.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you know the way to San Jose? We hope so! Cuz that is where we are podcasting from this week. </p>

<p>San Jose is home of the <a href="http://www.egyptianmuseum.org/">Rosicrucian Museum</a> and burial site for many of the Donner party, pioneers who struck out on the Oregon trail, took a wrong turn and got stuck for the winter.</p>

<h2>Mummies, tombs, and hieroglyphics!</h2><p>At the Rosicrucian Museum, the curators who were decked out in full Egyptian regalia (since we visited on Halloween), led us on a tour of an ancient tomb replica. The hieroglyphs at the tomb's entrance welcome visitors who brought the deceased food. Hey, you get hungry when you're dead and have to wait 20 years before entering the afterlife! Once inside the tomb we learned that the East wall represented birth and life since the sun rises in the east. The south wall depicts scenes of hunting and fishing portraying the deceased as being very skilled. The wall to the west is where the sun sets and so upon it we see the dead meeting the gods of the afterlife. And upon the north wall is a scene of judgment including a scale with a heart weighed against the feather of truth. And on the ceiling was the goddess who eats the sun and gives birth to the moon and then eats the moon and gives birth to the sun each day. Wonder if she gets a tummy ache?</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians believed that whatever is depicted in hieroglyphics becomes true and therefore heiroglyphs were very sacred. And because of this power, only a few scribes were trained in the art. To become a scribe you had to be a boy and a rich one at that. Then you had to attend school, where you get to sit for eight hours copying the same text over and over. And if your teacher felt you weren't quick enough they would beat your back. If you were dedicated and studied hard enough you would become a scribe, one of the most prestigious positions in the Egyptian society.</p>

<p>You can visit the Rusicrucian Museum online at <a href="http://www.egyptianmuseum.org/">http://www.egyptianmuseum.org</a> and find a virtual tour and an audio tour that you can download. Better yet visit it in person whenever you are in San Jose.</p>

<p>The Rosicrucian Museum is located in Rosicrucian Park, a picturesque facility encompassing an entire city block. It's the world headquarters of the Rosicrucian Order, a mystical society dating back to antiquity. Many notable historical figures are said to have been Rosicrucians, including Francis Bacon and Benjamin Franklin. The French impressionist composer Claude Debussy was a member of the order, and his music reflects its mystical nature.</p>

<h2>Isis and the Seven Scorpions</h2><p>While we were at the Rosicrucian Museum we learned this story and thought we'd share it with you. Isis, accompanied by her seven scorpions, makes her way to a town in the Nile Delta. The scorpions Petet, Tjetet, and Matet led the way, Mesetet and Mesetetaf walked beside her, while Tefen and Befen brought up the rear. Upon their arrival to town a noblewoman refused to give them shelter, which angered the scorpions. Meanwhile, a peasant girl offered her humble dwelling to Isis who was seeking refuge. However, the scorpions decide to teach the noble woman a lesson by poisoning her son with their venom. Distraught, the noblewoman seeks help for her dying son. Find out what happens to the boy, what Isis does, and what becomes of the noblewoman and the peasant girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Isis and the Seven Scorpions&quot; reminds us of another folktale with seven little guys who care for a maiden...</p>

<p>And here is another Egyptian story incase you missed it back in August: <a href="http://activated.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=113648">Rhodopis, the Egyptian Cinderella</a>.</p>

<h3>More Egyptian</h3><ul><li>An <a href="http://www.greatscott.com/hiero/">introduction to Egyptian hieroglyphic</a> writing and numbering. Interactive examples allow users to create hieroglyphic numbers and fractions. </li><li><a href="http://hieroglyphs.net/0301/cgi/pager.pl?p=04">Write in hieroglyphics</a> </li></ul>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Krakow.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are back in our old stomping grounds, where we began our theatre careers, our film career (in Zephyr's case), our company, our family and our life on the road. This week we come to you from Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, after performing at the San Francisco Jewish Community Center.</p>

<h2>Lake Shasta Caverns</h2><p>We tell of our recent trip to Lake Shasta Caverns, discovered by Charles Morton in 1878 near Mt.Shasta. The caverns are situated by Lake Shasta, the second-largest manmade lake in the country--it covers five former towns and contains sturgeon up to 30 feet long!&nbsp;We took the three-part tour (boat, bus and shoe leather) of the caverns and discovered some of the most graphic rock formations we've ever seen in the many caves we've toured.</p>

<p>Learn how to tell stalactites from stalagmites. We'll give you&nbsp;a couple of ways to tell them apart. And find out what helictites are. (No, they're not a frozen dessert on a stick, but they look like it.)</p>

<ul><li>More about <a href="http://www.lakeshastacaverns.com/">Lake Shasta Caverns</a></li></ul>

<h2>The Dragon of Krakow</h2><p>The story of &quot;The Dragon of Krakow&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;The Dragon of Wawel Hill&quot; or &quot;Krakus and the Dragon&quot;) is a folktale from Poland. We've been touring the country with this story since May 2006. Just a few more months to see it live on the west coast, as it will be closing in December to make way for our new production. </p>

<ul><li>Check the <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/schedule.html">Tour Schedule</a>&nbsp;for upcoming shows </li></ul>

<p>What happens when a young boy learns to deal with the trouble he has stirred up? A shoemaker's apprentice, egged on by peer pressure, awakens a sleeping dragon, which devastates the village and terrorizes the people. When the villagers are unable to defeat him, the apprentice realizes he must correct his own mistake, which he does with imagination and resourcefulness.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Oregon Shakespeare Festival</h1><p>Costumes, props, sets, Shakespeare. What goes into putting together the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland? We tell you some of what we learned on the backstage tour at the Festival (a tour conducted by veteran Festival actor Rex Young), including an inside glimpse of the Elizabethan Stage (America's first Elizabethan theatre), the Angus Bowmer Theatre (named after the Festival's founder) and the New Theatre.</p>
<p>Begun in 1935, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival runs 11 shows in three theatres from February through October every year. This year 82 actors protrayed 195 characters in close to 800 shows. Each actor plays 2 to 3 roles and understudies one to two other parts. And for every actor that you see on stage there are 4 people working backstage designing and building the costumes, sets, lights, and making the magic happen. </p>
<ul><li>More information about the <a href="http://www.orshakes.org/">Oregon Shakespeare Festival</a></li></ul>
<h2>Zephyr Haunts Ashland and Tumwater</h2><p><a href="http://www.scienceworks.org/">Science Works Museum</a> in Ashland offers hands-on educational (and fun!) exhibits for children, including the paper airplane launcher for flying airplanes they have been taught to make. A special exhibit of toys and games is coming soon, as is a Halloween haunted house which Zephyr helped design - having recently contributed his talents to a much larger attraction called <a href="http://www.twilightsterror.com/">Twilight's Terror</a> in Tumwater, Washington. </p>
<h1>Romeo and Juliet </h1><h2>(The Four Minute condensed comical version) </h2><p>William Shakespeare's classic tragedy about star-crossed lovers from dueling clans has roots in the Greek legend &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; (which he also invoked in &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;) and has inspired books, plays, movies and tv shows throughout the ages. Variations of this tale exist in many other cultures as well; a hit song on the radio in the Sixties called &quot;Running Bear and Little White Dove&quot; related a similar story involving Native Americans from warring tribes. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; illustrates Shakespeare's extraordinary ability to transform a borrowed plot into something wholly original, and uniquely his own. </p>
<p>And coming up for 2007 our own national tour of &quot;Shakespeare Shazam&quot;, an introduction to the Bard's work. We act out passages from such Shakespearean masterpieces as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in both the original version and modern English. </p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/zoro.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Up, up and away! Visit the Museum of Flight, learn about Leonardo Da Vinci and&nbsp;his plans for a flying machine, and hear the story of &quot;Zoro, the Flying Apprentice&quot;.</p>

<p>This week we survived a 27 mile bike ride which took us across the floating bridge and up the hills of Seattle (both ways).</p>

<h1>Visit The Museum of Flight</h1><p>Yes, there really is a flying car or &quot;AeroCar&quot;. And have you heard of the X-jet? It's a personal transportation device - or what we've dubbed the &quot;flying podium&quot;. It goes up 10,000 feet and 60 miles per hour. Take a tour of Air Force One, a Concorde jet and see the original Boeing factory where they made planes out of wood and canvas. And how about flying a plane for a month? Hey, where is our flying motorhome?</p>

<p>The Museum of Flight has an upcoming exhibit &quot;Leonardo Da Vinci; Man, Inventor, Genius&quot; opening October 1st (closes January 28th, 2007). Leonardo Da Vinci was a painter, sculptor, architect, art historian, natural scientist, writer and inventor.&nbsp;The drawings in&nbsp;his notebooks included&nbsp;designs of flying machines.</p>

<p>You will find the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington or online at <a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/">www.museumofflight.org/</a></p>

<h1>Zoro, the Flying Apprentice</h1><p>Around 1485 Leonardo Da Vinci drew detailed plans for a human-powered ornithopter (a wing-flapping device intended to fly). And legend has it that a young apprentice named Zoroaste (egged on by the mischievous Salai) took the machine out for a spin.</p>

<p>You'll find another version of this story in a book called &quot;Leonardo and the Flying Boy&quot; by Laurence Anholt.</p>

<h1 align="left">It's Banned Book Week (Sept. 23-30)</h1><p>You won't believe some of the books that have banned! Such as&nbsp;&quot;I Am the Cheese&quot;, the Harry Potter series, and&nbsp;&quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes.&nbsp;Catch the Activated Storytellers performing a live musical production of &quot;Alias, Don Quixote&quot; at a library. Upcoming appearances are scheduled in Oregon and California. Check the <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/schedule.html">itinerary</a> for more information. And learn more about banned books at the <a href="http://http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bannedbooksweek.htm">American Library Association</a> site.</p>

<p>Happy Listening!</p>

			<title>The Most Beautiful Thing in the World</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/MostBeautiful.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Seeking geocaches and &quot;The Most Beautiful Thing in the World&quot;. This week the Activated Storytellers come to you from Olympia, WA with a story from China.</p>
<h1>&quot;The Most Beautiful Thing in the World&quot; from China</h1><p>This is one of the stories we use when we conduct one of our weeklong Artist-in-Residency programs in schools. We direct students in all aspects of theatrical production, including developing the script from a story, designing and building props and costumes, and acting.</p>
<p>In this tale, a&nbsp;king sends his three children out into the world to find the most beautiful thing. The one that succeeds will inherit the crown.</p>
<h2>Post Your Thoughts</h2><p>What do you suppose is the most beautiful thing in the world? Is it a smile? Is it a place? Something someone did? We'd like to hear YOUR story! You can post your thoughts here and we'll read the best ones in an upcoming podcast.</p>
<h1>Geocaching &amp; Letterboxing</h1><p>Since the theme this week is seeking treasures, we decided to focus on Geocaching, the game where you are the search engine. If you are new to Geocaching, <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/">Geocaching.com</a> and a GPS unit will get you started. Type in your zip code, copy down the clues and get ready to do some real life treasure hunting. Be careful though and don't let the muggles spot you!</p>
<p>Geocaching got its inspiration from <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/">letterboxing</a>, which started about 150 years ago, and is still practiced today. But Geocaching as we know it, with the aid of a GPS device, started only about 6 years ago.</p>
<p>We chose to&nbsp;focus on Geocaching because the Olympia area has quite a number of interesting caches,&nbsp;some of historical interest.&nbsp;In addition to being a lot of fun, this game&nbsp;offers an opportunity to learn things while&nbsp;challenging your detective skills.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2><p>A couple of weeks ago we presented the story of <b>&quot;The Apple Dumpling&quot;</b> and pointed out how it reminded us of the guy who swapped a red paperclip on craigslist.org for something bigger and better, until he got his dream - a house. Well&nbsp;a family&nbsp;of listeners heard the story and decided to try it for themselves! This family's goal is to live on the road like we do, but first they need a bus. So they decided to trade a little red matchbox bus for a real one! You can check their progress at <a href="http://barterbus.blogspot.com/">A Bus 4 a Bus</a>.</p>
<h2>National Tour</h2><p>We are bringing our live theatrical productions to schools and libraries on the West Coast through December and then we'll be heading east. Please visit our web site for more information about <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/school_assembly.html">school assemblies</a> and <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/residency.html">residency programs</a>, or to find a <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/schedule.html">free show sponsored by a public library</a> to bring your family to. If you'd like to pass on information to your school&nbsp;you also find&nbsp;a flyer that you can download, print and share on our site.</p>
<p>Happy Listening,</p>
<p>Dennis, Kimberly and Zephyr Goza</p>

			<title>Red Riding Hood</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/activated/Red_Riding_Hood.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>From the End the Oregon Trail, we discuss pioneers and tell the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Also Zephyr gives a report about &quot;Not Back to School&quot; camp and find out a bit about roadschooling.</p>
<p>Back in 1843 families started heading west. They heard the stories of a better life. They saved up about $900 dollars ($100,000 in todays market) and made their way to Independence or St. Joseph Missouri to hook up with a wagon train. Loading 2000 lbs of supplies into a small closet sized wagon they were off on a 4-6 month journey following the Little Blue river northwest. They left in May headed west past Chimney Rock where they stopped to sign their names and on to Independence Rock hopefully by the 4th of July, past the Rocky Mountains along the Snake River and to the Oregon Territory. By the way, the Oregon Territory at that time included not only Oregon but Washington, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming.</p>
<p>The pioneers on the Oregon Trail were primarily well educated families who brought books with them and continued to school there kids on the treck. Books by Hans Christen Andersonand titles such as &quot;Little Women&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Robber Kitten&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; could be found bouncing along with the bacon, coffee, rice and churning butter. So this week we tell the story of the little girl in the red cloak on her way to grandmother's house.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we revisited our roots in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Zephyr attended the famous (in rock music circles) venue in Berkeley where Green Day, among others, got their start. We toured the Jelly Belly factory (the Goelitz Candy Co.) in Fairfield, and found that the owners are very appreciative of Ronald Reagan for helping popularize their jelly beans, but show little acknowledgment of Harry Potter, who's helped promote its Bernie Botts Every Flavor Beans. And we returned to perform at several Sacramento Libraries.</p>
<p>Our podcast story this week is &quot;The Boy Who Listened to Birds&quot;, one of the &quot;noodlehead&quot; stories from Russia.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Podcasting from Ukiah, California. This week we were inspired by a drive through Redwood Forest. We hiked amoung trees that are thousands of years old and hundreds of feet tall. Some are big enough to build several houses. The trunks of others have been turned into a 20' room, two story tree houses and even a gas station. There have been several reported sightings of Bigfoot in the area. We didn't catch a glimpse of the elusive Sasquatch but being surrounded by such tall trees we decided the story of Paul Bunyan was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Paul Bunyan was soooo big. How big was he? Why when he was just a baby his parents had to put his cradle out to sea. Follow Paul and Babe the Blue Ox on their journey to the logging camps across America. There was the summer that was soooo hot and the winter that was soooo cold. How hot was it? How cold was it? Well you'll have to listen to find out of course.</p>
<p>After the story the Activated Storytellers discuss the origins of Paul Bunyan stories.</p>
<h2>Paul Bunyan Activity Map</h2><p>Download the official <a href="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/documents/paul_bunyan_map.pdf">Paul Bunyan Activity Map</a> (.pdf) and print it out.</p>
<img src="http://www.activated-storytellers.com/images/paul_bunyan_map.jpg"/> <p>Enjoy coloring and using the map to follow Paul's Journey.</p>
<p>Happy Listening,</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Why do Wolves get such a bad rap in folktales? The Activated Storytellers visit Wolf Haven in Tenino, Washington to find out more about wolves and the role they play. What happens when wolves are erradicated? And did you know there is a joker in every wolf pack?</p>
<p>Stories about wolves have been told for as long as we can remember as have stories about a Cinderella type of character.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Cinderella is the oldest Cinderella story known to man. It comes from Egypt and it may even be true--at least we know that it's based on real events. The prince became the pharaoh Amasis, who ruled over Egypt for 44 years. And he really did marry a former slave girl from Greece. In this version of the story, the slave girl is named Rhodopis, and the prince must find a bride by his 21st birthday. He turns for help to his pet falcon, since falcons were revered as messengers of the sun god Horus. </p>
