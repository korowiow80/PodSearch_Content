    <description>This is a podcast for intermediate or advanced Italian language learners. You can expand your vocabulary by listening to spoken Italian while you also read the transcript and study the words that are unfamiliar. The best part is that you'll have a lot of fun in the process! &quot;Fumetti&quot; are Italian comic books. The podcasts are comic books that were originally dramatized for Italian radio (RADIO 2).

This podcast will focus mainly on three comic book characters that are incredibly successful in Italy: Tex, Diabolik and Dylan Dog. The podcasts and other materials on the website will show you how deeply the characters have entered the consciousness of contemporary Italian society. 

Transcripts are available for download. Please send me comments and suggestions at fumetti@podomatic.com.  

Grazie tante!

      <title>Normalman in Il Detersivo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1066473/600x600_701655.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Un'astronave aliena attera su un orto lasciando tracce di texylonio, un carburante, appunto, alieno. L'orto &#232; di Piermaria Carletti, un uomo cento volte pi&#249; debole, stupido ed inetto di un uomo normale. Piermaria mangia i pomodori che lo rendono 100 volte pi&#249; potente, diventa quindi &quot;normale&quot;, e si cuce un costume da supereroe. Queste sono le origini di... Normalman!

Normalman in &quot;Il Detersivo&quot;. Roma, ora quindici e trentasei. Piermaria Carletti alias Normalman sta facendo la spesa nel supermercato sotto casa. Una piccola vecchina deve comprare il detersivo. 
&quot;Eccolo. Finalmente l'ho trovato. SbiancX &#232; il detersivo che lava pi&#249; bianco del bianco. Solo che l'hanno messo sullo scaffale pi&#249; in alto. Non ci arrivo. Dovrei farmi aiutare da un commesso.&quot; 
Ma come in tutti i supermercati i commessi sono introvabili. Per fortuna che Piermaria Carletti alias Normalman si trova a pochi metri dalla vecchina e vede tutto. 
&quot;La mia normal vista mi dice che quella vecchina ha bisogno di aiuto. Questo &#232; un lavoro per Normalman.&quot; 
Fortunatamente Piermaria indossa gi&#224; il costume sotto il vestito. Quindi corre in toilette, si spoglia, si accorge di aver messo la maglia di Normalman al contrario, se la toglie, la mette dalla parte giusta, ha qualche difficolt&#224; con la lampo dello stivaletto, visto che c'&#232; ne approfitta per fare pipi e con la sua normal velocit&#224; in meno di 4 minuti si transforma in Normalman. Intanto la vecchina si sta rivolgendo alla cassiera.
&quot;Mi scusi pu&#242; chiamarmi un commesso per favore.&quot;
&quot;Che ne so? C'era Franco prima. Mo' non lo vedo. FRRANCO! E non risponde, non so che dirle.&quot;
&quot;Serve aiuto, signora?&quot; 
&quot;Uh-huh. Ma tu sei Normalman.&quot;
&quot;In carne ed ossa. Cosa posso fare per lei?&quot;
&quot;Devo prendere un detersivo ma &#232; su uno scaffale troppo in alto. Non ci arrivo.&quot; 
&quot;Mi ci porti. Con la mia normal altezza dovrei arrivarci.&quot; 
La vecchina conduce Normalman nel reparto detersivi.
&quot;Ecco. Devo prendere una confezione di SbianX ma vede quanto &#232; alto.&quot;
&quot;Dannazione!  La mia normal altezza non basta. Non ci arrivo neanch'io. Un momento, potrei usare uno sgabello.&quot;
Normalman si dirige dalla cassiera.
&quot;Scusi, ha uno sgabello?&quot;
&quot;Che ne so? C'era Franco prima. Mo' non lo vedo.  FRRANCO! E non risponde, non so che dirle.&quot;
&quot;La mia normal intelligenza mi dice che se mi faccio aiutare da un uomo alto posso risolvere il problema.&quot;
Proprio in quel momento passa il ragionier Guidotti. Un uomo alto un metro e novantadue. 
&quot;Mi scusi potrebbe prendere quella confezione di SbiancX lass&#249; che io non ci arrivo.&quot;
&quot;Ma certamente. Ecco fatto.&quot; 
&quot;Lo dia direttamente a questa signora.&quot;
&quot;Grazie signore e grazie a te Normalman.&quot;
&quot;Non mi ringrazi, sono un supereroe e faccio solo il mio dovere. Addio.&quot;
&quot;Addio Normalman.&quot;
Li dove c'&#232; un problema di tutti i giorni. Li dove necessit&#224; un piccolo aiuto. Li c'&#232; Normalman.

Ma esister&#224; davvero? Per molti si tratta dell&#8217;ennesima leggenda metropolitana, altri dicono che sia un inferno in Terra, un luogo segreto per esperimenti misteriosi o un centro di tortura gestito dallo Stato.

Anzi no, non &#232; proprio cos&#236;&#8230; Uno c&#8217;&#232; che pu&#242; raccontare come stanno davvero le cose a Necropolis: si chiama Dylan Dog. Ma ci sar&#224; un altro disposto a credergli?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Welcome to Necropolis. But does it really exist? For many, it's just one more case of the legends that spring up in the urban jungle, while others say it's a hell on Earth, a secret place for mysterious experiments or a torture centre run by the State. No-one can say, because no-one gets out alive from Necropolis. Oh, wait, no that's not quite true... there actually is one person who can tell you what things are really like in Necropolis: his name is Dylan Dog.

      <title>From Fumetti to Film</title>

I hope you've enjoyed the information I've presented and it has deepened your appreciation of the uniquely Italian genre known as fumetti.  Here's a wonderful documentary about Italian film maker Mario Bava and his film Danger: Diabolik.  It's quite&#160; well done and informative.  As you know from previous podcasts, Danger: Diabolik is a film adaption of the Diabolik fumetti.  For the most part the documentary narration is by Stephen R. Bissette who has been a professional cartoonist for twenty years.  He is best known for his award-winning collaboration with writer Alan Moore and inker John Totleben on DC Comics' Saga of the Swamp Thing from 1983-87.    The documentary is apprximately 20 minutes.  Buon divertimento!</description>

      <title>Decima e ultima puntata: Ombre nella Notte</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1066473/600x600_701679.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 10th and final episode of Ombre nella Notte.  The entire transcript is available on http://fumetti.podomatic.com.  

What happened in the prior episode?  Sammy is leading Tex and his partners down into a stinking hole where they'll find the hidden cages and the werewolf creatures.  Sammy says Valance and Kaiva would take the creatues out of the cages and put them in a specially constructed wagon to transport them to commit their next crime.  The creatures were trained to attack wagons transporting valuables.  Valance and Kaiva were getting rich. Sammy says the creatures were the result of Dr Stevens experiments. Valance told Dr Stevens that he would destroy the creatures but he actually kept them in these hidden cages.  The room is dark and Sammy tries to get closer to the creature so he can be seen.  Sammy gets too close and the creature attacks Sammy, breaks his neck, and kills him.  It happened so quick that Tex wasn't able to prevent it.

The group now goes to confront Dr Stevens with the facts they've learned. Alfred retrieves Dr Stevens.  Tex confronts him with the truth about what Valance and Kaiva have been doing with these creatures.  Dr Stevens is shocked about what happened. Stevens explains that he was trying to do something for the good of mankind and he felt he had a noble purpose for his experiments.  He's sorry that some Indians were sacrificed but it was for the good of all mankind.

Dr Stevens goes into convulsions.  He calls for the help of Dr Ferguson and thus it is revealed that Dr Ferguson is also there and he has been trying to find a way to cure the damage done by Dr Ferguson including what Dr Ferguson has done to himself.  Tex and his partners are forced to leave the room while Dr Ferguson tries to treat Dr Stevens.  From outside the room they listen to what sounds like a struggle between Dr Ferguson and Dr Stevens.  Tex has heard enough and decides he has to go back in the room in order to make sure Dr Ferguson is safe.

Will Dr Ferguson find the cure for these sick creatures?  Find out in the final episode.

What happened in episode number 8? Thomas and Tex were on their way to Dr Fergusons house with the bodies of Kaiva and a monster.  Thomas wonders how the Doctor and the others will react. Thomas is afraid of finding out that Dr Ferguson is involved in this because he has known him for a long time and as a child he admired the doctor.

All the sudden Tex and Thomas receive gunfire.  Tex and Thomas try to use their horses as cover.  Valance is determined to kill them but Kit Carson hears the shots and he arrives just in time to take out Valance.

Tex and his group are all together again. They'll take the bodies to Dr Stevens house and once they arrive at Dr Stevens house many mysteries will be resolved.

A short time later they arrive at Dr Stevens.  They show the bodies to the guy who works in the stables and at first he pretends to not have any 
knowledge of the things that Tex describes but Tex is determined to get the truth out of the guy.  He punches him and threatens him with a game of russian roulet.  The guy starts telling the truth about what happened. There's a flash back to Valance and Kaiva as they discuss how they can get rich by training these creatures to commit crimes.

It turns our that Dr Stevens created about 10 of these creatures and Valance tried to keep them all alive in hidden cages.  Some of them have been killed over the last several months.  Tex asks how many remain in the cages?  Only the last two remain in their cages.  Tex wants him to lead the group to the cages so they can take a closer look at the creatures.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1066473/600x600_701682.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the eight of 10 episodes of &quot;Ombre nella Notte&quot;.  What happened in the prior episode?  Tex and Thomas Ferguson recover from the vicious attack and they recognize the attackers as Valance, Kaiva and two creatures that seems to be half ape and half man. They speculate that the attack happened because they're getting too close to the truth. They also think there's a possibility the monsters are somehow related to the work of Dr.Stevens.  This might help explain the concerns Dr Ferguson has with the work of Dr Stevens. They hide the bodies in a cave so they can recover them later.  Tex asks Thomas how his wounded arm is doing.  Tex says Thomas shouldn't travel but Thomas decides to continue on with Tex to the indian village.

They arrive at the indian village where Tex is welcomed as a brother.  Towaka treats the wounded arm of Thomas.  They discuss Dr Stevens. The indians think the doctor is evil  and Tex asks why.  Towaka explains that he has read bones that sent a clear message that Dr Stevens is evil.  The indians have also had experience with the horrible creatures with hair and teeth like a wild animal. Tex Willer tells them he has seen the same creatures the prior night.  The creatures attacked but he was able to kill them and then he put the bodies in a cave so he could recover them later.  The indians want to help Tex and they'll go with Tex to take a look at the bodies of the creatures.

The action shifts to Dr.Stevens house and we hear a discussion between the doctors.  We understand from the discussion that Dr. Ferguson has been imprisoned in the house in order to help Dr Stevens with his work. Ferguson condeems the work of Stevens.  Dr Stevens explains that he's trying to seperate the good from evil in mankind so that he can re-create human beings that will be entirely good. But so far Stevens has only suceeded in isolating the evil part of human beings.  Stevens has been a dismal failure.

In the prior episode Tex and his companions are on their way out of Dr Ferguson's house. Tex is sure they'll get important information from the indians. Thomas is very disillusioned because their visit to Dr Ferguson didn't help clear up any of the mystery of his Father's disappearance.

Leo Valance and Kaiva meet the group on their way to the horse stalls.  Valance manages the horse stalls and Kaiva is his helper. Tex asks Valance if knows anything about what happened to Dr Ferguson. Valance says he heard about the disappearance and suggests Mexican bandits were probably involved. Tex speculates that the storehouses and stalls would be a good place for a bandit to hide things. Valance is incredulous because he thinks Tex is suggesting that he was involved in the disappearance.  Tex says it wasn't his intention. Tex also asks Valance for directions to the indian villages. Valance gives directions after retrieving the horses.  There are two paths to the indian villages. One path is long and winding while the other is very steep along the edge of cliffs.

The group gets on the trail and breaks up into two parts when the two trails diverge. Tex and Thomas will take the long trail while the others take the steep trail.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1066473/600x600_701684.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the sixth of 10 episodes of &quot;Ombre nella Notte&quot;. Tex and his partners are about to depart the house of Dr.Stevens. 

What happened in the prior episode?  The group was again on the trail to the house of Dr Stevens and they're talking about what might have happened to Dr Ferguson.  Carson asked Tex if he believed Fernandez (the guy who rented the horse and buggy to Dr Ferguson) when he said he never went to see what happened to the Dr. Ferguson? Tex said he believed it because Fernandez was probably too scared to visit the house. Thomas wondered if his Father could have gone off the trail without someone seeing him? Tex says &quot;no&quot; because the trail is too busy with servants commuting between Dr Ferguson's house and Tubac for food and supplies.  Somebody would have seen him.  Some of the cliffs along the trail have a really steep drop off. Thomas speculates that maybe his Father went over the edge.  Tex says he doesn't see any wreckage below and he thinks it's a waste of time to look down there.

The group arrives at the house of Dr Stevens.  The house was built directly under the mesa just as they've heard people say.  Dr.Ferguson sees them arriving, he calls his faithful servant Alfred and they formulate a plan. They plan to tell Thomas that Dr.Ferguson isn't feeling well and can't visit with them for very long. They'll also invite the group to stay with them in the house.  They realize they're running a risk but it's necessary because they don't want to raise too much suspician.

The big door in the wall at the boundary of the property opens and Tex and his pards are welcomed inside. Kaiva and Valance take their horses to the stalls. Valance and Kaiva talk about how dangerous the group is for their plans.  They plan to keep an eye on the gringos.

Tex wonders if somebody gave advance word of their arrival.  They weren't expecting to be welcomed into the compound. When Alfred arrives he asks Thomas about his father, Dr Ferguson. Thomas is shocked by the question because he was thinking his father was at the house. Alfred goes to get Dr. Stevens while the group waits in the living room of the huge and elegant house.  While waiting they speculate on what might have happened to Dr Ferguson. Could some criminal gangs have gotten him? 

Dr. Ferguson arrives. There are introductions. They ask the Doctor what might have happened to the Dr.Ferguson.  Dr.Stevens lets them know his relationship with Dr.Ferguson has been strained recently and he hasn't been well informed.  They mention that the hotel keeper and Fernandez remembered Dr.Ferguson well.  Could some bandits have made him disappear? Or could it have been indians? Dr Stevens says bandits are more likely than indians.  Regardless, Tex wants to visit with the indians.  Dr. Stevens says there are two indian villages that are fairly close by. Dr Stevens annouces that he's tired and needs to rest but he invites the group to stay with him as his guests.

Instead, Tex and his partners intend to get right back on the trail to visit the indian villages.

      <itunes:summary>This is the sixth of 10 episodes of &quot;Ombre nella Notte&quot;. Tex and his partners are about to depart the house of Dr.Stevens. 

What happened in the prior episode?  The group was again on the trail to the house of Dr Stevens and they're talking about what might have happened to Dr Ferguson.  Carson asked Tex if he believed Fernandez (the guy who rented the horse and buggy to Dr Ferguson) when he said he never went to see what happened to the Dr. Ferguson? Tex said he believed it because Fernandez was probably too scared to visit the house. Thomas wondered if his Father could have gone off the trail without someone seeing him? Tex says &quot;no&quot; because the trail is too busy with servants commuting between Dr Ferguson's house and Tubac for food and supplies.  Somebody would have seen him.  Some of the cliffs along the trail have a really steep drop off. Thomas speculates that maybe his Father went over the edge.  Tex says he doesn't see any wreckage below and he thinks it's a waste of time to look down there.

The group arrives at the house of Dr Stevens.  The house was built directly under the mesa just as they've heard people say.  Dr.Ferguson sees them arriving, he calls his faithful servant Alfred and they formulate a plan. They plan to tell Thomas that Dr.Ferguson isn't feeling well and can't visit with them for very long. They'll also invite the group to stay with them in the house.  They realize they're running a risk but it's necessary because they don't want to raise too much suspician.

The big door in the wall at the boundary of the property opens and Tex and his pards are welcomed inside. Kaiva and Valance take their horses to the stalls. Valance and Kaiva talk about how dangerous the group is for their plans.  They plan to keep an eye on the gringos.

Tex wonders if somebody gave advance word of their arrival.  They weren't expecting to be welcomed into the compound. When Alfred arrives he asks Thomas about his father, Dr Ferguson. Thomas is shocked by the question because he was thinking his father was at the house. Alfred goes to get Dr. Stevens while the group waits in the living room of the huge and elegant house.  While waiting they speculate on what might have happened to Dr Ferguson. Could some criminal gangs have gotten him? 

Dr. Ferguson arrives. There are introductions. They ask the Doctor what might have happened to the Dr.Ferguson.  Dr.Stevens lets them know his relationship with Dr.Ferguson has been strained recently and he hasn't been well informed.  They mention that the hotel keeper and Fernandez remembered Dr.Ferguson well.  Could some bandits have made him disappear? Or could it have been indians? Dr Stevens says bandits are more likely than indians.  Regardless, Tex wants to visit with the indians.  Dr. Stevens says there are two indian villages that are fairly close by. Dr Stevens annouces that he's tired and needs to rest but he invites the group to stay with him as his guests.

What happened in the prior episode?  Tex and his companions arrived in Tubac to visit the Sheriff.  The Sheriff gave the background on recent strange events.  These things started happening after the arrival of Dr Stevens and people look forward to the day when the Doctor leaves.  Tex told the Sheriff what happened with the silver wagon driver and his escort.  Tex and his group leave Tubac to visit the hotel keeper and the guy who rented the horse and carriage to Dr Ferguson.  Tex doesn't learn much from these guys that he hasn't already heard.  Soon they'll arrive at Dr Stevens house.

      <title>Quarta puntata: Ombre nella Notte</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1066473/600x600_701689.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the fourth of 10 episodes of &quot;Ombre nella Notte&quot;. It starts with Tex and his partners on their way to visit the Sheriff of Tubac. They're pulling a dead body on a stretcher with them. It's the body belonging to the escort for the wagon driver (Chavez).  

What happened in the prior episode?   A couple of bad guys are watching Tex and his amigos through binoculars. The bad guys fear the rangers and they decide to call off their pursuit of the wagon loaded with silver.  Instead, they backtrack to the scene of the ambush in order to get rid of the bodies of &quot;Yagos and Yamos&quot; before the bodies are discovered by Tex.  Obviously these guys were involved the event that caused the wagon driver to take off like a crazy man.

Tex and his group of amici still don't know what happened to cause the wagon driver to act so crazy.  They notice his wagon is pulling a load of silver and they wonder if maybe the driver thought they were robbers. Tex splashes water from his canteen (borraccia) into the face of the wagon driver and he wakes up. Tex interrogates the driver and hears a very strange story.  The driver was afraid of monsters!? The driver says he and his escort were attacked by two monsters as they were preparing a wagon loaded with silver.  The driver says he saw a monster kill his escort and he fired repeated shots at the two monsters before taking off like a bat out of hell. The driver suggests that if Tex wants proof he can go back up the trail to the place where the attack happened.  Tex thinks it a great idea because they need to see this for themselves. The driver is still scared and doesn't want to remain alone while Tex and his partners are gone. Kit Carson remains with the driver while Tex, Kit Willer, Tiger Jack and Thomas Ferguson return to the bloody scene.  

Tex and friends arrive at the place described by the wagon driver but they only find the body of the escort which has been ripped up by what must have been a monster because no human could destroy a body in this way -- but no dead monsters.  The mystery thickens.  The body is put on a stretcher and they return to meet Carson and the wagon driver.

We flash to a person who has morphed from monster to human. The person we hear realizes that he has been a monster and he must have killled again because his hands are bloody.  The person is sobbing because he has no control over the evil monster within himself.  

Carson is still trying to make the wagon driver feel better when Tex and his amigos gallop back to meet them.  The group tells Kit Carson and the wagon driver what they saw at the bloody scene of the ambush. On their trip back they've put the clues togther and figured out that the monsters were carried away from the crime scene by men on horses.  Could there be some connection between these monsters and the disappearance of Dr.Ferguson?  We don't know but we're sure to find out.

Tex and his parters get back on the trail to Tubac and they intend to visit the Sheriff as soon as they get there.

What happened in the last episode?  Episode 2 started in an indian village where the indian chief, Cavallo Zoppo, was discussing recents events with the medicine man, Towaka.  The wolfman creature came during the night and took away Azeema.  The indians decided to chase down the beast and Tonito, the fiance of Azeema, swore revenge but his attempt fails and he was killed by the beast.  The indians returned to their village with the body of Tonito.  

Meanwhile Tex and his partners were on the trail to Tubac when they heard shots and they saw a carriage being driven like crazy.  The driver was acting as if was being chased by the devil himself.  They chased down the driver so that he wouldn't harm himself and they also wanted to find out what caused him to be so scared.

At the beginning of the third episode we find out that Tex and his partners are being spied on by a couple of Dr. Stevens' hired hands, Valance and Kaiva. As Tex is about to interogate the carriage driver Valance and Kaiva slip away to get rid of the bodies of their two &quot;wolfman&quot; criminal accomplices.

Quickly it became clear that Dr. Stevens is not well liked because strange things started happening after his arrival in the area. Nobody will escort Dr Ferguson to Dr Stevens house. Ferguson was told to rent a horse and buggy and make his way there on his own. 

We also heard someone (maybe Dr Stevens?) morph into a werewolf creature.  

Some months later Dr Ferguson's son (Thomas) hasn't heard from his father, gets worried, and seeks help from Tex Willer to track down what has happened to his father.
