<title>Digging to Indochina with Connie Biewald</title>
<link>http://service.rssvp.com/mason/rssvp/article.html?id=4773374</link>
<description>Author Connie Biewald talks about her book Digging to Indochina and her career as a writer.

Seventeen-year-old Ivy MacKenzie is consumed by bitterness over the tragic death of her Vietnam veteran father. Desperate to break free of a family that doesn&#x27;t understand her and a small town that suffocates her, Ivy runs away with Gil Thompson&#x26;#151;a stranger who shows her a passion she&#x27;s never known and a violent danger she never saw coming. Ivy&#x27;s younger brother Bryan has a tender heart, conflicting memories, and a fierce loyalty to his family. Their disengaged, high-strung mother Carol parents as best she knows how while coping with her own lingering heartbreak and entering into a new relationship.

Though their voices and struggles are their own, each of the MacKenzies grapples with loss and disappointment and yearns for love and belonging. Together, they come of age and come to terms with the ways that memories and dreams can blur reality; they learn what it means to embrace family, flaws and all; and they discover how digging to Indochina can help them find their way home.

<title>How To Raise Kids Who Won&#x27;t Hate You</title>
<link>http://service.rssvp.com/mason/rssvp/article.html?id=2830573</link>
<description>Life Enhancement expert Allan Hunkin interviews Alan Thicke on his book How to Raise Kids Who Won&#x27;t Hate You.

If you&#x27;re a parent experiencing the many challenges of bringing up a decent child in today&#x27;s world, you&#x27;re sure to enjoy Alan Thicke&#x27;s hilariously true observations in How to Raise Kids Who Won&#x27;t Hate You.

Let&#x27;s face it&#x26;#151;kids have hated their parents since the beginning of time. The goal is to minimize the tension and find the happy ending. Is it possible to raise a child who doesn&#x27;t blame you for everything? According to author, actor, and father Alan Thicke, the answer is a resounding &#x22;maybe!&#x22;

With chapters like &#x22;Honey, I Screwed Up the Kids!,&#x22; &#x22;Why Does Daddy Throw Like a Girl?&#x22; and &#x22;When Grownups Go Bad,&#x22; How to Raise Kids Who Won&#x27;t Hate You will take you on a wild ride. You&#x27;ll laugh out loud at Thicke&#x27;s twist on everything from homework to the prom, and find answers to questions like &#x22;Are my children playing the right games with the right kids at the right schools? How will I handle her first swear word and his first dead pet&#x26;#151;or his first fight and her first unrequited crush? Are we being good enough friends and tough enough parents?&#x22;</description>
