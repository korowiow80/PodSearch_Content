<title>Fuel for the Race of Life with Dean Karnazes</title>
<link>http://service.rssvp.com/mason/rssvp/article.html?id=4539951</link>
<description>What does it take in food, training and conditioning to 350 continuous miles, foregoing sleep for three nights? What does it take to run accros Death Valley in 126 degree temperatures, and run a marathon to the South Pole in negative 40 degrees. What kind of body does one need to have to swim across the San Francisco Bay, scale Half Dome in Yosemite and mountain-bike for 24-hours straight.? Dean Karnazes knows. He has done all this and more.

Men&#x27;s Fitness Magazine says &#x22;Dean Karnazes might just be the fittest man in the world!&#x22; 

On seven different occasions, he&#x27;s run a 200-mile relay race solo, racing alongside teams of twelve. Dean is a Ten-time Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run Silver Buckle winner, has competed across the globe, and is the 2004 Badwater Ultramarathon champion, considered: &#x27;The World&#x27;s Toughest Footrace.&#x27;  

We talk with Dean about these extrodinary accomplishments and how he fuels his body and mind to do what he does. Dean is sponsored in part by Nature&#x27;s Path Foods and he consumes Nature&#x27;s Path foods for energy.

We talk with Charles Tremewen, Andrew Weil, Dr. Brian Becker and Adam Edinger about hemp and why it is such a terrific food plus the latest on regulations regarding hemp.
