 <description>Film review: Moon (2009).

Sam (Rockwell) works for an energy company and has been working alone on the moon for 3 years with only a robot named GERTY (excellently voiced by Kevin Spacey) for company.

Shot in just 33 days in the UK, British director Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie, makes his feature length directorial debut with this sci-fi drama which only cost $5m to produce what looks like a big budget Hollywood movie. 

Moon is out now on DVD.</description>

 <description>We discussed the three best film collaborations between the actor Kurt Russell and legendary filmmaker John Carpenter. The three films consist of:

• Escape From New York (1981)

Cited by Kurt Russell as his favourite movie of his career, he plays Snake Plissken in this post-apocalyptic thriller about a renegade soldier hired to rescue the President of the US from New York, which has become a sealed off prison. 

• The Thing (1982)

This sci-fi horror classic set in the Arctic, follows a group of government researchers who stumble upon a shape shifting alien life form with terrifying consequences. With groundbreaking special effects, The Thing remains to be one of the scariest sci-fi films of all time.  

• Big Trouble in Little China (1986)

Kurt Russell stars in this supernatural kung fu comedy as Jack Burton, a long distance truck driver who aids his friend in rescuing his fiancé from the clutches of an evil Chinese wizard. A complete contrast to the previous two Carpenter/Russell collaborations discussed, this hilarious film has a superb script and riveting action sequences.

 <description>* Gym douchebags and the things they do to earn their douchebag status.

* The 1998 sci-fi Dark City, by Alex Proyas, director of The Crow and I, Robot. Starring Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Jennifer Connolly, Kiefer Sutherland and Richard O’Brien, Dark City was underrated at the time of its release but has built a cult following over the years.

* The influence of Dark City on The Matrix and the many connections between the two movies.

* Why the 2002 cult classic Equilibrium was not a knock off of The Matrix but a great sci-fi in its own right.

* The 1991 TV show Eerie, Indiana created by Joe Dante, director Gremlins and Small Soldiers. Considered to be the Twin Peaks equivalent for young audiences, this cult TV show about weird occurrences in small town America was one of a kind.
