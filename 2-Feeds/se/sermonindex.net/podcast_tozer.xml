			<title>The Fear Of The Lord - Malachi&apos;s Resurgence by David Ravenhill</title>
			<itunes:author>SermonIndex.net</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Here we are confronted by one of America’s foremost, modern, “prophets” as he deals with several of church’s most fundamental truths: the fear of God, and the Holy Spirit—and we find his message greeted largely with silence. He crosses all denominational lines, and spares no one. Yet, when he is finished, and we look at ourselves and the North American church one cannot but wonder what will become of us if, as the brother points out, the church doesn’t get its act together. Can we really hope to survive, as a nation and as a people, if we continue to prefer our denominational dogmas, in the place of Scripture? The ramifications of this sermon are devastating.]]></description>

How this must break the heart of God! The Lord doesn’t judge with any delight in His heart but He looks down on what was supposed to be His heritage and says I can't let this go on any longer! He absolutely will not let His people pursue a path that will lead to hell. God is calling His church to return to Him and allow Him to take away all the iniquity in us that would keep His life from flowing through His Body. When we get right with God the storms will come but His church will stand with His Glory upon us. The testimony of the true church of Christ will not be shaken!]]></description>

This message suggests that God ALWAYS asks too much and it is never God's design or desire that we should ever be in a place where we think that what God is requiring is something that we can bring about in our own strength or by our own power. When God first speaks His promises to us there is strong expectancy for the fulfillment of that promise. But as time passes on and we are still waiting the possible begins to seem impossible. It is in these times of delay that our flesh will begin to think that we can make things happen in our own time and our own way. God in His mercy will bring us through the refiner's fire so we can let go of all that we think we are and what we think we are supposed to do. He will refine our gifts and our calling until He has complete ownership and lordship over them.]]></description>

			<title>The Beauty of Nothing by Richard Wurmbrand</title>
			<itunes:author>SermonIndex.net</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Pastor Wurmbrand shares his experiences in jail for 14 years by the communists. He shares a specific facet of his testimony which was the nothingness they were faced with in jail. No bibles, No fellowship, No communion, No sound. But admist this all the Lord Jesus Christ revealed himself to the prisoners and allowed them to experience him and even take communion. This message will stir you out of apathy and grumbling over our little issues in life that are nothing in comparision with what this brother went through. May this message show us the needs to pray and support the persecuted church. "It is a shame to be a luke-warm Christian".]]></description>
