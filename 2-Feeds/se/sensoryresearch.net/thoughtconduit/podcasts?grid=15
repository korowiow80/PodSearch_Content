				Smothered in secret sauce and served with a nice Chianti, this is the second of two parts of 'Pets or Meat' a collage show about animals and food. Abstract mash-ups of various songs, some collage pieces by NCN, comedy, Ronald's Cracklin' Burgers, and novelty song clips. Also includes an extended clip from Negativland's Over the Edge show 'Eat This!' featuring Phineas Narco, Das from BCO, Don Joyce of Negativland and Otis Fodder from the Bran Flakes. Program takes a detour into the realms of politics and religion. Just over an hour, and at 128kbps, this is a nice companion piece to Part 1! :)

				Part 1 of 2: Sort of a collage *slash* audio mini biodoc which seeks to take a very subjective view on the life, music and influences of Freddie Mercury of the legendary British rock group, Queen. The story is augmented with mods, mashups, remixes, deconstructions, effects, etc. of Queen's music for commentary and artistically interpretive purposes. More narrative in its structure than usual Plundercasts, this program examines Mercury's life from his childhood in Zanzibar, to the start of his career as an iconic rock star in the U.S. to his tragic death from AIDS in late 1991. Part 1 brings us up to his 6 year common law marriage with his female sweetheart Mary Austin, whom he lived with for 6 years. This is a very heartfelt celebration of a man whom I never met but greatly admire and love, as did millions of others all over the world. His music shall live on. 128kbps and 79 min. long. To be Continued in Part 2.

				Part 2 of 2: Continuation of personal high water mark for NCN on Plundercast (IMHO). The second half of this two part show musically represents with collage and montage musical moments throughout Mercury's career as legendary Queen frontman. Many mashups in here with a nice sprinkling of clips from  The Kleptones' 'A Night at the Hip-Hopera' as well as original deconstructions. Perhaps Queen's most famous song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' has a treatment in here too without actually being played like you're so used to hearing it (sorry Wayne and Garth). Concludes in the last 20 minutes or so with rememberances of who he was and how he tragically died. Prepare to cry! 79 minutes 128kbps.

				A video collage for our audio collage featuring at least a dozen different versions of The Beatles' &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; in the audio portion alone.

The concept, as it came out, is what goes through a Beatles' fans head in the moment she gasps with delight while watching from the audience of The Ed Sullivan Show. Caught in a momentary time warp, she has a psychedelic vision of the future.

			<description>
				A video collage for our audio collage featuring at least a dozen different versions of The Beatles' "I Am the Walrus" in the audio portion alone.

The concept, as it came out, is what goes through a Beatles' fans head in the moment she gasps with delight while watching from the audience of The Ed Sullivan Show. Caught in a momentary time warp, she has a psychedelic vision of the future.

Special appearance by J.R. "Bob" Dobbs of the Church of the Subgenius.

				A music collage video about madness. This is a syntopical commentary, and expansive deconstruction of Billy Joel's song 'You May Be Right' (I May Be Crazy) in regards to Billy Joel's bipolar condition.

Leitmotifs include: Bipolar as madness, madness as flight, the flight and fall of Icarus in Greek Mythology, madness as entertainment as evidenced through various cinematic psychopathic villains represented herein. Madness as escape. Madness as creativity, madness as destruction. Madness as strength. Madness ultimately as source, and the choice, of positive celebration.

(Trivia Note - Phinny is actually singing the vocals on the audio track of this video, not Billy Joel).

We also hear from ECC, The Cranial Fishers, Voicedude, Sam Flanagan and more. 3 hours! In .mov format with AAC and with chapter search if played with Quicktime. (Some material NSFW)

Where we have been, where we are going, crime as entertainment and distraction, the psychological effects of violence in media. It is based on a radio show originally mixed in the mid-nineties, live on KPFA, by Phineas Narco and Don Joyce (of Negativland) on Negativland's show 'Over the Edge'. Portions of that show have been used for this program which has been post-produced, remixed, re-mastered and re-cut in 2009 for www.plundercast.net.

All material in this program is fragmentary, re-worked, and used fairly for the purpose of criticism and commentary of said material as expressed through its uniquely subjective, re-contextualized, and syntopical arrangement.

All material in this program is fragmentary, re-worked, and used fairly for the purpose of criticism and commentary of said material as expressed through its uniquely subjective, re-contextualized, and syntopical arrangement. Made with Much Love! Please don't sue us. Presented in audio-only .mov format with AAC processing. 79 min. NSFW!

				This program is the Director's Cut for Part 1 of the 'Really Normal and Everything' trilogy. It follows a somewhat non-linear psychedelic storyline with various leitmotif's running through. Synopsis: Ronald Redball is half-asleep at one of his Cracklin' Burger restaurants dreaming vague dreams of teenagers having parties without him. Redball has somehow lost the memories of his earlier life and is confronted by his old friend John (Mr. Chemistry Homework portrayed by found sound artist 'Wobbly'). Using a special helmet of Mr. Homework's own design, Ronald's memories are restored as dissociated dreams, memories, hallucinations, and cognitive pre-impressions flood Redball's fragile psyche. Presented here as a 79 min. audio-only .mov file with AAC processing and index search. Continued in Part 2. NSFW!!

				This is about the top 3 NCN personal musical 'idols' namely Trent Reznor, Roger Waters and Frank Zappa. The holy trinity, in other words. Excerpts of NIN remixes make up the glue of the program which muses (in regular intense stream of consciousness fashion) about what it means to live an artistic life, it's trappings, joys and challenges. The program has a backdrop of melancholy, with bright musical bursts of darkly energetic inspiration in the foreground,  sometimes humorous, sometimes a complete digression from the dominant theme and then back again. This is the Director's Cut of the program, around 79 minutes long, in a single 128kbps V0 mp3. Includes the 'singles' 'Overreacting' (a Narco cover of a very cool song originally by the band 'Brad Sucks') and 'Cynical Girl', also sung by Narco, parodying Neil Young, dinBOT, and some rare Subgenius Show material. See links for this podcast for more information.

				Part 1 of 2. This program was broadcast live on KPFA at 12am on 4/24/10 in Berkeley, California on the Negativland show 'Over the Edge'. The original cut was 3 hours, but the performance has been adapted for Needle in the Red by Phineas Narco, and edited down to fit on two cd-r's (about 160 min. total) in two parts. Some post-production work and editing has been done on this show but almost all of what you hear is as it came out at the time. Participants were Phineas Narco of National Cynical Network, Wobbly, TradeMark G of ECC (Evolution Control Committee) and Don Joyce of Negativland. Sources were much and various from The Beatles and material related to The Beatles. This project is based on The Beatlerape album by Big City Orchestra. The first section of this show (about 30 minutes in this edit) is the same set we did at the Big City Orchestra 30th Anniversary Show at Cafe DuNord earlier in 2010.

				Part 1 of 2 of a collage Show on mental illness subtitled 'Deconstructing Madness'. Originally broadcast July 1st, 2007, this program is at the date of posting, the most popular program on the NCN site. It has been re-edited, remixed and re-mastered for 2010. Includes NCN's 'Self-Conscious Guy', a really nice NIN remix of 'Violent Heart', 'On My Meds Again', 'Jerky Turnstiles', and a song by 'Pocketful of Songs' called 'Prognosis' as well as the long collage for 'ADHD' by NCN and a radio adaptation for 'Passion of the Christ'. Some portions of this program appear in other programs by The National Cynical Network, others are exclusive to this episode. This version is generally not safe for radio play unless perhaps played in Safe Harbor hours. Some pieces appear on the newly released 'Straight Outta Klonopin' available on iTunes and Amazon (see links associated with podcast). Features an appearance by Alexander T. Newport. About 67 minutes in length in 128kbps. Continued in Part 2.

This was originally broadcast on KPFA in March of 1994 on Negativland's radio show 'Over the Edge', and has since been digitally re-mastered. Fidelity is far superior to other versions that are 'out there'. This on-air live party features most of Negativland (The Weatherman, Mark Hosler (by phone in the part 2 of 2 segment), Don Joyce) and most of NCN (Phineas Narco and Ronald Redball) and celebrated the then new release of Over the Edge Vol. 6 - The Willsaphone Stupid Show which presented mixes and collages made up of The Weatherman's actual childhood and family recordings. This segment includes a visit from The Wheel of Fortune, mixes of cd outtakes, and many many probing questions asked of The Weatherman by Narco, Redball, and many callers. 79 min. long in 128kbps mp3 format.

				Originally conceived as a Puzzling Evidence Show tribute, this became partly about Unions, including the huge controversy and uprising in Wisconsin (at the time of it's making) regarding union-busting by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and his cohort David Koch (who is impersonated in a 'gone viral' crank call to Governor Walker by writer of The Buffalo Beast blog). Other portions are some multi-layered talking by Phineas mixed with music and almost all of the 'old Doktor' Subgenius hierarchy in yak tapes from yesteryear and modern-day news about Middle East uprisings. The result sound very Puzzling Evidence type of mix you can zone out on and appreciate as background music or as something to listen to attentively. Basically a gearing up to Phinny's appearance on the KPFA 'Puzzling Evidence Show' in the week after this show was originally aired. Also included are Union Label commercials from the late 70's / early 80's, Louis C.K. asking Donald Rumsfeld if he is a flesh-eating lizard via The Opie and Anthony Show, Radiohead's latest (new) single, some remixes from Old Nerdy Bastard's 'Geeky Music Remixed', George Carlin discussing cynicism and what he hopes for, the trailer for the bogus but brilliant E(x).T. sequel, an 'Another Brick in the Wall' versions medley and a long guided meditation sequence which is new. In 128kbps LAME encoded 3-hour mp3 format.

It is a 'mashup movie', mashing up the visuals of Terminator 2 with Nine Inch Nails songs, of which there are many (see list at end in the program). This might not be up for long, as we may do a special showing in Second Life. There is a DVD with menus and superior sound and video, which we'll send you as a thank-you gift, if you make a donation of over $10. See the donations link at www.nationalcynical.com. Please include a short note saying that you want the NINT2 DVD-R. Enjoy.

This week's show is a mix of mash-ups, songs, remixes, dubstep versions, collages and general variations of music by Eminem mixed with various (mostly) nerdcore pieces by 'Weird Al' Yankovic poking fun at rap music and keeping it more real than the original songs. Lots of material referring to the idea that Eminem is gay (somehow) and material from the new 'Weird Al' album 'Alpocalypse' (recommended!) as well as Yankovic 'interviewing' Eminem. 128kbps LAME encoded, 180 min. with credits read at end.

				Originally broadcast on 7/10/11, this show is all about the psychological phenomenon of boredom. We syntopically explore this universally undesired state of ennui, malaise, doldrums, and 'blues' to find out what causes it, and what if anything should be done about it. It's actually an INTRIGUING SUBJECT found extensively in popular culture (NIN, Otis Redding, Green Day, etc.) as well as psychological and philosophical studies. Re-contextualized examples, samples and effects pour forth in this 3 hour psychedelic collage treatment of the subject. Mental quagmire or a doorway to peace and enlightenment? Includes some material from 'The Joy of Nothing'.

				This is a special 4-hour mix that was made during the height of the debt ceiling crisis in Washington in the Summer of 2011 during the presidency of Barack Obama. It explores the notion of the 'Shock Doctrine' put forth by Naomi Klein in her book by that name and using material made from the documentary based on the book. This is interwoven and augmented by the Adam Curtis documentary 'The Living Dead' about the use of shock treatment in the CIA's involvement with the development of modern-day psychiatry in the late 50's and early 60's. Other pieces, throughout are by NCN, as well as songs by Bob Dylan, Blancmange, Bob Seger, Michael Jackson, George Carlin, Neil Young, Buffalo Springfield, Coldplay, Radiodread, and others throughout. 128kbps LAME encoded mp3. 240 min.

				Recorded on 8.31.11, and broadcast live on DFM, this is originally a 2-hour show all about games. Phinny has done post-production work on it, boiling it down to just under 80 min. The original mix is available, check the link list in the listing associated with this podcast on the NCN site. This was part of UBRadio Salon which is heard on DFM out of Amsterdam each Wednesday at 4pm U.S. Pacific Time. We utilized a number of computers playing (mostly) video game samples and sound effects of games being played (there was a live UNREAL game going on at the time) game show theme music, and of course UNIVAC's 'Adventures in Science' for which he read from a 1981 book about video games. This show was great fun to do and I hope at least as much fun to listen to. The synthesized voices are live text-to-voice contributions via the DFM chatroom at the time.

				This program / show / mix was inspired by the 'Occupy Wall Street' protests in lower Manhattan in the Fall of 2011. It originally was webcast on 10/09/2011, but some modifications have been made since the original webcast. This sprawling and unique collage seeks to capture personal impressions of the event, in all it's aspects. With comparisons to other uprisings, title medleys, remixes, songs and music from the likes of Commodo, The Kleptones, Laurie Anderson, Les Miz, Stone Temple Pilots, Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, Zappa, The Who, Steinski, Daft Punk, and much more! This webcast/stream got at least 20 listeners. Also included are remixes of NIN and dubstep versions of Pink Floyd as well as a bevy of protest songs from years past about much the same issues we face today! Also, commentary by many many protesters, Keith Olbermann, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Moore and others. This is a vibrant, driven mix which is a sister-program to 'Uprisings' which we made in the Spring of 2011. See the links associated with this program in the archives section at the NCN home site at nationalcynical.com for full source and other information. 3 hour mix. 128kbps.

Just in time for the family holidays, a 3-hour mix that was first played on 11/20/11 on Plundercast and DFM about issues that spring up between fathers and their kids and... a situation we can all understand: 'Daddy Issues' (who do we know who doesn't have them? Even daddies!) and a creative mix of instances in popular and not-so-popular culture in which the subject is dealt with and explored. Mutated music clips from the likes of Johnny Cash, Pink Floyd, Cat Stevens, The Nice, Harry Chapin, Linkin Park, Austin Powers, movies like The Great Santini and 'A Boy's Life' and remixed comedy from Kids in the Hall, George Carlin and Mr. Show.
