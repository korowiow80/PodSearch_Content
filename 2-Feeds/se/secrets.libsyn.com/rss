        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[What is your spiritual path like?  Some folks don't think they have one, but we all do.  Why is it that one way of going makes someone miserable while others going the same way seem so happy?

Religion is like underwear: what works well for one person might be totally inappropriate for someone else.

No preaching or "follow my way" here, but a way to find the doors and windows that you might like to peek through in finding your own path.

All spiritual paths are welcome here, although some might not like all of that personal responsibility!]]></itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[In the pages of a well-respected scientific journal is the announcement of a discovery which is getting the attention of some folks I consider to be really mundane:&nbsp; some of the most respected medical institutions in the world are announcing that they have discovered that prayer and meditation can actually have a healing and/or curative effect, even allowing the brain and nervous system to "re-wire" or "re-program" themselves for the benefit of the individual.
WOW!&nbsp; Isn't it wonderful that these people announce what we've known for a few millenia?
Well, the fact is that what we've known all this time is suddenly becoming respectable and beneficial to the same people who would once call it either superstition, outdated, or perhaps a form of mental illness.
And that has some interesting implications for us, including the fact that it means that more people are going to find what we know.&nbsp; 
And we had better be ready for it.&nbsp; It's a major opportunity.
Blessed Be!

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/may-26-2012-memorial-day]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">May 28th is Memorial Day in the United States.&nbsp; If you are living in another country, you probably have a similar day somewhere on your calendar.&nbsp; Actually, it's the 4th Monday in May that's the official holiday in the US, originally it was May 30th.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">It is the day we honor those who died in the service of their country in the armed forces.&nbsp; Originally to honor the fallen Union soldiers in the Civil War (and known as "Decoration Day" back then), it bdecame a day to honor all of the fallen from all wars.&nbsp; And, most folks including myself include honoring those who did come home but who have since crossed over.&nbsp; But the main emphasis is on those who fell in battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some, like me, extend the honoring to all who fell from all countries, inclding those who fell fighting against us.&nbsp; We may have been at war with each other, but we are no longer and in many cases our countries have become good friends.&nbsp; I can honor their courage and their sacrifice, and the heartache of their families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">With the possible exception of those who intended to have a military career, most had their lives interrupted and had plans to return to resume that life once the war was over.&nbsp; But instead, a spouse or parent got a knock on the door with news that their loved one was not coming home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so, let's think about these men and women, some of whom were actually too young to be thought of as men and women until they put on their uniform.&nbsp; And how can we honor them?</span></p>

			<title>April 21, 2012 - Defining Deity</title>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">When I first felt a really strong call to ordained ministry, there were three kinds of people that I felt especially called to serve.&nbsp; There are those who feel&nbsp;spiritually isolated.&nbsp; There are those who feel spiritually abandoned.&nbsp; And then there is everyone else, because there is no telling who the next one will be to feel isolated or abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">It can happen ever-so-many ways and for any number of reasons, but the nastiest of all is when it's because of someone pushing their own agenda at the expense of not only your calling, but your well-being as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so, let's examine this in some depth, and see what it is that happens, and why.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">In this episode, I try to make clear a point that a lot of folks don't get.&nbsp; Then again, there are some folks who simply don't seem to want to get some points.&nbsp; Have you ever had the experience of trying and trying and trying to explain something to someone, and they just don't get it!&nbsp; Where I work in my day job, I've sometimes gotten to the point that I send someone a picture.&nbsp; Then again, sometimes when they are explaining a computer problem to me, I will ask them to send me a picture of their screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Well, with Ostara (under all of its variety of names), this is such a case many times over!&nbsp; And on so many issues, too!&nbsp; And it doesn't matter which spiritual path you're talking about: same questions, same answers waiting to be found.&nbsp; But in the case of certain paths, it appears that some folks are clueless!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Are we given something new, or are we being shown something that has been waiting for us to find?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">A clue can be found in the Wheel Of The Year.&nbsp; We know when the next Sabbat is going to be, and we know when all of the Sabbats are going to be.&nbsp; A promise is made at Samhain, and we watch it being fulfilled.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Perspective, proportion and priority are three principles that seem so basic, yet so many of us have seen how easy it is to lose sense of them.&nbsp; It seems especially true when we're doing something in the name of a large body of people, be it a military organization, a corporation, a church, a political party, or just about anything else of similar size.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Many of us who served in uniform can remember times and places where it seemed that clean barracks and nicely-pressed uniforms were more important than whatever it might take to win in combat.&nbsp; In corporations, you will find people who seem to push change for change's sake.&nbsp; And in some religious groups, you might sometimes see some things going on that really have nothing to do with ministry.&nbsp; And of course, there are the civic and youth organizations which sometimes put so much emphasis on their fund-raiser that there seems to be little time for what they came there for in the first place!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Now, let us understand that none of them started out that way.&nbsp; When George Washington organized what became the United States Army, he was much more interested in winning&nbsp;the Revolutionary War than with the length of his men's sideburns.&nbsp; And every church began because someone saw a need for ministry.&nbsp; So, what happened to them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I'm not sure&nbsp;what the chances are of moving an institution "back on track", but we can try.&nbsp; And, fo course, we can know what to beware of so that what we build does not&nbsp;have too many of such problems.&nbsp; And above all, we can recognize it when we see it!</span></p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/march-10-2012-my-argument-with-christianity-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">This episode will surprise some of you.&nbsp; And others of you were wondering when it was coming!&nbsp; And I felt that it was time to say something on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some folks will say that I threw down a gauntlet tonight.&nbsp; And so mote it be!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Please don't call me Christian!&nbsp; Besides the fact that I am a Wiccan and proud to be one, there is also the basic fact that I have no desire to be confused with the current crop of folks who claim to be Christians, especially those whose political campaign rhetoric includes purporting to be Christian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have no quarrel whatever with Yeshua Bar-Joseph.&nbsp; He, in essence, taught what we teach and he showed more respect for other faiths than many of his contemporaries.&nbsp; In Matthew 8:7-9, there's even a record of a very respectful meeting with someone who, if you believe history, just about had to have been a Mithraist!&nbsp; My issue is the people over the centuries who have claimed to be following him but who don't appear to understand what he actually taught!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">To begin with, and here's something that some politicians don't want to hear, John 18:36 documents him as being an advocate of the separation of church and state!&nbsp; And if he were not, he says what could have - and would have - happened on that original Good Friday!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">There also seems to be a hint of the distinction between following The Divine and following someone standing in for The Divine. (hit: he didn't give Peter the sheep!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Add to that some years of experiencing a Sunday soap opera equal to anything on TV and some political maneuvering beyond anything that the Democrats or Republican ever brewed up, and you've got a guy who started asking more questions than they were comfortable with.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So much can be said, and only one episode!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And, we're moving to new equipment next week!</span></p>

There also seems to be a hint of the distinction between following The Divine and following someone standing in for The Divine. (hit: he didn't give Peter the sheep!)
Add to that some years of experiencing a Sunday soap opera equal to anything on TV and some political maneuvering beyond anything that the Democrats or Republican ever brewed up, and you've got a guy who started asking more questions than they were comfortable with.
So much can be said, and only one episode!
And, we're moving to new equipment next week!
Blessed Be!

			<title>March 3, 2012 - Revisiting A Wiccan Lent!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/march-3-2012-revisiting-a-wiccan-lent-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">I know that this is a subject that we visited some time ago (quite some time, actually), but it seems time to visit it again.&nbsp; There are some good reasons for this.&nbsp; It is the time of Lent on the Christians' calendar, and I know that I'm not the only one whose memories of Lent are basically negative.&nbsp; Lent for so many was a combination of having to give up something you liked and having to do a bunch of stuff you didn't like, and as usual, the form got in the way of the substance.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">How was giving up candy going to help me into heaven?&nbsp; Or was it the other way around?&nbsp; I once knew a girl who thought she could commit suicide by eating meat on Friday.&nbsp; Hey, that's some of the stuff we were taught in those days!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So, if we look to the substance and keep the form in its place, what is it that's actually supposed to be accomplished in Lent?&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Do you know that as Wiccans, we just might already have a good place in our own calendar for something like that?&nbsp; And since we admit to being individuals, it can be as individual as we are, not following a herd. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And I don't mind borrowing on someone else's tradition - especially considering how many of ours have been borrowed on!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">But then, the question: what is it that I really want to do? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Everyone has been angered by someone, and sometimes what other people do causes a lot of hurt.&nbsp; And if I were going to do something, it should accomplish something, right?&nbsp; And most of us can name someone like this, and some of us can name a few people!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">She was also highly intelligent and talented.&nbsp; She wrote poetry, played the flute, and in general showd more depth to herself that most folks would expect in a middle-school girl.&nbsp; Had she lived, she would be entering her mid-twenties today.&nbsp; One can only imagine the young woman she might have become!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Many of us have endured bullying, and perhaps most of us who would find interest in a podcast such as this.&nbsp; It could be said that Tempest Smith was one of so many, but she is also one who represents ever-so-many.&nbsp; A look at the Tempest Smith Foundation web site reveals photographs of many more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so, perhaps we can see her as a patron for those who are the victims of bullying.&nbsp; And if we keep Tempest in mind, we might be able to put an end to bullying. &nbsp;</span></p>

			<title>February 11, 2012 - Honoring Tempest Smith</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/february-11-2012-honoring-tempest-smith]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">February 20th is a day that I and many others set aside as Tempest Smith Day.&nbsp; All three of my podcasts, this one, the video "Uriel's Gifts" and the other video "Church Back Home" will have special rituals in her honor.&nbsp; In fact, she is going to be given a most special honor at that time.&nbsp; And so, I am taking this time to simply talk about her and what her life and death means to all of us - and what it can come to mean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Tempest Kayne Smith died on February 20, 2001.&nbsp; She was twelve years old.&nbsp; She died by her own hand as a result of ceaseless bullying, mostly in her school, and primarily because of her religious choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As I see it, religious bullying is possibly one of the most dangerous things that anyone can do.&nbsp; Especially from a Christian point of view.&nbsp; It amazes me that Christians might resort to religious bullying, because their own scriptures are full of warnings agains that!&nbsp; And I'll give you some examples of their scripture which give a good reason for accepting and respecting other paths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">By all accounts, Tempest Smith was a brilliant young lady.&nbsp; She played the flute, wrote poetry, and a number of other things that young women of her age sometimes haven't given much thought to, at least not yet.&nbsp; Had she survived, she'd be approaching her mid-20's and my guess is that she would be doing something serious in her life, something meaningful. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The consequences of religious bullying go beyond the victim, and fall on the perpetrator.&nbsp; But do you know what I see within the dire warnings against religious bullying?&nbsp; There's a promise of what can be if we learn what we need to learn and apply the lesson!</span></p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/february-2-2012-an-imbolc-celebration-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Imbolc in some places is a Sabbat greeted with a feeling of relief.&nbsp; We've had winter with us for a while, the brightness and merriness of Yule is in the past, and what's been left to many of us is simply cold and perhaps a bunch of snow, too!&nbsp; At Imbolc, we celebrate the first stirrings of spring, with the first shoots of the heartier crops pushing their heads through the snow to be seen!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We were made a promise at Samhain when we celebrated the life of the old year.&nbsp; That promise was re-stated at Yule, as the sun began its return to us.&nbsp; And Imbolc gives us the first tangible evidence that it is actually happening.&nbsp; We have the first actual evidence that spring is actually going to be!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Other paths, including the Christian, have flattered us by adopting our Sabbats, and this one is no exception.&nbsp; However, you sometimes might feel forced to dig deep if you want to learn about more than "Ground Hog Day".&nbsp; But that's OK, there is something very significant - and it gives an extra perspective to help us see the full importance of what Imbolc means!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so, let's celebrate!</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">OK, I begin this with a really, really bad joke.&nbsp; I know it's a bad joke, it's a so-called "blonde joke", and I don't think much of jokes that are based on any kind of stereotyping.&nbsp; But I remembered it, it would not get out of my head, and then I realized that it illustrated a valid point, and a problem we all face at some time.&nbsp; We need to know where to look for something and what to look for.&nbsp; You'll just have to listen to hear what the joke is.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Nowhere is this more important than when we lose someone we love because they crossed over the bridge to the Summerland.&nbsp; We feel alone.&nbsp; We hurt.&nbsp; We miss someone, and it's not like they will ever return in the way we always knew them.&nbsp; And sometimes, we have to deal with feelings of abandonment and even anger.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if the person is a sibling, a spouse, a parent, a grandparent, a lover, a friend, or a pet.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some people will tell you you simply have to wait until it's your turn to cross the bridge, but that does nothing for you now.&nbsp; And, there are those who seem to be able to maintain some sort of connection in spite of it all.&nbsp; Is there something that people like you and I can do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We keep being told that the soul outlives the body and if so, then if they loved us before they would love us now.&nbsp; If we miss them and their company, wouldn't they miss us and ours as well.&nbsp; And might they want to try, too?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So, let's see what seems to have worked, and what we might be able to do!</span></p>

			<title>January 21, 2012 - Seeing It Happen!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/january-21-2012-seeing-it-happen-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">If you ask someone why religion and/or spirituality is important to them or is not important to them, invariably the answer will center on whether itactually works for that person.&nbsp; While it is true that there are some who will go through the motions based on someone "up there" keeping score and passing judgement, for most of us something like religion becomes important if it works.&nbsp; And by that I mean that if it's going to be important to me (or you), then it has to work for me (or you).&nbsp; </span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[If you ask someone why religion and/or spirituality is important to them or is not important to them, invariably the answer will center on whether itactually works for that person.&nbsp; While it is true that there are some who will go through the motions based on someone "up there" keeping score and passing judgement, for most of us something like religion becomes important if it works.&nbsp; And by that I mean that if it's going to be important to me (or you), then it has to work for me (or you).&nbsp; 
There are those who are non-spiritual or anti-spiritual because what they were told simply did not work for them.&nbsp; And, of course, there are those who were close to having a really great spiritual life - until someone with an agenda told them that what they were doing was wrong.&nbsp; And then they made the mistake of believing that instead of their real experience!
And so, it has to work.&nbsp; But, there's a catch!&nbsp; If it's going to work for you, you have to be able to see it working.&nbsp; And for that, you need to know where to look and what to look for.
And, there is a way to help that happen.&nbsp; And we'll discuss that here in detail.&nbsp; It's mostly common sense, but in a direction which many people don't explore.&nbsp; All that and bearing in mind that this is your individual experience, so don't judge yours based on what someone claims is theirs!
And with your inner and outer eyes open, you'll see - indeed!
Blessed Be!

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">There are going to be obstacles in life.&nbsp; The only way to not have to deal with obstacles is to become one of those dull people who lets other people run their lives for them.&nbsp; But then again, if you do that you might face the obstacle of not being able to come up to their expectations as they tell every aspect of how to live your life.&nbsp; And for those who succeed, what do they actually have?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">For the rest of us, especially those who want to see how much we can make out of the spiritual side of our lives, obstacles are a part of life.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are the obstacles that others claim exist for you:&nbsp; Are you smart enough?&nbsp; Are you good enough?&nbsp; Do you think you can actually do the work that's required?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are the obstacles that others force on you.&nbsp; Such as time, money and interruptions.&nbsp; Like there's "almost but not quite enough" money for the practice sessions you need, or the meditation or prayer time that seems to always get interrupted by a "BAM-BAM-BAM" on the door.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Obstacles you make for yourself.&nbsp; Of course, these are almost invariably "replaying the tapes" that someone else made four you long.long ago.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small;">And of course there are some based on genuine reality.&nbsp; Things such as education might require some sort of money, or the fact that society often insists upon credentials.</span></p>

			<title>January 7, 2012 - Making The Most Of A New Beginning!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/january-7-2012-making-the-most-of-a-new-beginning-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">We've been celebrating a number of celebrations lately that concern new beginnings.&nbsp; There was Samhain which was a death but a promise of a new birth.&nbsp; There was Yule as well as the Christians' Christmas which spoke of a birth and a beginning, and of course there's the mundane New Year's Day.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And, we've been talking about new beginnings, particularly in the form of resolutions and how to handle them.&nbsp; But how about taking it a couple of steps further.&nbsp; Just about every one of us has been living with a vision within ourselves, something that we would really, really like to do.&nbsp; And sometimes that vision can be really nagging - the vision of priesthood made a pest of itself until it happened, and now there's a vision of what to do with that priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And almost every one of us has some sort of a vision.&nbsp; So, why cause it to become part of your reality?&nbsp; No kidding, let's see what we can do to make it so!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Like anything else in magick, there are certain "things" which will be needed, but those you can get.&nbsp; Then, there are some other "things" we can do without.&nbsp; We'll get into a little detail on that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But finally, there's seeing the vision take form and come to be.&nbsp; This isn't time for excuses, it's time for doing.&nbsp; But that's fine - there's going to be a wonderful result.&nbsp; You'll see!</span></p>

			<title>December 31, 2011 - Resolution Spells!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/december-31-2011-resolution-spells-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">One thing that Samhain and the mundane New Year's Day have in common is resolutions, things you plan to accomplish in the coming year and beyond.&nbsp; And wouldn't it be nice if they worked?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I've known people to actually joke about their resolutions, and how they "meant well" - kind of like that relative, co-worker or other person you know who perpetually "was gonna" do one thing or another.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Face it - most resolutions are doomed to failure because they lack certain things.&nbsp; They lack reality, they lack effort, they lack follow-through and worst of all, they can't be made to happen in ten minutes.&nbsp; So, what can we do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Perhaps the best thing to do is to approach resolutions with the same attitude and methodology that we do in spells and magick.&nbsp; In fact, we can make them into spells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And what does that mean?&nbsp; Well, the basic contents of a spell you can find in books by Ravenwolf, Cunningham, Buckland, Conway or any of ever-so-many others including this podcast.&nbsp; But let's go beyond that and get into what will actually make the resultion and the resolution spell actually work!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And you can see just how much you can actually bring to be!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Blessed Be!</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">As you listen to this Yule is behind us.&nbsp; And, as most of us are also aware, the Christians' Christmas is either upon us or recently past as you hear this episode.&nbsp; And there are many other traditions which have celebrations at the time of the Winter Solstice, all of which center on a birth or a return, or possibly a re-birth.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">To Pagans, the sun is beginning its return journey.&nbsp; Many Pagan traditions mark the solstice with a celebration of the birth of a divine child.&nbsp; In the same manner as in England the "Queen's Birthday" is the official celebration which is not the day of her actual birth, Christmas as put at December 25th because someone else was said to have been born then.&nbsp; The divine child may or may not be born of a virgin, but the child does grow up into a special relationship with his divine father.&nbsp; And, as an adult, there is something about his death that is for all of our benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And do you know what?&nbsp; It tells us all something very special about The Divine and our relationship with The Divine.&nbsp; And it's something that not only will answer the objections of those who would mess with us, it also gives us a solid foundation for our spiritual lives!&nbsp; And we can count on it!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">In fact, most paths at the time of the Winter Solstice celebrate the time, and for good reason. &nbsp;It was the beginning of the sun's return. &nbsp;There were wintry days ahead, but a promise had been made, and this is its first sign of fulfillment, no matter if it's December in the Northern Hemisphere or June in the Southern Hemisphere. &nbsp;And since I'm in the Nothern Hemisphere, we have this now.</span></p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/december-10-2011-from-before-the-beginning-to-what-we-do]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Going to Before The Beginning and moving forward has been a learning experience, and this time is no exception to that! &nbsp;This time, let's go to Before The Beginning and see how it relates to what we do, especially spiritually and magickally. &nbsp;We've related Before The Beginning to oru spiritual strengths and abilities. &nbsp;We've related it to the rest of the world and the universe as a whole. &nbsp;And so, the next step is to relate it to what we do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">What do we do? &nbsp;Well, anyone who has any kind of spiritual life can generally be counted upon to do (or want to do certain things. &nbsp;We trust someone among The Divine to be there for us. &nbsp;We speak to The Divine. &nbsp;We listen to The Divine, listen for The Divine, and watch for The Divine. &nbsp;And, we use our relationship with The Divine as a way to make things happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And, regardless of the number or name or names of your deities, if you build a good foundation for your spiritual life, you'll find yourself doing that and more.</span></p>

			<title>November 26, 2011 - How Before The Beginning Makes Your Most Powerful Tool!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/november-26-2011-how-before-the-beginning-makes-your-most-powerful-tool-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Let's look again at what we talked about last week, but let's see it this time in terms of our own magickal abilities. &nbsp;In all versions of the Kaballah/Caballah/Qaballah and its parellels from the same time period, everything began with the mind of The Creator. &nbsp;And from there, as The Creator evolved in thought from "I am" to "I am that" to "I am that I am", we progress to the point of the creation stories most of us have been told since our own infancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Now, there are those who would say that the beginning of the beginning being in the mind of The Creator, then perhaps all is thought and we might need to re-evaluate our concept of what reality is. &nbsp;However, I do know that if I am hammering a nail and the hammer hits my thumb instead of the nail, the pain is sufficiently real for my immediate purposes. &nbsp;And therefore I consider such arguments about the physicality of reality to be pretty much moot as far as our current existence and what we need to do about it is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Nevertheless, it allows us to discover (once again, for many of us) the most important magickal tool we have. &nbsp;Or for that matter, our most important tool of any sort. &nbsp;It's what the Witch's Pyramid is there for us. &nbsp;The Creator has a mind which was used to bring about reality, and each of us has a mind. &nbsp;Athames, robes, wands, chalices, candles, and all the rest help to focus and direct, but our mind is not only the only tool necessary, but the tool which all of the other tools need in order for them to have any actual purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so let's look at this and see what we find.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Anyplace where religion and/or spirituality are practiced, people are talking about how nice it would be to have more unity. &nbsp;"Unity" is indeed one of those nice words which clergy and laity of all denominations use at ecumenical luncheons, Clergy Exchange Sunday, or when a couple of groups which don't get along suddenly find themselves on the same side of a dispute. &nbsp;But, can you get someone to define unity? &nbsp;For some, "Unity" means everyone marching in order as a result of some "my way or the highway" approach. &nbsp;Some others, when asked to give a definition, will give a bunch of double-talk to avoid the issue. &nbsp;And some folks are brave enough to admit that they just don't know what unity actually is!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I came across three men from the 20th century who seemed to have a good grasp of what unity is about. &nbsp;All three were priests, but all three were highly experienced in working with people who were committed to other paths. &nbsp;And they had a vision which I celebrate!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And this goes hand-in-hand with something else I've been trying to do. &nbsp;People have needs. &nbsp;And many, many people need healing. &nbsp;And the healing will need to deal with the various spiritual paths that someone is going to travel. &nbsp;And some of this, if brought to a practical level, might sound contradictory, but so what? &nbsp;Much of the more advanced religious experiene is exactly that - mastering the contradictions and, when possible, transform contradictions into syntheses!</span></p>

			<title>October 22, 2011 - Some Healthy Selfishness</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">To some, this will be a major revelation. &nbsp;I know what you and I were taught about selfishness when we were growing up, and it was intended to insure that our lives were hopefully going to be based on something else than greed. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But, there comes a time when it's necessary to recognize that in a balanced and well-moderated life, some selfishness is indeed healthy and in fact necessary for folks like you and me to survive and thrive. &nbsp;Yes, there is indeed a point at which the line-not-to-cross is crossed, and we don't intend to cross that line. &nbsp;We are not talking about taking second helpings at a meal causing someone else to have nothing. &nbsp;But we don't have to be doormats, either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some good, healthy selfishness can indeed be helpful in some of the things we need to do. &nbsp;Do you have a vision for yourself in life? &nbsp;I hope so! &nbsp;Is there a hurt which you would like to heal, or something which was taken from you which you would like to have back? &nbsp;That's the sort of thing we're talking about.</span></p>

			<title>October 15, 2011 - Being The Healed!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/october-15-2011-being-the-healed-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Over the last couple of weeks, I have had some interesting experiences which I hope that I will never have to experience again. &nbsp;The result was going into a hospital emergency room on a Sunday afternoon. &nbsp;It became apparent that what was bothering me was not just an inconvenience when I noticed how quickly I was being taken care of. &nbsp;I did not emerge from that hospital until the following Friday, I worked from home this week, and I'll get to try the office next Tuesday provided one more doctor agrees on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">As I was going through all of that, a thought occurred to me: &nbsp;there are zillions of books on the subject of healing, there are all kinds of ways to do healing, and finding what works for you to be an effective healer is an exciting experience. &nbsp;But what about the person who is supposed to be getting the healing? &nbsp;Is there anything to say what to do if you're not the healer, but the one who needs the healing?</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">Some healers are almost purely mechanical, especially those with the fancy medical and/or nursing degrees. &nbsp;Some are spiritual and might not have completed their education - one of the most powerful healings I ever witnessed was by someone who was still in high school at the time. &nbsp;Most are somewhere in between. &nbsp;And then there is the question of how to receive the healing. &nbsp;You've heard me talk about receiving before, and here it comes to the forefront. &nbsp;And it can really make a difference, especially when receiving from someone who doesn't know how much they actually sent!</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">To be able to heal is wonderful. &nbsp;To be able to be effective in being the one being healed completes the equation!</span></p>

			<title>October 1, 2011 - So Why Do We Argue?</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">First, an apology for the delay in getting this out to you. &nbsp;I normally do that on Friday nights, and this is only the second one that I've missed other than a couple that I put out in advance. &nbsp;But last night I had such nasty leg cramps that I could not get down the stairs to do it. &nbsp;And I've spent most of today in bed. &nbsp;Healing will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Now, on to the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some of the most pitiful people I've encountered are the people who insist upon raising disputes where there don't have to be any. &nbsp;And this is nothing new. &nbsp;It's been that way throughout recorded history. &nbsp;It's said, for instance, that if the English had simply asked the colonial assemblies in America rather than imposing stamp acts, etc., thirteen colonies might have stayed with the empire a little longer. &nbsp;And speaking of the English, they showed a tactic in the 20th century of planting seeds of dispute, but that wasn't exclusively and English thing, as we saw in what had been Yuglslavia. &nbsp;And people who had once been freinds, neighbors and co-workers learned to hate each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">When it comes to religion and spirituality, I see three especially major nonsense disputes, and it might be reasonable to say that all of us have gotten caught up in at least one of the three.</span></p>

			<title>September 24, 2011 - A Mabon Celebration!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/september-24-2011-a-mabon-celebration-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">It's Mabon, and here we are in Mabontide ready for a celebration! &nbsp;Some call this the last harvest, Lammas being the first. &nbsp;Some call it the second of three with the final being Samhain. &nbsp;Either way, this is Mabon and we do celebrate the harvest at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Not only do we celebrate the harvest, we give thanks. &nbsp;In fact, it can be said that Thanksgiving as people in the USA celebrate it is Mabon transplanted to later in the calendar. &nbsp;And yes, we give thanks. &nbsp;Not just for the good things that are apparent, but also for those that might not be apparent. &nbsp;There are those things we've been too busy to notice. &nbsp;There are some things which we might have come to take for granted. &nbsp;And yes, there probably are some blessings which we simply haven't realized. &nbsp;And this is the time for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This is another one of those Sabbats where the emphasis is on fulfillment. &nbsp;Those who feel as if they are in exile from other paths can take comfort in that. &nbsp;The Wheel Of The Year is about a promise and its fulfillment. &nbsp;There's no talk of "God's will" here because the will of The Divine is our fulfillment, happiness and well-being. &nbsp;There is no talk of "God's time" because each and every Sabbat can be marked on the calendar. &nbsp;As for "God's higher plan," this is indeed that "higher plan", and woe be those who stand in the way!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so come, join in this celebration!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Blessed Be!&nbsp;</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>September 17, 2011 - The Consummate Priest!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/september-17-2011-the-consummate-priest-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">You might wonder who it is that I might consider to be the priest I look up to the most, the one I would most like to emulate. &nbsp;The one whose shoes I can never fill, but I would love to try. &nbsp;I've known quite a number of priests, priestesses and others who might not have the title but fulfill the role. &nbsp;And in addition to those I've known, there are those I've known of because of their legacy from when they were here on this plane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I would begin with Jerome Birnbaum, who gave me my most eye-opening training and ordination. &nbsp;There's Rev Harold Oda, a Jodo Shinshu (Buddhist) priest who first acquainted me with the idea that some spiritual paths admit to not having all of the answers. &nbsp;There's Thomas Aquinas, whose writings make Israel Regardie (another on the list) seem like light reading. &nbsp;And I could go on and on and on. &nbsp;But, at least at this point in my life, one in particular stands out. &nbsp;Today, someone I consider to be small in many ways has been trying to fill his shoes and like all of this particular priest's successors, he hasn't come close. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In a time where the distinction between "haves" and "have-nots" was especially plain, he was of the "have-nots" who appeared to many to become one of the "haves". &nbsp;He had gotten an education in one of the fashionable ways of the time and was well-known as what we now call a political apointee. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Priesthood was thrust upon him, almost as a surprise. &nbsp;And, unlike what many (including the man who appointed him) might have expected, he proved to be far greater in that role than anyone, perhaps including himself, could have imagined. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">There's something in his story for all of us, regardless of our path. &nbsp;And if our path includes being any kind of priest or priestess, here's a very worthy role model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And I want to share some things about him with you.</span></p>

			<title>September 10, 2011 - Digging For The Positive!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/september-10-2011-digging-for-the-positive-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Last time, I talked about "Giving thanks anyway," which sometimes can seem to be a lot to ask of yourself. &nbsp;And one of the reasons is the often-asked question of what is there to feel positive about in the situation you're in. &nbsp;And, if you feel like you need to ask that question, your question is very valid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I was given an answer to that question by a woman who wrote in the "Sound Off" column of the local newspaper here (The Delaware County Times - a personal favorite). &nbsp;Her item in that column showed a lot of insight in a situation which would cause anyone to be highly upset. &nbsp;And that she recognized the positive and let it be known means that she will emerge victorious - and she's the type of person for whom things like this work out for the better. &nbsp;You'll see what I mean when you hear what she had to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Sometimes it can be hard to find the positive in a negative situation, especially if the people around you insist on being negative. &nbsp;But you can find it, and you don't have to be a "Pollyanna" or a "fluff bunny" to find it and to know it when you see it. &nbsp;And when you find it, you'll see how it strengthens you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I've been there a few times myself, most recently enduring Hurricane Irene. &nbsp;And I saw what's coming from that. &nbsp;I've known people who have been through worse than that, such as people who have seen their cities bombed almost beyond recognition. &nbsp;On a more everyday level, virtually every one of us will have to experience the death of a loved one, usually more than once or twice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">There is a way to find the positive. &nbsp;And, there are some basic facts you can rely on in helping you with such a quest when it becomes necessary.</span></p>

			<title>August 27, 2011 - Celebration So We Can Celebrate!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/august-27-2011-celebration-so-we-can-celebrate-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">It occurred to me that this would be a good time to have a celebration just for the sake of having a celebration. &nbsp;Just for the sake of seeing all that The Divine has done for us and giving some thanks, even if it isn't one of those marked-on-the-calendar appointed times for such a celebration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Many years ago, someone who I have come to venerate had some advice for people who were going to The Divine with prayers because of specific needs: "Give thanks in advance", he was known to say. &nbsp;And in at least one place, someone quoted him as saying "When you do that, you have them over the barrel and they have to do something for you, because you're thanking them!" &nbsp;Some would question such a statement, but it works. &nbsp;And, he was able to pull off some amazing stuff in his lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And, come to think of it, why not! &nbsp;And why not from time to time take a step back and look at the blessings you and I have and give some thanks. &nbsp;And who knows? &nbsp;Like in a retail business where it seems that the happy customer seems to get better service, in life it seems that people who give thanks wind up having more to give thanks about!</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">And in this, I'll reveal something to you which some of you might find to be the clue to inspire a quest. &nbsp;But, that is for you to see. &nbsp;Just as you'll see here that this ritual and celebration was spontaneous and unrehearsed (as mine normally are). &nbsp;But then again, I'm not the Pope at St Peter's Square at Christmas or Easter. &nbsp;I'm just a priest (and a mortal) who wants to spend some time giving thanks to The Divine for some wonderful things.</span></p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/august-20-2011-opening-the-spiritual-door-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Last week, we talked about what we do not want, and this week we're going to look at something which we absolutely do indeed want. &nbsp;Getting into the spiritual, the first thing just about everyone wants is to be able to open some important doors. &nbsp;And the one who has advanced considerably will still be seeking how to open doors. &nbsp;Doors beyond the initial set of doors, to be sure, but opening doors nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">First off, we need to know what we mean so that we know what to expect. &nbsp;And then, we need to proceed and let it happen. &nbsp;And here, there are some kewords which can hold some clues for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Remember, this is not spirituality of the so-called "clockmaker theory" in which someone set things into motion and then stepped back to watch (and keep score on you and me). And this is also not about the mood-swinging deity of the people who keep talking about something called "God's will". &nbsp;No, we are talking about The Divine who cares, regardless of the name or names you or I use to refer to The Divine. &nbsp;And we're talking about The Divine who not only cares about us, but actually does things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And here is where you can start opening doors. &nbsp;Look at those who have and what was said about them. &nbsp;But, look at what was actually true about them. &nbsp;And learn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">I'm talking about the trend in recent years in people being less and less willing to actually learn from others, especially those whose ways are different. &nbsp;We've fallen behind in that area, and it seems as if we keep falling behind in that area. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">History is full of learning from others. &nbsp;The reasons the Greeks and Romans did so well was that they learned from others. &nbsp;And when Rome captured Greece, the Romans even learned Greek! &nbsp;There are even cases in which one people put up with another people due to the fact that there was something which those others had which the people knew that they had to learn about. &nbsp;But now, it seems that more and more people are becoming unwilling to learn from anyone who does not fit their pre-conceived notions of being "worthy" (whatever that is). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Please note that I do not consider this an issue for certain distinct groups. &nbsp;I've met Wiccans who are as closed-minded as any Christian fundamentalist that I've known. &nbsp;Believe it or not, I've even seen people reject support to their position when it comes from "wrong people".</span></p>

<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">And so, the next question is what to do with them. &nbsp;The main thing you want to do is, of course, figure out what a dream is telling you. &nbsp;Are you being given advice? &nbsp;Is an observation being offered? &nbsp;Are you being told that something is going to happen? &nbsp;You're not seeing some Ancient One sit in a chair and say "OK, here's how it's going to be...." &nbsp;It's up to you to figure it out.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">It's personal, so seeing something in your dream might mean something for you that might not be valid for someone else. &nbsp;But - how will you know?</span></p>

			<title>July 23, 2011 - The Enemies Of Our Enemies!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/july-23-2011-the-enemies-of-our-enemies-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some people claim that they don't have enemies. &nbsp;If you're a Wiccan or a Pagan, you do. &nbsp;Between the folks who would like to ride you out of town on a fence-rail, the people who will stop at nothing to spread lies about us, the people who make it hard or even impossible for us to enjoy what others consider theirs as a matter of course, the people who try everything from laws to zoning ordinances to try to prevent us from practicing our faith, and the people who sit idly by and do nothing when it is their appointed duty to help, we do indeed have enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Of course, most of our enemies have other enemies. &nbsp;Do you think we have an exclusive on their attention? &nbsp;Of course not! &nbsp;Did you know that it's a historic fact that the Ku Klux Klan didn't bother much with African-Americans in Oregon? &nbsp;In Oregon, the KKK was primarily an anti-Catholic organization, and a good number of the laws the KKK introduced to prevent the Catholics from having too much influence are still on the books! &nbsp;And let's not forget the people who have been pulled off of airplanes in the name of "security" for praying Jewish prayers in Hebrew! &nbsp;And let's not forget Matthew Sheperd - it wasn't being a Wiccan that got him killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So, if we look around, there are a few groups of people who have the same enemies as we do! &nbsp;And there have been some pretty great alliances and friendships which began with the fact of having the same enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so, here is a place where we can begin. &nbsp;And, we can build from there. &nbsp;Working together brings dialogue, and with that comes mutual respect. &nbsp;Nobody's asking anyone to give up anything except perhaps a few preconceived notions. &nbsp;And from there, we can build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Blessed Be!&nbsp;</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Some people claim that they don't have enemies. &nbsp;If you're a Wiccan or a Pagan, you do. &nbsp;Between the folks who would like to ride you out of town on a fence-rail, the people who will stop at nothing to spread lies about us, the people who make it hard or even impossible for us to enjoy what others consider theirs as a matter of course, the people who try everything from laws to zoning ordinances to try to prevent us from practicing our faith, and the people who sit idly by and do nothing when it is their appointed duty to help, we do indeed have enemies.
Of course, most of our enemies have other enemies. &nbsp;Do you think we have an exclusive on their attention? &nbsp;Of course not! &nbsp;Did you know that it's a historic fact that the Ku Klux Klan didn't bother much with African-Americans in Oregon? &nbsp;In Oregon, the KKK was primarily an anti-Catholic organization, and a good number of the laws the KKK introduced to prevent the Catholics from having too much influence are still on the books! &nbsp;And let's not forget the people who have been pulled off of airplanes in the name of "security" for praying Jewish prayers in Hebrew! &nbsp;And let's not forget Matthew Sheperd - it wasn't being a Wiccan that got him killed.
So, if we look around, there are a few groups of people who have the same enemies as we do! &nbsp;And there have been some pretty great alliances and friendships which began with the fact of having the same enemies.
And so, here is a place where we can begin. &nbsp;And, we can build from there. &nbsp;Working together brings dialogue, and with that comes mutual respect. &nbsp;Nobody's asking anyone to give up anything except perhaps a few preconceived notions. &nbsp;And from there, we can build.
Blessed Be!&nbsp;

			<title>July 16, 2011 - To Really Dare!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/july-16-2011-to-really-dare-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">Most of us know The Witches' Pyramid and its four sides: To Dare, To Know, To Will, and To Keep Silent. &nbsp;And the same list can be found in other paths, too, usually with different names - but the same list. &nbsp;And even those paths which don't make explicit use of the list will still teach it, at least to some of their followers. &nbsp;And it is important to notice that "To Dare" is the first on the list.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">"To Dare" allows us to begin. &nbsp;It gives us permission to venture outside of our narrow comfort zones and, more importantly, it lets us increase the size of our comfort zones. &nbsp;And, it opens the door for growth and new beginnings.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">I recall my Dad once saying "Every great movement began as one person's wild idea." &nbsp;And it's true, in the mundane world as well as in the religious world. &nbsp;Name a movement, and you can probably come up with a single name. &nbsp;Even within a movement, there can be single names for various aspects. &nbsp;For the beginnings of Wicca as we know it, most people would mention the name of Gerald Garder. &nbsp;But within Wicca, there are names such as Alex Sanders, Scott Cunningham, Silver Ravenwolf, Jerome Peartree and so many others.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">There are many reasons to dare, and there are ways of going about it which have shown success for people over the years. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">The other three sides of The Witches' Pyramid are necessary, of course. &nbsp;But it begins with "To Dare." &nbsp;And that is indeed worth exploring, so that we can learn how others dared and how we can dare.</span></p>

			<title>July 9, 2011 - Healing: Why Not?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/july-9-2011-healing-why-not-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">In various religious circles, there is often talk of healing. &nbsp;And, the very word "healing" brings on various connotations, depending on your own spiritual path and your own experience. &nbsp;On one hand, there is the "mechanical" approach of the secular physician, and at the other extreme are the (often loud) revival-style prayers of faith-healers or the refusal of some groups to do anything for the sick or injured except to pray. &nbsp;And there is a lot in between. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">If you're here, you probably have some understanding of the spiritual aspect of healing - and how healing can sometimes be done solely through spiritual means. &nbsp;In fact, sometimes it has been known to work when secular medicine has given up. &nbsp;I've seen it happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Like with anything having to do with magick or the spiritual, if we are going to try and heal someone, it would be a good idea to have it be as effective as possible. &nbsp;And fortunately, there are ways of having insuring maximum effectiveness. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">It's much like anything else we do in regards to the spiritual, but there are some factors which deserve special emphasis. &nbsp;And some considerations might give you a bit more leeway. &nbsp;As an example, it might be unrealistic to wait for an unconscious person's consent, and there are reasons why you might have this flexibility which might not apply in another situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But yes, it can be done. &nbsp;And why not?</span></p>

			<title>July 2, 2011 - Dealing With Distractions</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/july-2-2011-dealing-with-distractions]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">Distractions are different from obstacles, and we encounter both on our spiritual and life journeys. &nbsp;But there is a difference. &nbsp;An obstacle merely gets in your way. &nbsp;A disrtraction is an attempt to get you to go a different way from the way that is actually yours. &nbsp;Spiritually, academically or vocationally, you might say that a distaction is the opposite of a calling.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">Each and every one of us knows someone who has devoted his or her entire life to living within a distraction. &nbsp;They might be living to please others, living to impress people, or simply living to be "the one who dies with the most toys." &nbsp;Regardless, people like that look in the mirror and see a stranger - they do not know who they are, and they act like they don't care.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">And, there are plenty of people who will wnat to offer you distractions, and for all kinds of reasons. &nbsp;They range from the "office prima donna" to one form or another of family member who think that they know what you "really need". &nbsp;And the reasons can be anything from their own ego to their fear that you might succeed - or simply to get you to shut up.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">And it's amazing what you'll be told in order to get you to follow a distraction instead of a calling.</span></p>
<p><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;">One of the problems, of course, is to be able to recognize what is a calling and what is a distraction. &nbsp;Sometimes one can look like the other. &nbsp;And then, once we recognize them, we need to know how to deal with them.</span></p>

			<title>June 25, 2011 - The Rite: This Time They Got It Right!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/june-25-2011-the-rite-this-time-they-got-it-right-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Of all of the movies I have seen, "The Rite" is perhaps the most special. &nbsp;Anthony Hopkins plays a key role in getting across a lesson we all need repeating. &nbsp;And if we can learn and be entertained at the same time, why not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The subject, if you insist on there being one, is exorcism. &nbsp;But, do not think of it in terms of such movies as "The Exorcist." &nbsp;That movie, in my opinion, was made to entertain people with a spectacle. &nbsp;While some parts of "The Rite" have spectacle enough, there's something in this movie which everyone will do well to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">If you remember "The Exorcist," you will remember that the younger one of the two priests was Father Damien Karras, a psychiatrist. &nbsp;He became a Jesuit, and the Jesuit order sent him to medical school. &nbsp;And he had come to the point where he was very much a psychiatrist and wasn't bothering to much about his priesthood. &nbsp;And if you read into things enough, you'll learn that he used the priesthood as a way out of the poverty of his boyhood. &nbsp;Instead in The Rite, you have a young man who goes to seminary as a way of getting away from what's left of his family, and getting away from the family mortuary business. &nbsp;And there the comparison ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Remember what I've said that ordination actually is? &nbsp;We see my point here in this movie when he does something that supposedly it wasn't time for him to do yet, but he does - and well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And at the end, the real main point will stare you in the face. &nbsp;It is that which has transformed many of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And I'm going to see it again. &nbsp;I think this will be another one of the rare ones which offers something new each time I see it.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">And once again, we share a celebration with "Mass For The Shut-Out" - and well we should.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Did you ever notice that on the Wheel Of The Year, Litha is the Sabbat directly opposite Yule? &nbsp;In fact, as we in the Northern Hemisphere celebrate Litha, they are having Yule in the Southern Hemisphere. &nbsp;And that fact has some implications worth noticing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">A baby was born at Yule. &nbsp;We've seen him go through all of the stages of growing and coming of age, and the last Sabbat was Beltaine, where we celebrated his wedding. &nbsp;Here at Litha, we celebrate his fulfillment! &nbsp;It is too soon to harvest, that will be soon enough. &nbsp;But it is a good time to look at what the baby born at Yule has grown to become!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And here is Litha's gift to us, as expressed in a reading which came from a place which you might not have expected. &nbsp;But the point of that reading was that someone was given something that they didn't put to use, and here at Litha we celebrate someone's fulfillment. &nbsp;In other words, the baby born at Yule now has all he needs to carry out what he needs to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So much of theology deals with stories of people who were trying to get what was already theirs. &nbsp;And some of us surprise ourselves when we discover how much we have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">You know those basic four principles: to dare, to know, to will, to keep silent. &nbsp;They happen everywhere, not just at your altar. &nbsp;And that means that they can be building something, perhaps even when you think that they are not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Ever notice things happening, very much to your surprise? &nbsp;You inner mind will dare even when you won't. &nbsp;You know. &nbsp;Your inner self might decide that your will is something that you want done. &nbsp;And you'll keep silent because your conscious self might not know what your unconscious self is up to. &nbsp;And the next thing you know, you hear about something happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some people think that they can put on and take off their spirituality like they might do a hat. We see them among several religious denominations which emphasize one particular approach. &nbsp;If they go to a church and the service commences at 11am on Sunday and ends an hour later, that is when they think that their spirituality begins and ends. &nbsp;Not hardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so, what do you do if there's a chance of some accidental energy creating a thoughtform which you did not intend to build? &nbsp;There's some ideas and a keyword.</span></p>

			<title>June 4, 2011 - Drinking From Two Wells</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/june-4-2011-drinking-from-two-wells]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">There are some issues which can be dismissed as "other people's issues", which don't bother you. &nbsp;This is not one of those issues. &nbsp;If it does not affect you now, it has in the past, or it will affect you in the future. &nbsp;Or, it may be a past, present and future issue all together! &nbsp;There was a time when a person could live a long, full life with no concern for or about other spiritual paths. &nbsp;I know, because I lived at the tail-end of that time. &nbsp;Now, paths cross paths every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Once upon a time, it was also expected that everyone would find their significant other among those in their own spiritual paths. &nbsp;Some churches even went to extremes to explain why a relationship with someone from "another faith" was wrong. &nbsp;That is, for the most part, no longer the case. &nbsp;In fact, religiously mixed marriages are fairly common.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And, of course, there is the situation in which someone finds a new path because of issues with the old path. &nbsp;But not with the old path's deities, but with the other mortals on that path. &nbsp;There might be some unfinished business there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And sometimes a person's main path is not offering all of the answers which that person needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And so, people find themselves drinking spiritual water from two spiritual wells. &nbsp;There are many of us who do, and even more of us who don't admit it for any number of reasons. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">It's a question of doing it right so that you find what you need to find and maintain balance as well.</span></p>

			<title>May 28, 2011 - Memorial Day!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/may-28-2011-memorial-day-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">At this time of year in the United States, we celebrate Memorial Day. &nbsp;It's a holiday set aside to remember those who died in armed service to their country, and also those who served, returned home, and died later. &nbsp;Most countries have such a commemoration, so if you're not in the United States, You might still find an opportunity to use what I'm going to offer here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We are talking about men and women who stepped forward when their country called. &nbsp;They might have been drafted, they might have joined voluntarily, or they might have volunteered so that they could pick their path rather than having a path picked for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">They took an oath. &nbsp;I remember mine. &nbsp;One part was to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domesic. &nbsp;Another part was that I swore to obey the orders of the President of the United States and the officers appointed over me. &nbsp;Note that it did not say which President, but the President regardless of who is President. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Memorial Day is a time for speeches, but people like you and I can do more. &nbsp;Envision one of them, as they were when they were in uniform. &nbsp;It's not too difficult for me to envision my Dad, and there are a few others I can envision, too. &nbsp;Having studied military history from more than one point of view, I can even envision some whom my Dad would have seen as enemies in those days - and later became friends after the war was in their mutual pasts. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">They answered their country's call. &nbsp;Many of them fell in service to their country. &nbsp;And what I'll describe here is a way to say thanks in a special way which we can do!</span></p>

			<title>May 21, 2011 - Time To Un-Learn, Perhaps?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/may-21-2011-time-to-un-learn-perhaps-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">I frequently write about learning, but this time I want to address the question of when and how it is best to un-learn. &nbsp;Sometimes, it is simply necessary to un-learn something to be able to make progress with real learning. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I'm especially speaking to those of us who saw and knew things which (according to peers and grown-ups) we were "not supposed to". &nbsp;I'm talking about invisible friends, angels, voices, and bits of knowledge that nobody else seemed to know about or understand. &nbsp;When the other kids found out, they'd ridicule you. &nbsp;Grown-ups would at least tell you that you're "too big" for such things, and some parents and teachers might even threaten you with what would happen to you if you kept on with that. &nbsp;But deities, spirits and other such entities (the good ones, anyway) can become silent if they feel that they are getting you into trouble. &nbsp;And so, it's been a long time since you've heard from them, hasn't it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And, of course, there are the others whose visions were not ridiculed. &nbsp;Did someone have a dream of flying into outer space? &nbsp;Did someone once envision having a "machine" he could fit onto a small table and could use it to communicate with people all over the world? &nbsp;And what of those whose visions were more spiritual? &nbsp;I recently read the story of one such young boy and how he grew up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But for most of us, it's been years since we've allowed such things to happen. &nbsp;Can we bring them back? &nbsp;Can we at least start up again? &nbsp;Let's see!</span></p>

			<title>May 14, 2011 - Yet Another End-Times Date?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/may-14-2011-yet-another-end-times-date-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Every day on my commute to and from work, when I transfer between the trolley and the subway I find a bunch of people passing out leaflets warning us that The Rapture is going to happen on May 21, 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Just about every spiritual path has some form of "end times" expectation, often including detailed descriptions of what they expect to happen. &nbsp;For the Norse, Ragnarok will happen following three winters which do not have summers between them. &nbsp;Another path speaks of earthquakes. &nbsp;The Mayan calendar's longest cycle ends in 2012. &nbsp;Nobody is especially unique in their variation of their description of end times. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The Rapture has a special attraction to Christians. &nbsp;According to many of them, The Rapture will be the event in which the truly righteous will be removed from this world all of a sudden, and allowed to rest while those left behind have to endure the Tribuation and the End Times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have reason to doubt their prediction of May 21st. &nbsp;Nevertheless, most of our paths do speak of end-times. &nbsp;So, what does that mean for us as we go through our daily lives? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">One of the first steps toward wisdom is acknowledging what we do not know. &nbsp;And regardless of what we expect, we don't know if it is going to be thousands of years from now, or if it will be interrupting your reading fo this paragraph.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Quite a number of you have come across my essay "Priesthood Is A State Of Being." &nbsp;It describes, among other things, the nature of a call to priesthood. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Many of us are called. &nbsp;In fact, almost all of us are called to something. &nbsp;I knew someone who was called to be a plumber. &nbsp;Between his plumbing business and his family, he was a really happy, fulfilled person. &nbsp;I also remember someone I once knew whose call to ministry was as a musician. &nbsp;He did far more as a musician than he ever could have any other way - and he loved what he did!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some people think that they are called, but are they? &nbsp;Is it their calling, for that matter, or is it what someone else wants (or does not want) their calling to be? &nbsp;I recall, for instance, someone who stated a large percentage of men in seminary who were supposedly there primarily to please their mothers and an almost as large percentage who were in seminary allegedly to displease their fathers. &nbsp;And what is it about their supposed goal that is calling them? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In some cases, a real calling can be so strong and unavoidable that it makes the proverbial "death and taxes" seem optional by comparison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So, how do you know if you are called? &nbsp;And what is it that you are pursuing? &nbsp;And what do you envision yourself doing if you reach what your calling is calling you to do?</span></p>

			<title>April 23, 2011 - The Golden Triangle Of Magick!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/april-23-2011-the-golden-triangle-of-magick-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">With Beltaine next week and Litha coming just a few weeks later, this is a good time to talk about fulfillment. &nbsp;Then again, anytime is a good time to talk about that, but especially now, when we see things being fulfilled, it is worth our while to understand what we can do to help such things be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And yes, we are witnessing the fulfillment of a promise which was made to us at Samhain. &nbsp;And how is it fulfilled? &nbsp;There are three basic components to the fulfillment: the divine does their part, we do our part, and there is consistency on all parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some of you, like me, have gone through a time when a strange view of The Divine was forced on us. &nbsp;If it happened that The Divine was portrayed as some old white man in the sky who keeps score on you, or if you felt you were enduring the "will" resulting from the mood-swings of a bipolar deity, &nbsp;some healing is in order, and you might find the basis of that healing here. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Seeing the three components and bringing them together forges a link between some of the most basic principles in relationships - any relationships. &nbsp;After all, most of us have experienced what it is like to have a "friend" who only comes around when they want something. &nbsp;And then there are the real ones who are simply interested in being friends. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Some basic principles here, which can come together to be the basis of some powerful magick!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Blessed Be!</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[With Beltaine next week and Litha coming just a few weeks later, this is a good time to talk about fulfillment. &nbsp;Then again, anytime is a good time to talk about that, but especially now, when we see things being fulfilled, it is worth our while to understand what we can do to help such things be fulfilled.
And yes, we are witnessing the fulfillment of a promise which was made to us at Samhain. &nbsp;And how is it fulfilled? &nbsp;There are three basic components to the fulfillment: the divine does their part, we do our part, and there is consistency on all parts.
Some of you, like me, have gone through a time when a strange view of The Divine was forced on us. &nbsp;If it happened that The Divine was portrayed as some old white man in the sky who keeps score on you, or if you felt you were enduring the "will" resulting from the mood-swings of a bipolar deity, &nbsp;some healing is in order, and you might find the basis of that healing here. &nbsp;
Seeing the three components and bringing them together forges a link between some of the most basic principles in relationships - any relationships. &nbsp;After all, most of us have experienced what it is like to have a "friend" who only comes around when they want something. &nbsp;And then there are the real ones who are simply interested in being friends. &nbsp;
Some basic principles here, which can come together to be the basis of some powerful magick!
Blessed Be!

			<title>April 16, 2011 - A Mount Athos For Wicca?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/april-16-2011-a-mount-athos-for-wicca-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">I've sometimes felt attracted to Mount Athos, for reasons which many of us can appreciate. &nbsp;Mount Athos is a little peninsula sticking out from Greece, narrow enough and with rough enough terrain that the only reasonable way to get there to visit is by boat. &nbsp;It is, for all intents and purposes, a sovereign nation which history has for the most part left alone. &nbsp;Its sole purpose is to be a place where men in various monastic orders can liver as monks with as little interference as possible from the secular world. &nbsp;And yes, I do mean men - no women have allowed on Mount Athos for centuries. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Many of the monks on Mount Athos consider the ultimate experience, one highly prized, is to be "kissed by God", which means living in complete isolation as a recluse. &nbsp;Having spent some time in a monastery of an order which (at the time) prized such things as silence and solitude, I have an apprecaition. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And what does this have to do with us?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Each and every one of us has a need for some private time with The Divine, regardless of the name or names we use in addressing The Divine. &nbsp;Even if you share a roof with someone you trust completely and from whom you have no secrets, it is in private time with The Divine that you can share your deepest thoughts and be free from any kind of real or imagined inhibition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">So, let's see how we might build such a place. &nbsp;Not to live there, but to visit when we need such private time.</span></p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/april-9-2011-spiritual-broccoli-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">What do you do when someone recommends that you try something spiritual, but it's something which you find disgusting, or it's something you've been wanting to leave in your long, long passed past? &nbsp;That's why I call this episode "Spiritual Broccoli." &nbsp;Please understand that broccoli makes me gag, no kidding. &nbsp;If you like it, enjoy it all you want, but I am not kidding that it makes me gag. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Unless you grew up in Pollyanna-land and are a current resident of the Land Of Fluff-Bunnies, you can probably list a few things which are your spiritual broccoli. &nbsp;And if you can answer "yes" to any of the questions I offer about your spiritual broccoli, then you have a full plate of it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I'll tell you about one example of spiritual broccoli that I forced myself to deal with. &nbsp;When you see how that particular subject turned into spiritual broccoli, I think you'll understand - especially if you've been in a similar situation. &nbsp;And then an author, whom I eventually came to think of as a teacher and friend, had just published a book on that particular subject. &nbsp;I felt lile I might feel if I had gone to my favorite Mexican restaurant and found that everything on the menu suddenly included broccoli!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">I faced the subject, and thanks to this author/teacher/friend, I was able to see things in a different way. &nbsp;It wasn't simple, but it was worthwhile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Let's explore this. &nbsp;Too many people have too much broccoli.</span></p>

<p>Two basic sets of principles I've discussed. &nbsp;One, the Witches' Pyramid, has been part of pre-dedicant training since long before I was a dedicant.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ostara is the 21st, so this is the time to celebrate it here!</p>
<p>I keep talking about fulfillment, and Ostara is the embodiment of fulfillment. &nbsp;In terms of the Jewish traditionj, it could be said that the baby born at Yule had a Briss at Ostara and now is having his Bar Mitzvah! &nbsp;Winter's hold is broken, and the world is returning to life!</p>
<p>Even the Christian celebration of Easter parallels this, as they celebrate someone dying (and dying a terrible death), and returning to life. &nbsp;And since it happened at Passover, it is at the same time of year. &nbsp;And some could call it the ultimate act of magick. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of their theologians says that it does not contradict science, but goes beyond science. &nbsp;And that's something basic at the heart of all magick - going beyond science. &nbsp;It belongs to every spiritual path which believes in The Divine (of any name or names) being able to do things for us in this life. &nbsp;And it works!</p>
<p>An so we have here a major celebration, and reason to celebrate.</p>
<p>And we also pray for the people in Japan, that they soon can celebrate and not live in fear.</p>

			<title>March 12, 2011 - Let's Focus On What We Share Rather Than What Divides Us! - The Fourth Corner Of The Spiritual Revolution</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/march-12-2011-let-s-focus-on-what-we-share-rather-than-what-divides-us-the-fourth-corner-of-the-spiritual-revolution]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the last few, we looked at the corners which gave you (1) Personal Responsibility (2) Authority and (3) Access. &nbsp;This time, let's look at what brings your power to bear as you intend it to.</p>
<p>Having a focus on what we share rather than on what divides us is but one kind of focus we need, but it can be said that it is also among the first we need. &nbsp;Focusing on division, after all, only helps create more division. &nbsp;And worse yet, it diverts energy from the real purpose, whatever that real purpose happens to be. &nbsp;And this has parallels all over the place in our daily lives. &nbsp;Why are some older folks nostalgic for the days of Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Kennedy? &nbsp;Becuase there was such a feeling of everyone being together and making things work!</p>
<p>And, although I risk stating the obvious to many of you, the fact is that those who would like to sabotage your spiritual life will often do so by trying to disturb your focus. &nbsp;They might interrupt your rituals, they might nitpick on technicalities, they might over-emphasize someone's shortcomings, or they might do some gossip. &nbsp;Messing with your focus is an especially favorite tactic of enemies who pretend to be friends.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice that the spiritual traditions which place an emphasis on how much The Divine can do in an active role in your life are also the ones who have various tools and methods to help you get focused and stay focused - like statues, pictures, shrines, various forms of prayer beads, meditation techniques, chanting and/or singing, etc?</p>
<p>And so, let's look at this. &nbsp;There's something here which, if used wisely, is part of the stuff that miracles are made of!</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>

<p>The first corner, which stated that any relationship with The Divne is mutual, gave you personal responsibility. &nbsp;The second, which stated that things can be made to happen, gave you authority to go with that responsibility. &nbsp;This one, which contains the twin messages of The Divine being accessible and The Divine genuinely caring about you, gives you access! &nbsp;</p>

			<title>February 19, 2011 - Tempest Smith Day - Mass For The Shut-Out in commemorating the 10th anniversary of her passing</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/february-19-2011-tempest-smith-day-mass-for-the-shut-out-in-commemorating-the-10th-anniversary-of-her-passing]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On this occasion, we mark the tenth anniversary of Tempest Smith's passing. &nbsp;On February 20, 2001, she died by her own hand as the result of religious bullying. &nbsp;She was intelligent and talented. &nbsp;But she was twelve years old. &nbsp;At that age, time almost stands still. &nbsp;At that age, torment can seem as if it is never going to end. &nbsp;And that is especially true if people in authority tend to "look the other way." &nbsp;So, those who would think of criticizing her while sitting in their own comfort zones have some things to take into consideration.</p>
<p>It might be wise to look at her and see where it is still happening. &nbsp;I note that there are additional pictures on the Tempest Smith Foundation web site. &nbsp;Pictures of young ones who would have been alive when Tempest died, but the date ranges on their pictures give a clue that they are not living now. &nbsp;And what of those who survived? &nbsp;How are they doing? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sticks and stones can break our bones, but those are wounds that can heal. &nbsp;Names and words can cause worse wounds, some of which might not ever heal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And what is being done about bullying? &nbsp;And, most importantly, is it being enforced equally in all directions? &nbsp;If a student gets into major trouble for using "the N-word", will another student get into similar trouble for making a wisecrack about someone being Jewish? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to see people take this as an opportunity to work together. &nbsp;Tempest Smith got bullied because she was a Wiccan, but others get bullied too - including Christians. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a tradition in certain paths to commemorate a special person on the day of their passing, and so February 20th is Tempest Smith Day at least so long as I keep saying it (and the rest of you join in). &nbsp;And we could even see her as a patron for religious freedom and also a parton for the victims of bullying.</p>
<p>Blessed Be!&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ps: The first challenge was getting this to you, between bouts of the flu and equipment issues - but enjoy!)</p>]]></description>

			<title>February 12, 2011 - A Mutual Relationship With The Divine!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/february-5-2011-a-mutual-relationship-with-the-divine-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>You may recall that last time when I spoke of the "Four Corners Of A Spiritual Revolution," the very first of the four corners was the basic fact that any relationship with The Divine is mutual.</p>
<p>This is a powerful concept, so powerful that some folks are afraid of it. &nbsp;In my years of pursuing truth about The Divine, I've come across many people who wanted to manipulate my spiritual life. &nbsp;And while some of them would worry about which television programs I watched and many of them were afraid of what I might read, they would sweat blood over what - or how - I might be praying!</p>
<p>Worse yet, for those people who want to mind your spiritual business for you, there is nothing here that involves taking attendance, passing a plate, or reporting to someone! &nbsp;We're talking here about something that is at least as personal as your toothbrush.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to function at this level of spirituality, then you have more individual responsibility than someone who is content to sit in a pew being spoon-fed. &nbsp;And there are those who will talk about having a personal relationship with &lt;whatever name(s) they use for The Divine&gt; out of one side of their mouth - and use the other side of their mouth to try get everyone to march in lock-step with them! &nbsp;But there is something more, much more, and we're here to explore that.</p>
<p>And it begins with the fact that any relationship with The Divine is mutual!</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/february-5-2011-four-corners-of-a-spiritual-revolution-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Something's going to give, and it's going to. &nbsp;For me, it began the day I realized that there never would be a place for me in The Episcopal Church, especially given what they had become. &nbsp;And the funny thing is that if they had given me what I had wanted when I had asked for it, then I would have probably been obediently under their thumb these many years - instead of learning and telling about some things that might make some vested interests among organized religion rather uncomfortable!</p>
<p>How many people do you know who:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't bother with the spiritual, or use the secular side of organized religion for their own purposes?</li>
<li>Have seen the religious path they once knew go off into some strange direction, to the point that they can't see it as their path anymore?</li>
<li>Have found that the religious path they used to follow is no longer able to deal with life as they have to deal with it?</li>
</ol>
<p>I see four basic concepts which I call "Four Corners Of A Spiritual Revolution". &nbsp;I offer them as the basis of a loving, gentle revolution which few people would dare resist. &nbsp;In fact, most of the resistance would come from vested interests afraid of losing money or secular power. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll outline them here, and then we can explore them separately and together. &nbsp;And it's the basis of something wonderful waiting for us!</p>

			<title>January 29, 2011 - Our Imbolc Celebration!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/january-29-2011-our-imbolc-celebration-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday, February 2nd, is Imbolc, so let's have a celebration! &nbsp;In fact, most spiritual paths which have their roots on places which have rough winters have a celebration about now. &nbsp;Celebration of Brighid, Lucia, Candlemas, and so many others, some of which are downright blatant in their Pagan roots, and some more subtly disguised. &nbsp;And then, of course, there is the Christian Feast of the Presentation - which just happens to also be on February 2nd.</p>
<p>If Samhain is the death and Yule is the birth of the baby, then Imbolc could be looked upon as the Briss, naming or christening, depending on your tradition. &nbsp;And isn't it amazing how the Christians chose Imbolc to be the celebration of the Presentation In The Temple. &nbsp;Their tradition was that if a boy is a woman's first-born, then he should be presented in the Temple in Jerusalem. &nbsp;Quite a parallel!</p>
<p>And the celebrations all have something more in common: taking a break from the bleakness of winter to celebrate what's coming. &nbsp;Notice how many of the celebrations have lore and ritual which includes the use of candles?</p>
<p>We have a special ministry here, and it seems to me that Imbolc has special meaning to that special ministry. &nbsp;And so, let's no just celebrate Imbolc, let's celebrate something even more!</p>
<p>And when you hear my suggestion of what might be included in an Imbolc celebration, you might think it revolutionary. &nbsp;But then again, you might also see the point and join in! &nbsp;And you will be most welcome!</p>
<p>Blessed Be!&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A fair question, not answered as well as it should be as often as it deserves, and one that you might have about some of the stuff that gets presented here and elsewhere concerning the spiritual.&nbsp; And it's a question you probably have asked and might be asking right now.</p>
<p>What can you actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>do</strong></span> with it?</p>

			<title>January 15, 2011 - Knowing Gnosis</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/january-15-2011-knowing-gnosis]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>At the opening of every episode, I introduce myself as "High Priest of the Temple of Gaia and a priest of the Universal Gnostic Fellowship." &nbsp;The first one you probably understand, but some of you might not have had a lot of exposure to what "Gnostic" might be about. &nbsp;And some of you may have only been exposed to some peoples' pre-conceived notions, and that can be worse than knowing nothing at all!</p>
<p>I recall my own first impressions when I heard about Gnosticism. &nbsp;In a college course titled "Great Religions of the World", the professor suddenly mentioned Gnostics and Gnosticism. &nbsp;Well, I knew that I considered agnostics to be even more of a pain than atheists, so if "Gnostic" was the opposite of "agnostic", I was not going to oppose it. &nbsp;But it was a while before I got to meet any real Gnostics and get to really grasp Gnosticism.</p>
<p>Virtually every spiritual path has its own Gnostic sub-path. &nbsp;In some cases, the Gnostic element is obvious, such as you'll find in the Jewish Kaballah (which you can find in Wicca as well), in Buddhism you have much of it in Zen, and I could go on and on. &nbsp;In other paths, they might not advertise themselves as much if they're there. &nbsp;As I see it, Gnosticism is unavoidable for some.</p>
<p>Regrettably, some people pin the "Gnostic" label on the strangest things. &nbsp;Case in point, a blog I visit now and then where people refer to some practices among the more non-traditionalist in their denomination as "Gnostic," when they definitely are not. &nbsp;Well, these are people who have been made to feel strangers in the churches which they grew up in, so I'll not blame them for not knowing a map of where they've never been.</p>
<p>But when you see what it is, you might find it worth your while. &nbsp;Come on, let's look!</p>
<p>Blessed Be!&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

Regrettably, some people pin the "Gnostic" label on the strangest things. &nbsp;Case in point, a blog I visit now and then where people refer to some practices among the more non-traditionalist in their denomination as "Gnostic," when they definitely are not. &nbsp;Well, these are people who have been made to feel strangers in the churches which they grew up in, so I'll not blame them for not knowing a map of where they've never been.
But when you see what it is, you might find it worth your while. &nbsp;Come on, let's look!
Blessed Be!&nbsp;]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>January 8, 2011 - Exploring Buckland's Big Blue Book</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/january-8-2011-exploring-buckland-s-big-blue-book]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>If there is one book which most Pagans and Wiccans have in common, it would be "Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft" by Ray Buckland. &nbsp;If you see a Wiccan's bookshelf, it's likely to be there. &nbsp;If it isn't, it could be that they gave it to someone who was just beginning. &nbsp;And sometimes, they talk about wanting to get another copy. &nbsp;Why, if it's "just" a primer? &nbsp;If they're advanced, would they be "beyond" a primer?</p>
<p>The book stands out on any bookshelf, even a bookstore, and even a bookstore that specializes in books of that kind. &nbsp;The first thing that is apparent is its size. &nbsp;And, there is the blue cover that makes it stand out. &nbsp;Hence the nickname "Buckland's Big Blue Book", or some just call it "The Blue Book" and know that those who know will know which book they mean. &nbsp;From the information on the inside front pages of my copy, the first printing was in 1986, and I have a copy from a printing done in 1989, so the book has been around a while, and it's still selling.</p>
<p>If you were to come to me for one-on-one lessons or even in a class if I were to teach one, it would be one of the books you'd be expected to read. &nbsp;And, I am not alone in that. &nbsp;I would also suggest the book to police departments, school teachers and principals, and a few others I could mention, including some clergy.</p>
<p>Let's look at this one and while we're doing that, we'll look at some of the basic principles of basic learning while we're at it. &nbsp;This is a book well-designed for someone who knows nothing about the subject and wants to learn something about it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's explore this!</p>

			<title>January 1, 2011 - Exploring Primers!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/january-1-2011-exploring-primers-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the 250th podcast, and the first episode in 2011, so it seems that primers might be a perfect subject to begin a new year with. &nbsp;There are some people who complain that all they find in bookstores are primers. &nbsp;Well, the more advanced are there, but there is a major need for primers. &nbsp;In fact, some of us wish that there were more. &nbsp;After all, every one of us began as a beginner. &nbsp;That holds true even for published authors on the subject. &nbsp;And to complicate matters, the "one size fits all" approach doesn't even work at the primer-level, so there's not only a need for primers, but there's a need for a variety of primers from more than one point of view.</p>
<p>And, even the most advanced have a need for primers. &nbsp;Sometimes, it's necessary to get back to basics, and it's good to have a reminder of what the basics are. &nbsp;Primers are also a good way to explore other paths and other perspectives to see what they have to offer.</p>
<p>I'm going to particularly explore four authors of primers whose work I especially like. &nbsp;There are more, and I will mention a couple of them too. &nbsp;But there are four which I feel will be authors on any Wiccan's bookshelf. &nbsp;Each has something special to offer. &nbsp;Much can be said about each of them. &nbsp;One, I've met. &nbsp;Another is a Facebook friend. &nbsp;Another is someone I have not had any chance to meet. &nbsp;The fourth passed away some years ago. &nbsp;But each has something special to offer.</p>
<p>If we are blessed with an abundance of primers, then at least we know that we have a good excuse to build on some very solid foundations.</p>

			<title>December 25, 2010 - Exploring The New Year!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/december-25-2010-exploring-the-new-year-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Merry Christmas, for those who follow that path. &nbsp;For those who celebrate Yule, I hope that yours was blessed. &nbsp;And for those who celebrate Hannukah or Kwanza, best wishes for a blessed one. &nbsp;And for those who celebrate any combination of them, may they all be blessed for you!</p>
<p>Say "Merry Christmas" to most people here in the US, and it's not uncommon for such a wish to be followed by "And a happy New Year" since the two holidays are only days apart. &nbsp;And even those of us who celebrate Samhain as the changing of our year, we have to note the change on January 1st when we make note of the date using the common system in use today.</p>
<p>This is also the last episode of "The Secrets In Plain Sight" which will be new entirely within 2010. &nbsp;The next one will be new mostly in 2011. &nbsp;And so, this appears to be a good time to discuss what is going to happen to "The Secrets In Plain Sight" as well as "Uriel's Gifts" beginning with the new year. &nbsp;And no, I am not taking up time on this podcast to merely make an announcement. &nbsp;I'm using the opportunity to give you an introduction, especially where this particular podcast is concerned. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are going to explore. &nbsp;I find that there is a lot that needs to be explored, and you're invited to join me. &nbsp;Of all that has made an impression on me spiritually, one thing that keeps making an impression on me is how overwhelming the infiniteness of The Divine must be. &nbsp;And some people have a problem with that - to the point that they try to place limits on The Divine. &nbsp;As if The Divine could be limited, they try to limit The Divine to the boundaries of their own understanding. &nbsp;Then again, we would indeed not be able to deal with being exposed to the full infiniteness of The Divine. &nbsp;But what I seek to do is to be exposed to just a little bit more than my current "zone of comfort" until I'm comfortable with that, and then I'll seek to expand a bit more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And that has some wonderful implications that go far beyond the boundaries of denomination and sect which people try to impose. &nbsp;You'll see!</p>

<p>And it's as full and real as you will let it be! &nbsp;We speak of magick, don't we? &nbsp;So, why not!</p>
<p>A promise was made at Samhain, and this is the first celebration of the promise's fulfillment. &nbsp;In the ancient times, when there were no computers or radios, and few other distractions, people noticed nature because they depended upon it. &nbsp;And they noticed that on a certain day, the sun would stop going away and would begin to return. &nbsp;And that's Yule (in the Northern Hemisphere).</p>
<p>The basic tradition is almost universal. &nbsp;Many paths include the birth of a divine child in this celebration, and the child is destined to do much for us. &nbsp;But above all else, it is fulfillment. &nbsp;And those of us who have in the past been forced to deal with such concepts as the so-called "God's will" can celebrate the real will of The Divine - which is our well-being and happiness!</p>
<p>A promise was made, and it is fulfilled. &nbsp;There are steps along the way which will lead to the fullness of the fulfillment, but this is the first step. &nbsp;And this first step in the fulfillment of the promise is what we're celebrating!</p>

			<title>December 11, 2010 - Seeing It When It Happens!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/december-11-2010-seeing-it-when-it-happens-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>You've heard me talk about various obstructions, obstructors, distractions, distractors, and other interruptions on your spiritual path which can get your journey derailed or diverted into a wrong direction. &nbsp;But, there is one thing even more important to know about and to know what to do about.</p>
<p>Simply put, when The Divine does something wonderful for you, it is a good idea to be able to recognize it when it happens. &nbsp;And, depending on your experience, it might be more difficult than it sounds. &nbsp;And you can't give thanks for some thing when you don't know that it has been given to you. &nbsp;And you're not able to give the right kind of thanks unless you have some idea of what you've been given.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the 8-year-old boy on Christmas morning who puts off opening the gift from Aunt Sally because he's certain it's going to be a shirt, just like every Christmas and birthday that he can remember. &nbsp;Then again, there's the boy who wanted a dog so badly and he spent so much of his time playing with neighbors' dogs that their owners started acting jealous - and then he suddenly was given a puppy of his own, one who became his friend and companion into adulthood. &nbsp;See the difference? &nbsp;And it's even more so when you're talking about the spiritual. &nbsp;(Imagine if he never noticed that Aunt Sally always put a twenty-dollar bill in the pocket of each shirt?) &nbsp;Now you're getting it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there are ways to help this happen. &nbsp;And two things can be accomplished that way. &nbsp;One is that you'll give yourself a spiritual exercise that will help recognize when you've been blessed. &nbsp;The other is that it fortifies your relationship with The Divine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's not all - believe me!</p>

			<title>December 4, 2010 - Dealing With Enemies</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/december-4-2010-dealing-with-enemies]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a hard time believing anyone who tells me that they have no enemies and that they hate nobody. &nbsp;Admittedly, there are those Pollyanna-type characters who try to make themselves into living doormats, and there are those who refuse to acknowledge the obvious, but the rest of us are forced to be human beings and we have to deal with what comes as part of being human.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of enemies, but generally they fall into certain categories. &nbsp;There are people living the agendas that make their life more of a "soap opera" than any afternoon TV drama. &nbsp;There are the ignorant who don't know and that's all they want to know. &nbsp;There are those who listened too much to the wrong people. &nbsp;And, of course, there are also the innocents whose only shortcoming was that someone rubbed your nose in them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with these folks isn't really the fact that we dislike them so much. &nbsp;The problem is that the emotions which people like them can raise in us are able to get in the way of what we are actually supposed to be doing - including our spiritual growth.</p>
<p>So, what can be done with them? &nbsp;Is there more than one way? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It depends, but there are ways to deal with them which have the potential for something positive. &nbsp;And at worst, it is always possible to close the door on the negative. &nbsp;And they don't have to side-track or distract your spiritual progress - or any other progress, for that matter!</p>

			<title>November 27, 2010 - The After-Thanksgiving Thanksgiving Show</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/october-27-2010-the-after-thanksgiving-thanksgiving-show]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Thursday (November 25th) was Thanksgiving Day here in the United States. &nbsp;It is (or purports to be) a purely secular holiday which has many traditions surrounding it, including the start of the Christmastide selling season and many, many family pilgrimages in which families come together for the traditional Thanksgiving meal.</p>
<p>Those family pilgrimages to family gatherings can be a whole other matter, considering the dynamics which can exist in almost any family. &nbsp;I mention some such situations here but, suffice it to say that it is necessary to not allow such factors interfere with the spiritual dimension of your own thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The secular Thanksgiving in the United States has been said by some to take up the void left by the fact that there isn't anything to take Mabon's place in the secular version of our spiritual calendar. &nbsp;That's as good an explanation as any. &nbsp;Most secular calendars do indeed include some day set aside for giving thanks. &nbsp;And if the secular want to think it's purely secular, let them enjoy their opinion. &nbsp;There's more to it than that, and we know it.</p>
<p>And, the principle behind Thanksgiving goes far beyond the celebration of one day on some calendar. &nbsp;Note that it is close to, but not at, the end of the year. &nbsp;Look at any daily cycle of prayer, such as a breviary, and you'll find that the time of most thanks (Compline, for instance) is at the last prayer service, which is after all of the day's work is complete and all that's left afterwards is to retire for the day. &nbsp;And this secular Thanksgiving does indeed follow Samhain and is while we wait for the first lights of Yule. &nbsp;And there's more!</p>
<p>There is something here which you can harness in your daily spiritual life which can become a most powerful spiritual tool! &nbsp;Look, and you will see what I mean!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>What is vital but insignificant, absolutely necessary but it won't stop you if it isn't there, causes all kinds of arguments but makes lots of people shrug their shoulders wondering what the fuss is about? &nbsp;It's the details of what you use in your own rituals!</p>
<p>It could be the color or style of your robe (or if you have one), the language you use in the ritual the kind of ritual tool you use, whether your robe's hood is up or down, or any number of other things. &nbsp;Some folks must own some impressive teapots for the tempests they can raise in them! &nbsp;And the funny thing is, the obvious question which might settle such controversies is almost never asked! &nbsp;And that question, and its answer, could make the controversy a fairly moot issue.</p>
<p>It might be a tempest in a teapot, but it is also something you do need to consider. &nbsp;After all, it is your spiritual life we're talking about. &nbsp;If something can make your spiritual life more powerful, it's worth considering. &nbsp;But then remember, it's your spiritual life and nobody else's. &nbsp; These people who raise a stink about how you handle your spiritual business might do well to mind their own a little better.</p>
<p>There are some good places to look to learn what has been shown to work over the course of time. &nbsp;And, there is one more dimension to that which refuses to be ignored - your own discovery.</p>
<p>Pursue it, and you can really have something wonderful!</p>

			<title>November 13, 2010 - Efficient Spirituality</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/november-13-2010-efficient-spirituality]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A good, basic definition of efficiency is the measure of the input which becomes the intended output.&nbsp; If, for instance, a car get 8 miles per gallon and another car gets 25 miles per gallon, the latter is more efficient because it will get more miles out of the same amount of gasoline.&nbsp; The inefficiency comes out as noise, heat, and all sorts of other things that are not travel.</p>
<p>In spiritual matters, the same principle applies.&nbsp; The more efficient your work is, the more of your input will produce the desired output.&nbsp; The inefficiency results in your input becoming something else that is not the desired result.&nbsp; And some of the main causes of inefficiency in spiritual matters usually are such factors as hate, ange and negativity.</p>
<p>But - we all have these issues.&nbsp; And most of us are wise enough to admit to having these issues.&nbsp; So, what can we do?</p>
<p>That's one of those "secrets in plain sight" which can cause great things to happen in spite of the nature of the mundane world!</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>

			<title>November 6, 2010 - Follow-up: The Next Steps</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/november-6-2010-follow-up-the-next-steps]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Pay attention to what's in this episode, and you'll set yourself apart from the crowd. &nbsp;You'll become one of the folks who are able to get their resolutions to actually work.</p>
<p>At Samhain, a lot of us made resolutions. &nbsp;And, most assuredly, at the moment we made them we were doubtlessly feeling sincere. &nbsp;But we all need to admit that some of us have a history concerning resolutions. &nbsp;In my case, I resolved to quit smoking more years than some of you have celebrated birthdays! &nbsp;It's true that I have not smoked in three years (as of this month), but before then were years in which I kept on quitting and then I'd quit quitting and then I'd try to quit again....</p>
<p>Think of a resolution as a journey, with the starting point being where you are now and where you want to be as the intended destination. &nbsp;How do you start the journey? &nbsp;How do you know when the journey is complete? &nbsp;How do you know where you are on the journey?</p>
<p>And there is one secret that is not very secret, but it is the secret as to why resolutions work well for some, while others fail so often that they joke about it. &nbsp;And that one secret is so simple and so basic - yet some are surprised by it.</p>
<p>Take that to heart and use it, and you can't miss!</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>

			<title>October 30, 2010 - Samhain - And An Opportunity!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/october-30-2010-samhain-and-an-opportunity-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's Samhain! &nbsp;And this year, The Wise Ones' Net (which includes this audio podcast as well as the videocast "Uriel's Gifts" have something special to offer - a semi-simulcast! &nbsp;We think of it as a simulcast because the same ritual is used in both the audio and the video. &nbsp;But it is not entirely simulcast because each one is done to take advantage of its media's special abilities. &nbsp;With audio being so great for imagery, there can be a major celebration in a major temple with people attending from all over. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the video gives a more intimate ritual among special friends who may have come a long way to be here with us.</p>
<p>Either way, it's Samhain, and we are celebrating. &nbsp;Not only ends and beginnings, not only the veil between the worlds being at its thinnest, but more. &nbsp;And it's what's more that you might really enjoy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And as you get into what we're doing here, you may find yourself discovering something.</p>
<p>This might just be a very powerful ritual - and you'll find something in it for you - and yes, I mean you!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/october-23-2010-the-full-ride-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>With Samhain coming, many folks wonder about what they can experience spiritually. &nbsp;We've all heard stories about people who have had visions, etc. &nbsp;And especially more wondrous when those visions proved to be spot-on about something important. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are those who will cast doubt on such things, even claiming any such spiritual experience to be nothing more than a sign of mental illness. &nbsp;But the truth is that nearly everyone who is not having such spiritual experiences wishes that they would. &nbsp;People have a need for the spiritual, and they would like to have their deities have a more active role in their lives. &nbsp;Can you blame someone like that for feeling just a bit of envy for those for whom it is really happening? &nbsp;It can happen, it does happen, and it can happen for you.</p>
<p>Think of it as an open door waiting for you to walk through. &nbsp;What's holding you back? &nbsp;Regardie details it so eloquently. &nbsp;And the door is open and waiting for you, provided that you can get the distractors out of the way.</p>
<p>And, of course, there is need for discernment, but that's another episode.</p>
<p>At Samhain, the veil between the world is at its thinnest. &nbsp;That doesn't mean that it's impenetrable at any other time, but moving between there and here is easiest now. &nbsp;So, what better time?</p>

			<title>October 16, 2010 - Unity?  Why Not! (with a clarified definition, of course!)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/unity-why-not-with-a-clarified-definition-of-course-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Unity is one of those words that gets tossed around more often than baseballs in a ball park. &nbsp;And what does it mean? &nbsp;It depends on who is talking! &nbsp;Well, for us it is definitely not forcing the one-size-fits-all approach on other people. &nbsp;And if unity is not that, then it might be simply people able to do things together even if they are on different spiritual paths. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bishop Fulton Sheen was known for saying that he did not seek a unity of religion, but a unity of religious people. &nbsp;There is an important distinction there, and he recognizes that. &nbsp;He also acknowledged that the one-size-fits-all approach to religion would never work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And then we see in Regardie's works some special revelations of where the Gods and Goddesses came from, what they did not come from, and what they came to be from. &nbsp;He had studied the ancient Egyptian deities in some depth, and you'd be amazed at the connection found between the Egyptian and the Hebrew. &nbsp;And do you think that the Celts, Norse, and others fromm afar.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice how similar the tales of gods and godesses are between various paths? &nbsp;And there are a few other clues.</p>
<p>And the conclusion, it would appear, is something which we can all celebrate! &nbsp;You'll see!</p>

			<title>October 9, 2010 - The Theology And Spirituality Of Popular Music</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/october-9-2010-the-theology-and-spirituality-of-popular-music]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am sure that the current genreation which is listening to the "leading edge" of popular music is taking a great deal of heat from their elders. &nbsp;I know not only because some see me as one of those elders, but I recall receiving a hard time from my elders about my choice of music. &nbsp;And then I read about the same round-and-round over popular music in my parents' generation, proven by an article in a popular music magazine which was published when my own mother was fifteen!</p>
<p>Admittedly, some music is made to offend, and some does have hidden meanings, and some is simply chosen by the paranoids and the "self-appointed defenders of virtue" as examples of some sort of conspiracy. &nbsp;I recall, for example, one TV preacher who tried proving his point &nbsp;by playing records (yes, 33-1/3 rpm stereo platters) slow and backwards.</p>
<p>But given that most music, including and perhaps especially popular music can be seen as both art and literature, there is much that might be said about it. &nbsp;And that includes some powerful spiritual matters.</p>
<p>And I'll show you in terms of three which were popular when my generation was settling down to homes and families.</p>
<p>And from there, you might decide to see what you might find in the popular music which especially appeals to you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[I am sure that the current genreation which is listening to the "leading edge" of popular music is taking a great deal of heat from their elders. &nbsp;I know not only because some see me as one of those elders, but I recall receiving a hard time from my elders about my choice of music. &nbsp;And then I read about the same round-and-round over popular music in my parents' generation, proven by an article in a popular music magazine which was published when my own mother was fifteen!
Admittedly, some music is made to offend, and some does have hidden meanings, and some is simply chosen by the paranoids and the "self-appointed defenders of virtue" as examples of some sort of conspiracy. &nbsp;I recall, for example, one TV preacher who tried proving his point &nbsp;by playing records (yes, 33-1/3 rpm stereo platters) slow and backwards.
But given that most music, including and perhaps especially popular music can be seen as both art and literature, there is much that might be said about it. &nbsp;And that includes some powerful spiritual matters.
And I'll show you in terms of three which were popular when my generation was settling down to homes and families.
And from there, you might decide to see what you might find in the popular music which especially appeals to you!
&nbsp;
Blessed Be!

			<title>October 2, 2010 - Your Greatest Barrier - Or Opportunity!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/october-2-2010-your-greatest-barrier-or-opportunity-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've spoken many times on how some of the greatest saints and mystics were basically simple people, and that the reason for that was the fact that for too many of us, it's too easy to let the intellect get in the way of the spiritual. &nbsp;While it might be important to know when to use your head instead of your heart, it is also necessary to know when to use your heart instead of your head!</p>
<p>But did you know that there is another barrier, a greater one? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to share with you just the smallest bit of what Israel Regardie wrote about the problem, and then let's explore it. &nbsp;Almost all of us have known someone suffering from it, and many of us might have shown symptoms of it. &nbsp;The funny thing is, a number of people might not even think that there's anything wrong!</p>
<p>And it leads to a question which is risky. &nbsp;It is risky because of the number of times that the problem has been a popular "fad diagnosis" and has caused some people to take unnecessary action.</p>
<p>But it is also a question worth asking. &nbsp;After all, how many people are so busy bing who they think that they are supposed to be that they have no idea who they are?</p>
<p>The answer is found in a two-word statement batted about in almost every theological writing available.</p>
<p>And mastering it will transform a major barrier into a major opportunity.</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>With Samhain coming, it's worth our while to discuss resolutions. &nbsp;At Samhain and at the mundane New Year, we have a tendency, and even a desire, to make resolutions. &nbsp;The resolutions are promises to ourself of things we want to accomplish in the coming year. &nbsp;Some people sound cynical about such resolutions because of how few of them seem to actually get fulfilled. &nbsp;Well, it does not have to be that way!</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be a good thing to make a resolution and see it fulfilled? &nbsp;It can happen, even the same resolution that others leave unfulfilled can be yours - and fulfilled! &nbsp;Do you really want to quit smoking? &nbsp;Do you really want to lose weight? &nbsp;Do you really want to get a better job? &nbsp;Do you really want to fulfill some other dream?</p>
<p>There's a way to go about it. &nbsp;And it does not involve a Pollyanna approach like some take. &nbsp;There's a way to grasp reality and bring your resolution to be. &nbsp;All with some basic principles and a healthy bit of selfishness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You're not just making a resolution into a reality. &nbsp;You're also embarking on a spiritual exercise which will let you claim your magickal power - and more of it that you knew that you had!</p>
<p>And the result can be a chain-reaction of blessings and opened doors!</p>

			<title>September 18, 2010 - Weddings, Funerals And What They Share!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/september-18-2010-weddings-funerals-and-what-they-share-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As we see Mabon almost here and Samhain only a few weeks away, it's a good time to think about endings and beginnings. &nbsp;And during the course of the year, of the more mundane events which might occur, there are none where endings and beginnings are more apparent and obvious than at weddings and funerals.</p>
<p>In fact, that's what they share. &nbsp;They mark a definite ending paired with a beginning. &nbsp;Or is it a beginning paired with an ending? &nbsp;Or is it both? &nbsp;Exploring that point is part of the fun we can have in growing spiritually. &nbsp;It's like that old debate as to whether a glass is half empty or half full - and someone might add the possibility that the glass is holding the right amount of liquid, but it's twice the size that it needs to be.</p>
<p>A funeral marks a definite end. &nbsp;I can't just call my Dad on the phone anymore, for instance. &nbsp;And a wedding marks the end of being single and only having to look out for oneself. &nbsp;The beginning inherent in a wedding is apparent, but what is the beginning that a funeral commemorates? &nbsp;I never promised you that I'd spoon-feed you answers, and I don't have all of the answers. &nbsp;But I have experienced enough to know that there is something on the other side of the bridge which we must all cross. &nbsp;And it is apparent to me that all that I can grasp is one small part of one small corner of the Infinite.</p>
<p>And so, let's explore these thoughts for a bit, in preparation for Mabon, Samhain and more!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Christians use Lent and Advent as seasons leading up to Easter and Christmas respectively as a means of introspection, self-examination and renewal. &nbsp;It is unfortunate that Lent has especially been mis-directed by some to being almost a season of punishment - that was probably not the actual intention. &nbsp;And if the actual intention was what I presume it to be, a season such as that could be good for us. &nbsp;After all, we are coming up to what is spiritually the most powerful time of the year.</p>
<p>When I was preparing to become a dedicant at a certain coven, the High Priestess had me write a paper on each Sabbat as it approached. &nbsp;As the time approached Mabon, I made the observation that Mabon could be seen as being to Samhain as a retirement banquet might compare to a funeral. &nbsp;Except that Samhain does include another harvest. &nbsp;And if we know the Wheel Of The Year, we know that it does not end at Samhain, does it? &nbsp;No, it also begins!</p>
<p>That makes right now a good time to look back on where we have been, and that might give us a better idea of where we are on this leg of the journey - and how to steer the course on the next leg which begins at Samhain.</p>
<p>Let's see what we might do to make this a most fruitful and gainful endeavor.</p>

			<title>September 4, 2010 - Taking Control Of Rules!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/september_4_2010_taking_control_of_rules_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>There are those who will claim that rules are unavoidable. &nbsp;But there are also those of us who have experienced what can happen when rules go too far. &nbsp;In the Air Force, there was a time when it didn't seem to matter if someone knew which end of a rifle is pointed at the target, so long as there was a nice haircut on your head. &nbsp;And when dealing with religion or spirituality, there can sometimes seem to be no end to the rules &nbsp;</p>
<p>Rules do have a purpose. &nbsp;They do make boundaries. &nbsp;To tell a small child not to play in the street, for instance, is reasonable and makes much sense. &nbsp;Within the boundaries made by rules, we are more free because the rules keep the dangers away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But, there can be more rules added in until things get stifling. &nbsp;Lent is one example. &nbsp;Or there was the young girl who was convinced that eating meat on Friday would end her life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some excesses and some quibblings over when a rule is needed and whether a rule is or is not broken can make for some rather humorous parody, too!</p>
<p>So, what do you do with rules? &nbsp;Much!</p>
<p>Let's explore that today.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Controversies seem to be all around us today. &nbsp;It didn't seem that way when I was growing up. &nbsp;Not until the early 1060's, and that was because a black family decided to move into our neighborhood. &nbsp;Until then, and much of the time after that until the Vietnam war entered everyone's lives, controversy was something people read about in the newspaper and perhaps saw on the TV news.</p>
<p>Today, it's different. &nbsp;Today, there are enough controversies that everyone can find at least one that's compelling them to take a side.</p>
<p>Know what I find interesting? &nbsp;In every controversy, each side has something valid to say. &nbsp;If it weren't so, there would be no side. &nbsp;But, there's the other side. &nbsp;And there comes polarization, an "either-or" attitude, demonizing or dehumanizing the other side, exaggerating the other side's shortcomings, and perhaps a heavy dose of gossip. &nbsp;Finally, you're at a point in time where a difference of opinion has grown into a major dispute. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to offer you some examples, and some of you might find something to get upset about in the examples I use. &nbsp;But each has something to be said for it. &nbsp;</p>

			<title>August 21, 2010 - Forging New Ground!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/august_21_2010_forging_new_ground_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been known to say that where the spiritual is concerned, nobody forges a new path and gets away with it. &nbsp;Basically, what I do is mostly see how supposedly different things fit together, and sometimes I get into trouble over that. &nbsp;But Isaac Bonewits was one of those folks who did actually forge new territory. &nbsp;And it seems right to talk about forging new paths. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When Isaac began his quest, whatever books on magick and non-mainstream spirituality were either gathering dust on university library bookshelves, or were preciously guarded on the bookshelf of a practitioner. &nbsp;They certainly were not going to be found in your neighborhood bookstore. &nbsp;And that's to say nothing of jewelry, supplies, ritual garb and the like. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's not easy exploring new territory, and it is not going to win you new popularity, either. &nbsp;And, it's not the safest thing to do, either. &nbsp;If you want to explore, have some idea that you are walking on solid ground, not thin ice!</p>
<p>And yet, for all that can be said to persuade someone not to try, it is a necessary part of our growth as individuals, as cultures, and as societies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, let's look at the implications of something which some of us might want to try.</p>

And it's not easy exploring new territory, and it is not going to win you new popularity, either. &nbsp;And, it's not the safest thing to do, either. &nbsp;If you want to explore, have some idea that you are walking on solid ground, not thin ice!
And yet, for all that can be said to persuade someone not to try, it is a necessary part of our growth as individuals, as cultures, and as societies. &nbsp;
And so, let's look at the implications of something which some of us might want to try.
Blessed Be!]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>August 14, 2010 - What's A Saint To You? And The Passing Of Isaac Bonewits</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This was another one of those times when I had an episode in the works, and instinct told me to take on another subject.&nbsp; And it was when the episode was written that I found the reason why.</p>
<p>Isaac Bonewits has crossed over.</p>
<p>Among many Gnostics, myself included, saints are often referred to as either Celestial Masters or Ascended Masters, the latter being those who once shared our humanity, shortcomings and all.&nbsp; I cannot think of a better person to fit that description than Isaac Bonewits.&nbsp; Along with all else that might be said, there was a personal factor.&nbsp; He gave me much encouragement in building what I am building. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And we can learn much, and gain much, from Ascended Masters such as Isaac, and from Celestial Masters such as the Archangel Uriel.</p>
<p>The problem some of us (including me at one time) have with saints is a combination of too much and not enough.&nbsp; Too much embellishment, and not enough of the person as an actual human being with the same concerns and desires as you and I.&nbsp; There is no such problem with Isaac - his humanity was obvious.</p>
<p>And so let's look at one we knew.&nbsp; And perhaps celebrate all of them.</p>

			<title>August 7, 2010 - Beyond Wrong!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/august_7_2010_beyond_wrong_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I came across an article about a coming event which I consider to actually be beyond wrong!&nbsp; Someone is planning on hosting an "International Burn A Quran Day" on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.&nbsp; Worse yet, the group planning on hosting the event is a Christian church!&nbsp; And yes, the people are actually encouraging people to burn a copy of the Quran, Islam's holy book!&nbsp; In explaining his motivation, their pastor claimed that Islam is "of the devil".</p>
<p>I cannot imagine a worse expression of hate, not only from the point of view of wanting the various spiritual paths to get along and work together, but it is probably spiritually dangerous to go down such a path.</p>
<p>Most of us who are Pagan or Wiccan learned early-on the importance of respecting other people's spiritual paths.&nbsp; That includes their practices, their deities, their books, and their sacred objects.&nbsp; Many, many Christians have learned that over the last several years.&nbsp; I have been in a position to notice some marked improvement, even if there is room for more improvement.&nbsp; And in this case, even the National Association of Evangelicals has asked them to call off the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are more reasons why a Quran-burning is spiritually dangerous, and I'll cite some very specific specifics.</p>
<p>And along with all else, it can be a major mistake to judge a large group by the actions of its extreme fringes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that isn't all!</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>

			<title>July 31, 2010 - Finding The Open Door, As Opposed To &quot;God's Will&quot;!</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Can anything be as frustrating as feeling a strong call to do something, and not being allowed to do it?</p>
<p>One particular priest who I admired back when I was an Episcopalian had the habit of delivering some hard-hitting sermons.&nbsp; They didn't seem to hit hard at first, but when he was done, you felt like he had really gotten up close and personal.&nbsp; When I asked him about that, his answer was that he was preaching to himself.&nbsp; I want to mention that up-front because this episode is sort of like that.&nbsp; And it touches on my frustrations in answering my call to the priesthood.</p>
<p>But please understand, it is not about my frustrations or what anyone made me endure.&nbsp; What I'm actually talking about is something bigger than that, and something that could easily be happening to you.</p>
<p>I recall being once told that if The Divine closes a door, another door or a window is opened.&nbsp; And I considered that saying to be yet another prime example of Pollyanna-style hogwash.&nbsp; That is, until recently when I looked back and came to the realization that a window or another door opening when the door I was looking at got slammed in my face is exactly what happened, on more than one occasion, and the result of those opened doors and windows is a priesthood and ministry far better than what I had asked for!&nbsp; If I had gotten what I had first asked for, I would have been bound under obediance and probably in a bunch of trouble, given their current controversies.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I get to speak my mind and minister to more people, including some whom many of those other folks choose to ignore!</p>

<p>And then, of course, there are the basic core values we all share.&nbsp; But you you as an individual work with The Divine is something that is personal and individual.&nbsp; And so, your answers might not be the same as someone else's.&nbsp; For that matter, someone else's answers might not work for you, either.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>There are some friends who are especially special, especially the ones with four legs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a son and a daughter who I wish would at least write more often now that they are on their own, but Lady Stormy and I have six other "kids" who never let us down.&nbsp; In fact, we seem to be the focus of their day.&nbsp; Two are dogs, four are cats, and each one was either rescued or is descended from someone whose rescue we know about.</p>
<p>Each one has his or her own story, and it is well worth telling.&nbsp; But I promise I won't make you hear all of them</p>
<p>And some of them are stories of what isn't supposed to happen.&nbsp; There are folks who claim that a "street cat" can't be made into a house pet.&nbsp; Well, we have a guy named Thor who can prove that to be a misconception.</p>
<p>And, they're both smart and appreciative.&nbsp; Friends have told us that they are simply too human.</p>
<p>And the relationship we have with them is so rewarding.&nbsp; If you wonder what "familiars" actually do, this is it!&nbsp; I would say that Thor knows me better than any priest, doctor or even perhaps Lady Stormy!</p>

			<title>June 19, 2010 - What  Price Revenge?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/june_19_2010_what_price_revenge_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are honest with yourself, you know at least one time when you really wanted to get back at someone.&nbsp; <span style="font-size: xx-small;">Someone had you that upset.&nbsp; They'd done something, or perhaps it is what they did not do.&nbsp; Regardless of the specifics, what you actually wanted was revenge.&nbsp; The only folks I know of who might not have had that urge in their life are still in diapers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">So, what do you do when the urge calls to get even?&nbsp; For some, the queston is not "what do you do?", but "what did you do?"&nbsp; Of course, that can be dangerous.&nbsp; It might perpetuate something, and give that other person another excuse.&nbsp; Or, if there has been enough time, it might re-awaken issues which everyone but you assumed were in the past.</span></p>
<p><br />But you feel that not doing anything about it would also be wrong.&nbsp; After all, you were wronged.&nbsp; You were hurt.&nbsp; You are a person, not a doormat.</p>
<p>But spending energy about something in the past is a way of looking backwards, and if you are looking backwards to the past, you are not looking forward toward what is waiting ahead of you.</p>
<p>So, how do you deal with all of those apparent contradictions?</p>
<p>Let's see what might be able to be done!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/june_12_2010_books_to_help_you_chart_your_course]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Books just might be second only to your own experience in their sheer power potential in forming your spiritual path.&nbsp; Is it any wonder that historically, some people have feared books more than anything else you can imagine.</p>
<p>From the Christian zealots in Alexandria who destroyed the famous library, to Hitler's followers with their book-burning rallys, to more recent times when people tried to burn Harry Potter books, it's obvious that some folks are simply afraid what books can do.</p>
<p>And what can a book do for you?&nbsp; Quite a lot!</p>
<p>Of course, there are books and there are books.&nbsp; Some I don't bother with, unless to learn how to recognize junk when I see it.&nbsp; Others are more important.&nbsp; Some will teach me something knew every time I read it.&nbsp; In some caes, I have to dig.</p>
<p>Do you wish you could meet someone, but the person died centuries ago?&nbsp; Would you like to visit a place which might not be reachable by conventional means?&nbsp; Do you want to experience an ordeal without having to endure it?&nbsp; Books can do all for you, and more.</p>
<p>Some of my favorites are the ones which force me to dig even deeper, looking for secrets, such as how another translation might read.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>And here again, we have another secret hiding in plain sight.&nbsp; One which a lot of people spend their lifetimes trying to seek.&nbsp; Like so much of the others that I've pointed out in the last few weeks, including last week.</p>
<p>This was inspired by an event which happened to us in the past week, plus the fact that in the course of the past week, Lady Stormy and I celebrated ten years as a commited couple, and nine years as a married couple.</p>
<p>The incident involved a couple who were stood-up by the church.&nbsp; Note that I did not say stood up *at* the church, but stood up *by* the church.&nbsp; That in itself is an interesting tale, the first such that I'd heard of in all my years of carious forms of ministry.&nbsp; But it only leads us to the main point.</p>
<p>The point is a simple one, which many express in many ways, but all of those expressions boil down to one single factor, one so simple that many miss it.</p>

<p>And then, what are sins?&nbsp; If you listen to certain people, you'll get the impression that the only thing that is not a sin is to fill that person's collection plate.&nbsp; And so, let us look at what some sins are, and let's look at which aspects of them might not be sins - and which indeed are wrong.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/may_8_2010_the_art_of_spiritual_borrowing_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it is an art.&nbsp; And you are probably already doing it, although you might not know it, and some don't like to admit it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, it can happen for all of the right reasons.&nbsp; In spiritual paths like many of ours, there isn't a lot of structure, and so therefore it might be a challenge to maintain balance.&nbsp; Even the major "establishment" religions have this problem, and they have more controls.&nbsp; Yet we keep hearing of churches where there seems to be so much emphasis on Lent and giving, and it's almost as if they try to have Lent without Easter - but then again, what path does not have folks with such a problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you come from another path, what if there was something which that path offered which really worked for you?&nbsp; Can you borrow that?</p>
<p>And what if you see something and you can tell that it will indeed work for you.&nbsp; What can you do?</p>
<p>There's a way, and often there's a very good reason why you should do so.&nbsp; And on the way to that reason, I'll warn you about a disease that has been known to decimate religious and political groups.&nbsp; You'll see what I mean.</p>

			<title>May 1, 2010 - A Biggie Is Revealed!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/may_1_2010_a_biggie_is_revealed_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a biggie!&nbsp; I really think so!&nbsp; This contains material which a lot of people don't want you to know about, much less give consideration to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I begin with citing The Law Of One as taught by the Universal Gnostic Fellowship.&nbsp; It is perhaps the only thing that approaches mandatory in the Universal Gnostic Fellowship, and it's one of the reasons why such a diverse group can work well together.</p>
<p>If you want the full text of what the Universal Gnostic Fellowship teaches about The Law Of One, go to <a title="http://gnosticfellowship.com/one.html" href="http://gnosticfellowship.com/one.html">http://gnosticfellowship.com/one.html</a> and read that page.&nbsp; Here, I talk about applying it.</p>
<p>So much that so many paths have in common, it is hard to believe that some folks don't see the unity.&nbsp; Then again, Wiccans and Pagans have an advantage here because so many of us have so many and varied personal pantheons that we're almost forced to accept other paths' validity.&nbsp; Others are not so fortunate, and that might be a very sad thing.</p>
<p>I find that often the only way to get Christians' attention is to show that a point I am making is in their own scripture, and it is - abundantly.&nbsp; In fact, I don't even cite half of what I could cite.&nbsp; But there is a powerful promise and warning few seem to understand.&nbsp; What is ironic is that it is right next to a verse which is so often quoted that even atheists acknowledge it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go from there to the Gospel of Thomas (one of the books that were excluded from the current Bible), and there is even more revealed to show some basic truths which some seem to have forgotten.</p>
<p>Talk about secrets in plain sight!</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This is a biggie!&nbsp; I really think so!&nbsp; This contains material which a lot of people don't want you to know about, much less give consideration to.&nbsp;
I begin with citing The Law Of One as taught by the Universal Gnostic Fellowship.&nbsp; It is perhaps the only thing that approaches mandatory in the Universal Gnostic Fellowship, and it's one of the reasons why such a diverse group can work well together.
If you want the full text of what the Universal Gnostic Fellowship teaches about The Law Of One, go to http://gnosticfellowship.com/one.html and read that page.&nbsp; Here, I talk about applying it.
So much that so many paths have in common, it is hard to believe that some folks don't see the unity.&nbsp; Then again, Wiccans and Pagans have an advantage here because so many of us have so many and varied personal pantheons that we're almost forced to accept other paths' validity.&nbsp; Others are not so fortunate, and that might be a very sad thing.
I find that often the only way to get Christians' attention is to show that a point I am making is in their own scripture, and it is - abundantly.&nbsp; In fact, I don't even cite half of what I could cite.&nbsp; But there is a powerful promise and warning few seem to understand.&nbsp; What is ironic is that it is right next to a verse which is so often quoted that even atheists acknowledge it.&nbsp;
Go from there to the Gospel of Thomas (one of the books that were excluded from the current Bible), and there is even more revealed to show some basic truths which some seem to have forgotten.
Talk about secrets in plain sight!
Harnessing The Law Of One will mean we can really do some heavy stuff!&nbsp; You'll see!
Blessed Be!]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One thing is almost as inevitable as the death and taxes some folks quip about when discussing the inevitable.&nbsp; In fact, some folks might avoid it and still die, but nobody avoids it who is capable of doing something for which they can be taxed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm talking about what some folks refer to as "formation."&nbsp; And it's something that you're going to do, including (perhaps especially) spiritually.&nbsp; It's going to happen.&nbsp; And you might as well benefit from it.</p>
<p>Formation comes in many forms, and no two people will have the same formation.&nbsp; And, there are many influences to your formation.&nbsp; And, you will have many teachers.&nbsp; One or two might be your main teachers, but there wil be others.&nbsp; It can easily be that every person in your life might be some kind of teacher,&nbsp; and some of the people who teach you might surprise you - and me.&nbsp; Even someone who is infamous for teaching "junk theology" does teach you (hopefully) to recognize junk when you see it.</p>
<p>And therein is the secret.&nbsp; And the really big secret is what makes your own path stronger.&nbsp; Some folks will claim it doesn't happen that way, but it does.</p>

			<title>April 17, 2010 - Trying To Peek Past The Bridge!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/april_17_2010_trying_to_peek_past_the_bridge_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Most Wiccans know what is meant by "bridge crossing".&nbsp; And this time of the year I think about a number of people who have crossed that bridge which we all will cross one day.</p>
<p>Between April 1st and July 1st, there are so many anniversaries of deaths of people I love.&nbsp; And, of course, the list grows as you grow older.&nbsp; At age 9, there was a grandpa who influenced the course of my day-job career.&nbsp; At age 10, my mother who gave me clues where to look when I was older and in need of answers which I could not find elsewhere.&nbsp; Later, my dad and then my stepmom.&nbsp; And so many others that I don't dare try to list them for fear I'd miss someone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people who have crossed over have one thing in common with people we love who live far away.&nbsp; We can't help but wonder how they are, what they are doing, do they know what's happening here, all of those questions.&nbsp; It's only natural to want to know.&nbsp; The difference is that my son can send me an email, but I can't send my dad an email.&nbsp; I'm only a plane ticket away for my daughter, but I can't visit my mother.</p>
<p>There are some clues which we are welcome to explore, and a fair amount of common sense and an exploration of lore might give us some assurance and comfort, especially those of us who have experienced the spiritual blackmail of people with agendas.</p>

			<title>April 10, 2010 - Three Lines To Not Cross!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/april_10_2010_three_lines_to_not_cross_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I said last time that with divination, the basic rules of magick apply.&nbsp; It seems to me that it would be a good idea to clarify what they might be.</p>
<p>But first, let's recognize the danger of rules.&nbsp; The dangerous thing about rules is that some people seem to make rules into ends in themselves - to the point that they put so much effort into following the rules that they don't actually accomplish anything.&nbsp; And worse, they add rules onto themselves to the point that it is almost impossible to do anything without breaking some rule.</p>
<p>But rules are necessary.&nbsp; Rules are what we use to keep out of trouble.&nbsp; Anyone who has been dealing with the spiritual for more than a week has a story of how a dabbler got into a bad situation.</p>
<p>There are some basic principles which pretty much cover the rules.&nbsp; At least, they cover the important parts of the rules so that if you follow the principles you won't find yourself in a world of hurt because of it.&nbsp; And it keeps you from becoming overly nit-picky.</p>
<p>"An' it harm none, do what thou wilt" - that's an example of such a principle.</p>
<p>While others might find others, I've noticed three lines that I certainly do not want to ever cross.&nbsp; And they are way outside the boundaries of a principle like the one I just quoted.&nbsp; And the descriptions of those three lines can be said to overlap in some important places.</p>
<p>Specific rules of a tradition are another matter and for the most part their inforcement is left to the individual follower.&nbsp; We're not talking about the color of your robe or whether you can eat bacon on Friday.&nbsp; We're talking about basic principles which, in my never-to-humble opinion, we should all be operating within.</p>
<p>And it gives us a lot of room to maneuver - and grow!</p>

			<title>April 3, 2010 - Divining Divination!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/april_3_2010_divining_divination_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>First off, let this be understood:&nbsp; Divination is not "fortune-telling."&nbsp; Many of you are aware of that basic fact, but enough are not that I need to state that up-front.</p>
<p>Is there a difference?&nbsp; Yes, and it is a major difference.&nbsp; So-called fortune-telling has a premise that you are stuck with what's coming.&nbsp; If a fortune-teller tells you that illness is coming, then you are indeed going to be sick.&nbsp; Divination shows you what can be and what may be, especially if the patterns made today continue.&nbsp; But if something is looming on the horizon that you'd prefer not to deal with, you have means to avoid or at least alleviate it.&nbsp; On the other side of the spiritual coin, there is also the fact that something priomising which you see through divination could be lost if you don't do your part.</p>
<p>And yes, the standard rules of magick apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many possible ways - there's got to be at least one that will fit you.</p>
<p>And for the inevitable objections you might hear from those who think they know but don't, there's a couple of clues here, including one that will surprise a lot of Christians.</p>
<p>And this, for any beginners, is but the beginning of the beginning.&nbsp;</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/march_27_2010_making_a_joyful_noise]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Psalm 100 in the Christians' Bible begins with words which should have a point to anyone regardless of their spiritual path:&nbsp; "Make a joyful noise...."&nbsp; Note that it says to make a joyful *NOISE*.&nbsp; That's a point which even some Christians miss, and they claim it's part of their book!</p>
<p>I will grant that in the case of an organized gathering in which a part of the people are set aside especially for making vocal or instrumental music, they should know what they are doing.&nbsp; That would apply to a Wiccan gathering as much as to Sunday morning at St Whoever's church at the corner of 5th and Wherever.&nbsp; But we are not talking about that here.&nbsp; What we are talking about is the rest of us - and all of us in our own devotions.</p>
<p>There's a saying that tells folks to "Dance as if nobody's watching, and sing as if nobody's listening."&nbsp; That's the point!</p>
<p>And where do we find something to sing or chant?&nbsp; And what to choose?&nbsp; There are so many places!&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what can it do?&nbsp; Anything from being a secret mantra to being your "heavy atrillery" at your altar.&nbsp; It can help you focus, it can help you transition, and it might even raise a spiritual army for you!</p>
<p>Every path has its songs and its chants.&nbsp; And some of the most powerful are some of the most basic.&nbsp; And nobody is going to worry if you can carry a tune.&nbsp; But you might surprise yourself.&nbsp; In fact, you might surprise yourself in how many ways you surprise yourself!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ostara has much to offer us, and coming at the end of a winter like the one we had here only proves the point all the more.&nbsp; Between Yule and now, we had three individual storms, each of which people claim dumped more snow on us than we get in the typical year.&nbsp; In fact, Yule was impacted by one of those storms, and our Imbolc celebration was threatened by another.&nbsp; And finally, Hecate (Lord Pan's widow, age 20 and "The Kitty Queen") gets to sit in her sun window again.</p>

<p>Look at all of the lore from all of the different spiritual paths, and you'll see much in common in Ostara and in tales which have connection to Ostara in one way or another.&nbsp; And if there is a kernel of truth at the heart of every legend and there are so many legends so similar in places which did not know of each other, then we've got more hear than the idea that Spring has arrived.</p>

			<title>March 13, 2010 - Getting A Spiritual Experience!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/march_13_2010_getting_a_spiritual_experience_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>There are some folks who firmly believe that they have never had a spiritual experience.&nbsp; And some of those folks would indeed like to have one - or more.</p>
<p>Some are influenced by movies, and expect spiritual experience to be like that.&nbsp; Others have heard stories about saints and others and wondered why they were left out.&nbsp; I know of someone who claimed that she did everything one particular saint did, and nothing happened.&nbsp; When she asked the one who was supposed to be teaching her such things, the answer was "You aren't good enough."&nbsp; I might add "no kidding" to that, but enough of you have had similar experiences to know that I'm not kidding - it happens all too often.</p>
<p>And there are others who say that they have had few experiences which were not spitirual, at least in some way.&nbsp; What's the difference?</p>
<p>The differences that you might notice on the surface might indeed be there, but they might also be indicators of the real differences which are deeper.&nbsp; Does a person really have to be simple, for instance, or is it merely necessary to keep the intellect in its place and not let it affect the spiritual.&nbsp; Another difference which is exactly as it appears is that these people did not let others try to control their spiritual experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, how to bring it about?&nbsp; That's what this episode is about.</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[There are some folks who firmly believe that they have never had a spiritual experience.&nbsp; And some of those folks would indeed like to have one - or more.
Some are influenced by movies, and expect spiritual experience to be like that.&nbsp; Others have heard stories about saints and others and wondered why they were left out.&nbsp; I know of someone who claimed that she did everything one particular saint did, and nothing happened.&nbsp; When she asked the one who was supposed to be teaching her such things, the answer was "You aren't good enough."&nbsp; I might add "no kidding" to that, but enough of you have had similar experiences to know that I'm not kidding - it happens all too often.
And there are others who say that they have had few experiences which were not spitirual, at least in some way.&nbsp; What's the difference?
The differences that you might notice on the surface might indeed be there, but they might also be indicators of the real differences which are deeper.&nbsp; Does a person really have to be simple, for instance, or is it merely necessary to keep the intellect in its place and not let it affect the spiritual.&nbsp; Another difference which is exactly as it appears is that these people did not let others try to control their spiritual experience.&nbsp;
And so, how to bring it about?&nbsp; That's what this episode is about.
Blessed Be!]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>March 6, 2010 - A Most Basic Right!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/march_6_2010_a_most_basic_right_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A most basic right.&nbsp; In fact, it is one of your most basic rights!&nbsp; That's religious freedom.</p>
<p>The gentlemen who wrote the first ten ammendments to the United States Constitution (known as the Bill of Rights) took special care in the first ammendment.&nbsp; Not only did they not use language which made it sound like the government was granting the right of free religion to the peoplem they did more.&nbsp; They made two specific prohibitions: one against any law concerning an establishment of religion, and the other prohibiting any interference with the free exercise of religion.</p>
<p>Those who claim that the "founding fathers" only intended to protect Christianity have not read much of Thomas Jefferson or Thomas Payne - or a few others.&nbsp; And the funny thing is that some of the people making such claims belong to denominations which did not exist at the time the Constitution was written - so by their own argument, they would not be protected, either!</p>
<p>And so we come to Rav Patrick McCollum, a Wiccan chaplain who is well known in the field.&nbsp; He applied to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and they refused to look over his qualifications!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because he is not of one of the five faiths which they select their chaplains from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also exclude Hindus and Buddhists.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If you've ever visited California, you will find plenty of Buddhist and Hindus.&nbsp; Is anyone going to claim that none of them have ever been forced to serve a sentence?</p>
<p>There is much which can be done, and I'm trusting you to learn what that might be.</p>
<p>If it can be done to any one, it can be done to anyone, so now is the time to make our voices known.&nbsp; And if all of our voices are heard, people will realize that we will not back down.</p>
<p>After all, we are talking about a right which the Founding Fathers saw as being beyond government's reach.</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>

			<title>February 27, 2010 - If your devotional life provides a compass, where's the map?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/february_27_2010_if_your_devotional_life_provides_a_compass_where_s_the_map_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A while back, I spoke of your devotional life, and how that provided you with a compass for staying on course.&nbsp; So, what else do you need?</p>
<p>In my younger days, I learned how to handle a fairly large boat, and I attended US Power Squadron courses with my parents.&nbsp; I learned how to navigate a boat on a river.&nbsp; Later, I learned to fly an airplane, and that included the basics of how to navigate an airplane.&nbsp; And then, in the Air Force, I learned how to find my way on land, including if I was in a place where someone might dispute my right to be there.&nbsp; I used a compass in all three cases, but I also used a map.</p>
<p>And so, what is our map for our spiritual journey?&nbsp; It's something we know, and it's something we need to get to know.&nbsp; And it does not limit itself to spiritual matters, either.&nbsp; It applies in other forms of endeavor, perhaps especially the business world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can tell the people who don't have a map - they wander around like they don't know where they're going - but they probably will claim that they know.&nbsp; In the business world and in the supposedly-organized world of more esstablished faiths, it can sometimes be obvious to anyone who knows what to look for.&nbsp; In spiritual matters, it might not be as immediately evident - but it is there to be seen.</p>
<p>And so, what is this map, and how can we use it?</p>
<p>It's more than a map.&nbsp; It functions as the base camp for your spiritual expeditions, too!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>February 20th is Tempest Smith Day.</p>
<p>Tempest Kayne Smith died on February 20, 2001.&nbsp; She was twelve years old.</p>
<p>Many spiritual paths commemorate the life of a person on the anniversary of the person's death.&nbsp; The facrt that some Christian churches commemorate saints' days on the day of their death does not mean they have anything anywhere near exclusive.&nbsp; It comes from the Jewish Jahrzeit and ever-so-many other customs.</p>
<p>Tempest Smith died by her own hand, the victim of incessant bullying, and it appears that most of the bullying was because she was a Wiccan.</p>
<p>I see her as a patron where two issues are concerned.</p>
<p>One is religious freedom.&nbsp; Some people claim that there is religious freedom in the United States of America, but there didn't seem to be enough to protect Tempest Smith.</p>
<p>The other issue is that of victims of bullying.</p>
<p>There is much to be said here, and Itry to say it.</p>

			<title>February 13, 2010 - Your Friends In The Very Highest Places!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/february_13_2010_your_friends_in_the_very_highest_places_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Friends in the very highest places - you have them, and probably plenty of them.</p>
<p>Every spiritual path has them, and there are many terms used to describe them.&nbsp; My favorite is the pair of terms "Celestial Masters" and Ascended Masters".&nbsp; The difference is that we know for sure that Ascended Masters were once people just like the rest of us.&nbsp; Celestial Masters might not have ever been our kind of human.</p>
<p>Every tradition has them under one label or another, or maybe even a combination of labels.&nbsp; If you look at the Christian saints, for instance, you will find some who "just happen to match" with Pagan gods and goddesses - they were "adopted" by the Christians.</p>
<p>And, it seems apparent that they care about us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, some of them have reason to share interests and concern with us, especially Ascended Masters who had a concern during the time when they were on the same plane as you and I are now.</p>
<p>All this leads to some great possibilities - and some great opportunities for spiritual exploration.</p>
<p>Please note that they don't have to be on someone else's list to be on your list, any more than someone else would need to choose which deities you work with.&nbsp; In both cases, that's your business!</p>
<p>And you just might discover some interesting "folks" waiting to help you.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/february_6_2010_looking_at_groups]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We need to pause and take a look at groups.&nbsp; A group may be in your future.&nbsp; Perhaps more than one group might be in your future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I help preside over at least one such group, and two if you count the place in cyberspace.&nbsp; And I like to think that they are good groups which benefit all of their members.</p>
<p>I also recall the groups that I've walked away from, and one group that I ran away from!</p>
<p>In the right group, you will learn more, and you will learn more quickly than you ever could learn alone.&nbsp; In the wrong group, you'll learn the "party line" and little else.</p>
<p>In the right group, you can agree that you disagree within very reasonable limits.&nbsp; In the wrong group, sometimes even agreeing can get you shunned.</p>
<p>In the right group, you can have friends and confidantes to share life's burdens.&nbsp; In the wrong group, pseudo-human vipers can gossip your family, your career and even your life into oblivion.</p>
<p>In the right group, you will find fellowship and affirmation.&nbsp; In the wrong group, you might be manipulated into saying and doing things which you regret later.</p>
<p>That's one of the reasons for Isaac Bonewits' "Cult Evaluation Frame" which I will recommend to any and all.&nbsp; And there are a few more signs to watch out for.</p>
<p>It is important to know what to beware of.&nbsp; And there are some signs which you might be able to see.</p>
<p>Some faith is not supposed to be blind.&nbsp; Sometimes faith requires your eyes to be open.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I definitely say <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>our</strong></span> daily compass because of how badly I need to remind myself of this sometimes!</p>
<p>Like it or not, life is lived one day at a time.&nbsp; The problem with that is that most of our real goals take more than a day to achieve.&nbsp; And this leaves room for diversions, distractions and detours.</p>
<p>A colonel I once served under had a sign behind his desk which stated that when you are up to your posterior in snapping alligators, it is very difficult to remember that your initial objective was to drain the swamp.&nbsp; And that's the problem we are talking about here.</p>
<p>And those familiar with Martial Arts know the importance of understanding the flow of things, and making use of that.&nbsp; And so, if time is in cycles, we can take advantage of that to remember what our objective is.</p>
<p>This is especially true of our spiritual lives.&nbsp; The cycles of what we do spiritually can match the cycles which the world forces us into, and the result is that we can keep focus.</p>
<p>There are other tools too, which can help us focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The criteria are simple:&nbsp; That it works and that it fits.&nbsp; Especially that it fits your life.&nbsp; In my mroning devotions, I don't begin them when I wake up.&nbsp; I begin them when I am dressed and ready to go out into the world.&nbsp; My evening devotions reflect back on the day, and there's a weekly devotion that focuses on the week.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Last time, we had a celebration of 200 episodes, and I spoke some of my journey.&nbsp; This time, let's look at your journey - and everyone else's.<br/><br/>Some of the greatest journeys remain untraveled.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because someone &quot;was going to&quot; do one thing or another.&nbsp; Others get to their destinations because the people doing the traveling insisted.&nbsp; In fact, some journeys include what some people called impossible and what others tried hard to prevent.<br/><br/>You can tell that a goal is yours when the sight of someone who has the same (or similar) goal makes you ache - there's something there that needs to be yours!&nbsp; And you can tell when you're gotten to such a goal, because among your first thoughts after arriving are how much you can do as a result - and how it is part of your next journey.<br/><br/>Or might it be said that one journey is actually part of a larger journey?&nbsp; See what you think!&nbsp; <br/><br/>And there are ways to chart your journey.&nbsp; And, of course, the more waypoints you pass, the closer your destination.<br/><br/>Above all else, the journey requires getting into motion.&nbsp; That first step.&nbsp; Enjoy it! <br/><br/>Blessed Be!<br/><br type="_moz"/><input type="hidden" id="gwProxy"/><input type="hidden" id="jsProxy" onclick="jsCall();"/><div id="refHTML"></div>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Last time, we had a celebration of 200 episodes, and I spoke some of my journey.&nbsp; This time, let's look at your journey - and everyone else's.Some of the greatest journeys remain untraveled.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because someone &quot;was going to&quot; do one thing or another.&nbsp; Others get to their destinations because the people doing the traveling insisted.&nbsp; In fact, some journeys include what some people called impossible and what others tried hard to prevent.You can tell that a goal is yours when the sight of someone who has the same (or similar) goal makes you ache - there's something there that needs to be yours!&nbsp; And you can tell when you're gotten to such a goal, because among your first thoughts after arriving are how much you can do as a result - and how it is part of your next journey.Or might it be said that one journey is actually part of a larger journey?&nbsp; See what you think!&nbsp; And there are ways to chart your journey.&nbsp; And, of course, the more waypoints you pass, the closer your destination.Above all else, the journey requires getting into motion.&nbsp; That first step.&nbsp; Enjoy it! Blessed Be!]]></itunes:subtitle>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Sometimes, the most important lesson from a Sabbat is learned by looking back towards it.&nbsp; And we're doing just that.&nbsp; Lammas was last week.I've said before that there is an element of each Sabbat in every other Sabbat, and that no Sabbat is &quot;over&quot; until the Wheel Of The Year has turned all of the way to the next year's iteration of the same Sabbat.&nbsp; And so, some of the most powerful learning to be gotten from any Sabbat is to be gained by looking forward and backward from that Sabbat to the others.&nbsp; And, we had a ritual at the Lammas celebration.&nbsp; It included many things, but one stood out in my mind:&nbsp; naming the seeds which we may have planted but which we did not want to harvest.&nbsp; Even the most Pollyanna of &quot;fluff-bunnies&quot; will admit that that is a real issue.&nbsp; So much so that there was even a classic sci-fi movie which was aimed at exposing a threat of which most magickal folk are only too aware.And we're going to face that.&nbsp; And maybe we can see how to claim victory over such a &quot;thing&quot;.&nbsp; Perhaps the most difficult thing is realizing that you actually can do that!Blessed Be!]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[Dan Brown has transformed another one of his books into a major Hollywood movie.&nbsp; And I cannot help but wonder if there is going to be the same sort of stir created by &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; as was created by &quot;The DaVinci Code.&quot;<br/><br/>First off, one thing needs to be understood: in both cases, he appears to have had the intent of writing a fiction novel to entertain us.&nbsp; But there are those who took it too seriously, as if it were a documentary revealing something.&nbsp; And then there were those who took it too seriously, as if it were revealing a proprietary secret which they are supposed to guard.&nbsp; And there are those who don't take it seriously enough, as if there were nothing there.<br/><br/>If we do explore this, what do we do?&nbsp; The same thing as for any other exploration.&nbsp; First off, you get past what's completely fiction.&nbsp; An organization with a purported history going back centuries before its actual founding is as useless as the cowboy movie &quot;hero&quot; who manages to shoot 25 shots from a six-shooter without reloading!<br/><br/>Get beyond that, and we know what is worth looking for.&nbsp; Once you find that, then the exploring can really begin.&nbsp; And this is where you can have some spiritual excitement!<br/><br/>Blessed Be!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/january_17_2009_forging_ahead_but_how_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>Now, we begin to walk forward.<br/><br/>In the last few months, if there has been any kind of recurring theme in my podcasts it would be that of putting any obstacles out of the way.&nbsp; <br/><br/>So then, you ask, what now?<br/><br/>Now, you begin to move forward toward your spiritual goal.&nbsp; It's your turn now.<br/><br/>There are stories about others, but this is your turn.&nbsp; Who is to say that what worked for someone else is going to work equally well for you?&nbsp; But, we can learn from the stories.<br/><br/>First, of course, we need to separate the spiritually successful from the successfully sanctimonious, at least for purposes of this exercise.&nbsp; <br/><br/>Some of the successfully spiritual were very simple people.&nbsp; Not much education, not much money, and in some cases considered to be not terribly smart.&nbsp; <br/><br/>But others who were successfully spiritual (and spiritually successful) had very powerful intellects and knew how to use it.&nbsp; So, what would they have in common with the simpler folk?<br/><br/>I offer an illustration which, I believe, brings out the point.<br/><br/>And with that, a journey begins.<br/><br/>Blessed Be!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Now, we begin to walk forward.In the last few months, if there has been any kind of recurring theme in my podcasts it would be that of putting any obstacles out of the way.&nbsp; So then, you ask, what now?Now, you begin to move forward toward your spiritual goal.&nbsp; It's your turn now.There are stories about others, but this is your turn.&nbsp; Who is to say that what worked for someone else is going to work equally well for you?&nbsp; But, we can learn from the stories.First, of course, we need to separate the spiritually successful from the successfully sanctimonious, at least for purposes of this exercise.&nbsp; Some of the successfully spiritual were very simple people.&nbsp; Not much education, not much money, and in some cases considered to be not terribly smart.&nbsp; But others who were successfully spiritual (and spiritually successful) had very powerful intellects and knew how to use it.&nbsp; So, what would they have in common with the simpler folk?I offer an illustration which, I believe, brings out the point.And with that, a journey begins.Blessed Be!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>November 29, 2008: Thanksgiving And Giving Thanks!</title>

            <description><![CDATA[In the United States, the fourth Thursday in November is the federal holiday known as Thanksgiving Day.&nbsp; Many other countries have a thanksgiving day of some sort during the course of the year.&nbsp; In the case of the US, it is claimed to commemorate a celebration had by the Plymouth Pilgrims to celebrate a bountiful harvest after a hard winter in which many of them died of starvation and cold.&nbsp; <br/><br/>It is a mundane holiday, and we are spiritual people.&nbsp; What can we do with this?<br/><br/>This is a celebration of &quot;the harvest&quot; in the same manner as Lammas, Mabon and Samhain are the celebrations of three distinct harvests.&nbsp; For those of us in modern times, this might not seem so apparent to someone whose food comes not from a field but from a supermarket.&nbsp; But there had to be a harvest even if you and I don't experience it.<br/><br/>Another dimension of the mundane Thanksgiving holiday is the number of families who come together, some of them overcoming miles and others setting aside issues for the sake of the celebration.&nbsp; How well I remember trips to Duluth (Minnesota) for Thanksgiving.&nbsp; What a way to give thanks, including for family!<br/><br/>But it is a time set aside for giving thanks.<br/><br/>And the kind of thanks we can give at such a special time (or any other time we set aside) is more than just thanks.&nbsp; It is the basis of something which we can build upon!&nbsp; And build we shall!<br/><br/>Blessed Be!<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[In the United States, the fourth Thursday in November is the federal holiday known as Thanksgiving Day.&nbsp; Many other countries have a thanksgiving day of some sort during the course of the year.&nbsp; In the case of the US, it is claimed to commemorate a celebration had by the Plymouth Pilgrims to celebrate a bountiful harvest after a hard winter in which many of them died of starvation and cold.&nbsp; It is a mundane holiday, and we are spiritual people.&nbsp; What can we do with this?This is a celebration of &quot;the harvest&quot; in the same manner as Lammas, Mabon and Samhain are the celebrations of three distinct harvests.&nbsp; For those of us in modern times, this might not seem so apparent to someone whose food comes not from a field but from a supermarket.&nbsp; But there had to be a harvest even if you and I don't experience it.Another dimension of the mundane Thanksgiving holiday is the number of families who come together, some of them overcoming miles and others setting aside issues for the sake of the celebration.&nbsp; How well I remember trips to Duluth (Minnesota) for Thanksgiving.&nbsp; What a way to give thanks, including for family!But it is a time set aside for giving thanks.And the kind of thanks we can give at such a special time (or any other time we set aside) is more than just thanks.&nbsp; It is the basis of something which we can build upon!&nbsp; And build we shall!Blessed Be!]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>November 15, 2008: The 10 Most Popular Ways To Destroy Your Own Spirituality!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://secrets.libsyn.com/november_15_2008_the_10_most_popular_ways_to_destroy_your_own_spirituality_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Here are the ten most popular ways to destroy your own spiritual life!</p>
<p>With the coming and going of Samhain, we have the end of one year and the beginning of another year.&nbsp; And this is a most appropriate time to reflect for a bit on some of the most basic of basics.</p>
<p>Everyone from the Pope and the Dahlai Lama down to frizzy-haired church gossips will offer advice on how to have a quality spiritual life.&nbsp; Some of the advice might be excellent.&nbsp; But, there is so much of &quot;how-to&quot;.</p>
<p>Some folks take another approach and speak of &quot;how not to&quot;.&nbsp; They show the more common shortcomings of some efforts in hopes that we'll avoid repeating the mistakes of others.</p>
<p>Here' I've taken a third approach.&nbsp; Every day, there are people whose spiritual life just sort of whimpers.&nbsp; One day, someone wakes up and suddenly discovers that their spiritual life is not only gone, it has been gone for a long time.&nbsp; So, I've decided to show how to make your spiritual life do an outright crash-and-burn!</p>
<p>Now, of course, it is not my intent to encourage you to be spectatular failures.&nbsp; Rather, it is my hope that in this list of the most popular ways to colossal spiritual failure, you'll find some clues as to how to be a major success.</p>
<p>As is often the case in many fields, the difference between success and failure is the grasping of a basic principle.&nbsp; Take marketing as an example.&nbsp; One store prospers over the long run, while another store does very well initially but then just sort of dies and goes out of business.&nbsp; There's a principle that says that once you've got the customer to come to your store, you need to give that customer reason to come again.&nbsp; And so one store flourishes over time while another store seems to be doing very well and then suddenly begins to wither away.&nbsp; It's the same thing with your spiritual life.</p>
<p>And perhaps there might be some clues here as to how to make your spiritual life sizzle!</p>
