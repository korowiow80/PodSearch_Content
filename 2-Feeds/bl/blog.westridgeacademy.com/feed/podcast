<div>How does an NBA ball player end up at West Ridge Academy?  Stranger stories have been told, but we thought you might want to hear this one.   In this podcast, we ask how Shawn ended up at West Ridge Academy serving as current Board Chairman.  He shares two very important keys to success for any life situation, including something that seems to be a problem in much of society.  He also makes an interesting comment about why some NBA athletes never really make it in the league. Shawn has spoken with thousands of youth throughout his career and now he serves the youth of West Ridge Academy.  We are lucky to have him here at the academy and on this podcast.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>***WARNING*** Information in this article is of a sensitive nature and contains frank information regarding sexual topics.  If this Information is offensive or undesired, please do not continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>West Ridge Academy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second podcast in this series on pornography addiction, this episode asks the question, &#8220;What is the difference between pornography addiction and healthy sexuality?&#8221; Eric Allred, LMFT joins Jeff again as they discuss how pornography acts like a drug and causes brain dysfunction.</p>
<p>During the podcast, we mention the symptoms and effects of pornography addiction. The following is a list of these effects based on current research:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not caring about women/men as real human beings; just thinking of them as objects</li>
<li>Starting to think rape isn&#8217;t a serious crime</li>
<li>Having a twisted view of sexuality (thinking of sexuality in unhealthy ways)</li>
<li>Not caring about having a long-term, stable relationship with one person (monogamous relationship)</li>
<li>Thinking your spouse isn&#8217;t a good enough sex partner</li>
<li>Beginning to think that marriage isn&#8217;t important</li>
<li>Not really caring about having children or raising a family</li>
<li>Thinking it&#8217;s normal and natural to have casual sex with many people</li>
<li>Trying out &#8212; or wanting to try out &#8212; sexual behaviors that aren&#8217;t healthy, legal, or natural (these behavior are also called sexually deviant behaviors)</li>
<li>Having a lot of struggles and problems in your close relationships</li>
<li>Thinking rape victims are the ones who are to blame for being raped and that rapists don&#8217;t need to be punished for their crimes</li>
<li> Being much more likely to commit sexual abuse</li>
<li>Becoming sexually aggressive (violent or forceful)</li>
<li>Being more likely to get separated or divorced</li>
<li>Thinking the best sexual relationships are the ones that don&#8217;t involve emotional involvement or commitment</li>
<li>Being more likely to cheat on your spouse (emotionally and/or physically)</li>
<li>Being more likely to lose your job or get kicked out of college</li>
<li>Threatening the well-being of children in your home by straining marriage relationships, causing financial burdens, and increasing your children&#8217;s risk of being exposed to pornography</li>
<li>Starting to think that explicit or offensive sexual material isn&#8217;t that big of a deal (becoming desensitized)</li>
<li>Beginning to think that uncommon or unusual sexual activities (such as group sex or sex with animals) are normal and happen a lot</li>
<li>Losing the trust of those in close relationships</li>
<li>Developing a negative body image (thinking negatively about your body)</li>
<li>Getting wrong information about human sexual behavior</li>
<li>Being more likely to have oral, anal, or group sex</li>
<li>Being more likely to develop compulsive or addictive sexual behavior (in other words, being more likely to lose control over how often and how long you act out sexually)</li>
</ol>

<p>In this podcast, West Ridge Academy Clinical Director, Amy Whittaker sits down with Jeff and discusses therapy in general. Does therapy work? What works best? In many cases a synergy occurs when a clinical problem is addressed using multiple methods. We start by discussing a recent study which found that up to half of severe mental health issues are not treated. We look at why some people resist getting therapeutic help even though it is clear that therapy is effective.  We also discuss the West Ridge multi-faceted approach to clinical issues.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Is substance abuse the same as when I was a teen?&#8221; In today&#8217;s world, statistics suggest that most teens will try to abuse some substance prior to graduating high school.  It is almost abnormal to not experiment or be curious about drug use.  This doesn&#8217;t mean that parents should not be concerned about a child who is using substances.  In fact, most students hide their substance use from their parents so if parents are seeing signs, then it may signal that it is time to find out a little more about it.  Additionally, we know that the more a parent is permissive, the more likely a child is to become dependent.  In this podcast, we try to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy.   We were able to pick the brains of Fiona Ray and Christina Howard of Visions, adolescent treatment centers, based out of Malibu, California.  There is an interesting discussion about the latest trends in substance abuse, parent involvement in treatment and more.</p>

Part of our discussion focuses on what kind of problems a child could have if their parents neglect or overemphasize any of the four tasks that we have been talking about.</p>
<p>It is important for parents to understand that most parents don&#8217;t do everything well. It can be helpful to find another person that can teach your child the piece that you are missing.</p>
<p>Whenever we start a new activity or try to form a new habit we meet resistance. This is especially true when you try to change the your parenting style and technique. Stick with it. There will be resistance from your children. If you persist, however, you will develop new habits for your family and the new parenting style will become normal for your family.</p>
