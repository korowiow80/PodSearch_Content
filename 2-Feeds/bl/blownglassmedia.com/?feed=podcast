<p>The ability to create positive change and to make a difference in the world by expressing one’s own thoughts, ideas, and visions should not be taken lightly. These thoughts, ideas, and visions will ultimately alter our current reality, creating the kind of changes we all want to see happen in our world.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Let’s consider this:</p>
<p>We are in the age of youtube.com, and micro blogging, we are in the midst of an explosion of self expression. as a mater of fact are you making a movie? Well who the heck needs distribution right?</p>
<p>I’ve heard people say, I’m just as talented as Justin Bieber and I’ve had my youtube videos up for months but I’ve only been able to get a few hundred views. I’m not a search engine marketing guru so what do I do now? It seems like this age of self expression comes with a bottle neck effect.</p>
<p>So the question for the our modern age is really ..How do you filter your voice through the chaos of this explosion to be seen or heard by a massive audience? This is where BlownGlass Media comes in with what we are calling the Butterfly Revolution.</p>
<p>We are all neighbors on a global scale and while everyone acknowledges that to be true, we don’t practice it in theory. Most people are stuck in their regional part of the world. For example when we launched the behind the scenes Xperience for the movie, Idiots=Product+ Money, in our top 10 list Canada was closer to the bottom coming in at #10 for viewers and website hits.</p>
<p>Unlike other media sharing platforms like youtube, daily motion, Vimeo, Facebook &amp; Myspace videos BlownGlass Media bridges the gap allowing the new age online producer to conn ect with a massive audience around the world. the ability to connect the new age online producer with a massive audience is the Butterfly Revolution.</p>
<p>It is our belief that our efforts will transform and revolutionize an entire industry.<br />
because the leaders of the world tomorrow will not just be the men and women with the ability to express themselves, but rather the men and women who have mastered the Art of self expression, but most importantly it will be those men and woman with the platform &amp; audience to do so.</p>

The ability to create positive change and to make a difference in the world by expressing one’s own thoughts, ideas, and visions should not be taken lightly. These thoughts, ideas, and visions will ultimately alter our current reality, creating the kind of changes we all want to see happen in our world.

What does that mean?

Let’s consider this:

We are in the age of youtube.com, and micro blogging, we are in the midst of an explosion of self expression. as a mater of fact are you making a movie? Well who the heck needs distribution right?

I’ve heard people say, I’m just as talented as Justin Bieber and I’ve had my youtube videos up for months but I’ve only been able to get a few hundred views. I’m not a search engine marketing guru so what do I do now? It seems like this age of self expression comes with a bottle neck effect.

So the question for the our modern age is really ..How do you filter your voice through the chaos of this explosion to be seen or heard by a massive audience? This is where BlownGlass Media comes in with what we are calling the Butterfly Revolution.

We are all neighbors on a global scale and while everyone acknowledges that to be true, we don’t practice it in theory. Most people are stuck in their regional part of the world. For example when we launched the behind the scenes Xperience for the movie, Idiots=Product+ Money, in our top 10 list Canada was closer to the bottom coming in at #10 for viewers and website hits.

It is our belief that our efforts will transform and revolutionize an entire industry.
