      <description>This week is a special show folks.  Earl Scruggs passed away this past week and me and Cleo and Harley are dedicating this show to his memory.  We've picked out some great songs that he helped record back in 1945 to 1948 with Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys.  Then we took the first album him and Lester made with the Foggy Mountain Boys and picked out some more.  We hope you enjoy what we selected.  Rest in peace Earl.</description>
