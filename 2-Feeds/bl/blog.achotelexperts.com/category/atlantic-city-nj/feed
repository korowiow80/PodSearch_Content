<p><strong>Atlantic City, NJ</strong> &#8211; Contrary to what people may believe, there are plenty of family friendly activities that can make your next trip to Atlantic City one to remember for the entire family.  In this article, we will cover the top family oriented attractions, hotels and casinos that cater to adults and children of all ages and highlight some really fun things to do in AC.  You&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised of the what you can do, we guarantee it.</p>
<h2>Hotels and Casinos Fit for a Family</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by mentioning the casinos and hotels that are good fits for the entire family.  Harrah&#8217;s Casino Resort is located in the Marina District across from the Borgata and Golden Nugget <a href="http://www.achotelexperts.com/casinos/golden-nugget-atlantic-city.html">www.achotelexperts.com/casinos/golden-nugget-atlantic-city.html</a> Casinos.  Although it&#8217;s not on the beach, you will find an amazing Resort Style Pool that offers a limited schedule for children to swim, but, to make up for the small window, they created the Family Fun Center specifically for families.  It is located in the Harbour Tower and features at least one full days worth of indoor activities.</p>
<p><strong>Harrah&#8217;s Casino Family Fun Center</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find a large indoor pool and outdoor sundeck, a family friendly hot tub, 18 holes of miniature golf, water balloon game called &#8220;Water Wars&#8221;, over 25 incredible arcade games with a ticket / prize redemption center, indoor shuffleboard, island music all day and a full service beverage bar.  You can travel to nearby Brigantine Beach or to the Boardwalk area very easily by car or jitney and there are 10 food outlets of all levels throughout the hotel.  Pretty much every casino has an indoor or seasonal pool, so they will be comfortable in that regard.</p>

</ol>
<h3>Honorable Mention for your Family Vacation at the New Jersey Shore</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day at the Beach</strong> &#8211; this is a must, the beaches in Atlantic City are free and are annually ranked at the top of the list for beach goers.  In front of your hotel or the new Revel Beach or anywhere within the two miles of beaches that has a life guard on duty.</li>

<li><strong>Largest Pipe Organ in the World Tour</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not kidding, this is an amazing tour, the organ is located in Boardwalk Hall, too see how huge this is and the history behind it, you&#8217;ll be able to stump anyone on many trivia questions, don&#8217;t miss this one</li>
<li><strong>James or Fralingers Salt Water Taffy</strong> &#8211; no trip to the Jersey Shore is complete without stopping in for Salt Water Taffy and candy, located in many locations on the boardwalk.</li>

<li><strong>Korean War Veterans Memorial</strong> &#8211; located in on the Boardwalk in the Brighton Park Pavilion, a cool lesson about the Korean War.</li>
<li><strong>Tanger Outlets &#8221; The Walk &#8220;</strong> &#8211; your teenagers will love a day of outdoor shopping at Outlet Stores of all levels, one of the largest Outlet Shopping area&#8217;s on the east coast.</li>
<li><strong>Lucy The Elephant</strong> &#8211; located in Margate, NJ just 5 miles down the beach, this has cool history and is fun for younger kids.</li>
<li><strong>Story Book Land</strong> &#8211; this would be ranked higher, it&#8217;s only 6 miles from Atlantic City and is an award winning fantasy-land with rides and amusements that your children will never forget, I still remember, LOL.</li>
<li><strong>Jet Ski&#8217;s</strong> &#8211; they may be found at Revel Beach, if so, they deserve to moved up, for now the closest location is Ocean City, NJ 10 miles south.</li>
<li><strong>Ocean City, NJ Boardwalk</strong> - located 10 miles south, a trip to the Ocean City Boardwalk is another great family vacation idea, check out Mack Manco&#8217;s Pizza, Bob&#8217;s Lemonade, Johnson&#8217;s Popcorn and the rides at Wonderland Pier and Play-land, you may even go here twice if you choose.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure this article satisfies any questions on the topic of, is Atlantic City Family friendly?   You can a weeks vacation in AC for your entire family and still see everything.  There are additional things to do like Boardwalk Bicycle Rentals, Ride in the Rolling Chairs, Other Arcades, Segway Rentals and the list goes on.</p>

<p><strong>March 30, 2012 &#8211; Atlantic City, NJ</strong> The Showboat Casino announces, <strong>Worship Surf Bar</strong> will open April 2, 2012 with beach service beginning on Memorial Day Weekend. Inspired by the best beach bars in Florida &amp; California, Worship Surf Bar is unique because it&#8217;s located on Delaware &amp; States avenue beach in Atlantic City and offers some of the best waves for surfers in southern New Jersey.  (States Ave is one of three approved surfing beaches.)</p>
<h2>Worship Surf Bar at <a href="http://www.achotelexperts.com/casinos/showboat.html" class="kblinker" title="More about Showboat Atlantic City &raquo;">Showboat Atlantic City</a></h2>
<ul>
<li> Outdoor Boardwalk Patio with board racks for surfers</li>
<li> 8 large flat-screen TVs that will show Fuse TV, local sports like Phillies games etc</li>
<li>Flip flops and board shorts welcome, beach attire is the vibe.</li>
<li>Visitors can check out classic photo&#8217;s from decades of Atlantic City surf culture including the OP Pro in 1983.</li>
<li>Incredible food from Crossroads at the HOB, a Aaron Sanchez celebrity chef experience.</li>
<li>Amazing drink menu with $3 Miller Lite drafts<br />
Signature cocktails such as:  <br />
- The Wipeout (Absolut Berri Açai vodka, Rockstar Energy drink and cranberry juice)<br />
- The Big Kahuna (Malibu Coconut rum, Malibu Black rum, pineapple and cranberry juices and grenadine)<br />
- The Barrel (Avión tequila, raspberry liqueur, sour mix and orange juice)</li>
<li>(Seasonal) Beginning Memorial Day Weekend, Worship Surf Bar will offer beach service for those hanging out on the beach. If you are relaxing in the designated &#8220;Worship Surf&#8221; area, you will be able to order directly from a beach server and receive you food and beverages from her.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crossroads at the House of Blues</h3>
<p>Worship Surf Bar’s food menu will feature creative selections from the new Crossroads at House of Blue restaurant created by Food TV Network, celebrity chef, Aaron Sanchez.  Food options will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazing Tacos &#8211; citrus marinated steak tacos with Cotija cheese and roasted tomatillo salsa. </li>
<li>Grilled Flat Breads &#8211; with options like basil pesto and tomato, wild mushroom &amp; crispy prosciutto.</li>
<li>Chicken Wings &#8211; in flavors such as smoked tomato BBQ sauce, Jamaican jerk style or Buffalo style.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Revel Beach opening just a few blocks down and Worship Surf Bar opening April 2, 2012, this area of beach is where you will find, hot surfers in top shape and beautiful gals in bikini&#8217;s.  This area get&#8217;s my vote for Best Beaches in Atlantic City for the summer season Revel Beach, States and Delaware Ave and stop by the Worship Beach Bar at the Showboat Casino on the Boardwalk and don&#8217;t forget the waitress service on the beach the designated service area.<br />

When I say this is a state-of-the-art parking facility, it may be an understatement.  The cost to build was $32 million, features such as 1,677 solar panels on the top floor that generate over 400 kilowatt hours per day, glass enclosed elevators, over 16,000 square feet of retail space, 1,180 parking spaces, 5 levels of parking and several payment stations.  This one is amazing, there are 6 charging stations for electric cars of the future.  Customers can pay for parking using EZ Pass, Cash, Debit Card or Credit. When a local business validates your parking ticket, you receive a special price of $4 for up to 2 hours.  There are all kinds of pricing benefits for Tanger Outlet employee&#8217;s and others.  Special monthly fee of $50 [...]]]></description>

<p>Atlantic City Tourism District and Casino Authority Shift in Power bills S &#8211; 11 and S -12 signed into law.</p>
<p>The sun is beginning to shine on Atlantic City, recents news point to a bright future lead by Governor Chris Christie.</p>
<h2>Atlantic City Tourism District</h2>
<p>NJ State Bill S &#8211; 11 was signed on February 1, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Atlantic City Tourism District</strong> boundaries will most likely include, the world famous Boardwalk, all casinos, The Walk AC Outlets, Bader Field Casino district and the Marina district where Harrah&#8217;s and Borgata are located.  The goal of the state controlled tourism district is to do many things, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep Atlantic City visitor&#8217;s and business owners safe</li>
<li>Attract new businesses into the Boardwalk area Tourism area</li>
<li>Promote and market Atlantic City as a tourist destination</li>
<li>The CRDA will oversee all the functions of the New Tourism District</li>
<li>Beautify existing area&#8217;s within the boundaries of the Tourism District and upgrade existing infrastructure as well as creating new.</li>
<li>Attract new and previous large citywide convention groups</li>
<li>much more.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tourism district bill be transfer all processes and duties of the ACCVA Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Authority to CRDA.  This includes tourism marketing, convention marketing, management of Boardwalk Hall and the Convention Center etc.  Another agency called the ACSID The <em>Atlantic City</em> Special Improvement District will also be run by the CRDA, this group is a nonprofit organization that works to beautify the city and to enhance local businesses, especially the entrances to the city, they also have many public works &amp; cleaning responsibilities.</p>
<p>Newly signed bill S &#8211; 12 will shift the power from the Casino Control Commission to the Division of Gaming Enforcement and eventually to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.  This shift is the largest step ever taken since casino gambling began in <strong>Atlantic City</strong> in 1978.  The DGE under the direction of the State Attorney General&#8217;s office will assume the majority of the casino regulatory powers from the CCC, including, deciding casino licensing &amp; registration, casino operating areas within the city and overseeing new gaming rules.</p>
<p>In addition to these two bills, Governor Christie announced that <a href="http://www.achotelexperts.com/casinos/revel-casino.html" class="kblinker" title="More about Revel Casino &raquo;">Revel Casino</a>, which was a stalled project, has recently acquired over $1 billion dollars in private funding to continue building <strong>Revel Atlantic City</strong>.  Construction will begin again February 14 and Revel <em>Atlantic City</em> should be ready to open in June 2012.</p>

<p>Atlantic City and Monopoly, Perfect Together.</p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>There have been many accounts of who actually invented the game of Monopoly.  The bottom line is that  Charles Darrow is best known for creating an <strong>Atlantic City</strong> variation of &#8220;<strong>Monopoly</strong>&#8220;, the  original game was called &#8220;The Lanlords Game&#8221;. Darrow was a salesman of heating and  engineering equipment but lost his job during the great depression, triggered by the stock  market crash of 1929.  He decided to create a handmade versions of the game and sell copies to his close friends. He launched Monopoly in 1933 and it quickly became a huge  success, so he decided to patent his inevntion. What&#8217;s truly amazing, is that today, the value of the properties on the <strong>Monopoly</strong> game board reflect the actual condition of the real streets in <em>Atlantic City, NJ</em> with Boardwalk and Park Place being the nicest and Mediterranean and Baltic being the slums.</p>
<p><strong>Atlantic City</strong> became the inspiration for game inventor Charles Darrow&#8217;s &#8220;Monopoly&#8221; game because of his fondness for childhood vacations spent in the beachside city. He often played a game called &#8220;The Landlords Game&#8221; with his friends, came up with the idea to apply Atlantic City to the existing game.  Darrow was an unemployed Philadelphian at the time of the game&#8217;s invention, and most of the &#8220;real estate&#8221; for sale in the game is based on actual streets in <em>Atlantic City, New Jersey</em>, with one in-famous  exception.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marvin Gardens&#8221; in the <strong>Monopoly</strong> Board Game is a misspelling of &#8220;Marven Gardens&#8221;, a suburb of<em> Atlantic City</em>. &#8220;Marven&#8221; gets its name as a hybrid of &#8220;MARgate City&#8221; and  &#8220;VENtnor City&#8221;, and is not just an odd spelling of the popular male name &#8220;Marvin&#8221;.  Hasbro, the game&#8217;s current owner, made an official apology to residents of Marven Gardens, perhaps as a publicity move, in the late 1990s. While Charles Darrow cannot be given full credit for inventing the game alone, he is a kind of a folk hero to many, especially inventors trying to create the next great phase!   Biggest lesson to learn, the first one to Patent and Trademark wins.</p>
<p>Atlantic City&#8217;s connection in the Monopoly game allowed for the nickname, &#8220;Monopoly City&#8221; and brought extra attention to the Jersey Shore, a popular vacation destination on the Atlantic Ocean. <strong>Monopoly</strong> landmarks, photos, and plaques are located around Atlantic City and are dedicated to the game and its &#8220;inventor&#8221; Charles Darrow. The city gladly embraces its Monopoly heritage, and perhaps some tourists include Atlantic City on their vacations simply because of the Monopoly Game connection. Unfortunately for Atlantic City, newer versions of the game have completely abandoned the once prestigous, New Jersey Shore Town.</p>
<p>The royalties from the sales of Monopoly made Darrow a multi millionaire. He retired at age 46 and lived the rest of his life in Bucks County, Pennsylvania about one hour from <strong>Atlantic City</strong>, enjoying a world travel and became a collector of exotic orchids.  Many families may not be aware of the interesting history of the game Monopoly, but the  game continues to be enjoyed from one generation to the next.</p>
<p><strong>Monopoly Game Facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Monopoly Game Board consists of forty spaces; 28 properties (22 colored streets, 4 railroads and 2 utilities), 3 Chance spaces, 3 Community Chest spaces, a Luxury Tax space, an Income Tax space, and the 4 corner squares: GO, In Jail / Just Visiting, Free Parking, and go to Jail.</li>
<li>Monopoly Railroad facts; Short Line is believed to refer to the Shore Fast Line, a streetcar line that served Atlantic City and Philadelphia. A booklet included in the 1935 edition states that the four railroads that served Atlantic City in the mid 1930s were the Jersey Central, the Seashore Lines, the Reading Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.</li>
<li>The longest MONOPOLY® game ever played was 1,680 hours long. That is 70 straight  days!</li>
<li>Over 250 million sets of the MONOPOLY® game have been sold worldwide.</li>
<li>The character locked behind the bars is called Jake the Jailbird. Officer Edgar Mallory sent him to jail.</li>
<li>The total amount of money in a standard MONOPOLY® game is $15,140.</li>
<li>In Cuba, the game had a strong following until Fidel Castro took power and ordered all known sets destroyed.</li>
</ul>

The <strong>amazing Steel Pier Amusements </strong>also has 24 exciting rides, including games and prize wheels. Some of the rides are the giant slide, rock-climbing wall, dragon jets, mini rocket, and the kiddy coaster.</p>
<p>Not all the fun is for the kids here either.  Adults can find a good time at The <strong>Pier Shops at Caesars</strong>, which is a four-story shopping mall. Inside there are shops such as Tourneau, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, and Burberry.</p>
<p>So no matter what, you know you&#8217;ll find fun for anyone here at the <em>Atlantic City Boardwalk.</em> </p>

<h2>ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey</h2>
<p>A new bill that allows two casinos with 200 rooms has been approved by the NJ State Senate, as reported by The Press of <em>Atlantic City</em>.  Current casino legislation allows only 500 room hotel casinos, but bill proposed allows for 200 room casinos that will expand to 500 rooms within 5 years.  The bill is in response to current economic conditions in <strong>Atlantic City, New Jersey</strong>, where projects struggle to find investment capital, this bill will act as a stimulus to spur grwoth in the resort town.</p>
<p>The first interested party is Hard Rock International, they said that if the bill is approved it will move to begin immediate work on its proposed Atlantic City casino hotel.  Step one is the Design work, the Hard Rock casino estimates it would take about six to eight months, with construction spanning over another 18 to 22 months, Jimmy Allen said. Although the Hard Rock is far from finalizing its designs, preliminary plans call for 200 to 300 hotel rooms to start, eventually building up to 500.  &#8220;We&#8217;re committed to going ahead and meeting the 500-room minimum,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Hard Rock Casino remains one of the few developers serious about building a new <em>casino in Atlantic City, NJ</em>, a gaming market mired in a significant revenue slump and impacted by competitors in nearby states. Atlantic City, New Jersey has been further hindered by a sluggish economy, but Jim Allen said there are signs of a recovery on the horizon. He believes <strong>Atlantic City, NJ</strong> has absorbed the worst of the initial impact from the rival Pennsylvania casinos.  &#8220;There are a lot of good things happening in Atlantic City if you begin reading between the lines,&#8221; he said.  Hard Rock is encouraged by Southwest Airlines pending takeover of AirTran Airways, a carrier that serves Atlantic City International Airport (ACY) from Atlanta. The merger potentially means expanded AirTran service to Atlantic City or Southwest could bring in its own brand of flights to <em>Atlantic City</em>.</p>
