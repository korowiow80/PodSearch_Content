            <title>16 BlueWave Media Cafe - Kimberly Beaven</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to BlueWave Media Cafe's first mobile podcast, but our 16th podcast. Today, with host Kimberly Beaven, we will talk about small business marketing's basics. First, you need a logo and branding identity. Remember, in order to use that image/logo in your marketing you need an .eps, that can be colour separated, not just a .tiff or .bmp. As well, you need to have a consistent use of that image - on your fax cover sheet, your letterhead, business cards, online and in print ads. It is not about spending a lot of money but just spending it wisely; print two collateral pieces such as flyers together to save on printing costs, or purchase the paper you are going to use through out the year in bulk to save some extra cash. You have set aside money for an actual marketing strategy haven't you? You advertising should be a reflection of you, after all you are your business. There needs to be a "you flavour" in how you market the business. It shoud also be an outpouring of your business plan and mission statement. Your business plan sets the direction in which you will proceed and helps you identify your overall business health. If you haven't made one yet, get to it! Every business needs one! This will also direct you in your product and services that you offer. If a service/product is not profitable, then maybe you need to look at removing  or replacing it. Finally, your advertising and marketing should be measurable. You need to know if your hard work is paying off. This is the only way to make intelligent decision on the type, or style of marketing that works for your particular business.
