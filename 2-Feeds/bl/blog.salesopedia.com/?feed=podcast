			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Steven Rosen</strong> is an expert in leveraging sales coaching. He advocates for the front line sales manager.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jeff Koser</strong> defines a zebra as a perfect prospect. In this podcast he explains his process of quantifying a prospect against seven quick questions to determine if you should pursue the prospect or not. Jeff suggests when you look at a zebra you know exactly what you are looking at … the same applies to the perfect prospect. The lion is the main predator of zebras; you will enjoy the metaphor he uses when he compares the hunting techniques of inexperienced and experienced lions which have strong parallels to sales people. Jeff claims an individual can close 90% of zebras by using the sales process he outlines in his book. That by itself is worth the listen!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sellingtozebras.com" target="new">Jeff Koser</a> has more than thirty years of experience in consulting, executive sales management, business strategy, and business development in various industries. His current consulting customers range from Global 2000 companies to companies aspiring to make an initial public stock offering.
