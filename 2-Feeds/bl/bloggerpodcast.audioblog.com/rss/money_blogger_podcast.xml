      <title>Interview with Michael Mihalik, author of Debt is Slavery</title>
      <description><![CDATA[My guest for this podcast is Michael Mihalik. He's the author of a new book, Debt Is Slavery.

Michael's story starts in a common way: he got his first credit card in high school, and soon started spending beyond his means. After college he got a good job, which led to a higher credit limit, allowing him to spend even more.

Much of what Michael bought with credit were things of no lasting value. He realized he was left mostly with debt, not things, and ultimately he felt enslaved by the debt.

Michael turned things around and found his way out of debt by achieving a mental shift in his view of money. He describes some of this experience in the interview, and gives us a preview of the 10 of the lessons about money that he learned. You can read them all in Debt is Slavery, and 9 Other Things I Wish My Dad had Taught Me About Money.]]></description>

      <title>Judith Levine, author of Not Buying It</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This interview is my first with an author who I think will be of interest to many of my listeners.  Judith Levine is the author of Not Buying It: My Year Without Shopping, a new book from Free Press.  Judith writes about  the same core issue that many personal finance and simplicity bloggers write about - what we spend our money on and why - and also the flip side, what it's like to not buy the things that our consumerist culture often makes us feel that we can't live without.  In her book she gives the topic a thorough examination through a project of avoiding all non-essential purchases for an entire year.  Judith's writing is immensely engaging, and the book is full of colourful characters, dramatic events, and profound insights.  I particularly appreciate her insight that in a world of incredible choice of things to buy, we've found ourselves impoverished in imagination of what we could have.  I hope this interview gives you a small taste of a book well worth reading.  And a quick thank you to Seattle Simplicity, the blogger who recommended this book to me and to the listeners of this podcast.]]></description>
