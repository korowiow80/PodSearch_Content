Not only is Brian a gifted writer but one who has selected a topic most authors would shy away from - living with a disability.

Brian Hartman was born in North Arlington, New Jersey. He graduated from Ramapo College in 1992 with a BA in English Literature, and in 2000 from Rutgers University with a Masters degree in Library Science. "First Steps" is his first nationally published work. He also has a short story collection, "Dave Rigglers Stories." Mr. Hartmans website is http://www.brianswebpagehome.com. He can be reached by email at brian.hartman.author@gmail.com Join us as we speak with author Hartmann on his own writing process, living life as we call it disabled and take a look into the highs and lows of Mr. David Riggler.

Not only is Brian a gifted writer but one who has selected a topic most authors would shy away from - living with a disability.

He graduated from Ramapo College in 1992 with a BA in English Literature, and in 2000 from Rutgers University with a Masters degree in Library Science.

She is the winner of a first place Forward National Literature Award (for Six Weeks to Yehidah). Her poetry, fic&shy;tion, essays, reviews and arti&shy;cles have appeared in numer&shy;ous jour&shy;nals and antholo&shy;gies, includ&shy;ing Boule&shy;vard, Con&shy;necti&shy;cut Review, Pleiades, Gradiva, Amer&shy;i&shy;can Book Review, Poets and Writ&shy;ers, and The Smok&shy;ing Poet. She received her MFA from Sarah Lawrence Col&shy;lege and is a Cre&shy;ative Writ&shy;ing and Eng&shy;lish pro&shy;fes&shy;sor for a com&shy;mu&shy;nity col&shy;lege in Texas. She cur&shy;rently serves as a Reviewer-at-Large for The National Poetry Review and Con&shy;tribut&shy;ing Edi&shy;tor for The Cri&shy;te&shy;rion and Tiferet, as well as the host of Tiferet&rsquo;s blogtalk inter&shy;view pro&shy;gram, Tiferet Talk.

Inspired by her own personal tragedies, Jana` lends voice to her pain in hopes of helping other young adults work through theirs as well. "The goal of this book is to uplift and inspire. Weve all been through some sort of adversity in our lives, by sharing mines, I hope to help others get through theirs. Ive been through it and came out standing. I want the world to know that they can come out standing too." --Jana` Chantel A fascinating true story that sears into the readers heart, Jana` Chantel presents the details of her tumultuous childhood in Detroit, of a woman whose memory of a violent upbringing is still fresh in her mind. She begins by recalling the death of her mother who was murdered in cold blood when Jana was just a year old. Call in @ 213-769-0952 or visit our chat room. 9PM EDT,8PM CDT,6PM PDT.

Yes, so have we. Perhaps we should think about it a bit more. Were joined with author and businessman Phil Saylor, who says it best.... Retire is a word I never liked. The word retire, along with dramatic emphasis, sounds like you&rsquo;re going to die. Of course, death is inevitable weather we retire or not. Wisdom satisfies the notion that sometimes when you don&rsquo;t like something it&rsquo;s just a pure case of tough stuff. In other words, the word retire is here to stay. I can&rsquo;t do anything about it. I think it&rsquo;s highly over-rated and for sure over-used. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re retired. So does that mean you don&rsquo;t do anything, or is retired what you do?&rdquo; When googling retirement, youll be bombarded with financial stuff and AARP insurance sites. That must mean you have to have money to retire. What a novel idea. Who would have thought? Money is a given. My contention is money is only part of what you need. One day you wake up and it happens to be your 65th birthday..., they stuff a gold watch in your hand, give you a cake, a pat on the back & send you down the elevator with a cardboard box of personal items from your desk, you&rsquo;ve just retired. Congratulations! If you aren&rsquo;t ready mentally to retire, then you&rsquo;re in for the hardest time of the rest of your life. Most likely your spouse and friends will share in that misery.

Yes, so have we. Perhaps we should think about it a bit more. Were joined with author and businessman Phil Saylor, who says it best.... Retire is a word I never liked. The word retire, along with dramatic emphasis, sounds like you&amp;rsquo;re going to die. Of course, death is inevitable weather we retire or not. Wisdom satisfies the notion that sometimes when you don&amp;rsquo;t like something it&amp;rsquo;s just a pure case of tough stuff. In other words, the word retire is here to stay. I can&amp;rsquo;t do anything about it. I think it&amp;rsquo;s highly over-rated and for sure over-used. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re retired. So does that mean you don&amp;rsquo;t do anything, or is retired what you do?&amp;rdquo; When googling retirement, youll be bombarded with financial stuff and AARP insurance sites. That must mean you have to have money to retire. What a novel idea. Who would have thought? Money is a given. My contention is money is only part of what you need. One day you wake up and it happens to be your 65th birthday..., they stuff a gold watch in your hand, give you a cake, a pat on the back &amp; send you down the elevator with a cardboard box of personal items from your desk, you&amp;rsquo;ve just retired. Congratulations! If you aren&amp;rsquo;t ready mentally to retire, then you&amp;rsquo;re in for the hardest time of the rest of your life.

With ADD, social relationships baffled him. After years of bewilderment and depression, his condition was finally diagnosed, and effectively treated. Suddenly, at 43, everything made sense. Shupe emerged from ADD with a unique perspective on the way society functions, both individually and collectively. As a scientist, he bolsters every conclusion with logical and compelling examples. As a person of feeling and intuition, he expresses his hopes for humanity with genuine compassion and sincerity. As a whistleblower to the world, he speaks with urgency about the need to make fundamental, radical changes in our way of life, if we are to assure the eventual well being of humankind. Why is our world essentially without relational intimacy, when that is what we want most is to love and be loved? And why are we destroying the habitat that we need to survive?

This is a feel good story of one mans life, Mr. Lloyd Rosens. He felt compelled to write his story in hope of saving many other people that suffer with depression. In the authors own words, he states " I want everyone to know through reading my book, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel." Well take you on a roller coaster journey from Lloyds teen years up to the present times. From therapy, ADD, failed marriages and ultimately serious suicidal tendencies. Again, quoting Mr. Rosen, " I wrote the book because you can get healthy and lead a very productive life, and make something of yourself." Depression is a very serious subject and something everyone will face at one time in their life. Join our guest as we openly discuss his life, his book, and what anyone can do to overcome deep depression. For this is a work created out of love, understanding and the need to help and reach out to others.

Wilson has a widely varied and rich life experience background, from Hippie Rock and Roll musician,nightclub entertainer, Zen student,ordained Buddhist minister, carpenter, small business owner, network marketer,sales and sales training, skilled trades instructor and adult education teacher, to public speaker and motivational coach. Now in his chosen &ldquo;golden years&rdquo; career, a writer and multi-published author with the self-proclaimed, &ldquo;audacity to write novels.&rdquo; He is a professional editor, on staff with All Things That Matter Press and takesfreelance projects as well. Wilson describes his spiritual path as one who is a non-religious, dogma-free, maverick spiritualist Christian, with a strong bent toward Zen, Taoism, and the Law of Attraction, and who believes in the Oneness of all creation and all paths leading to re-awakening to the One. He is the proud father of three grown children and seven (and counting) grandchildren, and enjoys organic gardening as well as listening to, writing, performing and recording music&mdash;when not writing, travelling, and marketing his books. Marvin writes primarily in the spiritual/inspirational genre, but likes to pen &ldquo;cross-over&rdquo; novels that appeal to a wide audience. His books are uplifting, sometimes weighty, oftentimes humorous, abidingly thought-provoking, meant to instil and create passion and emotion, more than occasionally provocative to the point of controversial, and always &ldquo;tell it like it is&rdquo;, real world, no punches pulled writing. He likes to deliver spiritual messages in a non-preachy, often irreverent, sometimes sexy and ribald way, through the medium of an entertaining story.

He attended a one-room schoolhouse that is still standing and joined the military as soon as he was old enough. Every summer, when I was a kid, we drove 500 miles or so to visit the folks. Except for the long drive, it was fun because they lived like old-time cowboys &ndash; no electricity, no plumbing, no milk delivery. My mom took a lot of naps, but I helped my grandmother feed chickens and collect eggs, pick just enough vegetables from the garden for dinner (lunch) or supper, and although I stayed away from the cow, I shook cream into butter in a big mason jar. One day, when I was living in Austin, Texas, I asked myself: I wonder if my grandmother ever fell in love with anyone else and decided to write a short story about a love triangle on a farm in Arkansas. That story turned into 300 pages called TOM&rsquo;S WIFE. The details of buildings, natural landscape and weather are accurately set on my grandparents&rsquo; farm. The characters of Annie and Tom Huckaby are composites of people I met in Arkansas with unique characteristics added. Jake&rsquo;s character is based on reading Stephen Birmingham&rsquo;s book, Our Crowd, the story explaining how the Jewish banking firms started in NYC by sending their sons into the South as peddlers then loaning out the profits to other immigrating Jews. Alana Cash is an award-winning filmmaker and author. She taught writing classes at the University of Texas Informal Classes in Austin, Texas, and was one of 60 U.S. teachers chosen to be profiled in the PBS series "A Writers Exchange."

He attended a one-room schoolhouse that is still standing and joined the military as soon as he was old enough. Every summer, when I was a kid, we drove 500 miles or so to visit the folks. Except for the long drive, it was fun because they lived like old-time cowboys &amp;ndash; no electricity, no plumbing, no milk delivery. My mom took a lot of naps, but I helped my grandmother feed chickens and collect eggs, pick just enough vegetables from the garden for dinner (lunch) or supper, and although I stayed away from the cow, I shook cream into butter in a big mason jar. One day, when I was living in Austin, Texas, I asked myself: I wonder if my grandmother ever fell in love with anyone else and decided to write a short story about a love triangle on a farm in Arkansas. That story turned into 300 pages called TOM&amp;rsquo;S WIFE. The details of buildings, natural landscape and weather are accurately set on my grandparents&amp;rsquo; farm. The characters of Annie and Tom Huckaby are composites of people I met in Arkansas with unique characteristics added. Jake&amp;rsquo;s character is based on reading Stephen Birmingham&amp;rsquo;s book, Our Crowd, the story explaining how the Jewish banking firms started in NYC by sending their sons into the South as peddlers then loaning out the profits to other immigrating Jews.

When the traditional publishers stopped publishing her favorite type of book &mdash; character and story driven novels that can&rsquo;t easily be slotted into a genre &mdash; she decided to write her own. Second Wind Publishing liked her style and published four of Bertram&rsquo;s books: Light Bringer, Daughter Am I, More Deaths Than One, and A Spark of Heavenly Fire. Bertram blogs about writing and the writing life at http://patbertram.com/ Becka Johnson had been abandoned on the doorstep of a remote cabin in Chalcedony, Colorado when she was a baby. Now, thirty-seven years later, she has returned to Chalcedony to discover her identity, but she only finds more questions. Who has been looking for her all those years? Why are those same people interested in fellow newcomer Philip Hansen? Who is Philip, and why does her body sing in harmony with his? And what do either of them have to do with a shadow corporation that once operated a secret underground installation in the area? Bertrams publisher says: "I was told by some other small publishers with whom I had done research that I was going to get mountains of unacceptable crap for every worthy thing I received.

Her love for books began her very first summer in the U.S. when her stepmother literally dragged her to the library;a way to keep her off the streets. As if a match made in heaven Marlene took to reading like a fish to water. Some favorite authors were Laura Ingalls Wilder, Beverley Cleary and Judy Blume. Growing up in a house with 3 brothers she was lucky to find an author like Ms. Blume to educated her on the trials and tribulations of being a young girl. Marlene laughingly states that due to having a tight-lipped, strict stepmother she was happy to have access to books as Are You There God, It&rsquo;s Me Margaret, Blubber and Forever to keep her informed as she advance into womanhood. Marlene began writing poetry at the age of 11 and from that point on she felt lost if she didn&rsquo;t have a pen and her trusty composition notebook with her.. In 2005 Marlene self-published, her first book Babies&rsquo; Daddies. She published her second book &lsquo;Making It In My Own&rsquo; in 2006, &lsquo;Island Beauty&rsquo; followed on June 1, 2009. Her most recent release came out on June 15, 2011 titled Jamaican Gal. Marlene states that she wrote this book to bring some of the island feel to the readers. She rarely saw books depicting her home or use of the dialect. Drawing from her memories and experiences of her first eight years, she painted a vivid picture of what it was like living in Jamaica, moving to a different country at such a young age and trying to integrate into such a different culture. She is currently working on her fifth book Babies Daddies-The Remix, and a novella titled, UnWanted. http://www.authormarlene.webs.com/ Join us 213-769-0952 9PM EST, 8PM CST, 6PM PST<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/new-age-publishing/'>New Age Publishing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/new-age-publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/new-age-publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/changes-in-life/'>Changes in Life</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/changes-in-life.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/changes-in-life.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/new-beginnings/'>New Beginnings</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/new-beginnings.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/new-beginnings.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jaimaican-authors/'>Jaimaican Authors</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jaimaican-authors.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jaimaican-authors.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/realities-in-life/'>Realities in Life</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/realities-in-life.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/realities-in-life.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Marlene moved to the United States at the age of eight.

Brent, author of the book Why Wait? The Baby Boomers Guide to Preparing Emotionally, Financially & Legally for a Parents Death, is a guide for family caregivers and aging parents As a speaker, she travels throughout the United States lecturing about the importance of adult siblings and parents having what she calls &ldquo;crucial conversations&rdquo; in preparation for the end-of-life issues they may face, so instead of being torn apart, they can come together as a strong family. She is committed to enhancing the lives of family caregivers and their aging parents throughout the world. Carolyn&rsquo;s passion for her subject started when she was caring for her own father, who was diagnosed with dementia in 1997. From that experience, she found that neither she nor her family truly understood not only the medical challenges related to aging and chronic illness, but also the financial and emotional weight that these bring to bear on a family. In 2009, she founded her business Grandpa&rsquo;s Dream and the non-profit organization Caregiver Story for the dissemination of information through books, speaking engagements and a web-based info portal, with the hopes of them becoming instruments of positive change for other families who were experiencing the same pain and heartache that she experienced, and who were being challenged by the need to plan for their aging parents&rsquo; medical, financial, and legal well-being. http://www.caregiverstory.com http://www.babyboomersguide.org Call in at 213-769-0952 to speak with Carolyn or visit via the chatroom. 8PM EST, 7PM CST, 6PM Mountain, 5PM PST <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dealing-with-parents-death/'>Dealing with Parents Death</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dealing-with-parents-death.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dealing-with-parents-death.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/preparing-for-family-departures/'>Preparing for Family Departures</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/preparing-for-family-departures.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/preparing-for-family-departures.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/carolyn-a-brent/'>Carolyn A Brent</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/carolyn-a-brent.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/carolyn-a-brent.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/care-of-parents/'>Care of Parents</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/care-of-parents.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/care-of-parents.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/elder-care/'>Elder Care</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/elder-care.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/elder-care.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Carolyn A.

What could you sacrifice to save your own soul? Special Agent Will Taylor and his reluctant partner, Jackson Allen, have formed an uneasy and unlikely friendship, but are now bonded forever due to the complicated hand of Fate interlocking the two by family and circumstance. As they settle into their new lives, the Fallen plots the demise of mankind by horrific means; using the Society&rsquo;s love and Commitment to one another to create the havoc and negativity causing tragedies the world over. No sacrifice is too great, and unimaginable pain willingly suffered as they must fight both separately and as a team to bring an end to this evil that threatens to destroy The Society, and take world along for the ride. Along the way, the hard lessons of fate, destiny and life are both taught and learned by everyone involved in the struggle for both the salvation of the world and the understanding that life is not about the individual; but about the ultimate plan. And one&rsquo;s final destination, Katherine Whitley loves to write! And write and write. The state of Vermont is a great factor in providing the surroundings that create inspiration. The beauty; the pure joy of the seasons.

What could you sacrifice to save your own soul? Special Agent Will Taylor and his reluctant partner, Jackson Allen, have formed an uneasy and unlikely friendship, but are now bonded forever due to the complicated hand of Fate interlocking the two by family and circumstance. As they settle into their new lives, the Fallen plots the demise of mankind by horrific means; using the Society&rsquo;s love and Commitment to one another to create the havoc and negativity causing tragedies the world over. No sacrifice is too great, and unimaginable pain willingly suffered as they must fight both separately and as a team to bring an end to this evil that threatens to destroy The Society, and take world along for the ride. Along the way, the hard lessons of fate, destiny and life are both taught and learned by everyone involved in the struggle for both the salvation of the world and the understanding that life is not about the individual; but about the ultimate plan. And one&rsquo;s final destination, Katherine Whitley loves to write! And write and write. The state of Vermont is a great factor in providing the surroundings that create inspiration.

This soon led to volunteering in various health related programs, such as the Regional Medical Disaster Program, the Red Cross Disaster and Blood program, the Home Health Association, Visiting Nurse Association, Hospice, several committees on biomedical issues, adviser to the California Health Law Revision Committee, Single Payer Health Care for All, Physicians for a National Health Plan, California Physicians Alliance and other health-related activities. He has also written numerous articles, letters and Op Ed pieces and appeared on radio, television and lectured on health care issues at many venues. Recently retired from medical practice, he continues to volunteer for many health oriented community programs. This book is a collection of essays by Dr. Kirschner, regarding some of the many unresolved health care, pharmaceutical and insurance issues that his patients have shared with him during his forty-seven years of family medical practice.

This story was written to allow my audience to see deep inside the walls of survival. We have all watched the story of the abused child on the crime channels. But few of us have seen what happened the next day and the next and the next. I wrote this story so that I could take you inside of survival. Sometimes it is not pretty. But in the end I know that you will believe in the human spirit and the will to survive that is buried in all of us. I want this story to save lives. I want the mother that reads this story to peek in on her baby&rsquo;s one more time tonight. I want the addict that reads this story to find their way out of the darkness. And for those of you that have never had to wake up inside a tunnel to reach out to those who do. Remember, there is always a rainbow after the storm. You just have to look up.

Join us this evening as we discuss how racism affects many cultures and races throughout the world. 213-769-0952 8PM PST, 7PM CST, 6PM Mountain, 5PM PST YoonOKs website: http://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/YoonOk </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>01:30:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/monicabrinkmanandoana/2011/06/23/raciscm-part-ii-blind-bigotry-special-guest-yoonok-kim.mp3" fileSize="21567657" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/monicabrinkmanandoana/2011/06/23/raciscm-part-ii-blind-bigotry-special-guest-yoonok-kim.wma" fileSize="21567657" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>It Matters Radio</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>Racism,Women,Bigotry throught the world,YoonOK Kim,Two Unsynchronized Souls,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Raciscm Part II, Blind Bigotry special guest YoonOK Kim</itunes:subtitle><itunes:image href="http://cdn.btrcdn.com/pics/showpics/large/141692_6jrUndup.png" /></item><item><title>Two Unsynchronized Souls-Achieving Your Dreams &amp; Goals - Jun 22,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/monicabrinkmanandoana/2011/06/22/two-unsynchronized-souls-achieving-your-dreams-goals</link><description><![CDATA[ We are pleased to have as our guest, Darshan G. Shanti, in his own words states: "I understand how much you&rsquo;re hurting. I feel your pain, desperation, worry and fear. Take heart my friend. I&rsquo;ve been there and I have come out on the other side, healthy, wealthy and happy. You can and you will too. I know this without a doubt because I know the truth of you. You are priceless, magnificent, incredible, a winner and a champion. Anything that stops you from realizing that must be eliminated. Or like a weed, it will keep coming back over and over again. This book will show you the step by step, systematic approach I personally used (and have taught to thousands) to permanently transform their lives. It will help you to free yourself from the ball and chain of your past so you can forget about it. It puts you in the driver&rsquo;s seat of your own transformation and in control of your own life. It will help you to have your wants and your dreams by enabling you to change your own mind about who you are and your future. When you change your own mind, your change is permanent" Darshan is an expert in human motivation, rapid transformation and helping people eliminate unwanted, self-destructive behaviors in hours, not years. He has a unique ability to very quickly empower participants to change their own mind about who they are, what they want and whats possible, both now and in the future. When they change their own minds, their change is permanent. That leaves them free to make new decisions, take new actions and create new, powerful and fulfilling lives. His personal mission is to reach out and help at least 25 million people through his books, seminars, audio/video programs to discover and replace their core, limiting beliefs, blocks and barriers so they have the freedom to live the powerful, fulfilling and magnificent lives they truly deserve.

Nielsen, Jr Niels C. Nielsen, Jr. is the J. Newton Rayzor Professor of Philosophy and Religious Thought emeritus at Rice University in Houston, Texas. Rice is an independent university, neither a state supported school or a church sponsored institution. He was founding chairman of its department of religious studies from 1968 to 1990. His B.A. degree is from George Pepperdine University in Los Angeles, and his B.D. and Ph.D from Yale. He taught in the Yale University Department of Religion before coming to Texas. His professional affiliations include the American Academy of Religion, American Philosophical Society, American Society for the Study of Religion, Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies and the Society for European Culture. His doctoral research at Yale was in contemporary theology. Subsequently he has written in the fields of world religions and religion in Eastern Europe; he traveled extensively researching in these fields. As one reviewer states: "With penetrating analyses of twenty presidents from Washington to Obama, God in the Obama Era is a "must read" for anyone interested in the American presidency, the place of religion in American history and culture, or religion in the Obama campaign and presidency. This erudite, lucid, enlightening book brilliantly illuminates the central icon of American culture, the American presidency. In the aftermath of the presidential election of 2008, in which religion played a greater role than in any election since that of 1960, we are fortunate to receive this book...this important book is rich in insight, lively in style and wide-ranging in scope."

For 20 years he was CEO of a manufacturing company while writing short stories and essays which have been published in national magazines and anthologies. Also eighteen of his essays on business management and one on WWII appeared in The Wall Street Journal. Since retirement he has written two novels, two screenplays, twenty stage plays, two short story collections, a WWII letter collection, a travel journal, three children&rsquo;s stories, and two books on business management. QUINTET, a collection of five novellas was published in 2005. A second collection of his business essays was published in June, 2009. And a second collection of short stories STORIES FROM A LIFETIME was published in October 2010.. Currently he has created a comic strip of a social satire for a new website. He lives with his artist wife in mid-coast Maine. Stories from a Lifetime carries readers through a widely diverse series of lifes peaks and valleys with poignant, clear-eyed vision and understanding that is only gradually gained across the course of a lifetime through endurance and honest appraisal of the emotional rollercoaster that we all ride. Hugh Aaron delicately reveals the world through the innocent eyes of a young boy, through those of a soldier far from home during wartime, and those of a struggling businessman and faltering husband. He is unafraid to reveal panic beneath a fa&ccedil;ade of success, the deep and hollow sadness that may exist in an outwardly happy marriage, the yearning we feel to make a break for freedom from the rat race, the unexpected emotional responses that shift lives far beyond the expected course of events. These stories form a welcome, and increasingly rare, honest, grounded, and beautifully written collection that will touch nerves while sympathizing with what it means to be human 8PM EST, 7PM CST, 6PM Mountain, 5PM PST<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/stories-of-a-lifetime/'>Stories of a LIfetime</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/stories-of-a-lifetime.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/stories-of-a-lifetime.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/hugh-aaron/'>Hugh Aaron</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/hugh-aaron.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/hugh-aaron.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/short-stories/'>Short Stories</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/short-stories.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/short-stories.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/life--experiences/'>Life  Experiences</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/life--experiences.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/life--experiences.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/books-about-life/'>Books About Life</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books-about-life.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books-about-life.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, Hugh Aaron received a degree in the Humanities at The University of Chicago.

During this time he constantly challenged the status quo asking, &ldquo;Why are we doing it this way?&rdquo; In his search for an effective solution, he found not one, but many which could effectively solve specific problems. Once he truly understood how complex and enormously different each student was he began experimenting with ways to individualize instruction. Dr.Rose learned to balance that by developing extensive group dynamics and group cohesiveness techniques. In his own words, "Mutual respect through better listening and observation on my part lead to giving more and more earned power to my students as they became increasingly responsible. This culminated in the continuous feedback and the negotiations that helped them live in a real democracy. Finally, I managed my classrooms by using a combination of coercion, persuasion, and negotiation that resulted in the most efficient delivery of lessons, good test scores, and happy, well-rounded students. With all the new technology these results are much easier to achieve. In his education books you will see his efforts and growth as Dr. Rose went from a completely naive and clueless teacher to a professional who has attempted more unique approaches. He was convinced that teachers need more, not less autonomy (power). They need to be able to find out who they are, what teaching styles work best, what materials work best for them, and then allowed the opportunity to learn from their failures without being demoralized by excessive criticism. These teachers then would have the attitude towards learning and the confidence to allow the same respect and shared power with their students to totally change students present attitude towards learning.

Now, Dr. Sherman is taking her experience to the public, making her Art of Choice workshops and seminars available to groups and organizations rather than just to private clients. Additionally, she teaches individually designed adult education courses, catering to the specific interests and learning styles of the people who seek her expertise. Dr. Sherman moved into motivational psychology and marriage counseling from her own troubled past. As someone who grew up under difficult circumstances, Dr. Sherman developed a keen awareness of others&rsquo; problems. Drawing on personal experience as well as academic training, she relates to a much broader arc of life situations than most. &ldquo;For many years, my life was an emotional roller coaster,&rdquo; Dr. Sherman says. &ldquo;Growing up, I was exposed to horribly negative life situations and as an adult,it seemed that I was a slave to them.&rdquo; It was upon realizing that she was still reacting to her earlier experiences that the first inkling of what would become the Art of Choice appealed to her, allowing her to change her circumstances, and directing the rest of her professional life. It is from my journey that I know that you, too, can choose not merely to react to all the things that happen around you- whether they trigger something from your past or are things that are happening today- but to make powerful choices.&rdquo; Dr. Sherman sees her role as a facilitator of those difficult choices.

Now, Dr. Sherman is taking her experience to the public, making her Art of Choice workshops and seminars available to groups and organizations rather than just to private clients. Additionally, she teaches individually designed adult education courses, catering to the specific interests and learning styles of the people who seek her expertise. Dr. Sherman moved into motivational psychology and marriage counseling from her own troubled past. As someone who grew up under difficult circumstances, Dr. Sherman developed a keen awareness of others&rsquo; problems. Drawing on personal experience as well as academic training, she relates to a much broader arc of life situations than most. &ldquo;For many years, my life was an emotional roller coaster,&rdquo; Dr. Sherman says. &ldquo;Growing up, I was exposed to horribly negative life situations and as an adult,it seemed that I was a slave to them.&rdquo; It was upon realizing that she was still reacting to her earlier experiences that the first inkling of what would become the Art of Choice appealed to her, allowing her to change her circumstances, and directing the rest of her professional life. It is from my journey that I know that you, too, can choose not merely to react to all the things that happen around you- whether they trigger something from your past or are things that are happening today- but to make powerful choices.&rdquo; Dr. Sherman sees her role as a facilitator of those difficult choices.

Before Revelations, Sandy Cohen published two books in Europe plus stories, articles, poetry, and essays in journals and magazines in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, England, and Greece. His work, critical and creative, has drawn praise from, among others, Norman Mailer, Bernard Malamud, Patrick White and Isaac Beshevis Singer. He has been a professor, jazz musician, bookbinder, actor and, for almost two decades, a humorous commentator on public radio. He appeared in his own mini-series for public television and in a feature film, Do Not Disturb, filmed in northern China, where he lived for a year.

Kaiser, Ph.D., ABPP, is a Licensed Psychologist in Philadelphia, where he is in private practice and also serves as consulting psychologist to the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. In addition to serving on staff at both Jefferson and Methodist Hospitals, Dr. Kaiser is Clinical Associate Professor in the Department of Neurology at Jefferson Medical College. He is listed in the National Register of Health Service Providers in Psychology and Board Certified in Forensic Psychology by the American Board of Professional Psychology. He has a special interest in behavioral medicine and in working with medical patients to improve their emotional functioning. During his half century of helping others, Dr. Kaiser has evolved an approach to working with patients that emphasizes their abilities to take charge of their lives and build emotional strength to overcome obstacles and improve general mental health. He has presented some of his ideas at workshops and conferences in various cities in the U.S. as well as Cancun, Stockholm, and Istanbul. His recent e-book, "WHAT CAN GO RIGHT? The Thinking Person&rsquo;s Guide to Making Good Things Happen," presents his approach to improving mental health by being proactive and positive. The Mental Health Gym was founded so that the internet could be utilized to reach and help more people. Dr Kaiser emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high level of physical health in his personal life, and he actively works out at a gym and also does yoga as part of a healthy lifestyle.

The stories of warfare as experienced by children may take a lifetime to understand and describe. For some it took many years before they were able to reflect upon the meaning of the war as they lived through it. What happened to children across the world during the Second World War, in the years 1930 to 1945, shows a common theme of emotional upheaval, fear and hunger. The author was a child living in Hawaii when Pearl Harbor was attacked, and remembers what the war years were like. She has gathered accounts from others to include along with hers. These are their stories. Jean Rodenbough is a retired Presbyterian minister living in Greensboro, NC. A poet and writer who has published books on fiction, poetry, and pastoral care, she is active with organizations working for peace and justice. Jean's interests also include chip carving and playing the recorder Over the years Jean Rodenbough has been very active in peace, justice and women's issues.
