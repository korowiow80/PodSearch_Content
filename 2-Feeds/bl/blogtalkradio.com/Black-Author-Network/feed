Upon learning of Lees surrender, Sam--a runaway slave who once worked for the Union Army--decides to leave his safe haven in Philadelphia and set out on foot to return to the war-torn South. What compels him on this almost-suicidal course is the desire to find his wife, the mother of his only child, whom he and their son left behind 15 years earlier on the Mississippi farm to which they all "belonged." Leonard Pitts Jr. won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2004. He is the author of the novels Freeman (June 2012) and Before I Forget. His column in The Miami Herald runs every Sunday and Wednesday. Forward From This Moment, a collection of his columns, was released in 2009. Leonard also wrote the 2008 series I Am A Man, commemorating the 40th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther Kings assassination.

Love &amp; Regrets exposes the struggles of commitment, the human capacity to rise above hatred and revenge and the power of love and kinship.

She&rsquo;s the bestselling author of sweet and sensual romance with multicultural characters. In her spare time she reads romance novels, mysteries, thrillers, and a fair amount of non-fiction. She also loves to travel. She speaks French and can get by in Spanish. Meet Author Tucker Davis Website: www.tuckerdavisnovels.com Tucker Davis is an Atlanta native and often describes herself as a Grady baby. (If you are from Atlanta you know exactly what she means!) She has had a love of writing since she was in high school. Tucker, a naturally risk adverse person, often lived her adventures through reading. It wasn&rsquo;t until she discovered authors like John Grissom, Terry McMillan, Brenda Jackson, Kayla Perrin and Rochelle Alers that her desire to tell her own stories was fed. She decided it was time to share the stories she allowed to play out in her mind. Thus, she penned her first novel, Misplaced Desires, which will be published in 2012 under the Twisted Pleasures series. Her first published novel Derrin&rsquo;s Hot Pursuit brings to life the story of Derrin, one of five African-American men who, for varying reasons, want to avoid long term commitments and falling love. Take the journey with Tucker Davis as we follow Derrin, Marcus, Calvin, Jared and Ennis when they chase love. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>Ella Curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>EDC Creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/book-clubs/'>Book Clubs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/book-clubs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/book-clubs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/social-media/'>Social Media</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/social-media.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/social-media.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/black-books/'>Black Books</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/black-books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/black-books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Meet the Author Delaney Diamond Like Delaneys fan page: http://facebook.com/DelaneyDiamond Delaney Diamond was born and raised in the United States Virgin Islands and currently lives in Atlanta, Georgia.

Luckett - Jan 24,2012</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2012/01/24/west-book-launch-passing-love-by-jacqueline-e-luckett</link><description><![CDATA[ Passing Love by Jacqueline E. Luckett RELEASES JANUARY 25, 2012 Nicole-Marie Handy has loved all things French since she was a child. After the death of her best friend, determined to get out of her rut, she goes to Paris, leaving behind a marriage proposal. While there, Nicole chances upon an old photo of her father-lovingly inscribed, in his hand, to a woman Nicole has never heard of. What starts as a vacation quickly becomes an investigation into his relationship to this mystery woman. Moving back and forth in time between the sparkling Paris of today and the jazz-fueled city filled with expatriates in the 1950s, Passing Love is the story of two women dealing with lost love, secrets, and betrayal...and how the City of Light may hold all of the answers. Passing Love will be available online and at major and independent bookstores everywhere. We encourage readers to ask a bookstore to order copies of PASSING LOVE if they cannot find it in their local store. Preorder available now. Meet The Author Jacqueline E.

Luckett RELEASES JANUARY 25, 2012 Nicole-Marie Handy has loved all things French since she was a child. After the death of her best friend, determined to get out of her rut, she goes to Paris, leaving behind a marriage proposal. While there, Nicole chances upon an old photo of her father-lovingly inscribed, in his hand, to a woman Nicole has never heard of. What starts as a vacation quickly becomes an investigation into his relationship to this mystery woman. Moving back and forth in time between the sparkling Paris of today and the jazz-fueled city filled with expatriates in the 1950s, Passing Love is the story of two women dealing with lost love, secrets, and betrayal...and how the City of Light may hold all of the answers. Passing Love will be available online and at major and independent bookstores everywhere. We encourage readers to ask a bookstore to order copies of PASSING LOVE if they cannot find it in their local store. Preorder available now. Meet The Author Jacqueline E.

Emerson McGee has spent most of his life living with a secret, and the first-year law student&rsquo;s menacing struggle with his sexuality is only the half of it. His wife, Danielle, has her own scars of adolescent heartache&mdash;which she thinly veils behind her fa&ccedil;ade as an upper-middle class princess. The newlywed&rsquo;s cookie-cutter marriage is abruptly interrupted when they make a reluctant move into the quaint house Emerson inherited from his deceased grandmother. Unbeknownst to them, there&rsquo;s already something else living there: A malevolent entity hell-bent on exposing its connection to Emerson and the tragic secret they share. A GHOST&rsquo;S STORY While a mysterious narrator recounts the details of his abject life, the McGees&rsquo; vengeful poltergeist pulls Danielle deeper into a mystery that has haunted an impoverished ghetto in South Baton Rouge&mdash;aptly called &ldquo;&lsquo;Da Bottom&rdquo;&mdash;for nearly a decade, and spills into the provocative world of New Orleans hoodoo. Before its final scare, Never Dead concludes with a bloody twist the McGees never saw coming. NEVER DEAD Book Review: &ldquo;Never Dead&rdquo; is a combination of mystery and paranormal. There was a little erotica as well. Tastefully written erotica. Mr. Jones did an excellent job developing this group of complex characters. I cannot wait to read more stories written by this author. I recommend &ldquo;Never Dead&rdquo; to readers looking for a good suspense novel.

She has proven to be the Picasso of the pen!&rdquo; &mdash;Bishop T. D. Jakes Critically acclaimed, award-winning author Sharon Ewell Foster pens &lsquo;The Resurrection of Nat Turner Part One: The Witnesses.&rsquo; Just in time for the 180th anniversary of Nat Turner&rsquo;s infamous rebellion, THE RESURRECTION OF NAT TURNER PART ONE: THE WITNESSES sheds new light on that complicated time in our nation&rsquo;s history. Written from the perspectives of slaves, slave owners, and an antislavery lawyer, this riveting historical novel reveals the tensions between free men and the oppressed before and after Nat Turner ignited an uprising on August 22, 1831. As Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin, searches for her next book idea, she encounters a mysterious man who recounts stories of people who knew Nat Turner, both friends and enemies. In their words are the truth of the mystery and conspiracy of Nat Turner&rsquo;s life, death, and confession. Together they tell the horror of the massacre and Turner&rsquo;s ultimate capture and trial. THE WITNESSES spans more than sixty years, sweeping from the majestic highlands of Ethiopia to the small town of Jerusalem in Southampton County, Virginia. Based on extensive research, interviews, contemporary correspondence, news accounts, and actual trial records, Foster breaks hallowed ground revealing long-buried secrets of Turner and his rebellion. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/sharon-ewell-foster/'>Sharon Ewell Foster</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/sharon-ewell-foster.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/sharon-ewell-foster.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/resurrection-of-nat-turner/'>Resurrection of Nat Turner</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/resurrection-of-nat-turner.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/resurrection-of-nat-turner.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>Ella Curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>EDC Creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/book-club/'>book club</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/book-club.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/book-club.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ The Resurrection of Nat Turner Part 1 - The Witnesses by Sharon Ewell Foster The destinies of a young white man, a young African American woman, and a rebel "called by God" incite a historical massacre. &ldquo; Sharon Ewell Foster is one of America&rsquo;s best kept secrets&mdash;but not for long!

LCB offers a variety of African-American literature including Contemporary Fiction, Womens Fiction, Urban/Street Literature, Teen Fiction, and a host of other categories. CEO, Azarel Smallwood, launched the company with the release of her self-published title, A Life to Remember, and from there has continued to sign and promote best-selling authors such as J.Tremble, Tiphani Montgomery, and Danette Majette. Currently, LCB has nineteen authors and offers outside distribution to selective projects. To date, the company has published fifty-six books. The success of LCB is a team effort starting with outgoing authors, and a progressive management team. In 2008, Life Changing Books restructured its relationships with wholesale establishments across the United States and abroad; because of that,in 2011 the company has celebrated many successes. Most recently, Miss KP was honored for her debut novel, The Dirty Divorce as Urban Book of the Year by AAMBC. Secondly, LCB has gained notoriety for producing four best-selling sequels over the past five years; Bruised 1and 2, The Millionaire Mistress Series, the Dirty Divorce Series, and the One Night Stand series. In addition, the company announced in late 2010 that it secured a deal to have The Millionaire Mistress books and Secrets of a Housewife re-published with Kensington Books for sale to Walmart for a limited time.

Currently, LCB has nineteen authors and offers outside distribution to selective projects. To date, the company has published fifty-six books. The success of LCB is a team effort starting with outgoing authors, and a progressive management team. In 2008, Life Changing Books restructured its relationships with wholesale establishments across the United States and abroad; because of that,in 2011 the company has celebrated many successes. Most recently, Miss KP was honored for her debut novel, The Dirty Divorce as Urban Book of the Year by AAMBC. Secondly, LCB has gained notoriety for producing four best-selling sequels over the past five years; Bruised 1and 2, The Millionaire Mistress Series, the Dirty Divorce Series, and the One Night Stand series. In addition, the company announced in late 2010 that it secured a deal to have The Millionaire Mistress books and Secrets of a Housewife re-published with Kensington Books for sale to Walmart for a limited time. Life Changing Books has soared in the literary world and continues to build relationships both in and out of the community. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>00:56:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2011/10/06/j-tremble-and-life-changing-books-showcase.mp3" fileSize="13366462" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2011/10/06/j-tremble-and-life-changing-books-showcase.wma" fileSize="13366462" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>Black Author Network</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>LCB,Life Changing Books,J Tremble,Azarel,bookclubs,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Evening with Life Changing Books </itunes:subtitle><itunes:image href="http://cdn.btrcdn.com/pics/showpics/large/bc420848-2c37-433a-9a99-4822d5a12d79_edclogo2xll.jpg" /></item><item><title>Evening with Ella and Pat G'Orge Walker - Sep 28,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2011/09/28/evening-with-ella-and-fabulous-ebook-authors</link><description><![CDATA[ Join host Ella Curry, president of EDC Creations as she greets Christian author Pat GOrge Walker. Featured Book: No Ordinary Noel by Pat GOrge-Walker www.amazon.com/No-Ordinary-Noel-Pat-GOrge-Walker/dp/0758259662 Pat GOrge Walker - is in a league of her own. This accomplished Christian author and comedienne has an amazing mind and talent for turning her observations of church life into gems of sidesplitting humor. It is her own special gift from God that enables GOrge-Walker to depict the often ridiculous antics of church folk without subverting the Good News or watering down the potency of its message. Pat GOrge-Walker has paid a high price for the ever-present smile on her face. This Mt. Vernon, New York PK (preachers kid) has survived a raging house fire; a violent assault; a car crash that mangled her body and a viral infection that left her temporarily blinded. Through it all, Pat quietly soaked in material from her fathers Baptist congregation and her mothers Pentecostal assembly to create the stories that keep readers and audiences howling with laughter. Pat is a kept woman whose life is held firmly and safely in Gods hand. Mercy and compassion season every word spoken or written by Pat, who makes her story palpitate in the hearts of people who readily relate to victory over adversity. The First Lady of Gospel Comedy forges a successful career as author and comedian. She has paved the way for many others in both fields. Pats storytelling is likened to Zora Neale Hurstons folklore documentation of American culture and church life in literature. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>EDC Creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>Ella Curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/book-club/'>book club</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/book-club.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/book-club.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/african-american/'>African American</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/pat-gorge-walker/'>Pat GOrge Walker</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pat-gorge-walker.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pat-gorge-walker.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Join host Ella Curry, president of EDC Creations as she greets Christian author Pat GOrge Walker.

Billed as the book &ldquo;where sex and spirituality collide,&rdquo; the year of its release SITS positioned Lutishia as a Debut Author Finalist at the Southeastern Arts Association&rsquo;s Literary Awards. The novel was a bestseller on Amazon, Black Expressions and other internet sites and the subsequent books in this ongoing series: Love Like Hallelujah, A Preacher&rsquo;s Passion, Heaven Right Here, Reverend Feelgood and Heaven Forbid, have enjoyed tremendous success as well, and have made her a popular guest with book clubs, magazines and radio stations. Thankful to be living her dream, Lutishia is also humbled to be the voice for so many who feel silenced. From molestation, homosexuality and infidelity in ministry to her latest series, The Business, that examines the dynamics of dysfunction among family and society, she approaches each topic with compassion and unconditional love&mdash;offering a safe place for those who&rsquo;ve experienced such challenges to come forward and be &ldquo;seen,&rdquo; and also encouraging dialogue along with the space for healing and understanding. Currently, Lutishia is busy at work on her second series, which features All Up In My Business, Mind Your Own Business, and Taking Care Of Business. Fans of the Hallelujah Love series will be happy to know that that series continues in 2012.

Billed as the book &amp;ldquo;where sex and spirituality collide,&amp;rdquo; the year of its release SITS positioned Lutishia as a Debut Author Finalist at the Southeastern Arts Association&amp;rsquo;s Literary Awards. The novel was a bestseller on Amazon, Black Expressions and other internet sites and the subsequent books in this ongoing series: Love Like Hallelujah, A Preacher&amp;rsquo;s Passion, Heaven Right Here, Reverend Feelgood and Heaven Forbid, have enjoyed tremendous success as well, and have made her a popular guest with book clubs, magazines and radio stations. Thankful to be living her dream, Lutishia is also humbled to be the voice for so many who feel silenced. From molestation, homosexuality and infidelity in ministry to her latest series, The Business, that examines the dynamics of dysfunction among family and society, she approaches each topic with compassion and unconditional love&amp;mdash;offering a safe place for those who&amp;rsquo;ve experienced such challenges to come forward and be &amp;ldquo;seen,&amp;rdquo; and also encouraging dialogue along with the space for healing and understanding. Currently, Lutishia is busy at work on her second series, which features All Up In My Business, Mind Your Own Business, and Taking Care Of Business.

Laushaul was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and now resides in Houston, Texas with her son. She is employed as a Finance Administrator for a furniture retailer. She is an inspirational poet, novelist, and entrepreneur. In her free time she enjoys performing and listening to spoken word poetry. Nakia has always loved to read and early on in life guessed that writing would play a major role in her future. Nakias career pursuits in writing did not come without obstacles. Finally, all the bottled-up imagination and thoughts that needed to be expressed on paper came pouring out. Inspired and fueled by attempts to be molded into the norm, she began to write her first collection of poetry and essays titled The Truth As I See It which is set to be released in early 2010 by Serendipity Bound Books. Nakia remains determined to present the truth as she sees it in all facets of her writing, and hopes that her writing will inspire and serve a meaningful purpose for her readers. She is committed to challenging everyone in her reach to find compassion and empathy in the differences that exist among us all. She is currently promoting her new book Running from Solace. Nakia R.

Thomas Felicia S.W. Thomas is the author of 80 Proof Lives, her debut novel, which was released in February 2011 and published by Amani Publishing, LLC, in Tallahassee, Florida. Felicia holds a B.S. degree in Journalism from Florida A&M University, and a Juris Doctorate degree from Florida State University. Felicia practices Unemployment Law. She is also an editor, as well as a freelance writer. Felicia currently lives in Quincy, Florida, with her husband and three children. She is hard at work on a sequel to her debut novel and other creative titles. 80 Proof Lives (YA Fiction) Primary Subject Matter: Coming of age, cautionary tale that touches upon many issues young adults struggle with today. 80 Proof Lives is a young adult novel set in a small, southern town where graduation is optional but a life of despair seems mandatory. This is the story of Fla (rhymes with clay), a 15-year-old girl who is brilliant but ignorant that shes supposed to be somebody great, because her emotionally abusive, alcoholic mother stifles her dreams and forces her to work for Miss Lipstick, the queen of the bootleg business and the local madam. While working for Miss Lipstick during the summer of 1976, Fla learns why some people live inside a liquor bottle, as well as some life-changing information about herself that could plunge her into an 80 Proof life, or break that bottle hanging over her head to become somebody great.

Raised on the brink of poverty, he and his siblings often went hungry, but with the help of a family in the neighborhood, he beat the odds and studied criminal law at Loyola University and joined the New Orleans police department in 1975. He began his career with aspirations of being a great cop, but before long he was exposed to a darker side of law enforcement. Davis found himself a fugitive, living off the land in remote forests in the United States and Canada to elude capture. His church upbringing was abandoned in anger. For over twenty years he hid, becoming an expert survivalist. Today, Robert Davis is a committed Christian and motivational speaker.

Raised on the brink of poverty, he and his siblings often went hungry, but with the help of a family in the neighborhood, he beat the odds and studied criminal law at Loyola University and joined the New Orleans police department in 1975. He began his career with aspirations of being a great cop, but before long he was exposed to a darker side of law enforcement. Davis found himself a fugitive, living off the land in remote forests in the United States and Canada to elude capture. His church upbringing was abandoned in anger. For over twenty years he hid, becoming an expert survivalist. Today, Robert Davis is a committed Christian and motivational speaker.

Smart, sexy Victoria Small has come to the end of her year off—from men, that is. She's enjoyed her hiatus, the peace, quiet—and no unexpected interruptions. But now she's ready to have someone to come home to. And her timing is perfect, as not one, but two, handsome possibilities enter her life. . . Ted, a powerful, blue-eyed CEO sends a thrill of excitement through her that shocks Victoria out of her comfort zone. Meanwhile, Parker, a talented surgeon, melts her defenses with his warmth and ebony good looks. The men are as different as can be—inside and out—but they have one thing in common: they both want Victoria.

She can’t stand the fact that Charity is a published author too, though she swears that Charity is nowhere near as good. It seems like the publishing industry might agree, because Charity is having trouble getting her contract renewed. Is it possible that Lynzee has had her blacklisted? With her savings dwindling, Charity struggles to pay her bills, and the pressure is putting incredible strain on her marriage. Things only get worse when Lynzee drops a bomb: she reveals that Charity’s husband is the father of a child she gave up for adoption years ago. Charity’s life goes into a tailspin as she struggles with the shocking news. Should she tell her husband about the child he never knew he had, or would that be more drama than their already fragile marriage can handle? Charity chooses to fight back against her sister in a very creative way, but the fallout from all this drama might leave plenty of casualties in its wake. Bestselling author Rosalyn McMillan narrates the tale of two literary sisters that will make readers ask: How much of this is based on actual events?

Each volume of the series will focus on a very essential Biblical principle and its application in our daily lives. In Love & Forgiveness, love and forgiveness are defined Biblically and then contrasted with worldly use. The book explores what love is, what love does, how love feels, the importance of repentance and forgiveness and the benefits of both. LaShawnda Jones is currently living and thriving in New York City. Her prior work includes an autobiographical devotional, My God and Me: Listening, Learning and Growing on My Journey and an autobiographical volume of poetry, Cliches: A Life in Verse. LaShawnda’s writing and publishing work ranges from poetry, to blogging, to designing an annual full-figured fashion calendar. She was a contributor to a daily political blog during the last presidential election and an anthology of letters addressed to First Lady Michelle Obama. LaShawnda’s current work is a series of short books, focusing on foundational Biblical principles. The series is called the MeatyWord series. The first volume, The Process of Asking for, Receiving and Giving Love & Forgiveness, will be available January 2011. LaShawnda’s life is an illustration of transition – constant movement and growth from one point to another. She is ecstatic about moving forward on her journey with the LORD. She continues to grow stronger in her faith, wiser in her knowledge and more loving to people as she seeks to mirror exactly the Christ in her.

Unfortunately, Drake Collins has other ideas about the true state of their relationship. Kennedy hopes to turn him around; Drake just wants to turn her out sexually. Kennedy is also searching for her biological mother, who gave her up at birth. She wants answers and she has tons of questions. The enormous weight of these predicaments leads to a failed suicide attempt. Her overprotective and overbearing mother, Dorothy Logan, moves in with Kennedy and makes it her mission to get her daughter's life back in order. The first step is getting rid of Drake Collins once and for all, but that's easier said than done. Drake has no intentions of going anywhere. Kennedy's ever loyal and fun-loving best friend, Taylor, and her absentee father join forces to help support Kennedy in her time of need. At her psychiatrist's advice, Kennedy uses writing as her therapy. She starts to keep a daily journal detailing the erotic circumstances and family drama that led up to her despair. Through very personal, funny, and graphic entries, readers will share her confessions. Brace yourselves for a very steamy journey!

Before Hurricane Katrina, few had even heard of this close-knit, predominately African American community nestled less than five miles from world-famous Bourbon Street. The author says, “I watched it all unfold on TV from my home near Dallas that morning. As the waters rose, my heart sank. This was my home, my neighborhood, my people. How could I not use my gifts to tell their story?” Born and raised in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, award-winning writer Lynette Norris Wilkinson was born to write. From the time she won her first writing contest at the age of 11, she has always sought self-expression through writing that inspires, influences, and informs. Job titles may have changed over the years, but she considers herself first and foremost a writer. Since graduating cum laude from Texas Southern University in Houston , Texas , with a major in journalism and a minor in marketing, she has held a number of positions, including a business reporter with Dun & Bradstreet; a technical writer, and most recently, a public relations coordinator with a large health system in Dallas. In August 2005, she found herself with 16 family members and friends on her doorstep when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Seeing images of the devastated Lower Ninth Ward, she had the God-inspired idea to write a book that celebrated hurricane survivors from that area and donate the proceeds to organizations that are helping residents recover. “You see me as I am now,” she says. “But there was where it all began. These are my roots and my people. How could I not use my gift to do what is within my power to help?” Wilkinson says, “If this is the best and biggest thing I ever do in my life, I will be happy.” Website: www.HurricaneKatrinaStories.com <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>Ella Curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>EDC Creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/black-pearls-magazine/'>Black Pearls Magazine</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/black-pearls-magazine.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/black-pearls-magazine.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/books/'>books</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/literature/'>literature</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/literature.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/literature.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Some of the first images you saw of New Orleans under water during Hurricane Katrina were the mangled houses and cars, and drowned bodies of the people from the Lower 9th Ward.

Samaria Jacobs has her sights set on Gregory Preston. A successful surgeon, he has just the bankroll she needs to keep her in the lifestyle that her credit card debt has helped her grow accustomed to. Samaria joins Greater Christian Church to get close to Gregory’s wife. If she gets to know Angelina Preston, she can become like her in more than just looks, and really work her way into Greg’s heart. Angelina Preston’s life is filled with a successful career and busy ministry work, but something’s just not right with her marriage. Late nights, early meetings, lipstick- and perfume-stained shirts have her suspicious that Greg is doing a little more operating than she’d like. But does she have the strength to confront the only man she’s ever loved and risk losing him to the other woman? Just when Samaria thinks she’s got it all figured out, she finds herself drawn to Angelina’s kindness. Will she be able to carry out her plan after she finds herself yearning for the one thing she’s never had . . . the friendship of a woman? ABOUT THE AUTHOR Rhonda McKnight is the owner of Legacy Editing, a free-lance editing service for fiction writers and Urban Christian Fiction Today, a popular Internet site that highlights African-American Christian fiction.

Samaria Jacobs has her sights set on Gregory Preston. A successful surgeon, he has just the bankroll she needs to keep her in the lifestyle that her credit card debt has helped her grow accustomed to. Samaria joins Greater Christian Church to get close to Gregory’s wife. If she gets to know Angelina Preston, she can become like her in more than just looks, and really work her way into Greg’s heart. Angelina Preston’s life is filled with a successful career and busy ministry work, but something’s just not right with her marriage. Late nights, early meetings, lipstick- and perfume-stained shirts have her suspicious that Greg is doing a little more operating than she’d like. But does she have the strength to confront the only man she’s ever loved and risk losing him to the other woman? Just when Samaria thinks she’s got it all figured out, she finds herself drawn to Angelina’s kindness. Will she be able to carry out her plan after she finds herself yearning for the one thing she’s never had . . . the friendship of a woman?

Jenkins  - Nov 18,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/11/18/evening-with-ella-series</link><description><![CDATA[ About Beyond the Closet Door by Sharon C. Jenkins A rescuer translated in today's vernacular would be equivalent to the term super hero. For some it may be hard to see Jesus as a super hero in tights with a banner on his chest flying through the air like Superman. Especially when you've been struggling most of your life with the consequences of child abuse, and now you're all grown up and still carrying around that baggage. Beloved, know that God did not forsake you. He has a rescue plan tailor-made just for you. He's been waiting all these years for you to answer the closet door of your wounded heart. Remember the closet? That place where you have stored all the things you don't want anyone else to know about ... Beyond the Closet Door helps you find the courage and strength to get up off the closet floor of oppression, answer the door of deliverance and run into the waiting arms of your super hero, Jesus Christ. In his rescuing arms you will find the fulfillment of his promise for comfort, healing, forgiveness and everlasting hope. About the Author Known as The Master Communicator, author Sharon Jenkins is proficient in communicating the plight of the abused child in her revelatory book, Beyond the Closet Door. Ms. Jenkins is a motivational speaker and workshop facilitator and serves as the inspirational Principal for Desire to Inspire Writers’ Workshop Series. She is currently working on her PhD at Union Institute and University in Public Policy and Social Justice and is an MLK Scholar. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>Ella Curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>EDC Creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/black-pearls-magazine/'>Black Pearls Magazine</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/black-pearls-magazine.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/black-pearls-magazine.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/books/'>books</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/literature/'>literature</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/literature.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/literature.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ About Beyond the Closet Door by Sharon C.

Miss KP began writing in high school as an outlet to express her emotions as a teenager. She would write poetry and has even written unpublished songs. However, after feeling as if she had much more to say, she decided to purchase a laptop and began working on her first novel, which we now know as Dirty Divorce, Part 1. Just months after a good friend introduced her to publisher, Azarel; Miss KP’s dreams came true. She became a published author with the Life Changing Books (L.C.B) family with a #1 hit behind her name. Along with being an author, Miss KP works in the fashion industry as a Merchandise Manager in prominent department store. A native Washingtonian, Miss KP currently resides in Maryland with her eight year old daughter, and is awaiting the release of her second and most anticipated novel of 2010, The Dirty Divorce- Part 2.

Andrea Clinton is a novelist, poet and essayist, and aspiring screenwriter/filmmaker. As a Montclair State University graduate, she possesses a degree in English, Film and Journalism. She’s the founder and CEO of the non-profit organization, People Helping People; worked as Editor in Chief of AMISTAD newspaper, New Jersey; and is presently working on a biography and screenplay featuring the life of her uncle George Clinton of Parliament/Funkadelic and the Clinton family. Andrea can remember telling stories as far back as eight years old when she and her younger sister would lay in bed at night waiting to fall asleep. She remembers this gift maturing as she went to summer camp where telling stories around the camp fire and in the cabin with cabin mates was a ritual. In grammar school Andrea’s grandmother, Dorothy Louise Carter, introduced her to playwriting.

We will also discuss newly released novel Stripper Pole To Heaven by Hunter Hayes at 9:00 pm EST. About Stripper Pole To Heaven: In these hard times, most of us want to believe in something; a higher power, or maybe even more in ourselves. But some of us have to learn the hard way, that getting money isn't the answer to everything.... About the Book Soon After The Ministry birthed by one will be exploited by another. Can Willie Green stand idly by and let that happen? When Pastors Willie Green and Vanessa Morton got married and moved to merge their churches, they never expected so much resistance. Now it seems someone is sending a strong message by setting fire to the Harvest Baptist Church building. The newly unified Pleasant Harvest Baptist Church is no more than four months into business as usual before Co-Pastor Willie Green is drawn into the middle of an arson investigation. Alexis Montgomery, an overzealous reporter, sees the experienced pastor as a great source to latch onto as she tries to unearth the stories that might solve the crime. Instead of being bothered by the presence of this woman, Co-Pastor Vanessa uses it as a distraction to help conceal her own secrets. Orchestrating the unification rift makes Deacon Charley Thompson a prime suspect. His unexpected silence only fuels the accusations of guilt... What should have been a simple unification of two churches has turned into something much more complicated, and it will take plenty of faith to hold it all.

We will also discuss newly released novel Stripper Pole To Heaven by Hunter Hayes at 9:00 pm EST. About Stripper Pole To Heaven: In these hard times, most of us want to believe in something; a higher power, or maybe even more in ourselves. But some of us have to learn the hard way, that getting money isn't the answer to everything.... About the Book Soon After The Ministry birthed by one will be exploited by another. Can Willie Green stand idly by and let that happen? When Pastors Willie Green and Vanessa Morton got married and moved to merge their churches, they never expected so much resistance. Now it seems someone is sending a strong message by setting fire to the Harvest Baptist Church building. The newly unified Pleasant Harvest Baptist Church is no more than four months into business as usual before Co-Pastor Willie Green is drawn into the middle of an arson investigation. Alexis Montgomery, an overzealous reporter, sees the experienced pastor as a great source to latch onto as she tries to unearth the stories that might solve the crime. Instead of being bothered by the presence of this woman, Co-Pastor Vanessa uses it as a distraction to help conceal her own secrets. Orchestrating the unification rift makes Deacon Charley Thompson a prime suspect. His unexpected silence only fuels the accusations of guilt... What should have been a simple unification of two churches has turned into something much more complicated, and it will take plenty of faith to hold it all.

Appearances mean everything to Delilah Dupree Jewel. So after hearing of her daughter-in-law's sudden death, Delilah decides that coming to the rescue of her long estranged son Jesse and her granddaughter Tamara would be a good look . . . though Lord knows she-ll have to dig hard to find her maternal instincts. But Delilah quickly discovers Jesse wants nothing to do with her. And Tamara, who's following in Delilah's musical footsteps, isn't interested in her career advice, especially since Delilah got ahead using the singing couch. And Delilah's old flame Deacon Pillar, an ex-convict who-s traded in his gangster ways for a Bible, is stirring up a past that-s sure to shock. Now, all Delilah knows is that she'd better hold on to her faith, because she needs God now more than ever. . . . About the Author Pat G'Orge-Walker is the Essence bestselling author of Somebody's Sinning in My Bed; Somewhat Saved; Cruisin' on Desperation; Mother Eternal Ann Everlastin's Dead; Sister Betty, God's Calling You, Again!; and contributed a short story to the anthology Proverbs for the People. Growing up a preacher's kid gave G'Orge-Walker a quirky perspective on the church community and inspired her to create a one-woman comedy show centering on Sister Betty, an elderly super saint whose un-Christian-like behavior blocks her blessings. With the success of the Sister Betty comedy show, G'Orge-Walker turned her humor and imagination to writing. She resides in Long Island, New York, with husband Rob.

Appearances mean everything to Delilah Dupree Jewel. So after hearing of her daughter-in-law's sudden death, Delilah decides that coming to the rescue of her long estranged son Jesse and her granddaughter Tamara would be a good look . . . though Lord knows she-ll have to dig hard to find her maternal instincts. But Delilah quickly discovers Jesse wants nothing to do with her. And Tamara, who's following in Delilah's musical footsteps, isn't interested in her career advice, especially since Delilah got ahead using the singing couch. And Delilah's old flame Deacon Pillar, an ex-convict who-s traded in his gangster ways for a Bible, is stirring up a past that-s sure to shock. Now, all Delilah knows is that she'd better hold on to her faith, because she needs God now more than ever. . . . About the Author Pat G'Orge-Walker is the Essence bestselling author of Somebody's Sinning in My Bed; Somewhat Saved; Cruisin' on Desperation; Mother Eternal Ann Everlastin's Dead; Sister Betty, God's Calling You, Again!; and contributed a short story to the anthology Proverbs for the People.

When asked to define Christian fiction in her terms, Shelia stated “My definition of Christian fiction is real life stories about everyday struggles and shortcomings that people face in life, along with a God defined message that God stands willing, waiting and ready to offer His redemption and forgiveness.” Call into the show at 646.200.0402 to join Shelia in this discussion and to tell us your views on faith-based books. My Son’s Ex-Wife: The Aftermath is the second book in Author Shelia E. Lipsey’s My Son’s Wife trilogy. The story of the Graham family continues in My Son's Ex-Wife. First Lady Audrey Graham is more than relieved when Stiles encounters the young, vivacious nutritionist Detria Mackey. Rena is equally captivated by recent divorcee, Robert Becton. Does the handsome, science teacher Robert Becton possess what Rena needs to give her life a much needed jump start? When Rena returns to Memphis for less than pleasant reasons, Stiles and Rena realize they still have deep feelings for one another, but will their feelings overcome the past that severed their relationship? Will Audrey manage to come between them again or will other circumstances intervene that will give them cause to rethink their past and move forward to the future.

Lutishia Lovely, in Heaven Forbids, picks up the story at Gospel Truth Church. Reverend Doctor Bishop Obadiah Meshach Brook, Jr., at the encouragement of Reverend Stanly Lee, steps out of retirement to bring order back to the church after the fall of its former minister, Pastor Nathaniel Thicke. As his first order of business, Reverend Doctor O issues a new code of ethics to the members of Gospel Truth only to have them turn their backs on him. The Reverend begins to believe that he does not have what it takes to head a ministry, until someone from his past returns with an agenda – to get him back in her bed. Princess Brook, Rev. Doctor O’s grand-daughter, has decided to write a book about her experiences in college. The only problem is that she has not discussed it with her parents and she still craves the attention of the person that broke her heart. Reverend Stanley Lee and his wife, Carla, are also facing a major problem that needs immediate attention. Carla seeks help from Maxine, Reverend Doctor O’s wife. But Maxine’s advice only leaves Carla desperate. Lovely answers many questions her readers asked regarding her unforgettable characters, Passion, Carla, Maxine, and many more. As always, this story will make you laugh, cry, and shout as you turn each page. Lovely has a wonderful way of telling the story without it being too preachy and it has enough scandal, sex, and laughter to make you want to read more. If you like church gossip without the preaching, this is the book for you. This book was provided by the author for review purposes. written by Priscilla C.

Lifelong friends Coco, Nita, and Audra have spent years looking for love in the arms of flashy pro athletes, hoping to land a baller but ending up with a stream of failed relationships. The beautiful and demure Coco has endured years of physical abuse from her boyfriend, Sonny, while Audra, a single mother, has dated her fair share of cheaters and yearns for a stable companion who will be a father figure to her son. And feisty, seductive Nita is tired of being the million dollar mistress and wants to settle down—if she can find someone worth coming home to. Patricia Haley discusses "Destined." Destined by Patricia Haley is the second novel in the Chosen series, inspired by the popular biblical kings David and Solomon. Don, the eldest son and rightful heir to the ministry, returns from South Africa after three years of self-imposed exile. With a renewed zeal to reclaim the leadership of his late father’s multi-million dollar ministry, his plans are short-lived when a stock transfer agreement goes wrong, rendering Don powerless. Don’s little brother Joel continues as CEO, careening down the path of personal, professional, and spiritual demise, as he drags the ministry down with him. The only hope to save their father’s legacy is Don’s intervention, and so clinging to his self-worth and faith, Don is torn between fighting for a company he wasn’t chosen to run and fleeing back to his South African refuge, a place where his peace, his growing relationship with Naledi, and his dignity aren’t in question. After much soul searching, Don comes to realize that his destiny is inescapable and that his future lies in his family’s legacy. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>EDC Creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>Ella Curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/books/'>Books</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/publishing/'>Publishing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/literature/'>Literature</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/literature.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/literature.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ReShonda Tate Billingsley discusses "Holy Roller."

After much soul searching, Don comes to realize that his destiny is inescapable and that his future lies in his family’s legacy. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>02:00:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/06/18/why-it-matters-panel-discussion.mp3" fileSize="17475837" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/06/18/why-it-matters-panel-discussion.wma" fileSize="17475837" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>Black Author Network</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>EDC Creations,Ella Curry,Books,Publishing,Literature,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Patricia Haley and ReShonda Tate Billingsley Showcase</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>Donna Watford Book Launch Party - Jun 17,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/06/17/why-it-matters-panel-discussion</link><description><![CDATA[It's a Party!

"Church Sex Scandal!" the front page of The Washington Times screamed. Barely off the plane from Africa for two minutes and some American sensationalism is there to greet her. Glad not to be in public relations anymore, Trina Michaels plans to ignore the headline. Until she recognizes the faces of the accused. When she returns from her two-year mission trip in Mozambique, Trina realizes that other than longing to see her mother and her best friend, her heart aches to fly back to the place that now feels more like home than anywhere she's ever lived. And to the man who's stolen her heart. Her dreams of returning to her beloved village are short-lived. Trina soon learns that her mother has been diagnosed with cancer and the cost of treatment is expensive. She's forced to return to her career in public relations and is assigned a damage control client--the bishop of a mega-church where an associate pastor and deacon were accused of sexually abusing young boys. One of the young boys has grown up to become her best friend's husband and a popular gospel recording artist. Representing Bishop Walker could cost Trina her most valued friendship, her reputation, and a future with her new love. As she plows deeper into the scandal and the bishop blackmails her to cover the church's secrets and lies, Trina realizes it could cost her soul. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>EDC Creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>Ella Curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/books/'>Books</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/publishing/'>Publishing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/literature/'>Literature</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/literature.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/literature.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Featured Book: Selling My Soul (Urban Christian) by Sherri Lewis.

We had a small techinal glitch. But the show moves on the be a blast! Join host Ella Curry and the BAN fans as they discuss the new book Uptown: A Novel by Virginia DeBerry and Donna Grant. Don't miss the authors reading live from their book. ENTER THE WORLD OF UPTOWN Uptown . . . where money rules Uptown . . . where ambition trumps tradition Uptown . . . where politics come before everything Uptown . . . where a family’s secrets will bring them together—or down After twenty years away, Avery Lyons returns to New York when her mother and uncle suffer a serious car accident. The tragedy brings the family together, but Avery is not happy about the impromptu reunion. She no longer recognizes the Harlem of her childhood, but the same old family dynamics and secrets are all too familiar . . . Heir to a real estate empire, Dwight is willing to do anything to realize his aging and demanding father’s dream: Dixon Plaza, a luxury high-rise development on Central Park North that will change the face of Harlem forever. There’s only one thing in his way: his cousin Avery has inherited a share of the property. She’s more than willing to sell until a reporter uncovers the truth behind the rumored shady dealings . . . In Uptown a prominent Harlem family is strained to the breaking point by the high-stakes world of the Manhattan real estate industry, and one woman searches for her identity and the will to forgive. Steamy, provocative, and sexy, Uptown is a turbulent and triumphant read. About the Authors With seven novels to their credit, Virginia DeBerry and Donna Grant, best friends for more than 25 years, have turned a friendship into one of the most successful and enduring writing collaborations in women's fiction.

Attica Locke discusses Black Water Rising with the Go on Girl President.Attica Locke is a novelist and a screenwriter who has written scripts for Paramount, Warner Bros, Disney, Twentieth Century Fox, HBO Films and more. A graduate of Northwestern University, she was a fellow at the Sundance Institute’s Feature Filmmaker’s Lab. Black Water Rising, her first novel, was nominated for a 2010 Edgar Award and a 2010 NAACP Image Award. She is currently at work on her second book. Black Water Rising is a murder mystery that takes place in Houston, Texas, in 1981. It follows the character, Jay Porter, a low rent criminal defense attorney who was heavily involved in the civil rights movement in the late '60s and early '70s and now finds himself trying to transition from the political activism of his youth into the Reagan '80s - a time when the whole country and black people in particular had shifted our focus from political progress to economic progress. At the beginning of the book, Jay saves a woman from drowning and soon gets caught up in a mystery involving this woman and some of the biggest power brokers in the city. And along the way he has to come to terms with the demons of his past: the guns, his FBI file, the trial that nearly destroyed him.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/publishing/'>publishing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/bookclubs/'>bookclubs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bookclubs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bookclubs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/african-american/'>african american</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>ella curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>edc creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join Ella as she meets one today's hottest authors.

It follows the character, Jay Porter, a low rent criminal defense attorney who was heavily involved in the civil rights movement in the late '60s and early '70s and now finds himself trying to transition from the political activism of his youth into the Reagan '80s - a time when the whole country and black people in particular had shifted our focus from political progress to economic progress. At the beginning of the book, Jay saves a woman from drowning and soon gets caught up in a mystery involving this woman and some of the biggest power brokers in the city. And along the way he has to come to terms with the demons of his past: the guns, his FBI file, the trial that nearly destroyed him.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/publishing/'>publishing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/bookclubs/'>bookclubs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bookclubs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bookclubs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/african-american/'>african american</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>ella curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>edc creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Books</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/03/04/author-interview/#comments</comments><enclosure url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/03/04/author-interview.mp3" length="16369081" type="audio/mpeg" /><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/03/04/author-interview</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2010 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><itunes:summary>Join Ella as she meets one today's hottest authors.

Luckett  and Dolen Perkins Valdez - Feb 24,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/02/24/author-interview</link><description><![CDATA[After leaving the corporate world, Jacqueline Luckett took a creative writing class on a dare, from herself, and began writing short stories and poetry and never looked back. Searching for Tina Turner is the story of Lena Harrison Spencer, a woman on the verge of change, whose journey is inspired by Tina Turner’s strength. There is no physical abuse in Lena’s life, but there is the longing to follow a dream. Lena loves her life, her husband Randall—successful, attentive, but distant—and their two children—Kendrick, the oldest, trying to nip a drug habit in the bud, and Camille, seventeen and disgusted by her mother’s overbearing behavior. Wench: A Novel by Dolen Perkins-valdez. In her debut, Perkins-Valdez eloquently plunges into a dark period of American history, chronicling the lives of four slave women—Lizzie, Reenie, Sweet and Mawu—who are their masters' mistresses. The women meet when their owners vacation at the same summer resort in Ohio. There, they see free blacks for the first time and hear rumors of abolition, sparking their own desires to be free. For everyone but Lizzie, that is, who believes she is really in love with her master, and he with her. An extended flashback in the middle of the novel delves into Lizzie's life and vividly explores the complicated psychological dynamic between master and slave. Jumping back to the final summer in Ohio, the women all have a decision to make—will they run? Heart-wrenching, intriguing, original and suspenseful, this novel showcases Perkins-Valdez's ability to bring the unfortunate past to life. Dolen Perkins-Valdez's fiction and essays have appeared in The Kenyon Review, African American Review, North Carolina Literary Review, and the Richard Wright Newsletter. Born and raised in Memphis, a graduate of Harvard, and a former University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellow, Perkins-Valdez teaches creative writing at the University of Puget Sound. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/publishing/'>publishing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/publishing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/bookclubs/'>bookclubs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bookclubs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bookclubs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/african-american/'>african american</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>ella curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>edc creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[After leaving the corporate world, Jacqueline Luckett took a creative writing class on a dare, from herself, and began writing short stories and poetry and never looked back.

Wench: A Novel by Dolen Perkins-valdez. In her debut, Perkins-Valdez eloquently plunges into a dark period of American history, chronicling the lives of four slave women—Lizzie, Reenie, Sweet and Mawu—who are their masters' mistresses. The women meet when their owners vacation at the same summer resort in Ohio. There, they see free blacks for the first time and hear rumors of abolition, sparking their own desires to be free. For everyone but Lizzie, that is, who believes she is really in love with her master, and he with her. An extended flashback in the middle of the novel delves into Lizzie's life and vividly explores the complicated psychological dynamic between master and slave. Jumping back to the final summer in Ohio, the women all have a decision to make—will they run? Heart-wrenching, intriguing, original and suspenseful, this novel showcases Perkins-Valdez's ability to bring the unfortunate past to life. Dolen Perkins-Valdez's fiction and essays have appeared in The Kenyon Review, African American Review, North Carolina Literary Review, and the Richard Wright Newsletter. Born and raised in Memphis, a graduate of Harvard, and a former University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellow, Perkins-Valdez teaches creative writing at the University of Puget Sound. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>02:00:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/02/24/author-interview.mp3" fileSize="25791344" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/02/24/author-interview.wma" fileSize="25791344" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>Black Author Network</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>publishing,bookclubs,african american,ella curry,edc creations,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Evening with Jacqueline E.

Years of poor communication and neglect leave her doubting that God will ever fix her marriage.

Pediatric cardiologist Jonah Morgan is obsessed with one thing: his work.

Royal  discusses, Bankruptcy Ain't Broke  - Jan 23,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/01/23/theresa-d-royal-discusses-bankruptcy-aint-broke</link><description><![CDATA[Join Ella as she meets author Theresa D. Royal. Theresa will discuss her book, Bankruptcy "Ain't" Broke (Putting the Pieces Back Together Through Life Lessons)by Theresa D. Royal. Theresa D. Royal, CMP, an entrepreneur specializing in event planning, was forced to file bankruptcy in 2006 due to her putting her trust in one client, and not putting her trust in God. She had good credit all of her life, but due to certain choices and the unethical practices of this client, her finances spun out of control. In addition, she had never been late on her mortgage payments until her income was abruptly cut off. Even though she tried to work out a forbearance with the mortgage company, they accelerated the foreclosure process and she found herself in a situation where her home was about to be auctioned off within a very short period of time.

Armstrong Author Interview - Jan 13,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/black-author-network/2010/01/13/lori-g-armstrong-author-interview</link><description><![CDATA[Join host Ella Curry as she meets mystery writer Lori G. Armstrong to discuss her new title, No Mercy. Lori G. Armstrong left the firearms industry in 2000. Her mass market mystery series has been nominated for the Willa Cather Literary Award, the High Plains Book Award, the Daphne du Maurier Award, and the Shamus Award for Best Paperback Original by The Private Eye Writers of America. Lori is a fourth generation South Dakotan and lives with her family in Rapid City. No Mercy: Mercy Gunderson is a straight shooter with a hard edge. On medical leave from the army, she returns home to South Dakota, which isn't much safer for her than Iraq. Arriving just after the death of her father, it is up to Mercy to decide what to do with the family ranch and try to deal with her irresponsible sister and nephew. Feeling guilty that she didn't make it home soon enough to see her father one last time, Mercy is suddenly pulled into the local community when the body of an Indian boy is found on her land. But nobody seems to be doing anything about it, especially not the local law enforcement.

Armstrong to discuss her new title, No Mercy. Lori G. Armstrong left the firearms industry in 2000. Her mass market mystery series has been nominated for the Willa Cather Literary Award, the High Plains Book Award, the Daphne du Maurier Award, and the Shamus Award for Best Paperback Original by The Private Eye Writers of America. Lori is a fourth generation South Dakotan and lives with her family in Rapid City. No Mercy: Mercy Gunderson is a straight shooter with a hard edge. On medical leave from the army, she returns home to South Dakota, which isn't much safer for her than Iraq. Arriving just after the death of her father, it is up to Mercy to decide what to do with the family ranch and try to deal with her irresponsible sister and nephew. Feeling guilty that she didn't make it home soon enough to see her father one last time, Mercy is suddenly pulled into the local community when the body of an Indian boy is found on her land. But nobody seems to be doing anything about it, especially not the local law enforcement. When tragedy strikes again, Mercy is ready to throw all her energy into her own investigation, and she's out for revenge. As she digs up the truth behind the shocking crimes, Mercy uncovers dark and dangerous secrets and must race to stop a killer before everything she's fought for is destroyed forever.

This accomplished Christian author and comedienne has an amazing mind and talent for turning her observations of church and black church life, in particular, into gems of sidesplitting humor. It is her own special gift from God that enables G’Orge-Walker to depict the often ridiculous antics of church folk. She does it without subverting the Good News or watering down the potency of its message. Pat G’Orge-Walker has led a colorful life professionally, to say the least. She is a former music industry veteran who has worked for several major labels including Epic, Def Jam and Columbia. She cut her chops as a singer by performing with the legendary 60s girl group, Arlene Smith and the Chantels (“Maybe”) as well as with the gospel groups The Spiritualettes and The Heavenly Two. And she has written as well as acted in stage presentations.

Francis will discuss her many years as a writer and chat with her fans. Message from Francis: Dear Readers, Fall is definitely here. There’s a nip in the air, the leaves are falling, and women are pulling out their fabulous boots. For readers that means it’s time to curl up with a great book. Thankfully, there are lots of great reads coming out. Please remember what great gifts books make. While shopping for books I invite you to pick up ONE NIGHT WITH YOU, Book # 3 in the Grayson Friends Series. You’ll be happy to know that the book will provide you with an update on Blade and Sierra, and Faith and Brandon, and you’ll learn a bit more about Rio. And, yes, Rio will have his own story. ONE NIGHT WITH YOU is Duncan McBride’s story...Faith and Cameron might have escaped the McBride family curse, but Duncan doesn’t hold out much hope for himself. But, then, he hasn’t met Raven La Blanc! Readers met Raven in IRRESISTIBLE YOU when Ruth Grayson used her to push Pierce toward Sabra. I wonder if Ruth is up to a little match-making between Raven and Duncan. If so, this time she might need a little help. One guess who that help is coming from!

Loretta is the presiding President and Founder of C.H. Publishing. This exceptional educator possesses the ability to cultivate the gifts and talents within her young adult scholars. Loretta currently resides in Orlando, Florida where she is dedicated to the completion of her doctorate degree in education at Nova Southeastern University. The sole purpose of “The Journey Less Traveled” is to equip readers with the necessary tools to make the conscious decision to “Turn Tragedy into Triumph.” When life throws you a hardball, it does not teach you how to recover from the hit.

From the ICU unit, to rehab, to outpatient therapy, depression, emotional deprivation, and my eventual triumph; this book offers readers a transparent look at how I chose to endure the pain that would ultimately catapult me into my destiny.

Her books have garnered several awards, including two EMMA awards, the Romance In Color Reviewers Award, Readers Choice Award and the Atlanta Choice Award in the Religious & Spiritual category. Jacquelin was a 2005 honoree at the Houston Black Film Festival for the movie adaptation of her novel, Hidden Blessings. She was the first recipient to receive the Writers Achievement Award at the North Carolina Book Festival in Winston-Salem. Although Jacquelin initially published in the romance genre, she decided to follow the call on her heart to write Christian fiction because she seeks to write books that will touch your heart and uplift your spirits with tales of characters who yearn to have an intimate relationship with God. Committed to writing books that glorify God and her growing teen audience, Jacquelin published the first of her Young Adult Inspirational Fiction series titled Simply Divine in October 2006. Her second book in the series, Divine Confidential was nominated for a 2008 NAACP Image Award. She has since gone on to publish two more books in the series. When asked why she is so passionate about writing teen novels, Thomas shares that teens are confronted with so much—sex, drugs, violence and abuse, physically and mentally. They need to not only listen to what the world says about these things but also to what the Bible says.

In the Land of Cotton by Martha A. Taylor SLAVERY IS MORE THAN CHAINS AND SHACKLES SLAVERY IS A STATE OF MIND Immerse yourself in this highly anticipated political docu-drama set in the Deep South amidst the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement. Martha was a young white girl living in the Deep South, inundated with the racist sentiments of the times. But Martha's natural curiosity and generous heart led her to question this racial divide. When she discovered a primitive Negro family living deep in the woods near her house, everyone's life changed forever. Take the journey of a lifetime alongside Martha as she forges relationships that lead to self discovery and a clearer understanding of the world around her. In the Land of Cotton provides an outstanding snapshot of life in the South during those troubled times - a snapshot everyone should take a close look at, regardless of era or color.

Dr. Cheryl Wilson-Bridges answers that provocative question in the pages of her brand new book, Levite Praise. Published by Creation House, the book views praise and worship from a uniquely biblical perspective as it delves through the Scripture searching the answers to three questions: 1) What does God desire? 2) What does God require; and 3) How should we aspire? Dr. Wilson-Bridges, minister of music at the Community Praise Center in Alexandria, VA and the recipient of a Master of Arts in Practical Theology and Worship and a Doctorate in Strategic Leadership, both from Regent University, rediscovers the purpose of praise and worship in Levite Praise. Although many agree that praise and worship plays a crucial role in Christian church services, few agree about the method. Levite Praise digs into the Scriptures to help worship leaders and worshipers develop a full understanding of what it means to direct and take part in God’s perfect model for praise and worship.

Levite Praise digs into the Scriptures to help worship leaders and worshipers develop a full understanding of what it means to direct and take part in God’s perfect model for praise and worship.

Dr. Cheryl Wilson-Bridges answers that provocative question in the pages of her brand new book, Levite Praise. Published by Creation House, the book views praise and worship from a uniquely biblical perspective as it delves through the Scripture searching the answers to three questions: 1) What does God desire? 2) What does God require; and 3) How should we aspire?

Have you ever craved someone so bad…that you’d be willing to do anything? Meet Dominique Lewis, a foul, hard-boiled, go-getter who spends most of her days yearning to be just like her sister, and plotting on taking her man. For her, it’s all about money, sex, and power. Although she possesses the perfect physique and sexy features, her life-long dream is to become wealthy and a house-hold name. By any means necessary, she vows to get what she wants. As Dominique’s mission unfolds, she manages to get connected to Yuri, a violent replacement for the man she really sought. After realizing she’s partnered with a beast, her world turns upside down. And soon, after the tragic murder of her sister, all hell breaks loose when Dominique’s cover is blown. Armed with revenge on the brain, and a status goal in mind, Dominique soon appoints herself as Rapheal’s woman, the most sought after millionaire in Atlanta. Raphael’s lavish status in town would put her on a new level, right where she always dreamed…the only problem …he never said he wanted her. In an effort to hold on to Rapheal, and all the elaborate material possessions, Dominique sets out on a deadly mission to remove anything that stands in her way. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ella-curry/'>Ella Curry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ella-curry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/azarel/'>Azarel</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/azarel.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/azarel.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/african-american/'>African American</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/african-american.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/carbon-copy/'>Carbon Copy</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/carbon-copy.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/carbon-copy.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edc-creations/'>EDC Creations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edc-creations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Book spotlight: Carbon Copy by Azarel.

Lies of Blue is the story about Lynne Forde, a young woman who tries to reach her dream by making sacrifices. Somewhere along the line, the wrong sacrifices get made. It's Training Day meets OZ with a twist of Set It Off. When Forde gets tired of her dead end job in the City Courts, she embarks on a career in the belly of the beast. With a degree in hand and a little bit of street sense, she decides to try her hand working in River's Edge Jail Complex. From day one at the Academy to her last day at Prison, Forde evolves from your average "rookie" into something other than just a woman.

Monique D. Mensah is a native Detroiter. She declared her dream of becoming an author at eight years old. After earning a Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Michigan, she completed her first manuscript. Shortly after, she launched Kisa Publishing, and published her first novel, Who Is He To You. Monique now resides in Southfield, MI where she is raising her daughter and working on her second novel. Readers will be intrigued by the intelligent exploration of sensitive issues such as cutting, emotional abuse, depression, and drug-addiction.The first page which is filled with intense emotion and a descriptive setting that pulls the reader right into the scene. Simone, a shockingly beautiful teen, is on the downward spiral of destruction as she battles incest and self-hatred; she finds cutting to be the only way to relieve her pain. Jessica lives the upscale lifestyle of a refined society matron. She strives to be the perfect wife, but without her husband, Ross, she would be nothing more than the abused stripper he rescued 16 years ago. Ryan, a fiery thirty-something, is quickly slipping into depression and prescription drug-addiction as her boyfriend, Anthony, artfully dangles the empty promise of marriage. As the shattered lives of three very different women collide, they find that they have one thing in common: they are all in a desperate fight to hang on to love. But when love involves incest, self-mutilation, drug-addiction and murder, will they continue to fight or will they find the strength to escape before it's too late? Experience their emotional journey through to the shocking end where these women will experience injury, imprisonment and even death while crafting new lives from the ashes of their ruination.

What would you do if the secret you were keeping could set you free, yet ultimately devastate the ones you love?.........After six years of marriage, Victoria and Ted are the ultimate power couple. She's a beautiful, business savvy sister who owns one of Atlanta's most sought after event planning companies. He's a powerful, blue-eyed CEO who knows how to take care of business in and out of the boardroom. But their seemingly happy life begins to unravel in the blink of an eye when long held desires and decades old secrets come back to haunt them. Victoria's road to deceit begins when Parker Brightwood re-enters her life. She thought she'd gotten over the brazenly handsome surgeon who once stole her heart, but an unusual set of circumstances ushers the ebony prince back on the scene, and this time he's determined to win her back at any cost. Ted's undoing begins with his mother's sudden death, and a mysterious secret that leads to unexpected places. When the truth is finally revealed, it's a realization so shocking, it threatens the life and marriage he holds so dear. As Victoria and Ted journey down a road filled with uncertainty, they're forced to take a hard, honest look at themselves and confront their hidden fears.

What would you do if the secret you were keeping could set you free, yet ultimately devastate the ones you love?.........After six years of marriage, Victoria and Ted are the ultimate power couple. She's a beautiful, business savvy sister who owns one of Atlanta's most sought after event planning companies. He's a powerful, blue-eyed CEO who knows how to take care of business in and out of the boardroom. But their seemingly happy life begins to unravel in the blink of an eye when long held desires and decades old secrets come back to haunt them. Victoria's road to deceit begins when Parker Brightwood re-enters her life. She thought she'd gotten over the brazenly handsome surgeon who once stole her heart, but an unusual set of circumstances ushers the ebony prince back on the scene, and this time he's determined to win her back at any cost. Ted's undoing begins with his mother's sudden death, and a mysterious secret that leads to unexpected places. When the truth is finally revealed, it's a realization so shocking, it threatens the life and marriage he holds so dear. As Victoria and Ted journey down a road filled with uncertainty, they're forced to take a hard, honest look at themselves and confront their hidden fears. Can they repair the damage before it's too late, or will they follow a path headed toward destruction?

I have defined faith as vision fueled by action, and have suggested that faith is not necessarily an exclusively religious notion. The book takes the stories of some Biblical characters who have done extraordinary things, just because God said do it and they believed God and that they could do what God said do.

<p><strong>That Devil's No Friend of Mine --Synopsis<br />
</strong>When Bishop Fontaine passed away, he left behind more than a list of good deeds.  He was known as a caring friend and doting father...but he was also manipulative and controlling, especially to those he loved. His death begins to unravel deep secrets and shocking desires among the people he cared most about.   Five very different people whose lives are only connected by Bishop suddenly find themselves up close and personal as desires, dreams and passions collide.</p>
<p ><br />
<strong>Reviews:</strong> <br />
"Mason has become a major name in African American fiction. Her stark portrayals of her characters and their innermost thoughts bring the readers right into the emotional center of the story. Those who enjoy Carl Weber and Eric Jerome Dickey will add Mason to their list of favorites." <strong>--Booklist</strong> <br />
 <br />
 <br />
"Bishop Fontaine is a huge presence in the lives of his friends and family, and Mason adeptly shows how his death has an equally powerful impack on them. Diverse emotions flow across the pages, and readers will savor the intimacies and storylines that make this novel an exceptional offering."<strong> --Romantic Times BOOKreviews</strong></p>
<p ><br />
<strong>Biography</strong><br />
J.D. MASON is the author of YOU GOTTA SIN TO GET SAVED, THIS FIRE DOWN IN MY SOUL, DON'T WANT NO SUGAR, AND ON THE EIGTH DAY SHE RESTED, and ONE DAY I SAW A BLACK KING. She lives in Denver, Colorado with her two children.<br />

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br><font color=#8b0000 size=4>Letter to My Daughter by Dr. Maya Angelou</font><br>&nbsp;<br>For a world of devoted readers, a much-awaited new volume of absorbing stories and inspirational wisdom from one of our best-loved writers. Dedicated to the daughter she never had but sees all around her, Letter to My Daughter reveals Maya Angelou’s path to living well and living a life with meaning. Told in her own inimitable style, this book transcends genres and categories: guidebook, memoir, poetry, and pure delight.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>
<p>“I gave birth to one child, a son, but I have thousands of daughters. You are Black and White, Jewish and Muslim, Asian, Spanish speaking, Native Americans and Aleut. You are fat and thin and pretty and plain, gay and straight, educated and unlettered, and I amspeaking to you all. Here is my offering to you.”</p>
<p>–from Letter to My Daughter </p>
<p><br><font color=#8b0000>Biography</font><br>An author whose series of autobiographies is as admired for its lyricism as its politics, Maya Angelou is a writer who’s done it all. Angelou's poetry and prose -- and her refusal to shy away from writing about the difficult times in her past -- have made her an inspiration to her readers.<br></p>

<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: Wow you have a phenomenal new book out <i>Letter to My Daughter</i>, it's a book to cherish and savor, reread and share. You were quoted as saying, "I gave birth to one child– a son, but I have thousands of daughters. I'd like to thank you for offering this book for us.&nbsp; </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> Thank you for receiving it.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: So tell us about your new book and what inspired you to write <i>Letter to My Daughter</i>?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> Well, this is my 80th year and I have been celebrating it all year long. And I realize that I have much less time ahead of me than I have behind and that I have learned some lessons and am in the process of learning some. So I thought I would jot down some of the incidents, some events which took place in my life from which I drew great lessons. And in looking at that, I didn't want to say which lessons I learned or what exactly I did with the lessons–the solutions. Because I know that my readers are as intelligent and resourceful and they will read about one incident they will get one solution. They'll gather it and then six months later, if they read it again they will find another possible lesson to be learned. I know that is the way I do when I read other people's work. So when I reread it, I think <i>hmm, I didn't know that was in there all the time</i>. So I hope that's what will happen with my readers.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: So in your book, <i>Letter to My Daughter</i>, you discuss several different topics and you remember lost friends such as Coretta Scott King and Ozzie David, could you talk to us about that for a minute, your memories?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> Yes, I was brought to look at those events because a number of friends of mine have died recently and I thought back to Ms. King and how we were chosen sisters and how I miss her. And then I thought about Ozzie and others. I thought about <span style="BACKGROUND: yellow">Max Roach</span> and people that names many you don't know and some are famous and some not known but famous in my heart. And I thought, <i>What on earth? </i>Instead of just crying and mourning really, because while we celebrate the life we should be free to mourn as well. Mourn their absence. And as I was doing that I felt, <i>Well maybe, maybe there's a way I can reduce the mourning, if I can go back to that life and see what their friendship did for me</i>. And as I went back, I was disheartened, heartened, I was inspired because I had been thinking about their absence and not really about the fun we had and the lessons they taught me. I learned from Coretta, stick-to-it-tiveness. Now I have learned that and have had other teachers to teach me that and life itself. But without Coretta Scott King just holding her faith that her husband would be remembered, I suspect that he would have. He could have become a footnote in the pages of history had she not simply stuck it. And because of her there's the King Center because of her and all the friends of course and the supporters. But because of her there's the King Day holiday. Without her there would not be that king memorial going up in Washington D.C.–in the Capitol. So I take from her life and even some conversations we've had, we travelled together to different places in the world. And when I think of that and I miss her, I'm able to look at what I got from her and be grateful to God for her life and be grateful to her for her love. </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: Wow that is so powerful to be remembered in that way. &nbsp;Ms. King and Dr. Martin Luther King will forever be icons...I was about to say the African American community, but worldwide. They created change that will forever improve our way of life. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> I think we have to put into that Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz as well, into that mix. ...and Medgar Evers into that mix. And Fanny Lou Hamer, men and women who really sought to make a better life for African Americans and for all Americans and all people–really all people.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> <b>So in 1959 through 1960 you were the northern coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and you were appointed at the request of Dr. Martin Luther King. How did that feel? Take us back to that time.</b> </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. Angelou:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> <b>(laughter)</b> Well you have to imagine I was young...'59, that's 50 years ago minus one. I was young, I'm six foot tall and I was very skinny at the time and I wore my hair natural–since 1952. And there was a lot of it. (laughter) o, I think, later on Angela Davis had a lot of it, well I looked sort of like that. <b>(laughter)</b></span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: Oh wow, that was a lot of hair.&nbsp; (laughter)</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A.:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> And a number of people really, they were made really uncomfortable...people around the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in New York. One woman dropped a note in a column in the New York African American newspaper, <i>The Amsterdam News</i>. She wrote, "Who is this person who has come from the west coast with the savage hairdo? Don't they have beauticians or at least barbers out there on the coast?" <b>(laughter)</b></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">It was heavy and so exciting because you'd have to be in his presence to sense the authority that Rev. King had. And I don't mean...I mean what is called charisma I think. It's a sense of he was in his skin and in the right place. So I was bowled over by that–by the job. I did my best and then I fell in love with a South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make and I married him and moved to Egypt. </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC : What traits do you see in Barack Obama that may also have been in the young Dr. Martin Luther King?&nbsp; I know they both speak so very well and elegantly. Do you see traits in Barack Obama that were the same as the young Dr. Martin Luther King? </span></b></p>

Of course, Senator Obama [is living] in another time. He is very inclusive, which is a wonderful thing. At that time when Rev. King first started he was not inclusive, he wasn't exclusive but it was only at the end of his life that he began to include openly. I mean before he said people of goodwill, African Americans or...and people of goodwill from anywhere. But toward the end of his life when he started the plan for the Poor People's March, that plan included... and he in fact told it to me and everybody. He said, "This is not an African American people's march, the Negro march, it is not a Black march, this is for the poor Whites, this is for the poor Whites in West Virginia. This is for the poor Spanish-speaking people in Texas and California and Arizona. This is for the poor Native Americans on the reservations; this is for the poor Asians set apart to garden for the world and have no rights, no chances." He said, "This is a poor people's march". When he became that inclusive, he really became dangerous. </span></p>

Be a little kinder when you talk to her. See, they don't know–smaller people. Children don't know that life is kicking you in the behind. They don't understand that.

Told in her own inimitable style, this book transcends genres and categories: guidebook, memoir, poetry, and pure delight.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>
<p>“I gave birth to one child, a son, but I have thousands of daughters. You are Black and White, Jewish and Muslim, Asian, Spanish speaking, Native Americans and Aleut. You are fat and thin and pretty and plain, gay and straight, educated and unlettered, and I amspeaking to you all. Here is my offering to you.”</p>
<p>–from Letter to My Daughter </p>
<p><br><font color=#8b0000>Biography</font><br>An author whose series of autobiographies is as admired for its lyricism as its politics, Maya Angelou is a writer who’s done it all. Angelou's poetry and prose -- and her refusal to shy away from writing about the difficult times in her past -- have made her an inspiration to her readers.<br></p>

You were quoted as saying, "I gave birth to one child– a son, but I have thousands of daughters. I'd like to thank you for offering this book for us.&nbsp; </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> Thank you for receiving it.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: So tell us about your new book and what inspired you to write <i>Letter to My Daughter</i>?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> Well, this is my 80th year and I have been celebrating it all year long. And I realize that I have much less time ahead of me than I have behind and that I have learned some lessons and am in the process of learning some. So I thought I would jot down some of the incidents, some events which took place in my life from which I drew great lessons. And in looking at that, I didn't want to say which lessons I learned or what exactly I did with the lessons–the solutions. Because I know that my readers are as intelligent and resourceful and they will read about one incident they will get one solution. They'll gather it and then six months later, if they read it again they will find another possible lesson to be learned. I know that is the way I do when I read other people's work. So when I reread it, I think <i>hmm, I didn't know that was in there all the time</i>. So I hope that's what will happen with my readers.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: So in your book, <i>Letter to My Daughter</i>, you discuss several different topics and you remember lost friends such as Coretta Scott King and Ozzie David, could you talk to us about that for a minute, your memories?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> Yes, I was brought to look at those events because a number of friends of mine have died recently and I thought back to Ms. King and how we were chosen sisters and how I miss her. And then I thought about Ozzie and others. I thought about <span style="BACKGROUND: yellow">Max Roach</span> and people that names many you don't know and some are famous and some not known but famous in my heart. And I thought, <i>What on earth? </i>Instead of just crying and mourning really, because while we celebrate the life we should be free to mourn as well. Mourn their absence. And as I was doing that I felt, <i>Well maybe, maybe there's a way I can reduce the mourning, if I can go back to that life and see what their friendship did for me</i>. And as I went back, I was disheartened, heartened, I was inspired because I had been thinking about their absence and not really about the fun we had and the lessons they taught me. I learned from Coretta, stick-to-it-tiveness. Now I have learned that and have had other teachers to teach me that and life itself. But without Coretta Scott King just holding her faith that her husband would be remembered, I suspect that he would have. He could have become a footnote in the pages of history had she not simply stuck it. And because of her there's the King Center because of her and all the friends of course and the supporters. But because of her there's the King Day holiday. Without her there would not be that king memorial going up in Washington D.C.–in the Capitol. So I take from her life and even some conversations we've had, we travelled together to different places in the world. And when I think of that and I miss her, I'm able to look at what I got from her and be grateful to God for her life and be grateful to her for her love. </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: Wow that is so powerful to be remembered in that way. &nbsp;Ms. King and Dr. Martin Luther King will forever be icons...I was about to say the African American community, but worldwide. They created change that will forever improve our way of life. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> I think we have to put into that Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz as well, into that mix. ...and Medgar Evers into that mix. And Fanny Lou Hamer, men and women who really sought to make a better life for African Americans and for all Americans and all people–really all people.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> <b>So in 1959 through 1960 you were the northern coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and you were appointed at the request of Dr. Martin Luther King. How did that feel? Take us back to that time.</b> </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. Angelou:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> <b>(laughter)</b> Well you have to imagine I was young...'59, that's 50 years ago minus one. I was young, I'm six foot tall and I was very skinny at the time and I wore my hair natural–since 1952. And there was a lot of it. (laughter) o, I think, later on Angela Davis had a lot of it, well I looked sort of like that. <b>(laughter)</b></span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC: Oh wow, that was a lot of hair.&nbsp; (laughter)</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A.:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> And a number of people really, they were made really uncomfortable...people around the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in New York. One woman dropped a note in a column in the New York African American newspaper, <i>The Amsterdam News</i>. She wrote, "Who is this person who has come from the west coast with the savage hairdo? Don't they have beauticians or at least barbers out there on the coast?" <b>(laughter)</b></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">It was heavy and so exciting because you'd have to be in his presence to sense the authority that Rev. King had. And I don't mean...I mean what is called charisma I think. It's a sense of he was in his skin and in the right place. So I was bowled over by that–by the job. I did my best and then I fell in love with a South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make and I married him and moved to Egypt. </span></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br><br>EC : What traits do you see in Barack Obama that may also have been in the young Dr. Martin Luther King?&nbsp; I know they both speak so very well and elegantly. Do you see traits in Barack Obama that were the same as the young Dr. Martin Luther King? </span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">Dr. A.:</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"> Yes, I sense some of that. Of course, Senator Obama [is living] in another time. He is very inclusive, which is a wonderful thing. At that time when Rev. King first started he was not inclusive, he wasn't exclusive but it was only at the end of his life that he began to include openly. I mean before he said people of goodwill, African Americans or...and people of goodwill from anywhere. But toward the end of his life when he started the plan for the Poor People's March, that plan included... and he in fact told it to me and everybody. He said, "This is not an African American people's march, the Negro march, it is not a Black march, this is for the poor Whites, this is for the poor Whites in West Virginia. This is for the poor Spanish-speaking people in Texas and California and Arizona. This is for the poor Native Americans on the reservations; this is for the poor Asians set apart to garden for the world and have no rights, no chances." He said, "This is a poor people's march". When he became that inclusive, he really became dangerous. </span></p>

And it is, I am happy to say, Target Company took it and put in almost every newspaper in the country and put it in their stores so that the customers could have copies of it. It's a blessing, that people in church, in fact in two churches I know, it was in the programs. And sometimes I wish they didn't just put in and then take it out. I wish they would just leave it in the programs. Anyway, it's there. </span></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=4>In the United States, breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Each year, a small number of men also are diagnosed with or die from breast cancer. Although the breast cancer diagnosis rate has increased, there has been a steady drop in the overall breast cancer death rate since the early 1990's.<br><br></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=4>While the incidence rate is lower for African Americans than Whites, the mortality rate is higher. Women of other racial and ethnic groups have lower incidence and mortality rates.<br><br></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=4>It is estimated that approximately $8.1 billion* is spent in the United States each year on treatment of breast cancer.<br><br></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On Thursday, May 8, 2008 8pm-10pm EST,&nbsp;The Black Authors Network (BAN)</strong>&nbsp;will open its phone lines <strong>for any caller</strong> who wants to tell the world how much they love their mothers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also an opportunity for those who have survived breast cancer to speak out and for those who&nbsp;have lost a loved one to breast cancer, to remember and pay tribute to their life in a inspirational <strong>Mother’s Day Salute</strong>. I hope the literary community will join us in this open forum to address breast cancer and to thank the mothers, aunts, daughters, and sisters who are working towards a prevention and eventual cure for breast cancer in our global community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statistics state that 10 million people around the world could die from breast cancer in the next 25 years without the cures to prevent it. BAN would like to enlighten African American women of the realities behind breast cancer, while paying tribute to survivors of breast cancer. BAN would also like to share, the love for mothers who may have passed on, to a higher reward as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
