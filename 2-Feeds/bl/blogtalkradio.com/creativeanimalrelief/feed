In order to have a HAPPY HOWL’OWEEN,remember that &nbsp;Dogs and candy just don’t mix. So put that Halloween haul of treats securely out of your dog’s reach. Even dogs who typically don’t get into human food may be tempted by the jackpot of new smells. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dressing a dog in a Halloween costume has come out of America's closet, so to speak. A recent survey by the American Kennel Club showed that one in ten dog owners plan to dress up their dog on Halloween. Almost half of those surveyed liked the idea even if they weren't planning to dress up their dog. But the trick is not to treat Halloween as just another day for your dog. Whether your dog dons a frightening frock or not, the AKC reminds owners to follow certain guidelines for keeping your pet safe during Halloween:$0$0$0$0$01) Supervise your costumed dog at all times. Make sure the costume fits properly and doesn't impede his breathing, eyesight, or hearing. If your dog swallows any elastic or decorative items, it could cause intestinal obstructions or choking.$0$0$0$0$02) Chocolate and sweets are not treats for your dog. A dog's digestive system is not adapted for sweets, and chocolate contains theobromine, which can be harmful and sometimes fatal to your dog.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$03) Walk your dog while it is still light outside.Your dog may find candy, wrappers, and broken eggs on lawns and streets. Make sure that these tempting treats stay out of reach.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$04) Children in costumes can frighten dogs.Make sure pets are in a safe and secure room when you answer the door to prevent them from running out, getting hurt and frightening your visitors.$0$0$0$0$05) Keep your dog on a leash if you want him to greet trick-or-treaters. Your dog may be stressed by the noise, activity or simply the interruption of his normal routine.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$06) Don't leave your dog unattended in the front or back yard on Halloween. Pranksters may target your dog with eggs, and passersby may be tempted to give your dog harmful treats and candy.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$07) If you are having a Halloween party, consider confining your dog securely in one area of the house. Leave a radio or TV and lights on for your pet.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$08) Be careful about where you place candles and Jack-o-Lanterns. They can easily be knocked over by a wagging tail and either burn your dog or start a fire.$0$0$0$0$0Keep these tips in mind and you and your dog will have a safe and happy Halloween.$0$0$0$0$0-Anyone that loves animals and wants to be a member of CAR is welcome to join us.

First of all, they have rescued a wonderful dog that needs medical care. &nbsp;His leg was very infected and needed to be removed when he was rescued in September. I am unsure if they have gotten the funds for the surgery or not, but they were tapped out with funds and have even spent their own personal funds to keep them up and running. &nbsp;The surgery was estimated at approx. $1,000.00 because of the infection. &nbsp;No matter what this dogs current situation, they are in desperate need of funds, no matter how small or large. Also, they need Sponsors for their kitties. Please go to www.itsmeowornever.org and choose a kitty or dog to sponsor. Even sponsoring for one month will help their animals with vet care, food and litter. Make sure that, If you donate, you specify for which cause or sponsorship, you are giving too.You may also want to check out their store, www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com. &nbsp;where They sell Kitty toys, lavender, spices, herbs, beads, dried flowers, and lots of other items. 100% of the proceeds from this store goes to the animals at It's Meow or Never Animal Rescue.<strong><span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 255); "> www.itsmeowornever.org</span></strong>$0$0$0$0$0<strong><span style="background-color: rgb(153, 255, 255); "></span></strong>*Even though we received a request to help Rudy the bloodhound back in July We still want to discuss him and ask for donations on his behalf. This is probably one of the worst abuse cases I've ever heard of. &nbsp;They think that he is about 11 years old. &nbsp;He is covered with tumors, &nbsp;has 2 teeth, and Someone has chopped off his tail with a hacking motion.

In order to have a HAPPY HOWL’OWEEN,remember that &nbsp;Dogs and candy just don’t mix. So put that Halloween haul of treats securely out of your dog’s reach. Even dogs who typically don’t get into human food may be tempted by the jackpot of new smells. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dressing a dog in a Halloween costume has come out of America's closet, so to speak. A recent survey by the American Kennel Club showed that one in ten dog owners plan to dress up their dog on Halloween. Almost half of those surveyed liked the idea even if they weren't planning to dress up their dog. But the trick is not to treat Halloween as just another day for your dog. Whether your dog dons a frightening frock or not, the AKC reminds owners to follow certain guidelines for keeping your pet safe during Halloween:$0$0$0$0$01) Supervise your costumed dog at all times. Make sure the costume fits properly and doesn't impede his breathing, eyesight, or hearing. If your dog swallows any elastic or decorative items, it could cause intestinal obstructions or choking.$0$0$0$0$02) Chocolate and sweets are not treats for your dog. A dog's digestive system is not adapted for sweets, and chocolate contains theobromine, which can be harmful and sometimes fatal to your dog.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$03) Walk your dog while it is still light outside.Your dog may find candy, wrappers, and broken eggs on lawns and streets. Make sure that these tempting treats stay out of reach.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$04) Children in costumes can frighten dogs.Make sure pets are in a safe and secure room when you answer the door to prevent them from running out, getting hurt and frightening your visitors.$0$0$0$0$05) Keep your dog on a leash if you want him to greet trick-or-treaters. Your dog may be stressed by the noise, activity or simply the interruption of his normal routine.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$06) Don't leave your dog unattended in the front or back yard on Halloween. Pranksters may target your dog with eggs, and passersby may be tempted to give your dog harmful treats and candy.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$07) If you are having a Halloween party, consider confining your dog securely in one area of the house. Leave a radio or TV and lights on for your pet.&nbsp;$0$0$0$0$08) Be careful about where you place candles and Jack-o-Lanterns. They can easily be knocked over by a wagging tail and either burn your dog or start a fire.$0$0$0$0$0Keep these tips in mind and you and your dog will have a safe and happy Halloween.$0$0$0$0$0-Anyone that loves animals and wants to be a member of CAR is welcome to join us.

First of all, they have rescued a wonderful dog that needs medical care. &nbsp;His leg was very infected and needed to be removed when he was rescued in September. I am unsure if they have gotten the funds for the surgery or not, but they were tapped out with funds and have even spent their own personal funds to keep them up and running. &nbsp;The surgery was estimated at approx. $1,000.00 because of the infection. &nbsp;No matter what this dogs current situation, they are in desperate need of funds, no matter how small or large. Also, they need Sponsors for their kitties. Please go to www.itsmeowornever.org and choose a kitty or dog to sponsor.

</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>After a much needed hiatus, Gena got back into the drivers seat to get the <SPAN style="COLOR: #000099"><STRONG>CAR</STRONG> </SPAN>program on down the road again. In the passengers seat was a new member of the team, Lauren, aka Chainmail Lady. Tammy evidently hadn't had enough vacation because she took the night off to nap. Well, she said that it was because she had strep throat, but Gena wonders because she was the one that was supposed to have the night off! lol. <BR>
<BR>
At any rate, Gena and Lorn maneuvered through the sad and difficult topic of loosing your pet. To help answer questions, as well as to discuss the various ways to memorialize lost pets, special guest Katherine, from OurPals.com, joined the show. While you would certainly require a local provider should you need these types of services, visiting the OurPals website can assist you by providing a list of questions that you should be prepared to ask potential service companies. Additionally, they offer some basic information that could prove to be useful to you, even if you are not in their neck of the woods, so take a look!<BR>
</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>The No Speed Limit Highway section&nbsp;took the night off with Tammy, but Lauren told a heart-warming story&nbsp;about a Siberian Husky that adopted a litter of kittens! You can listen to the show or you can&nbsp;read about it at;&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mercurynews.com/weird-news/ci_13472352?nclick_check=1">http://www.mercurynews.com/weird-news/ci_13472352?nclick_check=1</A>&nbsp;<BR>

<P >-On Saturday, September 26, Typhoon Ketsana slammed into the Philippines, dropping more rain in 12 hours than typically falls in the entire month of September. The country is hit by multiple storms every year, but this is the worst flooding in four decades. More than 300 people were killed, and hundreds of thousands more affected.The number of animals injured or lost is still unknown. As the Filipino government and international aid agencies move in to provide food, shelter and medical attention for human victims, HSI is preparing to send a team to rescue animals. They will set up shelters to take in animals they find until their owners can be located. They will leave food and water for those they can’t reach. And they will save pets left shut up in homes after people were forced to evacuate without them. They will ensure that as many animals as possible who lived through the initial storm will also survive in its aftermath. <BR>
You can follow our disaster responders as they deliver food, medicine and veterinary care to animals in the Philippines.<STRONG><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99"> Visit their website at hsi.org/disaster or follow them on Facebook and Twitter. </SPAN><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99">hsi.org/disaster</SPAN></STRONG> <BR>
Unfortunately there were two more storms brewing off the coast of the Philippines expected to hit this past weekend, we are not not sure of the added damage they caused, we just know that HSI is there to help. They are also reaching out to communities impacted by a major earthquake in Indonesia and a deadly tsunami in Samoa. Obviously they do a great work all over the world, so Please make a generous gift today to their International Disaster Fund and help bring aid to the animal victims of Typhoon Ketsana and other disasters. again they can be contacted at hsi.org/disaster <BR>

-Of course October is also Halloween month, so begin to plan for that day&nbsp;now in order to have a <SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6600"><STRONG>HAPPY HOWL’OWEEN.&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN>Remember that&nbsp; Dogs and candy just don’t mix, so put that Halloween haul of treats securely out of your dog’s reach. Even dogs who typically don’t get into human food may be tempted by the jackpot of new smells.<BR>
Dressing a dog in a Halloween costume has come out of America's closet, so to speak. A recent survey by the American Kennel Club showed that one in ten dog owners plan to dress up their dog on Halloween. Almost half of those surveyed liked the idea even if they weren't planning to dress up their dog. But the trick is not to treat Halloween as just another day for your dog. Whether your dog dons a frightening frock or not, the AKC reminds owners to follow certain guidelines for keeping your pet safe during Halloween: <BR>
<BR>
1) Supervise your costumed dog at all times. Make sure the costume fits properly and doesn't impede his breathing, eyesight, or hearing. If your dog swallows any elastic or decorative items, it could cause intestinal obstructions or choking. <BR>
2) Chocolate and sweets are not treats for your dog. A dog's digestive system is not adapted for sweets, and chocolate contains theobromine, which can be harmful and sometimes fatal to your dog. <BR>
3) Walk your dog while it is still light outside.Your dog may find candy, wrappers, and broken eggs on lawns and streets. Make sure that these tempting treats stay out of reach. <BR>
4) Children in costumes can frighten dogs.Make sure pets are in a safe and secure room when you answer the door to prevent them from running out, getting hurt and frightening your visitors. <BR>
5) Keep your dog on a leash if you want him to greet trick-or-treaters. Your dog may be stressed by the noise, activity or simply the interruption of his normal routine. <BR>
6) Don't leave your dog unattended in the front or back yard on Halloween. Pranksters may target your dog with eggs, and passersby may be tempted to give your dog harmful treats and candy. <BR>
7) If you are having a Halloween party, consider confining your dog securely in one area of the house. Leave a radio or TV and lights on for your pet. <BR>
8) Be careful about where you place candles and Jack-o-Lanterns. They can easily be knocked over by a wagging tail and either burn your dog or start a fire. <BR>
<SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff9900"><STRONG>Keep these tips in mind and you and your dog will have a safe and happy Halloween.<BR>

<P >*<SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>The Animal Rescue Site still needs everyones help to click</STRONG></SPAN> on it its site daily so that they can meet their quota and get free (donated) food&nbsp; for the abused and neglected animals that they care for on a daily basis. Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. Here's the web site!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</STRONG></SPAN></A>&nbsp; After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!</P>
<P >&nbsp;*We have Several requests from <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>ItsMeowOrNever.org.</STRONG></SPAN> First of all, they have rescued a wonderful dog that needs medical care.&nbsp; His leg was very infected and needed to be removed when he was rescued in September. I am unsure if they have gotten the funds for the surgery or not, but they were tapped out with funds and have even spent their own personal funds to keep them up and running.&nbsp; The surgery was estimated at approx. $1,000.00 because of the infection.&nbsp; No matter what this dogs current situation, they are in desperate need of funds, no matter how small or large. </P>
<P>They are also asking for Sponsors for their kitties. All sponsors will receive a free handmade Kitty Kicker and a sample of their potpourri dried herbs and flowers. Please go to <A href="http://www.itsmeowornever.org">www.itsmeowornever.org</A> and choose a kitty or dog to sponsor. Even sponsoring for one month will help their animals with vet care, food and litter.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
Another issue is that they have had pink eye in their cat area and needed to purchase medication for each kitten. Each tube of medicine cost $14.50, so it adds up fast!</P>
<P>If you donate, please specify for which cause, sponsorship, pink eye or our the newest rescued dog you are giving too.You may also want to check out their store, <A href="http://www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com">www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com</A>.&nbsp; They sell Kitty Kickers, lavender, spices, herbs, beads, dried flowers, and more items. 100% of the proceeds from the store goes to the animals at <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>It's Meow or Never Animal Rescue. </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://www.itsmeowornever.org"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>www.itsmeowornever.org</STRONG></SPAN></A></P>

<P>*In July we received a request to <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>help Rudy the Bloodhound</STRONG></SPAN>. They think that he is about 11 years old.&nbsp; He is covered with tumors,&nbsp; has 2 teeth, and Someone has chopped off his tail with a hacking motion. There are too many scars on his old body to count.&nbsp; He is blind and deaf, in deed One of his eyes was popping out of his head.&nbsp; He also tested heartworm positive, yet the vet said that poor Rudy has a few good years left in him. The rescue group is&nbsp; determined to make him feel happy and safe for these remaining years because No animal should have to suffer the way that he has.&nbsp; Rudy weighed a mere&nbsp; 46 lbs when rescued and they said they'd begin his much needed surgeries (starting with his eye) as soon as he gained 10 lbs. Rudy is still in need of funds, so if you can help this dog in any way, please contact the <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>East Tennessee blood hound rescue. at&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://easttennesseebloodhoundrescue.chipin.com/rudy"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>http://easttennesseebloodhoundrescue.chipin.com/rudy</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; or contact </STRONG></SPAN><A href="mailto:Icybaby05@aol.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>Icybaby05@aol.com</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>After a much needed hiatus, Gena got back into the drivers seat to get the <SPAN style="COLOR: #000099"><STRONG>CAR</STRONG> </SPAN>program on down the road again. In the passengers seat was a new member of the team, Lauren, aka Chainmail Lady. Tammy evidently hadn't had enough vacation because she took the night off to nap. Well, she said that it was because she had strep throat, but Gena wonders because she was the one that was supposed to have the night off! lol. <BR>
<BR>
At any rate, Gena and Lorn maneuvered through the sad and difficult topic of loosing your pet. To help answer questions, as well as to discuss the various ways to memorialize lost pets, special guest Katherine, from OurPals.com, joined the show. While you would certainly require a local provider should you need these types of services, visiting the OurPals website can assist you by providing a list of questions that you should be prepared to ask potential service companies. Additionally, they offer some basic information that could prove to be useful to you, even if you are not in their neck of the woods, so take a look!<BR>
</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>The No Speed Limit Highway section&nbsp;took the night off with Tammy, but Lauren told a heart-warming story&nbsp;about a Siberian Husky that adopted a litter of kittens! You can listen to the show or you can&nbsp;read about it at;&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mercurynews.com/weird-news/ci_13472352?nclick_check=1">http://www.mercurynews.com/weird-news/ci_13472352?nclick_check=1</A>&nbsp;<BR>

<P >-On Saturday, September 26, Typhoon Ketsana slammed into the Philippines, dropping more rain in 12 hours than typically falls in the entire month of September. The country is hit by multiple storms every year, but this is the worst flooding in four decades. More than 300 people were killed, and hundreds of thousands more affected.The number of animals injured or lost is still unknown. As the Filipino government and international aid agencies move in to provide food, shelter and medical attention for human victims, HSI is preparing to send a team to rescue animals. They will set up shelters to take in animals they find until their owners can be located. They will leave food and water for those they can’t reach. And they will save pets left shut up in homes after people were forced to evacuate without them. They will ensure that as many animals as possible who lived through the initial storm will also survive in its aftermath. <BR>
You can follow our disaster responders as they deliver food, medicine and veterinary care to animals in the Philippines.<STRONG><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99"> Visit their website at hsi.org/disaster or follow them on Facebook and Twitter. </SPAN><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99">hsi.org/disaster</SPAN></STRONG> <BR>
Unfortunately there were two more storms brewing off the coast of the Philippines expected to hit this past weekend, we are not not sure of the added damage they caused, we just know that HSI is there to help. They are also reaching out to communities impacted by a major earthquake in Indonesia and a deadly tsunami in Samoa. Obviously they do a great work all over the world, so Please make a generous gift today to their International Disaster Fund and help bring aid to the animal victims of Typhoon Ketsana and other disasters. again they can be contacted at hsi.org/disaster <BR>

-Of course October is also Halloween month, so begin to plan for that day&nbsp;now in order to have a <SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6600"><STRONG>HAPPY HOWL’OWEEN.&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN>Remember that&nbsp; Dogs and candy just don’t mix, so put that Halloween haul of treats securely out of your dog’s reach. Even dogs who typically don’t get into human food may be tempted by the jackpot of new smells.<BR>
Dressing a dog in a Halloween costume has come out of America's closet, so to speak. A recent survey by the American Kennel Club showed that one in ten dog owners plan to dress up their dog on Halloween. Almost half of those surveyed liked the idea even if they weren't planning to dress up their dog. But the trick is not to treat Halloween as just another day for your dog. Whether your dog dons a frightening frock or not, the AKC reminds owners to follow certain guidelines for keeping your pet safe during Halloween: <BR>
<BR>
1) Supervise your costumed dog at all times. Make sure the costume fits properly and doesn't impede his breathing, eyesight, or hearing. If your dog swallows any elastic or decorative items, it could cause intestinal obstructions or choking. <BR>
2) Chocolate and sweets are not treats for your dog. A dog's digestive system is not adapted for sweets, and chocolate contains theobromine, which can be harmful and sometimes fatal to your dog. <BR>
3) Walk your dog while it is still light outside.Your dog may find candy, wrappers, and broken eggs on lawns and streets. Make sure that these tempting treats stay out of reach. <BR>
4) Children in costumes can frighten dogs.Make sure pets are in a safe and secure room when you answer the door to prevent them from running out, getting hurt and frightening your visitors. <BR>
5) Keep your dog on a leash if you want him to greet trick-or-treaters. Your dog may be stressed by the noise, activity or simply the interruption of his normal routine. <BR>
6) Don't leave your dog unattended in the front or back yard on Halloween. Pranksters may target your dog with eggs, and passersby may be tempted to give your dog harmful treats and candy. <BR>
7) If you are having a Halloween party, consider confining your dog securely in one area of the house. Leave a radio or TV and lights on for your pet. <BR>
8) Be careful about where you place candles and Jack-o-Lanterns. They can easily be knocked over by a wagging tail and either burn your dog or start a fire. <BR>
<SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff9900"><STRONG>Keep these tips in mind and you and your dog will have a safe and happy Halloween.<BR>

Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. Here's the web site!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</STRONG></SPAN></A>&nbsp; After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!</P>
<P >&nbsp;*We have Several requests from <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>ItsMeowOrNever.org.</STRONG></SPAN> First of all, they have rescued a wonderful dog that needs medical care.&nbsp; His leg was very infected and needed to be removed when he was rescued in September. I am unsure if they have gotten the funds for the surgery or not, but they were tapped out with funds and have even spent their own personal funds to keep them up and running.&nbsp; The surgery was estimated at approx. $1,000.00 because of the infection.&nbsp; No matter what this dogs current situation, they are in desperate need of funds, no matter how small or large. </P>
<P>They are also asking for Sponsors for their kitties. All sponsors will receive a free handmade Kitty Kicker and a sample of their potpourri dried herbs and flowers. Please go to <A href="http://www.itsmeowornever.org">www.itsmeowornever.org</A> and choose a kitty or dog to sponsor. Even sponsoring for one month will help their animals with vet care, food and litter.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
Another issue is that they have had pink eye in their cat area and needed to purchase medication for each kitten. Each tube of medicine cost $14.50, so it adds up fast!</P>
<P>If you donate, please specify for which cause, sponsorship, pink eye or our the newest rescued dog you are giving too.You may also want to check out their store, <A href="http://www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com">www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com</A>.&nbsp; They sell Kitty Kickers, lavender, spices, herbs, beads, dried flowers, and more items. 100% of the proceeds from the store goes to the animals at <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>It's Meow or Never Animal Rescue. </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://www.itsmeowornever.org"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>www.itsmeowornever.org</STRONG></SPAN></A></P>

<P><SPAN>After a much needed hiatus, Gena got back into the drivers seat to get the <SPAN style="COLOR: #000099"><STRONG>CAR</STRONG> </SPAN>program on down the road again. In the passengers seat was a new member of the team, Lauren, aka Chainmail Lady. Tammy evidently hadn't had enough vacation because she took the night off to nap. Well, she said that it was because she had strep throat, but Gena wonders because she was the one that was supposed to have the night off! lol. <BR>
<BR>
At any rate, Gena and Lorn maneuvered through the sad and difficult topic of loosing your pet. To help answer questions, as well as to discuss the various ways to memorialize lost pets, special guest Katherine, from OurPals.com, joined the show. While you would certainly require a local provider should you need these types of services, visiting the OurPals website can assist you by providing a list of questions that you should be prepared to ask potential service companies. Additionally, they offer some basic information that could prove to be useful to you, even if you are not in their neck of the woods, so take a look!<BR>
</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>The No Speed Limit Highway section&nbsp;took the night off with Tammy, but Lauren told a heart-warming story&nbsp;about a Siberian Husky that adopted a litter of kittens! You can listen to the show or you can&nbsp;read about it at;&nbsp;<A href="http://www.mercurynews.com/weird-news/ci_13472352?nclick_check=1">http://www.mercurynews.com/weird-news/ci_13472352?nclick_check=1</A>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P>-On Saturday, September 26, Typhoon Ketsana slammed into the Philippines, dropping more rain in 12 hours than typically falls in the entire month of September. The country is hit by multiple storms every year, but this is the worst flooding in four decades. More than 300 people were killed, and hundreds of thousands more affected.The number of animals injured or lost is still unknown. As the Filipino government and international aid agencies move in to provide food, shelter and medical attention for human victims, HSI is preparing to send a team to rescue animals. They will set up shelters to take in animals they find until their owners can be located. They will leave food and water for those they can’t reach. And they will save pets left shut up in homes after people were forced to evacuate without them. They will ensure that as many animals as possible who lived through the initial storm will also survive in its aftermath. <BR>
You can follow our disaster responders as they deliver food, medicine and veterinary care to animals in the Philippines.<STRONG><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99"> Visit their website at hsi.org/disaster or follow them on Facebook and Twitter. </SPAN><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99">hsi.org/disaster</SPAN></STRONG> <BR>
Unfortunately there were two more storms brewing off the coast of the Philippines expected to hit this past weekend, we are not not sure of the added damage they caused, we just know that HSI is there to help. They are also reaching out to communities impacted by a major earthquake in Indonesia and a deadly tsunami in Samoa. Obviously they do a great work all over the world, so Please make a generous gift today to their International Disaster Fund and help bring aid to the animal victims of Typhoon Ketsana and other disasters. again they can be contacted at hsi.org/disaster <BR>

-Of course October is also Halloween month, so begin to plan for that day&nbsp;now in order to have a <SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6600"><STRONG>HAPPY HOWL’OWEEN.&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN>Remember that&nbsp; Dogs and candy just don’t mix, so put that Halloween haul of treats securely out of your dog’s reach. Even dogs who typically don’t get into human food may be tempted by the jackpot of new smells.<BR>
Dressing a dog in a Halloween costume has come out of America's closet, so to speak. A recent survey by the American Kennel Club showed that one in ten dog owners plan to dress up their dog on Halloween. Almost half of those surveyed liked the idea even if they weren't planning to dress up their dog. But the trick is not to treat Halloween as just another day for your dog. Whether your dog dons a frightening frock or not, the AKC reminds owners to follow certain guidelines for keeping your pet safe during Halloween: <BR>
<BR>
1) Supervise your costumed dog at all times. Make sure the costume fits properly and doesn't impede his breathing, eyesight, or hearing. If your dog swallows any elastic or decorative items, it could cause intestinal obstructions or choking. <BR>
2) Chocolate and sweets are not treats for your dog. A dog's digestive system is not adapted for sweets, and chocolate contains theobromine, which can be harmful and sometimes fatal to your dog. <BR>
3) Walk your dog while it is still light outside.Your dog may find candy, wrappers, and broken eggs on lawns and streets. Make sure that these tempting treats stay out of reach. <BR>
4) Children in costumes can frighten dogs.Make sure pets are in a safe and secure room when you answer the door to prevent them from running out, getting hurt and frightening your visitors. <BR>
5) Keep your dog on a leash if you want him to greet trick-or-treaters. Your dog may be stressed by the noise, activity or simply the interruption of his normal routine. <BR>
6) Don't leave your dog unattended in the front or back yard on Halloween. Pranksters may target your dog with eggs, and passersby may be tempted to give your dog harmful treats and candy. <BR>
7) If you are having a Halloween party, consider confining your dog securely in one area of the house. Leave a radio or TV and lights on for your pet. <BR>
8) Be careful about where you place candles and Jack-o-Lanterns. They can easily be knocked over by a wagging tail and either burn your dog or start a fire. <BR>
<SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff9900"><STRONG>Keep these tips in mind and you and your dog will have a safe and happy Halloween.<BR>

Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. Here's the web site!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</STRONG></SPAN></A>&nbsp; After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!</P>
<P>&nbsp;*We have Several requests from <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>ItsMeowOrNever.org.</STRONG></SPAN> First of all, they have rescued a wonderful dog that needs medical care.&nbsp; His leg was very infected and needed to be removed when he was rescued in September. I am unsure if they have gotten the funds for the surgery or not, but they were tapped out with funds and have even spent their own personal funds to keep them up and running.&nbsp; The surgery was estimated at approx. $1,000.00 because of the infection.&nbsp; No matter what this dogs current situation, they are in desperate need of funds, no matter how small or large. </P>
<P>They are also asking for Sponsors for their kitties. All sponsors will receive a free handmade Kitty Kicker and a sample of their potpourri dried herbs and flowers. Please go to <A href="http://www.itsmeowornever.org">www.itsmeowornever.org</A> and choose a kitty or dog to sponsor. Even sponsoring for one month will help their animals with vet care, food and litter.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
Another issue is that they have had pink eye in their cat area and needed to purchase medication for each kitten. Each tube of medicine cost $14.50, so it adds up fast!</P>
<P>If you donate, please specify for which cause, sponsorship, pink eye or our the newest rescued dog you are giving too.You may also want to check out their store, <A href="http://www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com">www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com</A>.&nbsp; They sell Kitty Kickers, lavender, spices, herbs, beads, dried flowers, and more items. 100% of the proceeds from the store goes to the animals at <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>It's Meow or Never Animal Rescue. </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://www.itsmeowornever.org"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>www.itsmeowornever.org</STRONG></SPAN></A></P>

<P>*In July we received a request to <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>help Rudy the Bloodhound</STRONG></SPAN>. They think that he is about 11 years old.&nbsp; He is covered with tumors,&nbsp; has 2 teeth, and Someone has chopped off his tail with a hacking motion. There are too many scars on his old body to count.&nbsp; He is blind and deaf, in deed One of his eyes was popping out of his head.&nbsp; He also tested heartworm positive, yet the vet said that poor Rudy has a few good years left in him. The rescue group is&nbsp; determined to make him feel happy and safe for these remaining years because No animal should have to suffer the way that he has.&nbsp; Rudy weighed a mere&nbsp; 46 lbs when rescued and they said they'd begin his much needed surgeries (starting with his eye) as soon as he gained 10 lbs. Rudy is still in need of funds, so if you can help this dog in any way, please contact the <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>East Tennessee blood hound rescue. at&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://easttennesseebloodhoundrescue.chipin.com/rudy"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>http://easttennesseebloodhoundrescue.chipin.com/rudy</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; or contact </STRONG></SPAN><A href="mailto:Icybaby05@aol.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>Icybaby05@aol.com</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P>-On Saturday, September 26, Typhoon Ketsana slammed into the Philippines, dropping more rain in 12 hours than typically falls in the entire month of September. The country is hit by multiple storms every year, but this is the worst flooding in four decades. More than 300 people were killed, and hundreds of thousands more affected.The number of animals injured or lost is still unknown. As the Filipino government and international aid agencies move in to provide food, shelter and medical attention for human victims, HSI is preparing to send a team to rescue animals. They will set up shelters to take in animals they find until their owners can be located. They will leave food and water for those they can’t reach. And they will save pets left shut up in homes after people were forced to evacuate without them. They will ensure that as many animals as possible who lived through the initial storm will also survive in its aftermath. <BR>
You can follow our disaster responders as they deliver food, medicine and veterinary care to animals in the Philippines.<STRONG><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99"> Visit their website at hsi.org/disaster or follow them on Facebook and Twitter. </SPAN><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99">hsi.org/disaster</SPAN></STRONG> <BR>
Unfortunately there were two more storms brewing off the coast of the Philippines expected to hit this past weekend, we are not not sure of the added damage they caused, we just know that HSI is there to help. They are also reaching out to communities impacted by a major earthquake in Indonesia and a deadly tsunami in Samoa. Obviously they do a great work all over the world, so Please make a generous gift today to their International Disaster Fund and help bring aid to the animal victims of Typhoon Ketsana and other disasters. again they can be contacted at hsi.org/disaster <BR>

-Of course October is also Halloween month, so begin to plan for that day&nbsp;now in order to have a <SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6600"><STRONG>HAPPY HOWL’OWEEN.&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN>Remember that&nbsp; Dogs and candy just don’t mix, so put that Halloween haul of treats securely out of your dog’s reach. Even dogs who typically don’t get into human food may be tempted by the jackpot of new smells.<BR>
Dressing a dog in a Halloween costume has come out of America's closet, so to speak. A recent survey by the American Kennel Club showed that one in ten dog owners plan to dress up their dog on Halloween. Almost half of those surveyed liked the idea even if they weren't planning to dress up their dog. But the trick is not to treat Halloween as just another day for your dog. Whether your dog dons a frightening frock or not, the AKC reminds owners to follow certain guidelines for keeping your pet safe during Halloween: <BR>
<BR>
1) Supervise your costumed dog at all times. Make sure the costume fits properly and doesn't impede his breathing, eyesight, or hearing. If your dog swallows any elastic or decorative items, it could cause intestinal obstructions or choking. <BR>
2) Chocolate and sweets are not treats for your dog. A dog's digestive system is not adapted for sweets, and chocolate contains theobromine, which can be harmful and sometimes fatal to your dog. <BR>
3) Walk your dog while it is still light outside.Your dog may find candy, wrappers, and broken eggs on lawns and streets. Make sure that these tempting treats stay out of reach. <BR>
4) Children in costumes can frighten dogs.Make sure pets are in a safe and secure room when you answer the door to prevent them from running out, getting hurt and frightening your visitors. <BR>
5) Keep your dog on a leash if you want him to greet trick-or-treaters. Your dog may be stressed by the noise, activity or simply the interruption of his normal routine. <BR>
6) Don't leave your dog unattended in the front or back yard on Halloween. Pranksters may target your dog with eggs, and passersby may be tempted to give your dog harmful treats and candy. <BR>
7) If you are having a Halloween party, consider confining your dog securely in one area of the house. Leave a radio or TV and lights on for your pet. <BR>
8) Be careful about where you place candles and Jack-o-Lanterns. They can easily be knocked over by a wagging tail and either burn your dog or start a fire. <BR>
<SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff9900"><STRONG>Keep these tips in mind and you and your dog will have a safe and happy Halloween.<BR>

<P>*<SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>The Animal Rescue Site still needs everyones help to click</STRONG></SPAN> on it its site daily so that they can meet their quota and get free (donated) food&nbsp; for the abused and neglected animals that they care for on a daily basis. Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. Here's the web site!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</STRONG></SPAN></A>&nbsp; After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!</P>
<P>&nbsp;*We have Several requests from <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>ItsMeowOrNever.org.</STRONG></SPAN> First of all, they have rescued a wonderful dog that needs medical care.&nbsp; His leg was very infected and needed to be removed when he was rescued in September. I am unsure if they have gotten the funds for the surgery or not, but they were tapped out with funds and have even spent their own personal funds to keep them up and running.&nbsp; The surgery was estimated at approx. $1,000.00 because of the infection.&nbsp; No matter what this dogs current situation, they are in desperate need of funds, no matter how small or large. </P>
<P>They are also asking for Sponsors for their kitties. All sponsors will receive a free handmade Kitty Kicker and a sample of their potpourri dried herbs and flowers. Please go to <A href="http://www.itsmeowornever.org">www.itsmeowornever.org</A> and choose a kitty or dog to sponsor. Even sponsoring for one month will help their animals with vet care, food and litter.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
Another issue is that they have had pink eye in their cat area and needed to purchase medication for each kitten. Each tube of medicine cost $14.50, so it adds up fast!</P>
<P>If you donate, please specify for which cause, sponsorship, pink eye or our the newest rescued dog you are giving too.You may also want to check out their store, <A href="http://www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com">www.bumblebeesknee.etsy.com</A>.&nbsp; They sell Kitty Kickers, lavender, spices, herbs, beads, dried flowers, and more items. 100% of the proceeds from the store goes to the animals at <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>It's Meow or Never Animal Rescue. </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://www.itsmeowornever.org"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>www.itsmeowornever.org</STRONG></SPAN></A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>*In July we received a request to <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>help Rudy the Bloodhound</STRONG></SPAN>. They think that he is about 11 years old.&nbsp; He is covered with tumors,&nbsp; has 2 teeth, and Someone has chopped off his tail with a hacking motion. There are too many scars on his old body to count.&nbsp; He is blind and deaf, in deed One of his eyes was popping out of his head.&nbsp; He also tested heartworm positive, yet the vet said that poor Rudy has a few good years left in him. The rescue group is&nbsp; determined to make him feel happy and safe for these remaining years because No animal should have to suffer the way that he has.&nbsp; Rudy weighed a mere&nbsp; 46 lbs when rescued and they said they'd begin his much needed surgeries (starting with his eye) as soon as he gained 10 lbs. Rudy is still in need of funds, so if you can help this dog in any way, please contact the <SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>East Tennessee blood hound rescue. at&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://easttennesseebloodhoundrescue.chipin.com/rudy"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>http://easttennesseebloodhoundrescue.chipin.com/rudy</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; or contact </STRONG></SPAN><A href="mailto:Icybaby05@aol.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG>Icybaby05@aol.com</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #003333; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffcc"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This week we had Sherri Franklin from <SPAN style="COLOR: #009900"><STRONG>Muttville.org</STRONG></SPAN> as our special guest. Muttville is a non-profit charity that rescues senior dogs from California shelters which are slated for death, often being the last phone call, Muttville is truly a life-saving group. Operating with approximately 60 volunteers, they pick up the dogs, get them any medical care needed, provide foster homes, and seek adoptive homes to provide a permanent, loving home for these dogs. <BR>
At the end of June, Muttville hosted a large fundraising event, dubbed Moolah for Mutts. You may remember us promoting this very special event for several months, as it was hosted at a house that had been featured on a segment of "This Old House". Additionally, they didn't just have one thing going on that night, they had several. They hosted a wine and cheese tasting, a silent auction, a live auction, raffles, and more. It truly was a special event at a special venue, and we are told that it was quite successful! Many Artisans heard our pleas and sent products and donations which helped to make this event the success that it was, so THANK YOU ALL!!!! </P>
<P ><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ccffff">The No Speed Limit Highway</SPAN> looked at aromatherapy for dogs. <SPAN style="COLOR: #009900"><STRONG>Aromatherapy</STRONG></SPAN> is the use of essential oils from plants in healing. These oils contain a number of properties, many can act as antibiotics, antiseptics, and antivirals. Oils can also act as a stimulator for the body to trigger its own healing abilities. First you have to decide on the specific essential oil that is needed for your dog. There are simply way too many oils, as well as ailments for me to cover here, so please consult your Veterinarian and/or published texts for more information about the use of essential oils. Once you have decided on the oil that you need to use, place ten drops of the oil into a cup of hot water, and put the cup near your dog's head while he/she is sleeping. Try to keep it warm for about one half hour, using a candle or coffee warmer. After thirty minutes you need to stop using for at least thirty minutes, then you can heat and sniff again of needed.&nbsp; Here are some to try;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Peppermint for the treatment of gastritis <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rosemary for certain heart problems<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Peppermint to suppress kennel cough<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Peppermint relieves itching if your dog has mange<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Geranium and Rosemary work well if your dog has pancreatitis<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Eucalyptus helps if your dog has a respiratory ailment such as pneumonia. This is obviously a serious respiratory problem. Consult your Vet. immediately if signs occur<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Many different oils are used for the treatment of various emotional issues, such as lavender to calm a hyper or stressed dog or citrus to invigorate a depressed one. </P>
<P >Check with your Vet for more, or read more about essential oil therapy at your local library.<BR>

-As we head into July and the heat of summer, we want to remind you that even the healthiest pets can suffer from dehydration, heat stroke and sunburn if overexposed to the heat. Heat stroke can be fatal if not treated promptly, so everyone needs to be vigilant and watch out for the symptoms of overheating. Excessive panting or difficulty breathing, drooling, mild weakness, stupor or collapse are symptoms that can indicate heat related illness. Additionally, pets can also suffer from seizures, bloody diarrhea and vomiting, along with an elevated body temperature [over 104 degrees].&nbsp; According to the ASPCA experts, taking these simple precautions can help to prevent your pet from overheating;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp; *Avoid dehydration by always having fresh, clean water available and lots of shady places where pets can cool off.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; *When the weather’s extremely hot, keep your pets indoors. <BR>
&nbsp; *Give your dog a light summer haircut to help prevent overheating. Shave the hair to a one- inch length, but never down to the skin, as fur offers protection from the sun. </P>
<P>&nbsp; *Brushing your cat more often than usual can also help prevent problems caused by excessive heat. </P>
<P>&nbsp; *When using sunscreen or insect repellent, be sure the product is labeled specifically for use on animals.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp; *Never leave an animal alone in a parked vehicle. On a hot day, a parked car can become a furnace in no time—even with the windows open, which could lead to a fatal heat stroke.</P>
<P>&nbsp;*and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, If you suspect your pet is suffering from heat stroke, get help from your Veterinarian immediately.</P>
<P >-We now have a Flickr group, Yes, CreativeAnimalRelief is now a flickr group!! You don't have to be a member of CAR to join, so stop by and take a look! Join us and submit your animal pictures, or pictures of the animals at your local shelters/charities.<BR>

<P>This section is dedicated to charitable requests. This weekly section will list various non</P>
<P>-profit animal charities that are in need of funds and/or products for upcoming events. All </P>
<P>members are encouraged to review these requests and to help where they can!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>

<P>private need requests on other venues, so fill out the request form for any and all animal </P>
<P>related needs. Once filled out, we will review your request and place it here, on our </P>
<P>website, on our yahoo group page, or maybe even mention it on air! (we reserve the right to decline to advertise any event that does not meet our requirements). We want to organize all financial requests so that our members are not overwhelmed, so we have created guidelines for publication of these events. This area is generally dedicated to the 501c3 large events.</P>
<P >*The national canine cancer foundation will be holding a perfect tweet contest to raise e funds in a fun way for cancer research&nbsp; check out <A href="http://www.perfecttweet.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>www.perfecttweet.com</STRONG></SPAN></A> for all the info&nbsp; $5 for each entry will buy ya lots of fun&nbsp; and the potential to win lots of prizes! </P>
<P >*DRINK GOOD WINE and SAVE GOOD ANIMALS at the same time! Muttville has joined the list of rescue partners of the fine folks at <SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>Canine Wines</STRONG></SPAN>, who give $5 of every bottle they sell to help animal rescue groups. So, when you purchase a bottle of wine from them, simply mention Muttville and they will earmark a donation for them!</P>
<P >*The Animal Rescue Site is still having trouble getting&nbsp; enough people to click on it daily , which means that they fail to meet&nbsp; their quota for getting free (donated) food&nbsp; for the abused and neglected animals that they care for on a daily basis. Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help! <BR>
It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! <BR>
So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. Here's the web site!&nbsp;<SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</STRONG></SPAN></A>&nbsp; After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!.</P>

</STRONG></SPAN>&nbsp;
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This week we had Sherri Franklin from <SPAN style="COLOR: #009900"><STRONG>Muttville.org</STRONG></SPAN> as our special guest. Muttville is a non-profit charity that rescues senior dogs from California shelters which are slated for death, often being the last phone call, Muttville is truly a life-saving group. Operating with approximately 60 volunteers, they pick up the dogs, get them any medical care needed, provide foster homes, and seek adoptive homes to provide a permanent, loving home for these dogs. <BR>
At the end of June, Muttville hosted a large fundraising event, dubbed Moolah for Mutts. You may remember us promoting this very special event for several months, as it was hosted at a house that had been featured on a segment of "This Old House". Additionally, they didn't just have one thing going on that night, they had several. They hosted a wine and cheese tasting, a silent auction, a live auction, raffles, and more. It truly was a special event at a special venue, and we are told that it was quite successful! Many Artisans heard our pleas and sent products and donations which helped to make this event the success that it was, so THANK YOU ALL!!!! </P>
<P ><SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ccffff">The No Speed Limit Highway</SPAN> looked at aromatherapy for dogs. <SPAN style="COLOR: #009900"><STRONG>Aromatherapy</STRONG></SPAN> is the use of essential oils from plants in healing. These oils contain a number of properties, many can act as antibiotics, antiseptics, and antivirals. Oils can also act as a stimulator for the body to trigger its own healing abilities. First you have to decide on the specific essential oil that is needed for your dog. There are simply way too many oils, as well as ailments for me to cover here, so please consult your Veterinarian and/or published texts for more information about the use of essential oils. Once you have decided on the oil that you need to use, place ten drops of the oil into a cup of hot water, and put the cup near your dog's head while he/she is sleeping. Try to keep it warm for about one half hour, using a candle or coffee warmer. After thirty minutes you need to stop using for at least thirty minutes, then you can heat and sniff again of needed.&nbsp; Here are some to try;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Peppermint for the treatment of gastritis <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Rosemary for certain heart problems<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Peppermint to suppress kennel cough<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Peppermint relieves itching if your dog has mange<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Geranium and Rosemary work well if your dog has pancreatitis<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Eucalyptus helps if your dog has a respiratory ailment such as pneumonia. This is obviously a serious respiratory problem. Consult your Vet. immediately if signs occur<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Many different oils are used for the treatment of various emotional issues, such as lavender to calm a hyper or stressed dog or citrus to invigorate a depressed one. </P>
<P >Check with your Vet for more, or read more about essential oil therapy at your local library.<BR>

-As we head into July and the heat of summer, we want to remind you that even the healthiest pets can suffer from dehydration, heat stroke and sunburn if overexposed to the heat. Heat stroke can be fatal if not treated promptly, so everyone needs to be vigilant and watch out for the symptoms of overheating. Excessive panting or difficulty breathing, drooling, mild weakness, stupor or collapse are symptoms that can indicate heat related illness. Additionally, pets can also suffer from seizures, bloody diarrhea and vomiting, along with an elevated body temperature [over 104 degrees].&nbsp; According to the ASPCA experts, taking these simple precautions can help to prevent your pet from overheating;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp; *Avoid dehydration by always having fresh, clean water available and lots of shady places where pets can cool off.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; *When the weather’s extremely hot, keep your pets indoors. <BR>
&nbsp; *Give your dog a light summer haircut to help prevent overheating. Shave the hair to a one- inch length, but never down to the skin, as fur offers protection from the sun. </P>
<P>&nbsp; *Brushing your cat more often than usual can also help prevent problems caused by excessive heat. </P>
<P>&nbsp; *When using sunscreen or insect repellent, be sure the product is labeled specifically for use on animals.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp; *Never leave an animal alone in a parked vehicle. On a hot day, a parked car can become a furnace in no time—even with the windows open, which could lead to a fatal heat stroke.</P>
<P>&nbsp;*and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, If you suspect your pet is suffering from heat stroke, get help from your Veterinarian immediately.</P>
<P >-We now have a Flickr group, Yes, CreativeAnimalRelief is now a flickr group!! You don't have to be a member of CAR to join, so stop by and take a look! Join us and submit your animal pictures, or pictures of the animals at your local shelters/charities.<BR>

<P>This section is dedicated to charitable requests. This weekly section will list various non</P>
<P>-profit animal charities that are in need of funds and/or products for upcoming events. All </P>
<P>members are encouraged to review these requests and to help where they can!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
If your group, or a group that you know of, has a special event or need, please visit </P>
<P><A href="http://creativeanimalrelief.org/">http://creativeanimalrelief.org/</A> and <SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>click on the charitable request form</STRONG></SPAN>.&nbsp; We also post </P>
<P>private need requests on other venues, so fill out the request form for any and all animal </P>
<P>related needs. Once filled out, we will review your request and place it here, on our </P>
<P>website, on our yahoo group page, or maybe even mention it on air! (we reserve the right to decline to advertise any event that does not meet our requirements). We want to organize all financial requests so that our members are not overwhelmed, so we have created guidelines for publication of these events. This area is generally dedicated to the 501c3 large events.</P>
<P >*The national canine cancer foundation will be holding a perfect tweet contest to raise e funds in a fun way for cancer research&nbsp; check out <A href="http://www.perfecttweet.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>www.perfecttweet.com</STRONG></SPAN></A> for all the info&nbsp; $5 for each entry will buy ya lots of fun&nbsp; and the potential to win lots of prizes! </P>
<P >*DRINK GOOD WINE and SAVE GOOD ANIMALS at the same time! Muttville has joined the list of rescue partners of the fine folks at <SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>Canine Wines</STRONG></SPAN>, who give $5 of every bottle they sell to help animal rescue groups. So, when you purchase a bottle of wine from them, simply mention Muttville and they will earmark a donation for them!</P>
<P >*The Animal Rescue Site is still having trouble getting&nbsp; enough people to click on it daily , which means that they fail to meet&nbsp; their quota for getting free (donated) food&nbsp; for the abused and neglected animals that they care for on a daily basis. Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help! <BR>
It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! <BR>
So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. Here's the web site!&nbsp;<SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #663366; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99"><STRONG>http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</STRONG></SPAN></A>&nbsp; After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!.</P>

<P>This week,&nbsp;Gena took the night off to help her family move or to get even with Tammy for her recent vacation on the beach, depending upon who's version you believe. Whatever the REAL reason, lol,&nbsp;we discussed making your own dog food. From what I can tell, it really may be less expensive to cook the meals rather than buy the commercial brands.&nbsp;But&nbsp;you need to know what you are doing, and plan it well in order to provide all the&nbsp;nutritional&nbsp; requirements of your dog. You have to know the basic needs of your dog, vitamin, mineral, and calorie wise, as well as what NOT to feed them. Some foods are deadly to your dog, while others will cause severe distress. Under, or Over feeding of certain vitamins and minerals&nbsp;can cause severe illness or even death too, so if you are going to start cooking for your dog, please check with your Veterinarian first and read up on dog nutritional and cooking!</P>
<P>The No Speed Limit Highway section was actually skipped this week since I gave several recipes in the main discussion segment. So get your pen and paper ready and hit the play button for this weeks pod cast! </P>

<P >-At the end of May Nutro Products Announced a voluntary recall of their dry cat food products. Some of it had too much Zinc in it, and others had too little potassium.

If that date is between may 12, 2010 and August 22, 2010, please do NOT use it! Switch foods immediately and monitor your cat for symptoms including, a reduction in appetite or refusal of food, weight loss, vomiting or diarrhea.&nbsp; If your cat is experiencing health issues or is pregnant, please contact your veterinarian.

-As we head into July and the heat of summer, we want to remind you that even the healthiest pets can suffer from dehydration, heat stroke and sunburn if overexposed to the heat. Heat stroke can be fatal if not treated promptly, so everyone needs to be vigilant and watch out for the symptoms of overheating. Excessive panting or difficulty breathing, drooling, mild weakness, stupor or collapse are symptoms that can indicate heat related illness. Additionally, pets can also suffer from seizures, bloody diarrhea and vomiting, along with an elevated body temperature [over 104 degrees].&nbsp; According to the ASPCA experts, taking these simple precautions can help to prevent your pet from overheating;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
    <LI>&nbsp; *Avoid dehydration by always having fresh, clean water available and lots of shady places where pets can cool off.&nbsp;</LI>
    <LI>&nbsp; *When the weather’s extremely hot, keep your pets indoors. </LI>
</UL>
<P>&nbsp; *Give your dog a light summer haircut to help prevent overheating. Shave the hair to a one- inch length, but never down to the skin, as fur offers protection from the sun. </P>
<P>&nbsp; *Brushing your cat more often than usual can also help prevent problems caused by excessive heat. </P>
<P>&nbsp; *When using sunscreen or insect repellent, be sure the product is labeled specifically for use on animals.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp; *Never leave an animal alone in a parked vehicle. On a hot day, a parked car can become a furnace in no time—even with the windows open, which could lead to a fatal heat stroke.</P>
<P>&nbsp;*and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, If you suspect your pet is suffering from heat stroke, get help from your Veterinarian immediately.</P>
<P>-We now have a Flickr group, Yes, CreativeAnimalRelief is now a flickr group!! You don't have to be a member of CAR to join, so stop by and take a look! Join us and submit your animal pictures, or pictures of the animals at your local shelters/charities.<BR>

<P><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff0000"><STRONG>Update</STRONG></SPAN>; Jazz- the chinese crescent dog that was so terribly abused and neglected (did you see the&nbsp;pics on flickr?) This poor dog was so&nbsp;flea ridden that its skin was infected, which infected its blood. By the pictures,&nbsp;you could hardly recognize&nbsp;it was a dog. Easily, the&nbsp;most awful case of abuse I'd ever seen. At any rate,&nbsp;an East Tennessee Bloodhound Rescue member was asked to take Jazz (because she already had a&nbsp;Chinese Crested, and because they knew that she had knowledge of hairless breeds). She contacted us to ask for help because the Vet bills for this poor dog were quite steep. He had to go to the&nbsp;Vet once a week for&nbsp;6 weeks, was&nbsp;on antibiotics, vitamins, eye meds, medicated shampoos, and more. We put the word out for help and wish to thank those that were able to paw it forward!&nbsp; I just received an update, and&nbsp;am told that Jazz is still thriving, although&nbsp; he's still got a long road ahead. They just&nbsp;learned that he is blind, due to the massive infection that he&nbsp;lived with for so long. But She assures us that He is slowly getting used to people and to compassion. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>*The Animal Rescue Site is having trouble getting&nbsp; enough people to click on it daily , which means that they fail to meet&nbsp; their quota for getting free (donated) food&nbsp; for the abused and neglected animals that they care for on a daily basis. Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help! <BR>
&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! </P>
<P>So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. </P>
<P>Here's the web site!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/">http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</A>&nbsp; </P>
<P>After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!.</P>
<P>The next thing is quite serious. I know we usually only promote animal related events, but the following event is for a fellow Artisan, Katie Brown. Katie is a Texas Artist that now has brain cancer. Her medical bills have become outrageous while her career as a professional artist has come to a standstill. Due to her condition and the treatments she is unable to work.&nbsp;Her friends with the Craft Mafia have been working hard to get a Fund set up for her. If you are interested in helping Katie, or if you would like&nbsp; to&nbsp;help the Craft Mafia in their efforts to help the ever growing financial burden for Katie’s family, please contact: Patti Hinkley at&nbsp;&nbsp;<A href="mailto:queenoherbs@yahoo.com">queenoherbs@yahoo.com</A>. </P>
<P>The Craft Mafia will be holding a fundraiser fo Katie, so if you are in the San Antonio area please go by and check it out. It's the <SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ccffff">NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP</SPAN> - Katie Brown Fundraiser&nbsp; <SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ccffff">July 26th 4-8pm</SPAN> at the El Tropicano Hotel, 110 Lexington Ave., San Antonio Texas 78205.The San Antonio Craft Mafia can be found at <SPAN style="COLOR: #ccccff">htt</SPAN><A href="http://sanantoniocraftmafia.com"><SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: #ccccff">p</SPAN>://sanantoniocraftmafia</SPAN>.com</A><BR>

As your animals get older, needs change .. how to recognize those changes, how to deal with blindness, handle loss of hearing, deal with doggie senility, and compassion. When&nbsp; enough is enough, natural death versus a compassion trip to the Vet.</P>

<P><SPAN style="COLOR: #ff0000"><STRONG>Update</STRONG></SPAN>; Jazz- the chinese crescent dog that was so terribly abused and neglected (did you see the&nbsp;pics on flickr?) This poor dog was so&nbsp;flea ridden that its skin was infected, which infected its blood. By the pictures,&nbsp;you could hardly recognize&nbsp;it was a dog. Easily, the&nbsp;most awful case of abuse I'd ever seen. At any rate,&nbsp;an East Tennessee Bloodhound Rescue member was asked to take Jazz (because she already had a&nbsp;Chinese Crested, and because they knew that she had knowledge of hairless breeds). She contacted us to ask for help because the Vet bills for this poor dog were quite steep. He had to go to the&nbsp;Vet once a week for&nbsp;6 weeks, was&nbsp;on antibiotics, vitamins, eye meds, medicated shampoos, and more. We put the word out for help and wish to thank those that were able to paw it forward!&nbsp; I just received an update, and&nbsp;am told that Jazz is still thriving, although&nbsp; he's still got a long road ahead. They just&nbsp;learned that he is blind, due to the massive infection that he&nbsp;lived with for so long. But She assures us that He is slowly getting used to people and to compassion. </P>

<P>*The Animal Rescue Site is having trouble getting&nbsp; enough people to click on it daily , which means that they fail to meet&nbsp; their quota for getting free (donated) food&nbsp; for the abused and neglected animals that they care for on a daily basis.

&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! </P>

<P><SPAN>This week we had Financial expert, Gregory Furguson with us to discuss how giving to charities can actually help your personal financial planning! Since I am definately NOT a financial expert, I am just going to say that it was a very interesting show and you really should listen to it!<BR>
</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>The No Speed Limit Highway section this week was all about getting rid of teh pests of summer yet again. This week I offered essential oil recipes to spray the bugs away. </SPAN></P>
<SPAN>
<P>1/8 oz Citronella<BR>
1/8 Eucalyptus <BR>
1/8 Lavender <BR>
1/8 Catnip <BR>
1/8 oz lemon&nbsp; <BR>
1/4 oz cedar leaf<BR>
1/4 oz Pennyroyal <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Mix all of the essential oil together, then mix them into your choice of carrier oils. A vegetable oil base would work, but I orefer apricot kernal oil or sweet almond oil. Because of this products intense concentration a little goes a long way. Apray on exposed skin prior to going outside. Re-apply when the mosquitoes return, or every 2-4 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>FOR a bit simpler recipe, mix <BR>
5 drops of patchouli essential oil&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
2 oz witch hazel extract <BR>
8-10 drops cedarwood essential oil</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

PALS with Pawz trains Rescued and Donated Dogs as Autism, Mobility, Therapy and Neurological Disorder Service Dog Teams for physically, emotionally and psychologically disabled persons. Our goal is to Create a Loving Relationship Between the Rescued or Donated Dog and their Disabled Partner; resulting in the enhancement of their physical and emotional freedoms, sense of security, independence and the enrichment of their quality of life. As a Public Service, PALS with Pawz has two additional programs. All of the Pawz candidates must participate in our READING Pawz and Therapy Pawz programs as part of their training.

<P><SPAN>This week we had Financial expert, Gregory Furguson with us to discuss how giving to charities can actually help your personal financial planning! Since I am definately NOT a financial expert, I am just going to say that it was a very interesting show and you really should listen to it!<BR>
</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>The No Speed Limit Highway section this week was all about getting rid of teh pests of summer yet again. This week I offered essential oil recipes to spray the bugs away. </SPAN></P>
<SPAN>
<P>1/8 oz Citronella<BR>
1/8 Eucalyptus <BR>
1/8 Lavender <BR>
1/8 Catnip <BR>
1/8 oz lemon&nbsp; <BR>
1/4 oz cedar leaf<BR>
1/4 oz Pennyroyal <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Mix all of the essential oil together, then mix them into your choice of carrier oils. A vegetable oil base would work, but I orefer apricot kernal oil or sweet almond oil. Because of this products intense concentration a little goes a long way. Apray on exposed skin prior to going outside. Re-apply when the mosquitoes return, or every 2-4 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>FOR a bit simpler recipe, mix <BR>
5 drops of patchouli essential oil&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
2 oz witch hazel extract <BR>
8-10 drops cedarwood essential oil</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This section is dedicated to charitable requests. This weekly section will list various non</P>
<P>-profit animal charities that are in need of funds and/or products for upcoming events. All </P>
<P>members are encouraged to review these requests and to help where they can!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
If your group, or a group that you know of, has a special event or need, please visit </P>
<P><A href="http://creativeanimalrelief.org/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066"><STRONG>http://creativeanimalrelief.org/</STRONG></SPAN></A> and click on the charitable request form.&nbsp; We also post </P>
<P>private need requests on other venues, so fill out the request form for any and all animal </P>
<P>related needs. Once filled out, we will review your request and place it here, on our </P>
<P>website, on our yahoo group page, or maybe even mention it on air! (we reserve the right to decline to advertise any event that does not meet our requirements). We want to organize all financial requests so that our members are not overwhelmed, so we have created guidelines for publication of these events. This area is generally dedicated to the 501c3 large events.</P>
<P>-The national canine cancer foundation will be holding a perfect tweet contest to rais e funds in a fun way for cancer research&nbsp; check out <A href="http://www.perfecttweet.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066"><STRONG>www.perfecttweet.com</STRONG></SPAN></A> for all the info&nbsp; $5 for each entry will buy ya lots of fun&nbsp; and the potential to win lots of prizes! </P>
<P>The Animal Rescue Site is having trouble getting&nbsp; enough people to click on it daily , which means that they fail to meet&nbsp; their quota for getting free (donated) food&nbsp; for the abused and neglected animals that they care for on a daily basis. Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help! <BR>
&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! </P>
<P>So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. Here's the web site!&nbsp;<SPAN style="COLOR: #000066"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066"><STRONG>http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</STRONG></SPAN></A>&nbsp; After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!. </P>
<P>-The next thing is quite serious. I know we usually only promote animal related events, but the following event is for a fellow Artisan, Katie Brown. Katie is a Texas Artist that now has brain cancer. Her medical bills have become outrageous while her career as a professional artist has come to a standstill. Due to her condition and the treatments she is unable to work. </P>
<P>Her friends with the Craft Mafia have been working hard to get a Fund set up for her. If you are interested in helping Katie, or if you would like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help the Craft Mafia in their efforts to help the ever growing financial burden for Katie’s family, please contact: Patti Hinkley at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN style="COLOR: #000066; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffccff">&nbsp; </SPAN><A href="mailto:queenoherbs@yahoo.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffccff">queenoherbs@yahoo.com</SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffccff">. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>This week we had Financial expert, Gregory Furguson with us to discuss how giving to charities can actually help your personal financial planning! Since I am definately NOT a financial expert, I am just going to say that it was a very interesting show and you really should listen to it!<BR>
</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>The No Speed Limit Highway section this week was all about getting rid of teh pests of summer yet again. This week I offered essential oil recipes to spray the bugs away. </SPAN></P>
<SPAN>
<P >1/8 oz Citronella<BR>
1/8 Eucalyptus <BR>
1/8 Lavender <BR>
1/8 Catnip <BR>
1/8 oz lemon&nbsp; <BR>
1/4 oz cedar leaf<BR>
1/4 oz Pennyroyal <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Mix all of the essential oil together, then mix them into your choice of carrier oils. A vegetable oil base would work, but I orefer apricot kernal oil or sweet almond oil. Because of this products intense concentration a little goes a long way. Apray on exposed skin prior to going outside. Re-apply when the mosquitoes return, or every 2-4 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>FOR a bit simpler recipe, mix <BR>
5 drops of patchouli essential oil&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
2 oz witch hazel extract <BR>
8-10 drops cedarwood essential oil</P>

<P>-profit animal charities that are in need of funds and/or products for upcoming events. All </P>
<P>members are encouraged to review these requests and to help where they can!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
If your group, or a group that you know of, has a special event or need, please visit </P>
<P><A href="http://creativeanimalrelief.org/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066"><STRONG>http://creativeanimalrelief.org/</STRONG></SPAN></A> and click on the charitable request form.&nbsp; We also post </P>
<P>private need requests on other venues, so fill out the request form for any and all animal </P>
<P>related needs. Once filled out, we will review your request and place it here, on our </P>
<P>website, on our yahoo group page, or maybe even mention it on air! (we reserve the right to decline to advertise any event that does not meet our requirements). We want to organize all financial requests so that our members are not overwhelmed, so we have created guidelines for publication of these events. This area is generally dedicated to the 501c3 large events.</P>

<P >The Animal Rescue Site is having trouble getting&nbsp; enough people to click on it daily , which means that they fail to meet&nbsp; their quota for getting free (donated) food&nbsp; for the abused and neglected animals that they care for on a daily basis. Since we all love animals,&nbsp; I thought I'd post this here to see if you would help! <BR>
&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! </P>
<P>So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising. Here's the web site!&nbsp;<SPAN style="COLOR: #000066"><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; </STRONG></SPAN><A href="http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066"><STRONG>http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/</STRONG></SPAN></A>&nbsp; After you click it, PLEASE TELL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS to do the same!. </P>

Katie is a Texas Artist that now has brain cancer. Her medical bills have become outrageous while her career as a professional artist has come to a standstill. Due to her condition and the treatments she is unable to work. </P>
<P>Her friends with the Craft Mafia have been working hard to get a Fund set up for her. If you are interested in helping Katie, or if you would like&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help the Craft Mafia in their efforts to help the ever growing financial burden for Katie’s family, please contact: Patti Hinkley at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN style="COLOR: #000066; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffccff">&nbsp; </SPAN><A href="mailto:queenoherbs@yahoo.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffccff">queenoherbs@yahoo.com</SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffccff">. </SPAN></P>

The top of the ‘Green Box’ breaks down into convenient serving plates, eliminating the need for disposable plates. The remainder of the box converts easily into a handy storage container, eliminating the need for plastic wrap, tin foil or plastic bags. The perforations and scores that create this functionality allow for easy disposal into a standard-sized recycling bin. Made from a standard pizza blank, the ‘Green Box’ requires no additional material or major redesign and can therefore be produced at no additional manufacturing cost. e.c.o. owns the utility patent on the ‘Green Box.’ Check out a video demo of the ‘Green Box’ at <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQBjJjpkjl0"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99"><STRONG>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQBjJjpkjl0</STRONG></SPAN></A> . </P>

&nbsp;It only takes about 15 seconds of your time to go to their site&nbsp; and click on the PURPLE BOX, "CLICK HERE IT'S FREE", and you will help to FUND FOOD FOR ANIMALS FOR FREE! This&nbsp; only costs you your time, so please click it! Then tell all your friends to click it! </P>
<P>So you understand what the deal is, their corporate&nbsp; sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to calculate their donation of&nbsp; food&nbsp; to abandoned/neglected animals, in exchange for&nbsp; the advertising.

The top of the ‘Green Box’ breaks down into convenient serving plates, eliminating the need for disposable plates. The remainder of the box converts easily into a handy storage container, eliminating the need for plastic wrap, tin foil or plastic bags. The perforations and scores that create this functionality allow for easy disposal into a standard-sized recycling bin. Made from a standard pizza blank, the ‘Green Box’ requires no additional material or major redesign and can therefore be produced at no additional manufacturing cost. e.c.o. owns the utility patent on the ‘Green Box.’ Check out a video demo of the ‘Green Box’ at <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQBjJjpkjl0"><SPAN style="COLOR: #000066; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #99ff99"><STRONG>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQBjJjpkjl0</STRONG></SPAN></A> . </P>

<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>This week we tackled a very tough subject, cancer in our dogs. Nobody really likes to talk </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>about cancer, in humans or in animals, but it is a very important that we do, none the less. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Joining us was Mr. Gary Nice, President and CEO of the National Canine Cancer&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation . <A href="http://WeAreTheCure.org">http://W<SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><SPAN style="COLOR: #0098cb">eA</SPAN></SPAN>reTheCure.org</A> <BR>
After loosing his first dog to cancer, Mr. Nice set out to become a more informed pet owner by researching cancer in dogs, signs and symptoms, treatments available&nbsp;and research. What </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>he found was that research into canine cancer is terribly underfunded, that cancer in dogs </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>is rampant (affecting one out of every three dogs), and that research for canine cancers </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>would ultimately serve to benefit humans, especially cancers that affect children. Armed with this </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>knowledge, as well as a strong love for&nbsp;dogs, Gary founded his own group to&nbsp;fund cancer research and to push for a cure.&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>You can read all about his organization on their website&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><A href="http://WeAreTheCure.org">http://WeAreTheCure.org</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also follow them on Twitter under the name, WeAreTheCure.<BR>

<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>This week we tackled a very tough subject, cancer in our dogs. Nobody really likes to talk </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>about cancer, in humans or in animals, but it is a very important that we do, none the less. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Joining us was Mr. Gary Nice, President and CEO of the National Canine Cancer&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation . <A href="http://WeAreTheCure.org">http://W<SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><SPAN style="COLOR: #0098cb">eA</SPAN></SPAN>reTheCure.org</A> <BR>
After loosing his first dog to cancer, Mr. Nice set out to become a more informed pet owner by researching cancer in dogs, signs and symptoms, treatments available&nbsp;and research. What </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>he found was that research into canine cancer is terribly underfunded, that cancer in dogs </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>is rampant (affecting one out of every three dogs), and that research for canine cancers </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>would ultimately serve to benefit humans, especially cancers that affect children. Armed with this </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>knowledge, as well as a strong love for&nbsp;dogs, Gary founded his own group to&nbsp;fund cancer research and to push for a cure.&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>You can read all about his organization on their website&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><A href="http://WeAreTheCure.org">http://WeAreTheCure.org</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also follow them on Twitter under the name, WeAreTheCure.<BR>

<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>The No Speed Limit Highway section this week offered an herbal treatment that you can make at home.&nbsp;<BR>
</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P align=center><SPAN style="COLOR: #663366"><STRONG>Carpet Dusting Powder for flea and pest control.</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>2 1/4 Cups of Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)<BR>
2 Tbs. Borax<BR>
2 Tbs. Dried Tansy flowers (finely ground)<BR>
2 Tbs. Dried Lavender buds (finely ground)<BR>
1/2 tsp. Orris root powder<BR>
5 drops patchouli oil<BR>
1/2 Tbs. witch hazel<BR>
1/2 Tbs. cedar leaf oil (some people prefer cedarwood oil)<BR>
1/4 Tbs. lemon oil or lemon grass oil</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>
<P >Mix all of the dry ingredients together, except for the baking soda. Once mixed, add the </P>
<P>essential oils into the powder and thoroughly. Once combined, store in a plastic, air tight </P>
<P>container, preferably one with a shaker lid for easy dispensing. This mixture has a shelf </P>
<P>life of approximately 1 year. Make sure that you use this for DOGS, and exercise extreme </P>
<P>caution if you have cats. Cats tend to lick paws and this can be dangerous.<BR>

<SPAN>
<P >After some technical difficulties, this week's special guest was the UK's own Stewart North from <A href="http://www.workinggundog.com.uk"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>www.workinggundog.com.uk</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>.</STRONG></SPAN>&nbsp; Mr. North was actually named as the Runner-Up, Top Gundog Club Trainer for 2008. He is an accredited breeder, and has been specializing in training "gun dogs", as well as home dogs, both privately and in groups for the past twelve years. He has received many accolades as a trainer, and as a participant in field trials. While he generally works with retriever breeds, he also accepts other breeds for training classes. <BR>
Mr. North was a very interesting guest and we encourage you to look him up on dogster.com or on his website! </P>
<P>This weeks segments were deleted due to the time constraints that the technical difficulties caused us. So, in case you missed it, here is the dog treat recipe once again! </P>
<P>Take a 15 oz can of salmon or jack mackerel<BR>
Some whole wheat flour<BR>
1 tsp of baking powder<BR>
A few sprinkles of garlic powder (optional)<BR>
*the original recipe calls for 2 tsp of salt but I NEVER add salt to my treats, so do as you </P>
<P>desire</P>
<P>Mix together all of the fish and the water in the can, the baking powder and the garlic </P>
<P>powder, and enough flour for texture. I usually begin with about 1/8 cup and then sift in by </P>
<P>the spoon-full until the right texture is achieved. Spread onto a cookie sheet and score to </P>
<P>make cutting easer. Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes, or until golden. After cooled, place </P>
<P>in airtight container and either freeze or refrigerate. If refrigerated they should remain </P>
<P>good for about 4-6 weeks, and for about 6 months if frozen.<BR>

<P>The CAR website is out of the shop and on the road again!!!! Visit </P>
<P><A href="http://theCreativeAnimalRelief.org"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>http://theCreativeAnimalRelief.org</STRONG></SPAN></A> and take a look! While you are there, please sign up for membership, even if you were previously a member. Your points are still in the system, but some of the new features are interactive and require a log-on id and password, so it will help if you resubmit your info. <BR>
-The store is expected to be operational within the next few days, and the RPM system should be in place by then as well. The RPM's are a virtual point award system that will allow you to redeem your RPM's, aka points, for many different items. You really need to make sure that you read up on these so that you will know what all you can do with them!&nbsp; <BR>
-We truly did upgrade from the compact to the luxury sedan, so even though this detour was unplanned and took a bit longer than expected, it is going to be well worth it in the end!!&nbsp; </P>
<P >-Our first quarter is almost at an end, and new charity nominations will soon be held. In order to nominate a charity you must&nbsp;be a member of CAR, and have earned 7 CAR points&nbsp;during the previous quarter. So, for the July 1 quarter, you will have to have earned your points prior to June 15 (as all nominations are made the last two weeks of the month prior to the start of the quarter). Remember that you also need to be able to provide basic information about the charity, and, while NOT a requirement, it is our hope that you would be willing to act as a liaison between CAR and the organization you submit, should it be chosen. </P>
<P>-Remember, if you are not a member you need to be! Membership is free, but with </P>
<P>participation you earn additional benefits. Check out all the details at&nbsp; </P>

<P>This section is dedicated to charitable requests. This weekly section will list various non</P>
<P>-profit animal charities that are in need of funds and/or products for upcoming events. All </P>
<P>members are encouraged to review these requests and to help where they can!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
If your group, or a group that you know of, has a special event or need, please visit </P>
<P><A href="http://creativeanimalrelief.org/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>http://creativeanimalrelief.org/</STRONG></SPAN></A> and click on the charitable request form.&nbsp; We also post </P>
<P>private need requests on other venues, so fill out the request form for any and all animal </P>
<P>related needs. Once filled out, we will review your request and place it here, on our </P>
<P>website, on our yahoo group page, or maybe even mention it on air! (we reserve the right to decline to advertise any event that does not meet our requirements). We want to organize all financial requests so that our members are not overwhelmed, so we have created guidelines for publication of these events. This area is dedicated to the 501c3 large events.</P>
<P >Our quarterly charities are; </P>

Noah's Ark is in need of bleach, fruit trees, blankets and cash.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>** Saving Shelter Pets (SSP) is a small, all-volunteer organization that rescues &amp; </P>
<P>transports cats and dogs from high-kill shelters in the Southeastern US, moving them to </P>
<P>safe, no-kill rescues in the Northeast. All of the animals receive full medical care and are </P>
<P>quarantined at a boarding facility or in foster care until they are healthy enough to travel </P>
<P>safely. They use professional transporters to transfer the animals to places where they have </P>
<P>a much better opportunity for adoption. All of the veterinary, boarding, and transportation </P>
<P>costs are paid by SSP, and all funds come from donations. They also operate a program called </P>
<P>Puppy Promises, that not only rescues puppies, but also spays their mother's (to help reduce </P>
<P>pet overpopulation), and a Bernies Buddies program, which helps to treat heartworm positive </P>
<P>dogs that are saved through their Rescue &amp; Transport program. Recently they also began a </P>
<P>Spay &amp; Neuter program which offers financial assistance to low-income pet owners in several </P>
<P>Ohio and Georgia counties.<BR>
This group needs financial donations, so please help if you can.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>**Our fellow EFA member, Epic Farms, is in need of financial assistance for repairs. Their </P>
<P>horse farm was hit by storms that caused some major property damage. They utilize horses for </P>
<P>therapeutic treatment, and just received their non=profit status. Please visit </P>
<P><A href="http://epicfarms.etsy.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>http://epicfarms.etsy.com</STRONG></SPAN></A> to see what they have in their shop that you may be able to use. All money from the shop goes to support the animals! </P>
<P >**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since </P>
<P>this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only </P>
<P>newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website </P>
<P>features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to </P>
<P>shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If </P>
<P>there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your </P>
<P>shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them </P>
<P>about this project and they can check into signing up! Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <A href="http://www.snugglesproject.org"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>http://www.snugglesproject.org</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>.</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<SPAN>
<P >After some technical difficulties, this week's special guest was the UK's own Stewart North from <A href="http://www.workinggundog.com.uk"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>www.workinggundog.com.uk</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>.</STRONG></SPAN>&nbsp; Mr. North was actually named as the Runner-Up, Top Gundog Club Trainer for 2008. He is an accredited breeder, and has been specializing in training "gun dogs", as well as home dogs, both privately and in groups for the past twelve years. He has received many accolades as a trainer, and as a participant in field trials. While he generally works with retriever breeds, he also accepts other breeds for training classes. <BR>
Mr. North was a very interesting guest and we encourage you to look him up on dogster.com or on his website! </P>
<P>This weeks segments were deleted due to the time constraints that the technical difficulties caused us. So, in case you missed it, here is the dog treat recipe once again! </P>
<P>Take a 15 oz can of salmon or jack mackerel<BR>
Some whole wheat flour<BR>
1 tsp of baking powder<BR>
A few sprinkles of garlic powder (optional)<BR>
*the original recipe calls for 2 tsp of salt but I NEVER add salt to my treats, so do as you </P>
<P>desire</P>
<P>Mix together all of the fish and the water in the can, the baking powder and the garlic </P>
<P>powder, and enough flour for texture. I usually begin with about 1/8 cup and then sift in by </P>
<P>the spoon-full until the right texture is achieved. Spread onto a cookie sheet and score to </P>
<P>make cutting easer. Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes, or until golden. After cooled, place </P>
<P>in airtight container and either freeze or refrigerate. If refrigerated they should remain </P>
<P>good for about 4-6 weeks, and for about 6 months if frozen.<BR>

<P>The CAR website is out of the shop and on the road again!!!! Visit </P>
<P><A href="http://theCreativeAnimalRelief.org"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>http://theCreativeAnimalRelief.org</STRONG></SPAN></A> and take a look! While you are there, please sign up for membership, even if you were previously a member. Your points are still in the system, but some of the new features are interactive and require a log-on id and password, so it will help if you resubmit your info. <BR>
-The store is expected to be operational within the next few days, and the RPM system should be in place by then as well. The RPM's are a virtual point award system that will allow you to redeem your RPM's, aka points, for many different items. You really need to make sure that you read up on these so that you will know what all you can do with them!&nbsp; <BR>
-We truly did upgrade from the compact to the luxury sedan, so even though this detour was unplanned and took a bit longer than expected, it is going to be well worth it in the end!!&nbsp; </P>
<P >-Our first quarter is almost at an end, and new charity nominations will soon be held. In order to nominate a charity you must&nbsp;be a member of CAR, and have earned 7 CAR points&nbsp;during the previous quarter. So, for the July 1 quarter, you will have to have earned your points prior to June 15 (as all nominations are made the last two weeks of the month prior to the start of the quarter). Remember that you also need to be able to provide basic information about the charity, and, while NOT a requirement, it is our hope that you would be willing to act as a liaison between CAR and the organization you submit, should it be chosen. </P>
<P>-Remember, if you are not a member you need to be! Membership is free, but with </P>
<P>participation you earn additional benefits. Check out all the details at&nbsp; </P>

<P>This section is dedicated to charitable requests. This weekly section will list various non</P>
<P>-profit animal charities that are in need of funds and/or products for upcoming events. All </P>
<P>members are encouraged to review these requests and to help where they can!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
If your group, or a group that you know of, has a special event or need, please visit </P>
<P><A href="http://creativeanimalrelief.org/"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>http://creativeanimalrelief.org/</STRONG></SPAN></A> and click on the charitable request form.&nbsp; We also post </P>
<P>private need requests on other venues, so fill out the request form for any and all animal </P>
<P>related needs. Once filled out, we will review your request and place it here, on our </P>
<P>website, on our yahoo group page, or maybe even mention it on air! (we reserve the right to decline to advertise any event that does not meet our requirements). We want to organize all financial requests so that our members are not overwhelmed, so we have created guidelines for publication of these events. This area is dedicated to the 501c3 large events.</P>
<P >Our quarterly charities are; </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>** Saving Shelter Pets (SSP) is a small, all-volunteer organization that rescues &amp; </P>
<P>transports cats and dogs from high-kill shelters in the Southeastern US, moving them to </P>
<P>safe, no-kill rescues in the Northeast. All of the animals receive full medical care and are </P>
<P>quarantined at a boarding facility or in foster care until they are healthy enough to travel </P>
<P>safely. They use professional transporters to transfer the animals to places where they have </P>
<P>a much better opportunity for adoption. All of the veterinary, boarding, and transportation </P>
<P>costs are paid by SSP, and all funds come from donations. They also operate a program called </P>
<P>Puppy Promises, that not only rescues puppies, but also spays their mother's (to help reduce </P>
<P>pet overpopulation), and a Bernies Buddies program, which helps to treat heartworm positive </P>
<P>dogs that are saved through their Rescue &amp; Transport program. Recently they also began a </P>
<P>Spay &amp; Neuter program which offers financial assistance to low-income pet owners in several </P>
<P>Ohio and Georgia counties.<BR>
This group needs financial donations, so please help if you can.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>**Our fellow EFA member, Epic Farms, is in need of financial assistance for repairs. Their </P>
<P>horse farm was hit by storms that caused some major property damage. They utilize horses for </P>
<P>therapeutic treatment, and just received their non=profit status. Please visit </P>
<P><A href="http://epicfarms.etsy.com"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>http://epicfarms.etsy.com</STRONG></SPAN></A> to see what they have in their shop that you may be able to use. All money from the shop goes to support the animals! </P>
<P >**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since </P>
<P>this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only </P>
<P>newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website </P>
<P>features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to </P>
<P>shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If </P>
<P>there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your </P>
<P>shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them </P>
<P>about this project and they can check into signing up! Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <A href="http://www.snugglesproject.org"><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>http://www.snugglesproject.org</STRONG></SPAN></A><SPAN style="COLOR: #330099"><STRONG>.</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P>*You may still have some time to help out Muttville, a non profit charity out of San Fran Cisco which helps senior dogs. Their fundraiser is 6/13/09, so time is almost up, but please check with them and see if you can still help out in any way!

</strong></span>First, let me apologize for not maintaining the blog while I was on vacation. That Florida beach was just too enticing and the computer was just toooooo far away to bother with! lol<br />
If you missed the past two weeks shows with Gena, please make sure to go back and listen to the archived episodes.<br />
 <br />
One of the shows I missed was all about the Andes org., a Mexican National Charity that spays and neuters animals all over the countryside by utilizing a mobile surgical station. They use to have to operate in tents and borrowed garages, but recently they have been busy equipping a donated ambulance for this purpose. We just got an email with pictures, stating that it is now finished and will be on the road shortly, and boy does it look awesome! So congratulations to them, and a job well done to all the workers and the donators that helped to make it possible! <br />
<br />
This week, since I just returned from vacation, we were inspired to discuss how we should go about finding a pet-sitter for when you must leave animals at home, and what types of things tat you can do to ensure that you return home to a happy, healthy pet. We also took some time to discuss our opinions on whether someone who has paid for a animal cruelty crime should be allowed to work with animals again. Although we disagree a bit, we both have interesting viewpoints and wonder what yours is.<br />
<br />
I abandoned the Alternative Highway this week to offer everyone an easy dog treat recipe, I had some making up to do since I was gone so long! In case you couldn't get to your pen in time, here it is again;<br />
Take a 15 oz can of salmon or jack mackerel<br />
Some whole wheat flour<br />
1 tsp of baking powder<br />
A few sprinkles of garlic powder (optional)<br />
*the original recipe calls for 2 tsp of salt but I NEVER add salt to my treats, so do as you desire<br />
<br />
Mix together all of the fish and the water in the can, the baking powder and the garlic powder, and enough flour for texture. I usually begin with about 1/8 cup and then sift in by the spoon-full until the right texture is achieved. Spread onto a cookie sheet and score to make cutting easer. Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes, or until golden. After cooled, place in airtight container and either freeze or refrigerate. If refrigerated they shoudl remain good for about 4-6 weeks, and for about 6 months if frozen.<br />

    <p><span><span>** <span style="background-color: #ffcc66">Saving Shelter Pets (SSP)</span> is a small, all-volunteer organization that rescues &amp; transports cats and dogs from high-kill shelters in the Southeastern US, moving them to safe, no-kill rescues in the Northeast. All of the animals receive full medical care and are quarantined at a boarding facility or in foster care until they are healthy enough to travel safely. They use professional transporters to transfer the animals to places where they have a much better opportunity for adoption. All of the veterinary, boarding, and transportation costs are paid by SSP, and all funds come from donations. They also operate a program called Puppy Promises, that not only rescues puppies, but also spays their mother's (to help reduce pet overpopulation), and a Bernies Buddies program, which helps to treat heartworm positive dogs that are saved through their Rescue &amp; Transport program. Recently they also began a Spay &amp; Neuter program which offers financial assistance to low-income pet owners in several Ohio and Georgia counties.<br />
    This group needs financial donations, so please help if you can.<br />

    <p>**Our fellow EFA member, Epic Farms, is in need of financial assistance for repairs. Their horse farm was hit by storms that caused some major property damage. They utilize horses for therapeutic treatment, and just received their non=profit status. Please visit <a href="http://epicfarms.etsy.com/"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://epicfarms.etsy.com</strong></span></a> to see what they have in their shop that you may be able to use. All money from the shop goes to support the animals! <br />

    <p>**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.  Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
    Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <a href="http://www.snugglesproject.org/"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://www.snugglesproject.org</strong></span></a><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>.<br />

    <p><span><span>** <span style="background-color: #ffcc66">Saving Shelter Pets (SSP)</span> is a small, all-volunteer organization that rescues &amp; transports cats and dogs from high-kill shelters in the Southeastern US, moving them to safe, no-kill rescues in the Northeast. All of the animals receive full medical care and are quarantined at a boarding facility or in foster care until they are healthy enough to travel safely. They use professional transporters to transfer the animals to places where they have a much better opportunity for adoption. All of the veterinary, boarding, and transportation costs are paid by SSP, and all funds come from donations. They also operate a program called Puppy Promises, that not only rescues puppies, but also spays their mother's (to help reduce pet overpopulation), and a Bernies Buddies program, which helps to treat heartworm positive dogs that are saved through their Rescue &amp; Transport program. Recently they also began a Spay &amp; Neuter program which offers financial assistance to low-income pet owners in several Ohio and Georgia counties.<br />
    This group needs financial donations, so please help if you can.<br />

    <p>**Our fellow EFA member, Epic Farms, is in need of financial assistance for repairs. Their horse farm was hit by storms that caused some major property damage. They utilize horses for therapeutic treatment, and just received their non=profit status. Please visit <a href="http://epicfarms.etsy.com/"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://epicfarms.etsy.com</strong></span></a> to see what they have in their shop that you may be able to use. All money from the shop goes to support the animals! <br />

    <p>**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.  Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
    Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <a href="http://www.snugglesproject.org/"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://www.snugglesproject.org</strong></span></a><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>.<br />

    <p>*There is still some time to help out Muttville, a non profit charity out of San Fran Cisco which helps senior dogs for their 6/13/09 fundraiser.

</strong></span>Mr. Ed was unavailable, but that didn't stop us from talking about horses! These majestic creatures are being used more and more frequently in therapy for handicapped and trouble people, especially youths. <br />
We were very happy to have had David, from Arromont stables and cabins, as our special guest on this weeks show. David and his wife have been running a beautiful, North Carolina horse retreat for about twelve years now. They have a few hundred acres and about 25 working horses on their ranch. They offer fishing, trail riding, camping (both cabin and tent), and a lovely place to relax and get away for the "citified" folks! Most impressively, David and his wife are currently working on obtaining their accreditation for horse therapy, where their ranch will be certified to offer therapeutic programs for MRDD children.<br />

<p><span><span>** <span style="background-color: #ffcc66">Saving Shelter Pets (SSP)</span> is a small, all-volunteer organization that rescues &amp; transports cats and dogs from high-kill shelters in the Southeastern US, moving them to safe, no-kill rescues in the Northeast. All of the animals receive full medical care and are quarantined at a boarding facility or in foster care until they are healthy enough to travel safely. They use professional transporters to transfer the animals to places where they have a much better opportunity for adoption. All of the veterinary, boarding, and transportation costs are paid by SSP, and all funds come from donations. They also operate a program called Puppy Promises, that not only rescues puppies, but also spays their mother's (to help reduce pet overpopulation), and a Bernies Buddies program, which helps to treat heartworm positive dogs that are saved through their Rescue &amp; Transport program. Recently they also began a Spay &amp; Neuter program which offers financial assistance to low-income pet owners in several Ohio and Georgia counties.<br />
In order to raise funds for these programs, the SSP is hosting an on-line auction May 4-18.<br />
Please check their website for more details, and help them out of you can!<br />

<p >**Our fellow EFA member, Epic Farms, is in need of financial assistance for repairs. Their horse farm was hit by storms that caused some major property dammage. They utilizee horses for therepeutic treatment, and just received their non=profit status. Please visit <a href="http://epicfarms.etsy.com"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://epicfarms.etsy.com</strong></span></a> to see what they have in their shop that you may be able to use. All money from the shop goes to support the animals! </p>
<p >**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.  Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <a href="http://www.snugglesproject.org"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://www.snugglesproject.org</strong></span></a><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>.<br />

<p>**The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website<span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong> </strong></span><a href="http://www.scampp.com/"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://www.scampp.com/</strong></span></a> or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509. If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!</p>

<p >**The World Society for the protection  of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people. If this moves you please visit <a href="http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826">http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826</a></p>

<p >**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.  Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <a href="http://www.snugglesproject.org"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://www.snugglesproject.org</strong></span></a><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>.<br />

<p>**The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website<span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong> </strong></span><a href="http://www.scampp.com/"><span style="color: #006600; background-color: #ffcc66"><strong>http://www.scampp.com/</strong></span></a> or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509. If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!</p>

<p >**The World Society for the protection  of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people.

With summer upon us, many people's minds turn toward vacation. You can take your pets with you and have a great vacation, if you plan ahead. This weeks show was all about what you need to consider before taking off with your pet for summer holiday! Some points to ponder; call ahead to find out your transportation modes restrictions and rules. Check for  hotel fees and/or restrictions. If driving, make sure that you plan frequent stops to water and exercise your pet. Invest in a pet restraint so that your pet will not become a projectile if you make a quick stop, or are involved in an accident. Be sure to pack favorite toys, a crate, a bed, your pets normal food, water from your home, an animal first aide kit, a leash,  and ownership and immunization tags/papers. These basics should be included in any trip you take with your pet.  Remember that foreign countries may require different records than you may expect, so check with your Veterinarian before your trip. Invest in a crate for traveling and begin getting your pet use to it at least a month before your trip. Begin by leaving the door open and allowing your pet to go in/out on their own. Then close the door for a short period of time. Lengthen times gradually. Make sure that you open the cage and allow your pet out when they are calm, otherwise you will teach him/her that they get out for bad behavior. For more tips, listen to the archived show! <br />

</span></span><span style="font-size: 18px">The Run With the Big Dogs [poker Run], sponsored by the <span style="font-size: 18px">Greyhound Pets of America, Tampa Bay Chapter, raised over $8000 to help care for and place retired greyhounds last weekend! Gena played 6 hands (one for each of our quarterly charities, one for CAR, one for EFA, and one for pigatopia), while Shannon manned a booth for us at a vendor area. Thanks to both of these ladies, and a heart-felt congratulations to all the workers who helped raise money during this event!</span><br />
With summer upon us, many people's minds turn toward vacation. You can take your pets with you and have a great vacation, if you plan ahead. This weeks show was all about what you need to consider before taking off with your pet for summer holiday! Some points to ponder; call ahead to find out your transportation modes restrictions and rules. Check for  hotel fees and/or restrictions. If driving, make sure that you plan frequent stops to water and exercise your pet. Invest in a pet restraint so that your pet will not become a projectile if you make a quick stop, or are involved in an accident. Be sure to pack favorite toys, a crate, a bed, your pets normal food, water from your home, an animal first aide kit, a leash,  and ownership and immunization tags/papers. These basics should be included in any trip you take with your pet.  Remember that foreign countries may require different records than you may expect, so check with your Veterinarian before your trip. Invest in a crate for traveling and begin getting your pet use to it at least a month before your trip. Begin by leaving the door open and allowing your pet to go in/out on their own. Then close the door for a short period of time. Lengthen times gradually. Make sure that you open the cage and allow your pet out when they are calm, otherwise you will teach him/her that they get out for bad behavior. For more tips, listen to the archived show! <br />

This program can be activated for natural or man-made disasters affecting 350 pets or more. Program volunteers and supplies will be managed on site by the nonprofit organization, Healing HEART Sanctuary. <span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,153)">To Volunteer For the Emergency Relief Waggin' Program during a disaster, contact Laurel Ley with Healing HEART Sanctuary at laurelLey@AnimalReliefResource.org. </span><br />
They are currently sending an Emergency Relief Waggin' trailer stocked with at least 16 tons of much-needed pet food and supplies, as well as a back-up trailer loaded with essential care items for pets and their rescuers, to North Dakota in light of the recent flooding. Their assistance was requested by officials w the North Dakota State Board of Animal Health. Initial reports indicated that apporx. 1000 animals could be affected by this disaster so they doubled the amount of supplies that they typically would . They even have a third vehicle on standby in case it is needed, which it may be because the<br />
the National Animal rescue group, who is also helping out in this area, estimate that OVER 3000 animals may be in danger d/t the flooding.<br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.  Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. <span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,153)">If you'd like to know more, visit their website at http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. <span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,153)">Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website http://www.scampp.com/ or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509.</span> If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />

**The World Society for the protection  of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people<span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,153)">.

<strong style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 255);">REVERSE</strong>-<br />
This week&nbsp; was all slop! Pig slop that is, lol. Lynn, director of Noah's Ark Sanctuary, was our special guest as she gave us the 411 on pot bellied pigs. Noah's Ark has been rescuing pot bellied pigs from horrible abuse situations, abandonment, and just about any other condition that you can imagine for about twelve years now. This non-profit&nbsp; is truly a stand out organization. Here the animals are provided a forever home in an open herd sanctuary. With over 15 acres dedicated to their range, they certainly have room to roam while they are cared for medically and physically. There certainly is no shortage of love for these animals either, and if you listened to the show you know that! All these animals are also spayed/neutered, but most importantly, they are available for the public to visit. Lynn encourages people to visit, even feed the pigs, while she strives to teach everyone about these amazing animals and their true nature. You can visit the sanctuary on line at; <strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">noahasarkpbprecue.tripod.com</span></strong><br />
<br />
Joining Lynn on our show today was fellow Artisan and Big time pig enthusiast, Shannon of pigatopia.com. Shannon is a talented Artist who has been using her paintings to help support Noah's Ark, as well as her own rescued pigs, for the past four or five years. Shannon has even written a book about pigs, and all the sale proceeds support the pigs. You can check out Shannon's art, as well as her book at her Pigatopia Etsy shop,&nbsp; <strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">http.pigatopia.etsy.com </span></strong><br />
<br />
Both of these Ladies are special, caring people. While Lynn houses approximately 150 pigs at her Port Ritchey sanctuary, 12 of which live in her house!, Shannon cares for 12 of her own rescued pigs at her Le Canto, Florida home. Shannon, by the way, keeps 7 or so pigs in her home! lol.&nbsp; Shannon met Lynn when she sought a qualified p.b.p. Veterinarian. Since that day, Shannon has been one of Lynn's best students and supporters!<br />
<br />
<br />
We were so busy getting the pigsture about the pigs and Noah's Ark Pot Bellied Pig Sanctuary that we drove right on by this exit ramp today! Next week I'll be giving you some recipes, so get your pens and papers ready!<br />

*<strong><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Sahara Rain</span></strong>,
the up and coming Swiss Rock Band, donated their first cd to CAR
because they love animals too, and we put it up for an auction. Last we checked, the highest &nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 102);"> bid was $25.50</span>! Unfortunately, that is about the time that the CAR hit a speed bump. Now the CAR is in the shop getting the fender buffed out. As soon as we have it all buffed out and shined, and ready to get back on the road, we will let you know who has won the cd, and how much they donated! <span style="background-color: rgb(204, 255, 255);">ALL MONEY RECEIVED FROM THIS AUCTION WILL BE USED FOR ANIMAL CHARITY!</span><br style="background-color: rgb(204, 255, 255);" />

** Petsmart operates a few different charitable programs, one of which
is the Relief wagon. This program can be activated for natural or
man-made disasters affecting 350 pets or more. Program volunteers and
supplies will be managed on site by the nonprofit organization, Healing
HEART Sanctuary. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">To
Volunteer For the Emergency Relief Waggin' Program during a disaster,

They are currently sending an Emergency Relief Waggin' trailer stocked
with at least 16 tons of much-needed pet food and supplies, as well as
a back-up trailer loaded with essential care items for pets and their
rescuers, to North Dakota in light of the recent flooding. Their
assistance was requested by officials w the North Dakota State Board of
Animal Health. Initial reports indicated that apporx. 1000 animals
could be affected by this disaster so they doubled the amount of
supplies that they typically would . They even have a third vehicle on
standby in case it is needed, which it may be because the<br />
the National Animal rescue group, who is also helping out in this area,
estimate that OVER 3000 animals may be in danger d/t the flooding.<br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets
in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort
in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters
house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie
on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them.
If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this
international project. The website features lists of patterns for
knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters
all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the
Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer
to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be
happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this
project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who
sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy
fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the
website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the
edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight
stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of
flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You
can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of
batting. Then you are recycling as well. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">If you'd like to know more, visit their website at http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*SASHA Farm Sanctuary will soon be holding its annual silent
auction.The deadline for donations has past, but if you have <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">questions about donations, the sanctuary, or the mailing address please
email Sarah at JasperKat2@yahoo.com. You can learn more about this

*The Atlanta Animal Welfare Committee will be holding an art
auction/exhibition to raise funds for free
spaying/neutering/vaccinating of pets for neighbors in need. They need
donations of pieces of art or design to be auctioned off in Atlanta, GA
from April 1- 28. The opening will be Saturday, April 4 from 7-9 pm.
The artist will set the minimum suggested bid and The bidding will
remain open throughout the exhibition. Donations are tax deductible
too, so, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">if you are interested in donating contact Felicia Holden at animalwelfarecommittee @earthlink.net</span><br />

*The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs
(SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have
been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left
behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are
collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25
pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the
foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a
"backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then
there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter
(2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered
a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20.
Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house
large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of
donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they
also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already
being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for
any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone
can help them out with a home, please contact them. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Any
donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website
http://www.scampp.com/ or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite
D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509.</span> If donations are to be earmarked
for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue
effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of
all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful
watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in
need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting!
WooHoo Shannon! Way to oink it forward!<br />

<strong style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 255);">REVERSE</strong>-<br />
This week&nbsp; was all slop! Pig slop that is, lol. Lynn, director of Noah's Ark Sanctuary, was our special guest as she gave us the 411 on pot bellied pigs. Noah's Ark has been rescuing pot bellied pigs from horrible abuse situations, abandonment, and just about any other condition that you can imagine for about twelve years now. This non-profit&nbsp; is truly a stand out organization. Here the animals are provided a forever home in an open herd sanctuary. With over 15 acres dedicated to their range, they certainly have room to roam while they are cared for medically and physically. There certainly is no shortage of love for these animals either, and if you listened to the show you know that! All these animals are also spayed/neutered, but most importantly, they are available for the public to visit. Lynn encourages people to visit, even feed the pigs, while she strives to teach everyone about these amazing animals and their true nature. You can visit the sanctuary on line at; <strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">noahasarkpbprecue.tripod.com</span></strong><br />
<br />
Joining Lynn on our show today was fellow Artisan and Big time pig enthusiast, Shannon of pigatopia.com. Shannon is a talented Artist who has been using her paintings to help support Noah's Ark, as well as her own rescued pigs, for the past four or five years. Shannon has even written a book about pigs, and all the sale proceeds support the pigs. You can check out Shannon's art, as well as her book at her Pigatopia Etsy shop,&nbsp; <strong><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 204, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">http.pigatopia.etsy.com </span></strong><br />
<br />
Both of these Ladies are special, caring people. While Lynn houses approximately 150 pigs at her Port Ritchey sanctuary, 12 of which live in her house!, Shannon cares for 12 of her own rescued pigs at her Le Canto, Florida home. Shannon, by the way, keeps 7 or so pigs in her home! lol.&nbsp; Shannon met Lynn when she sought a qualified p.b.p. Veterinarian. Since that day, Shannon has been one of Lynn's best students and supporters!<br />

We were so busy getting the pigsture about the pigs and Noah's Ark Pot Bellied Pig Sanctuary that we drove right on by this exit ramp today! Next week I'll be giving you some recipes, so get your pens and papers ready!<br />

** Petsmart operates a few different charitable programs, one of which
is the Relief wagon. This program can be activated for natural or
man-made disasters affecting 350 pets or more. Program volunteers and

with at least 16 tons of much-needed pet food and supplies, as well as
a back-up trailer loaded with essential care items for pets and their
rescuers, to North Dakota in light of the recent flooding. Their
assistance was requested by officials w the North Dakota State Board of
Animal Health. Initial reports indicated that apporx. 1000 animals
could be affected by this disaster so they doubled the amount of
supplies that they typically would . They even have a third vehicle on
standby in case it is needed, which it may be because the<br />
the National Animal rescue group, who is also helping out in this area,
estimate that OVER 3000 animals may be in danger d/t the flooding.<br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets
in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort
in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters
house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie
on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them.
If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this
international project. The website features lists of patterns for
knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters
all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the
Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer
to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be
happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this
project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who
sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy
fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the
website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the
edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight
stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of
flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You
can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of
batting. Then you are recycling as well. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">If you'd like to know more, visit their website at http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The Atlanta Animal Welfare Committee will be holding an art
auction/exhibition to raise funds for free
spaying/neutering/vaccinating of pets for neighbors in need. They need
donations of pieces of art or design to be auctioned off in Atlanta, GA

The artist will set the minimum suggested bid and The bidding will
remain open throughout the exhibition. Donations are tax deductible
too, so, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">if you are interested in donating contact Felicia Holden at animalwelfarecommittee @earthlink.net</span><br />

*The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs
(SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have
been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left
behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are
collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25
pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the
foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a
"backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then
there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter
(2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered
a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20.
Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house
large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of
donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they
also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already
being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for
any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone
can help them out with a home, please contact them. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Any
donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website
http://www.scampp.com/ or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite
D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509.</span> If donations are to be earmarked
for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue
effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of
all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful
watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in
need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting!
WooHoo Shannon! Way to oink it forward!<br />

UNDER THE HOOD 4/8/09</h4>
<strong style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 255);">REVERSE</strong>-<br />
This week it was all about pampering the pooch! We discussed the spa like resorts available for doggie (and kitty) day care or boarding. There are many of these ultra pampering resorts popping up all over the country, so no matter where you live or are visiting, your pet can have the best!. Your pet can have a regular room, which isn't all that "regular",&nbsp; or a sweet to relax in, complete with a brass bed and web cam for owner viewing, they even get a nightly tuck in service, complete with a snack and a scratch. <br />
Of course, as with human spas, you can pay for many "extras" to make your pets spa visit grrrrrrrrrreat!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Even without the little extras, the environment and amenities in these pet spa palaces, are nothing, if not glamorous. They have extra large sleeping areas, top of the line agility training equipment, park like settings, including plants and even waterfalls, not to mention piped in music, televisions, even windows with bird and fish viewing for the cat guests.<br />
Check you local yellow pages for a pet spa in your area the next time you want to pamper your pet! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
<br />
The No Speed Limit Highway was all about Bach Flower Remedies; Bach Flowers are used when a dog's mental
condition needs to be changed. Certain essences, prepared
homeopathically, can treat emotional problems. Bach Flower Remedies can
often be used when there is a high stress level within the dog's house
and she is having physical symptoms because of it. A large amount of
stress in your dog's life can result from car accidents, dog fights,
fires, etc. If it would stress you, it most likely will stress your dog.<br />
There are 38 Bach Flower remedies, each corresponding
to specific emotional states. If more than one remedy is needed, you
can combine up to four of them.<br />
Preparing Bach Flower Remedies;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Remedies come in small bottles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Take 2-3 drops from bottle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Put drops into 1-ounce dropper bottle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you have more than one remedy, take 2-3 drops from each<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Fill bottle with distilled water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Shake bottle 108 times (a principle of homoeopathies)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 2-3x a day, put dropper full into dog's water, food, or directly into her mouth. <br />
<br />
Bach
Flowers are available at health food stores. To understand what each
remedy is used for, read the bottle or go to your local bookstore. A
number of books are written about Bach flowers. Luckily, there will not
be any negative effects if you pick the wrong remedy. If you select the
proper one(s), you are likely to get positive results.<br />

-Members need to visit http://creativeanimalrelief.org and fill out
their profiles. The new quarter began April 1, so get them filled out!<br />
<br />
-Speaking of the new quarter. The first ever quarterly charities were
randomly picked from the eligible entries, and the winners are;Noah's
Ark, Second Chance Doxie and Andes. For the next three weeks we will
review one of these. Today we focused on&nbsp; 2nd Chance Doxie, which was chosen by CAR member, Mammamardee. Second chance doxie began in 2006,
and are a small rescue, only dealing with about 4-5 dogs at a time. They say that they just don't rehome dachshunds, they nurture them mind, bod
and soul. They provide all the care that the recured dachsunds need,
medically, behaviorally, and physically until they find a forever home
for them. They use foster homes with a low-dog count to help love these
dogs until their forever home can be found. Located in
Sandiego, they only provide for adoptions in that county so that they can
make sure all the humans are perfect for their rescued dogs. You can
read more about them on their website <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">www.2ndchancedoxie.com</span><br />

** Petsmart operates a few different charitable programs, one of which
is the Relief wagon. This program can be activated for natural or
man-made disasters affecting 350 pets or more. Program volunteers and
supplies will be managed on site by the nonprofit organization, Healing
HEART Sanctuary. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">To
Volunteer For the Emergency Relief Waggin' Program during a disaster,
contact Laurel Ley with Healing HEART Sanctuary at
laurelLey@AnimalReliefResource.org. </span><br />
They are currently sending an Emergency Relief Waggin' trailer stocked
with at least 16 tons of much-needed pet food and supplies, as well as
a back-up trailer loaded with essential care items for pets and their
rescuers, to North Dakota in light of the recent flooding. Their
assistance was requested by officials w the North Dakota State Board of
Animal Health. Initial reports indicated that apporx. 1000 animals
could be affected by this disaster so they doubled the amount of
supplies that they typically would . They even have a third vehicle on
standby in case it is needed, which it may be because the<br />
the National Animal rescue group, who is also helping out in this area,
estimate that OVER 3000 animals may be in danger d/t the flooding.<br />
<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">You can help this

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets
in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort
in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters
house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie
on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them.
If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this
international project. The website features lists of patterns for
knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters
all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the
Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer
to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be
happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this
project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who
sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy
fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the
website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the
edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight
stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of
flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You
can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of
batting. Then you are recycling as well. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">If you'd like to know more, visit their website at http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs
(SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have
been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left
behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are
collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25
pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the
foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a
"backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then
there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter
(2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered
a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20.
Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house
large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of
donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they
also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already
being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for
any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone
can help them out with a home, please contact them. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Any
donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website
http://www.scampp.com/ or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite
D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509.</span> If donations are to be earmarked
for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue
effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of
all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful
watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in
need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting!
WooHoo Shannon! Way to oink it forward!<br />

*The Greyhound Pets of America, Tampa Bay Chapter is asking for

*The World Society for the protection&nbsp; of animals has sent out an
urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on
the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk
reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there
has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with
strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer
convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free'
status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected
outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not
attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health.
You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor,
asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies
prevention that will protect both animals and people<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">. If this moves you please visit http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826</span><br />
<br />
*Virtually every city in the USA has an animal control place that kills their collected<br />
animals each week. Few, if any of these take the time, because of
funds, to try and get these animals adopted. If you have ANY time to
visit and take pictures, you can hook up with petfinders and post those
pictures and maybe save an animal from needless destruction! Think
about it, you can make a HUGE difference!<br />

UNDER THE HOOD 4/8/09</h4>
<strong style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 255);">REVERSE</strong>-<br />
This week it was all about pampering the pooch! We discussed the spa like resorts available for doggie (and kitty) day care or boarding. There are many of these ultra pampering resorts popping up all over the country, so no matter where you live or are visiting, your pet can have the best!. Your pet can have a regular room, which isn't all that "regular",&nbsp; or a sweet to relax in, complete with a brass bed and web cam for owner viewing, they even get a nightly tuck in service, complete with a snack and a scratch. <br />
Of course, as with human spas, you can pay for many "extras" to make your pets spa visit grrrrrrrrrreat!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Even without the little extras, the environment and amenities in these pet spa palaces, are nothing, if not glamorous. They have extra large sleeping areas, top of the line agility training equipment, park like settings, including plants and even waterfalls, not to mention piped in music, televisions, even windows with bird and fish viewing for the cat guests.<br />
Check you local yellow pages for a pet spa in your area the next time you want to pamper your pet! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
<br />
The No Speed Limit Highway was all about Bach Flower Remedies; Bach Flowers are used when a dog's mental
condition needs to be changed. Certain essences, prepared
homeopathically, can treat emotional problems. Bach Flower Remedies can
often be used when there is a high stress level within the dog's house
and she is having physical symptoms because of it. A large amount of
stress in your dog's life can result from car accidents, dog fights,
fires, etc. If it would stress you, it most likely will stress your dog.<br />
There are 38 Bach Flower remedies, each corresponding
to specific emotional states. If more than one remedy is needed, you
can combine up to four of them.<br />
Preparing Bach Flower Remedies;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Remedies come in small bottles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Take 2-3 drops from bottle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Put drops into 1-ounce dropper bottle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you have more than one remedy, take 2-3 drops from each<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Fill bottle with distilled water<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Shake bottle 108 times (a principle of homoeopathies)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 2-3x a day, put dropper full into dog's water, food, or directly into her mouth. <br />
<br />
Bach
Flowers are available at health food stores. To understand what each
remedy is used for, read the bottle or go to your local bookstore. A
number of books are written about Bach flowers. Luckily, there will not
be any negative effects if you pick the wrong remedy. If you select the
proper one(s), you are likely to get positive results.<br />

<br />
-Speaking of the new quarter. The first ever quarterly charities were
randomly picked from the eligible entries, and the winners are;Noah's
Ark, Second Chance Doxie and Andes. For the next three weeks we will
review one of these. Today we focused on&nbsp; 2nd Chance Doxie, which was chosen by CAR member, Mammamardee. Second chance doxie began in 2006,
and are a small rescue, only dealing with about 4-5 dogs at a time. They say that they just don't rehome dachshunds, they nurture them mind, bod
and soul. They provide all the care that the recured dachsunds need,
medically, behaviorally, and physically until they find a forever home
for them. They use foster homes with a low-dog count to help love these
dogs until their forever home can be found. Located in
Sandiego, they only provide for adoptions in that county so that they can
make sure all the humans are perfect for their rescued dogs. You can
read more about them on their website <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 255);">www.2ndchancedoxie.com</span><br />

** Petsmart operates a few different charitable programs, one of which
is the Relief wagon. This program can be activated for natural or
man-made disasters affecting 350 pets or more. Program volunteers and
supplies will be managed on site by the nonprofit organization, Healing
HEART Sanctuary. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">To

They are currently sending an Emergency Relief Waggin' trailer stocked
with at least 16 tons of much-needed pet food and supplies, as well as
a back-up trailer loaded with essential care items for pets and their
rescuers, to North Dakota in light of the recent flooding. Their
assistance was requested by officials w the North Dakota State Board of
Animal Health. Initial reports indicated that apporx. 1000 animals
could be affected by this disaster so they doubled the amount of
supplies that they typically would . They even have a third vehicle on
standby in case it is needed, which it may be because the<br />
the National Animal rescue group, who is also helping out in this area,
estimate that OVER 3000 animals may be in danger d/t the flooding.<br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets
in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort
in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters
house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie
on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them.
If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this
international project. The website features lists of patterns for
knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters
all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the
Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer
to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be
happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this
project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who
sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy
fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the
website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the
edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight
stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of
flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You
can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of
batting. Then you are recycling as well. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">If you'd like to know more, visit their website at http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs
(SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have
been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left
behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are
collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25
pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the
foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a
"backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then
there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter
(2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered
a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20.
Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house
large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of
donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they
also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already
being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for
any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone
can help them out with a home, please contact them. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Any
donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website
http://www.scampp.com/ or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite
D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509.</span> If donations are to be earmarked
for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue
effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of
all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful
watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in
need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting!

*The World Society for the protection&nbsp; of animals has sent out an
urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on
the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk
reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there
has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with
strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer
convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free'
status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected
outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not
attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health.
You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor,
asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies
prevention that will protect both animals and people<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">. If this moves you please visit http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826</span><br />
<br />
*Virtually every city in the USA has an animal control place that kills their collected<br />
animals each week. Few, if any of these take the time, because of
funds, to try and get these animals adopted. If you have ANY time to
visit and take pictures, you can hook up with petfinders and post those
pictures and maybe save an animal from needless destruction! Think
about it, you can make a HUGE difference!<br />

This week it was our pleasure to have the creator and founder of <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">Dogster.com</span>, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">Catster.com</span>, and<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"> Togethertag.com</span>, Top Dog, <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 153, 0);">Ted Rheingold</span> on the show with us. His online communities boast over 476,236 members, and these numbers are what make the Together Tag work so well! <br />
<br />
Together with the<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"> American Red Cross</span>, Mr. Rheingold has developed a comprehensive way to put the word out about a lost pet. For a one-time fee of $25.00, five of which is donated to the American Red Cross, you get a virtually indestructible tag with an individual bar-code. If/when your pet is lost, your bar-code, and the information behind it- complete with pictures of your pet, is broadcast throughout the virtual community AND to all of your local pet-related facilities. Anyone finding your pet can contact you through the extensive information that you provided when you applied for the bar-code number. You can update this information as often as you like, so no matter where you are for the weekend, you can be found! Once located, you can even communicate with the rescuer directly by email or phone!!!! <br />

The No Speed Limit Highway was all about the touch this week, the healing touch of Reiki that is.&nbsp; Giving a Reiki treatment involves the practitioner putting his or her hands lightly on or near the dog's body. Different hand positions are used, depending on the condition being treated. Often the dog will enter a state of deep relaxation or sleep. Dogs love Reiki. They seem intuitively to understand its power to heal. It certainly cannot hurt them, and you will know if it something that they like or that they dont!For more information on Reiki as well as other natural treatments, read <em><strong><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">Dr. Pitcairn’s Complete Guide To Natural Health for Dogs &amp; Cats</span></strong>,</em> written by Richard H.

They are committed to eliminating the suffering of potbellied pigs, in Florida, that are abandoned, abused, neglected or unwanted. They promote spaying and neutering, and provide a permanent home for these pigs in an open herd sanctuary, a natural environment Once the pigs quality of life is diminished, they are suffering in pain due to injury or old age, they have the Veterinarian humanely euthanize the animals. They encourage the public to&nbsp; visit and learn about potbellied pigs.<br />

** Petsmart operates a few different charitable programs, one of which is the Relief wagon. This program can be activated for natural or man-made disasters affecting 350 pets or more. Program volunteers and supplies will be managed on site by the nonprofit organization, Healing HEART Sanctuary. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">To Volunteer For the Emergency Relief Waggin' Program during a disaster, contact Laurel Ley with Healing HEART Sanctuary at laurelLey@AnimalReliefResource.org. </span><br />
They are currently sending an Emergency Relief Waggin' trailer stocked with at least 16 tons of much-needed pet food and supplies, as well as a back-up trailer loaded with essential care items for pets and their rescuers, to North Dakota in light of the recent flooding. Their assistance was requested by officials w the North Dakota State Board of Animal Health. Initial reports indicated that apporx. 1000 animals could be affected by this disaster so they doubled the amount of supplies that they typically would . They even have a third vehicle on standby in case it is needed, which it may be because the<br />
the National Animal rescue group, who is also helping out in this area, estimate that OVER 3000 animals may be in danger d/t the flooding.<br />
<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">You can help this group help the animals by visiting;http://www.cdprograms.org/com or you can call 866-988-9111 ext 104 or 888-986-4483 </span><br style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);" />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">If you'd like to know more, visit their website at http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time.

*The World Society for the protection&nbsp; of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">.

His online communities boast over 476,236 members, and these numbers are what make the Together Tag work so well! <br />
<br />
Together with the<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"> American Red Cross</span>, Mr. Rheingold has developed a comprehensive way to put the word out about a lost pet. For a one-time fee of $25.00, five of which is donated to the American Red Cross, you get a virtually indestructible tag with an individual bar-code. If/when your pet is lost, your bar-code, and the information behind it- complete with pictures of your pet, is broadcast throughout the virtual community AND to all of your local pet-related facilities. Anyone finding your pet can contact you through the extensive information that you provided when you applied for the bar-code number. You can update this information as often as you like, so no matter where you are for the weekend, you can be found! Once located, you can even communicate with the rescuer directly by email or phone!!!! <br />

The No Speed Limit Highway was all about the touch this week, the healing touch of Reiki that is.&nbsp; Giving a Reiki treatment involves the practitioner putting his or her hands lightly on or near the dog's body. Different hand positions are used, depending on the condition being treated. Often the dog will enter a state of deep relaxation or sleep. Dogs love Reiki. They seem intuitively to understand its power to heal. It certainly cannot hurt them, and you will know if it something that they like or that they dont!For more information on Reiki as well as other natural treatments, read <em><strong><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">Dr. Pitcairn’s Complete Guide To Natural Health for Dogs &amp; Cats</span></strong>,</em> written by Richard H.

** Petsmart operates a few different charitable programs, one of which is the Relief wagon. This program can be activated for natural or man-made disasters affecting 350 pets or more. Program volunteers and supplies will be managed on site by the nonprofit organization, Healing HEART Sanctuary. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">To Volunteer For the Emergency Relief Waggin' Program during a disaster, contact Laurel Ley with Healing HEART Sanctuary at laurelLey@AnimalReliefResource.org. </span><br />
They are currently sending an Emergency Relief Waggin' trailer stocked with at least 16 tons of much-needed pet food and supplies, as well as a back-up trailer loaded with essential care items for pets and their rescuers, to North Dakota in light of the recent flooding. Their assistance was requested by officials w the North Dakota State Board of Animal Health. Initial reports indicated that apporx. 1000 animals could be affected by this disaster so they doubled the amount of supplies that they typically would . They even have a third vehicle on standby in case it is needed, which it may be because the<br />
the National Animal rescue group, who is also helping out in this area, estimate that OVER 3000 animals may be in danger d/t the flooding.<br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">If you'd like to know more, visit their website at http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website http://www.scampp.com/ or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509.</span> If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />

This week we took a look at dogs in the big-house, prison that is. Sponsored by the National Greyhound Foundation, the 2nd Chance at Life program actually receives some funding from the Department of Homeland Security to partner inmates with retired greyhounds. While we know for certain that this partnership saves dogs that would otherwise be put down, it is also proving to save the humans that they are partnered with. Guest Beverly Sebastian, the executive director of the 2nd Chance at Life, reports nothing but good has come from this program. In light of the programs benefits, for both the humans and the dogs that participate, she has grown this prison/dog ministry from a one state program, to a [now] five state program, with plans on continuing to branch out nationally. From this group, another dog/human program is also growing. Purple Heart Dogs will soon be taking the prison trained dogs and, after giving them an additional month of specialized, therapeutic classes, will use them to visit/work in rehabilitation facilities with our Veterans. If you would like more information about the greyhounds, please visit;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.4greyhounds.org/prison/index.html&nbsp; To help by donating, or to sponsor a dog, please visit; http://giveasecondchance.com <br />

The No Speed Limit Highway was all about the herbs this week. Herbal tretaments for your dogs can be purchased in health food stores, but you need to consult your Veterinarian before beginning treatment. There are several good books on the subject too, so do your homework! Some examples of herbal treatments are;<br />
* Parsley tea for a vomiting dog<br />
* Eyebright (Euphrasia) can be used for eye inflammations. You can buy ready-made&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyebright solution or make a tea.<br />
* Herbal flea sprays.<br />
* Pill curing (a Chinese patent medicine), peppermint tea, catnip tea, and chamomile tea can be used to cure gastritis.<br />
* Pure yucca to help dogs' with hip displasia.<br />
* Akebia 14, a Chinese herbal formula, can be used to prevent bladder-stones.<br />
* Skullcap tea, goldenseal, and valerian are used to cure patients with distemper.<br />

*Sahara Rain, the up and coming Swiss Rock Band, has donated their first cd to CAR because they love animals too! Since their desire was to raise as much money as possible for our animal charities, we have decided to place this cd up for an auction. The minimum bid is $10.00. Anyone interested should submit the maximum amount that they wish to donate to CAR, (over and above the minimum bid) in an email, making sure to include contact information (real name, address, as well as email address for winning notification).<br />
The person who submits the highest donation amount will win the cd, not to mention that they will be helping the animals in a big way! The winner then will have three days to&nbsp; submit their donation to CARl. Failure to do so within the allotted time will result in the next highest bidder being named as the winning bidder. The bidding will begin on March 19, 2009 and end on April 9, 2009. The winner will be notified on April 10, 2009 and will be announced as soon as payment has been verified! ALL MONEY RECEIVED FROM THIS AUCTION WILL BE USED FOR ANIMAL CHARITY!<br />

**The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website<span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);"> http://www.scampp.com/</span> or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509. If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting! WooHoo Shannon! Way to oink it forward!<br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The World Society for the protection&nbsp; of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people. If this moves you please visit <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826</span><br />
<br />
*Virtually every city in the USA has an animal control place that kills their collected<br />
animals each week. Few, if any of these take the time, because of funds, to try and get these animals adopted. If you have ANY time to visit and take pictures, you can hook up with petfinders and post those pictures and maybe save an animal from needless destruction! Think about it, you can make a HUGE difference!<br />

This week we took a look at dogs in the big-house, prison that is. Sponsored by the National Greyhound Foundation, the 2nd Chance at Life program actually receives some funding from the Department of Homeland Security to partner inmates with retired greyhounds. While we know for certain that this partnership saves dogs that would otherwise be put down, it is also proving to save the humans that they are partnered with. Guest Beverly Sebastian, the executive director of the 2nd Chance at Life, reports nothing but good has come from this program. In light of the programs benefits, for both the humans and the dogs that participate, she has grown this prison/dog ministry from a one state program, to a [now] five state program, with plans on continuing to branch out nationally. From this group, another dog/human program is also growing. Purple Heart Dogs will soon be taking the prison trained dogs and, after giving them an additional month of specialized, therapeutic classes, will use them to visit/work in rehabilitation facilities with our Veterans. If you would like more information about the greyhounds, please visit;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.4greyhounds.org/prison/index.html&nbsp; To help by donating, or to sponsor a dog, please visit; http://giveasecondchance.com <br />

The No Speed Limit Highway was all about the herbs this week. Herbal tretaments for your dogs can be purchased in health food stores, but you need to consult your Veterinarian before beginning treatment. There are several good books on the subject too, so do your homework! Some examples of herbal treatments are;<br />
* Parsley tea for a vomiting dog<br />
* Eyebright (Euphrasia) can be used for eye inflammations. You can buy ready-made&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyebright solution or make a tea.<br />
* Herbal flea sprays.<br />
* Pill curing (a Chinese patent medicine), peppermint tea, catnip tea, and chamomile tea can be used to cure gastritis.<br />
* Pure yucca to help dogs' with hip displasia.<br />
* Akebia 14, a Chinese herbal formula, can be used to prevent bladder-stones.<br />
* Skullcap tea, goldenseal, and valerian are used to cure patients with distemper.<br />
<br />

*Sahara Rain, the up and coming Swiss Rock Band, has donated their first cd to CAR because they love animals too! Since their desire was to raise as much money as possible for our animal charities, we have decided to place this cd up for an auction. The minimum bid is $10.00. Anyone interested should submit the maximum amount that they wish to donate to CAR, (over and above the minimum bid) in an email, making sure to include contact information (real name, address, as well as email address for winning notification).<br />
The person who submits the highest donation amount will win the cd, not to mention that they will be helping the animals in a big way! The winner then will have three days to&nbsp; submit their donation to CARl. Failure to do so within the allotted time will result in the next highest bidder being named as the winning bidder. The bidding will begin on March 19, 2009 and end on April 9, 2009. The winner will be notified on April 10, 2009 and will be announced as soon as payment has been verified! ALL MONEY RECEIVED FROM THIS AUCTION WILL BE USED FOR ANIMAL CHARITY!<br />

**The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website<span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);"> http://www.scampp.com/</span> or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509. If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting! WooHoo Shannon! Way to oink it forward!<br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The World Society for the protection&nbsp; of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people. If this moves you please visit <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826</span><br />
<br />
*Virtually every city in the USA has an animal control place that kills their collected<br />
animals each week. Few, if any of these take the time, because of funds, to try and get these animals adopted. If you have ANY time to visit and take pictures, you can hook up with petfinders and post those pictures and maybe save an animal from needless destruction! Think about it, you can make a HUGE difference!<br />

This week we took a look at dogs in the big-house, prison that is. Sponsored by the National Greyhound Foundation, the 2nd Chance at Life program actually receives some funding from the Department of Homeland Security to partner inmates with retired greyhounds. While we know for certain that this partnership saves dogs that would otherwise be put down, it is also proving to save the humans that they are partnered with. Guest Beverly Sebastian, the executive director of the 2nd Chance at Life, reports nothing but good has come from this program. In light of the programs benefits, for both the humans and the dogs that participate, she has grown this prison/dog ministry from a one state program, to a [now] five state program, with plans on continuing to branch out nationally. From this group, another dog/human program is also growing. Purple Heart Dogs will soon be taking the prison trained dogs and, after giving them an additional month of specialized, therapeutic classes, will use them to visit/work in rehabilitation facilities with our Veterans. If you would like more information about the greyhounds, please visit;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.4greyhounds.org/prison/index.html&nbsp; To help by donating, or to sponsor a dog, please visit; http://giveasecondchance.com <br />

The No Speed Limit Highway was all about the herbs this week. Herbal tretaments for your dogs can be purchased in health food stores, but you need to consult your Veterinarian before beginning treatment. There are several good books on the subject too, so do your homework! Some examples of herbal treatments are;<br />
* Parsley tea for a vomiting dog<br />
* Eyebright (Euphrasia) can be used for eye inflammations. You can buy ready-made&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyebright solution or make a tea.<br />
* Herbal flea sprays.<br />
* Pill curing (a Chinese patent medicine), peppermint tea, catnip tea, and chamomile tea can be used to cure gastritis.<br />
* Pure yucca to help dogs' with hip displasia.<br />
* Akebia 14, a Chinese herbal formula, can be used to prevent bladder-stones.<br />
* Skullcap tea, goldenseal, and valerian are used to cure patients with distemper.<br />

**The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website<span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);"> http://www.scampp.com/</span> or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509. If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting! WooHoo Shannon! Way to oink it forward!<br />
<br />
**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up!<br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The World Society for the protection&nbsp; of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people. If this moves you please visit <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826</span><br />
<br />
*Virtually every city in the USA has an animal control place that kills their collected<br />
animals each week. Few, if any of these take the time, because of funds, to try and get these animals adopted. If you have ANY time to visit and take pictures, you can hook up with petfinders and post those pictures and maybe save an animal from needless destruction! Think about it, you can make a HUGE difference!<br />

*The World Society for the protection&nbsp; of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate. <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people. If this moves you please visit <span style="background-color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826</span><br />
<br />
*Virtually every city in the USA has an animal control place that kills their collected<br />
animals each week. Few, if any of these take the time, because of funds, to try and get these animals adopted. If you have ANY time to visit and take pictures, you can hook up with petfinders and post those pictures and maybe save an animal from needless destruction! Think about it, you can make a HUGE difference!<br />

This week we addressed the issue of feeding your dogs home-made dog food. Remember that if you choose to go this route, you need to know your dogs weight and calculate its nutritional needs before you plan the recipes. Dogs need 40% of their total calories from protein sources, 45% from carbohydrates,35% of which needs to come from cooked grains and the other 10% from vegetables and/or fruits, and the last 15% needs to come from a supplemental fat, aka oil source. Additionally, you may need to add salt and/or potassium chloride, a salt substitute, depending upon the meal ingredients, bone meal, mineral supplements, and multivitamins. The amounts of supplements needed will depend upon your dog's size/weight and ideal caloric intake. All dogs need some salt, but too much salt can cause brain swelling, just as too many vitamins and minerals can be toxic. So make sure that you do your homework and research the requirements for your dog's size! Once you have that down, be sure to divide by two and offer the daily needs in two sittings. there are many good books on this subject, so please research until you are comfortable. I will post a sample recipe at the end of this post so you can get a feel for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

**The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website <span style="background-color: rgb(102, 255, 153);">http://www.scampp.com/</span> or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509. If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting! WooHoo Shannon! Way to oink it forward! <br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up! <br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <span style="background-color: rgb(102, 255, 153);">http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*Virtually every city in the USA has an animal control place that kills their collected<br />
animals each week. Few, if any of these take the time, because of funds, to try and get these animals adopted. If you have ANY time to visit and take pictures, you can hook up with petfinders and post those pictures and maybe save an animal from needless destruction! Think about it, you can make a HUGE difference!<br />

This week we addressed the issue of feeding your dogs home-made dog food. Remember that if you choose to go this route, you need to know your dogs weight and calculate its nutritional needs before you plan the recipes. Dogs need 40% of their total calories from protein sources, 45% from carbohydrates,35% of which needs to come from cooked grains and the other 10% from vegetables and/or fruits, and the last 15% needs to come from a supplemental fat, aka oil source. Additionally, you may need to add salt and/or potassium chloride, a salt substitute, depending upon the meal ingredients, bone meal, mineral supplements, and multivitamins. The amounts of supplements needed will depend upon your dog's size/weight and ideal caloric intake. All dogs need some salt, but too much salt can cause brain swelling, just as too many vitamins and minerals can be toxic. So make sure that you do your homework and research the requirements for your dog's size! Once you have that down, be sure to divide by two and offer the daily needs in two sittings. there are many good books on this subject, so please research until you are comfortable. I will post a sample recipe at the end of this post so you can get a feel for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

**The Southern California association for miniature potbellied pigs (SCAMPP) has asked us to relay an urgent request for help.There have been several foreclosures in their area, where many pigs have been left behind. The number of homeless pigs now total about 100. They are collecting donations on behalf of the Apple Valley foreclosure (25 pigs) and the French Valley foreclosure (16 pigs). In addition to the foreclosures they also managed to rescue some abused pigs from a "backyard breeder" (20 pigs - ALL female, most pregnant). And then there are also pigs that they rescued from the Elsinore Animal Shelter (2 female pigs - both pregnant). Additionally they have just discovered a home where there are 50 pigs, and they are only zoned for 20. Unfortunately SCAMPP does not have the funds or the property to house large numbers of pigs such as these. They are in desperate need of donations to help with feed, veterinarian needs, housing needs and they also need help to find adoptive homes for these pigs. Some are already being temporarily fostered, but they cannot be kept at these places for any length of time. They have lots of baby piglets too, so if anyone can help them out with a home, please contact them. Any donations can be made via Paypal on the SCAMPP website <span style="background-color: rgb(102, 255, 153);">http://www.scampp.com/</span> or mailed to; SCAMPP, 8304 Limonite Ave, Suite D-Box 21, Riverside, CA 92509. If donations are to be earmarked for a specific group of pigs, please designate which particular rescue effort you wish your donation to be disburse to.Be assured that 100% of all donations received will go to these rescue efforts!!!<br />
<br />
In a related note, our own Pigatopia is donating 2 of her wonderful watercolor paintings to SCAMPP to help pay for the care of the pigs in need. Her paintings will be raffled off at SCAMPP's next meeting! WooHoo Shannon! Way to oink it forward! <br />

**Founded in 1996, The Snuggles Project is a wonderful way to help pets in shelters.&nbsp; Thousands of homeless pets have received a little comfort in the form of a Snuggle since this project began. Because shelters house their pets in wire cages, many pets have only newspaper to lie on. A Snuggle is a warm, cozy pet-sized blanket you can make for them. If you sew, knit or crochet, you can become a part of this international project. The website features lists of patterns for knitters, crocheters and people who sew. It also has links to shelters all over the world. You can find shelters near you that accept the Snuggles. If there is not a shelter close to you listed, simply offer to donate your snuggle to your shelter. i am sure that they will be happy to accept your donation, then you can tell them about this project and they can check into signing up! <br />
Don't worry, even if you aren't a crocheter, knitter or someone who sews, you can sew a simple Snuggle by hand. Just take a piece of heavy fleece material or fake fur and cut it in the sizes listed on the website. You can do a simple whip stitch or blanket stitch around the edges or just leave it without edging. If you can sew a simple straight stitch, you can make an even cozier Snuggle by putting two pieces of flannel or fleece together and including a layer of batting inside. You can even use old towels inside two pieces of material instead of batting. Then you are recycling as well. If you'd like to know more, visit their website at <span style="background-color: rgb(102, 255, 153);">http://www.snugglesproject.org.</span><br />

*The World Society for the protection&nbsp; of animals has sent out an urgent request for people to sign a petition to stop the authorities on the island of Bali, Indonesia, from killing dogs in a knee-jerk reaction to six suspected human rabies fatalities. The government there has begun culling dogs in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. So far they have killed over 1,000 dogs, many being poisoned with strychnine, which leaves the animals fully conscious while they suffer convulsions and eventually suffocate.&nbsp; <br />
As a tourist hot spot Bali cannot afford to lose its 'rabies-free' status. However, the Balinese government's response to this suspected outbreak is ineffective as well as inhumane - a dog cull does not attack the root cause of the disease and cannot safeguard human health. You are being asked to sign an online letter to the Balinese governor, asking him to end the cull and adopt a humane approach to rabies prevention that will protect both animals and people. If this moves you please visit<span style="background-color: rgb(102, 255, 153);"> http://e-activist.com/ea-campaign/clientcampaign.do?ea.client.id=24&amp;ea.campaign.id=2826 </span><br />

This week, with the help of our special guest Vernon Yates, of Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation in Florida,&nbsp; we concluded our two week episode on the illegal smuggling of animals.</span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;">
This is a huge problem world-wide, in the US alone it is reported that illegal
wildlife shipments generate six billion dollars annually. This makes it
second only to drugs in profitability!&nbsp; We MUST get involved and speak
out so that we can effect change! Up to 30% of ALL the illegal traffic,
about $4 billion worth,&nbsp; goes through LAX each year. This flow is
monitored by TRAFFIC USA, a division of the World Wildlife Fund and
includes both plants and animals. While there are 200 agricultural and
customs inspectors, the wildlife facility has only ten inspectors.&nbsp;
This is so bassakwards!&nbsp; We need to have this changed, and the only way
to do that is to ban together and speak out! <br />
<br />
We also learned that the case of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"><span style="border-collapse: separate; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Javier Cervantes, a man that opened his </span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;">home
(in Mexico) to stray animals, only to have his home broken into by several masked men who, wielding machetes,
wreaked carnage, killing 40 animals and badly injuring many of the 30
that lived, has been gaining notoriety. Many protesters have staged memorials and spread the word about this horrific event. If you have not yet signed the petition, please go there and read about this for yourself!&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/jalt2009/petition.html" target="_blank">www.petitiononline.com/<wbr></wbr>jalt2009/petition.html</a>&nbsp;

    dogs &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; and cats. They do not have the personel or the funds to list any of these animals &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on petfinder. If you live in this area and have a small amount of time, please &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go there &amp; take
    pictures and upload them to petfinders. Of course, if you can </li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adopt or foster an animal from there, please do that too! They kill animals every &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday.</li>

This week, with the help of our special guest Vernon Yates, of Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation in Florida,&nbsp; we concluded our two week episode on the illegal smuggling of animals.</span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;">
This is a huge problem world-wide, in the US alone it is reported that illegal
wildlife shipments generate six billion dollars annually. This makes it
second only to drugs in profitability!&nbsp; We MUST get involved and speak
out so that we can effect change! Up to 30% of ALL the illegal traffic,
about $4 billion worth,&nbsp; goes through LAX each year. This flow is
monitored by TRAFFIC USA, a division of the World Wildlife Fund and
includes both plants and animals. While there are 200 agricultural and
customs inspectors, the wildlife facility has only ten inspectors.&nbsp;
This is so bassakwards!&nbsp; We need to have this changed, and the only way
to do that is to ban together and speak out! <br />
<br />
We also learned that the case of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"><span style="border-collapse: separate; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Javier Cervantes, a man that opened his </span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;">home
(in Mexico) to stray animals, only to have his home broken into by several masked men who, wielding machetes,
wreaked carnage, killing 40 animals and badly injuring many of the 30
that lived, has been gaining notoriety. Many protesters have staged memorials and spread the word about this horrific event. If you have not yet signed the petition, please go there and read about this for yourself!&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/jalt2009/petition.html" target="_blank">www.petitiononline.com/<wbr></wbr>jalt2009/petition.html</a>&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 16px;">REVERSE-</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">
This week we began a two episode discussion on the illegal smuggling of animals.</span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"> This is a huge problem world-wide, in the US alone, it is reported that wildlife shipments generate six billion dollars annually. This makes it second only to drugs in profitability!&nbsp; We MUST get involved and speak out so that we can effect change! Up to 30% of ALL the illegal traffic, about $4 billion worth,&nbsp; goes through LAX each year. This flow is monitored by TRAFFIC USA, a division of the World Wildlife Fund and includes both plants and animals. While there are 200 agricultural and customs inspectors, the wildlife facility has only ten inspectors.&nbsp; This is so bassakwards!&nbsp; We need to have this changed, and the only way to do that is to ban together and speak out! <br />
<br />
We also learned of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"><span style="border-collapse: separate; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Javier Cervantes, a man that opened his </span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;">home (in Mexico) to stray animals. After receiving threats, and just as he was preparing to move his 70 or so animals to a piece of donated land, his home was broken into. Several masked men, wielding machetes, wreaked carnage, killing 40 animals and badly injuring many of the 30 that lived. <br />
Even though the sounds of crying and dying animals could be heard for blocks, the local police were not moved, and made comments about it "just being dogs"!. Needless to say,&nbsp; justice is not anticipated. <br />
We have been provided links to people that could make a difference. We strongly encourage&nbsp; you to write and express your moral outrage at their lack of concern and dedication to treating this crime as a crime!&nbsp; A mans' home was broken into.&nbsp; A neighbor who heard the commotion and came to try to stop them was beaten unconscious. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;">40 animals were slaughtered. Numerous others were injured. And, on top of everything else, Mr. Cerventes</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"> has lost his home since the police won't allow him back in. <br />
I know this is a foreign country where the animal population is out of control, but THIS WAS A CRIME, actually SEVERAL crimes,&nbsp; and this case deserves to be treated as such!! Please check out this link and sign the petition, <br />

<span style="font-size: 16px;">REVERSE-</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">
This week we began a two episode discussion on the illegal smuggling of animals.</span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"> This is a huge problem world-wide, in the US alone, it is reported that wildlife shipments generate six billion dollars annually. This makes it second only to drugs in profitability!&nbsp; We MUST get involved and speak out so that we can effect change! Up to 30% of ALL the illegal traffic, about $4 billion worth,&nbsp; goes through LAX each year. This flow is monitored by TRAFFIC USA, a division of the World Wildlife Fund and includes both plants and animals. While there are 200 agricultural and customs inspectors, the wildlife facility has only ten inspectors.&nbsp; This is so bassakwards!&nbsp; We need to have this changed, and the only way to do that is to ban together and speak out! <br />
<br />
We also learned of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"><span style="border-collapse: separate; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Javier Cervantes, a man that opened his </span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;">home (in Mexico) to stray animals. After receiving threats, and just as he was preparing to move his 70 or so animals to a piece of donated land, his home was broken into. Several masked men, wielding machetes, wreaked carnage, killing 40 animals and badly injuring many of the 30 that lived. <br />
Even though the sounds of crying and dying animals could be heard for blocks, the local police were not moved, and made comments about it "just being dogs"!. Needless to say,&nbsp; justice is not anticipated. <br />
We have been provided links to people that could make a difference. We strongly encourage&nbsp; you to write and express your moral outrage at their lack of concern and dedication to treating this crime as a crime!&nbsp; A mans' home was broken into.&nbsp; A neighbor who heard the commotion and came to try to stop them was beaten unconscious. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;">40 animals were slaughtered. Numerous others were injured. And, on top of everything else, Mr. Cerventes</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"> has lost his home since the police won't allow him back in. <br />
I know this is a foreign country where the animal population is out of control, but THIS WAS A CRIME, actually SEVERAL crimes,&nbsp; and this case deserves to be treated as such!! Please check out this link and sign the petition, <br />

Somehow we managed to go on though, largely because we had the great fortune to have Susi of </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">http://knobnots.com</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"> join us as our special guest. The shows topic was rare&nbsp; breeds, and Susi owns and shows one of the oldest rare breeds, and arguably the most interesting in looks, the Puli.&nbsp; These dogs have corded coats that reach the floor after about 6yrs of growing!&nbsp; <br />
Almost extinct at the start of World War II, the Puli has made a come back in numbers, and remains a quite interesting breed. It is highly intelligent, very agile, and very loyal to its family. Of course it can also be very head strong. Originally bred to herd and to keep company with the Shepherd, Pulik (plural of Puli), love to work and still need plenty of exercise.&nbsp; <br />
For more breed information, contact the National Puli Association. As the current information officer and group Secretary, Susi will be happy to provide you with any and all details about this unusual breed!<br />

We want to address the horrific problem of illegal smuggling of animals into the USA. This has become big business, and is very often tied into drug trafficking.

<div align="left"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REVERSE-</strong></span> This week we began the show by wishing Gena a speedy recovery, as she was ill. Somehow we managed to go on though, largely because we had the great fortune to have Susi of </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">http://knobnots.com</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 16px;"> join us as our special guest. The shows topic was rare&nbsp; breeds, and Susi owns and shows one of the oldest rare breeds, and arguably the most interesting in looks, the Puli.&nbsp; These dogs have corded coats that reach the floor after about 6yrs of growing!&nbsp; <br />
Almost extinct at the start of World War II, the Puli has made a come back in numbers, and remains a quite interesting breed. It is highly intelligent, very agile, and very loyal to its family. Of course it can also be very head strong. Originally bred to herd and to keep company with the Shepherd, Pulik (plural of Puli), love to work and still need plenty of exercise.&nbsp; <br />
For more breed information, contact the National Puli Association. As the current information officer and group Secretary, Susi will be happy to provide you with any and all details about this unusual breed!<br />

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DRIVE;</strong></span> Next weeks show is HUGE! So huge in fact, that we will be taking two weeks to discuss this topic in depth. We want to address the horrific problem of illegal smuggling of animals into the USA. This has become big business, and is very often tied into drug trafficking. So plan to hop into the car as we take a ride down the wild road of exotic animal importation. You will never forget this drive, I promise you!&nbsp; <br />

If your group needs help please visit http://creativeanimalrelief.org and click on the charitable request form. Once filled out, we will review your request and place it here, on our website, on our yahoo group page, or maybe even mention it on air! (</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">

Each week I will have the same segments with new information! We will review the last show, make announcements, and preview the coming show. If there is anything you want to see included that isn't currently here, please let me know! Now...on with Under the Hood for this week.<br />
<br />
Well we drove through our first show and now are headed to our second! In case you missed it, remember that you can always listen on podcast!<br />
<br />
REVERSE- <br />
2/4/09 We introduced our new weekly segments and we discussed alternative therapies for dogs. We had Dr. Kim Bloomer &amp; Dr. Jeanne Thomason of Animal Talk Naturally on air to speak to our subject after hearing the basics of holistic care. While we had one person express their opinion in the chat room, neither they, nor anyone else, called in to discuss. This is such a big topic, we may have to revisit it in the near future! <br />
<br />
PARK- <br />
We made an announcement that the CAR group needs a logo and is holding a contest for YOU to design one for us! It needs to be fun, crafty,creative, animal related, and speak to what we represent; a group of artistic types who raise funds for animal charity. If your logo is chosen by the directors as the winner, you will receive a $50 gift certificate to the CAR store, 2 weeks advertising on our radio show, 2 weeks advertising on our web site, 2 weeks advertising on this blog and 3 car points. You do NOT need to be a CAR member and you do not need to join CAR, but we HOPE that you will want to! Please submit your entries to the CAR website http://creativeanimalrelief.org&nbsp; The deadline is February 14!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *<span style="font-size: 11px;">We reserve the right to determine that no logo fits our needs, and in such case, the prizes will not be awarded. If chosen you will relinquish all rights to the design. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Do you have an announcement that relates to animal charities or an event that supports an animal charity? Let us know by filling out our charitable request form and we may announce it on our forum, blog, web site, or possibly even our radio show! </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">DRIVE- <br />
Next week we will be discussing grooming and traveling tip for your pets! We will have Adrian &amp; Boett from the </span></span><span style="font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">musical group Sahara Rain as our special guests! </span></span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sahararain.com/tmp/sahararain-songs.zip">http://www.sahararain.com/tmp/<wbr></wbr>sahararain-songs.zip</a><br />

Each week I will have the same segments with new information! We will review the last show, make announcements, and preview the coming show. If there is anything you want to see included that isn't currently here, please let me know! Now...on with Under the Hood for this week.<br />
<br />
Well we drove through our first show and now are headed to our second! In case you missed it, remember that you can always listen on podcast!<br />
<br />
REVERSE- <br />
2/4/09 We introduced our new weekly segments and we discussed alternative therapies for dogs. We had Dr. Kim Bloomer &amp; Dr. Jeanne Thomason of Animal Talk Naturally on air to speak to our subject after hearing the basics of holistic care. While we had one person express their opinion in the chat room, neither they, nor anyone else, called in to discuss. This is such a big topic, we may have to revisit it in the near future! <br />
<br />
PARK- <br />
We made an announcement that the CAR group needs a logo and is holding a contest for YOU to design one for us! It needs to be fun, crafty,creative, animal related, and speak to what we represent; a group of artistic types who raise funds for animal charity. If your logo is chosen by the directors as the winner, you will receive a $50 gift certificate to the CAR store, 2 weeks advertising on our radio show, 2 weeks advertising on our web site, 2 weeks advertising on this blog and 3 car points. You do NOT need to be a CAR member and you do not need to join CAR, but we HOPE that you will want to! Please submit your entries to the CAR website http://creativeanimalrelief.org&nbsp; The deadline is February 14!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *<span style="font-size: 11px;">We reserve the right to determine that no logo fits our needs, and in such case, the prizes will not be awarded. If chosen you will relinquish all rights to the design. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Do you have an announcement that relates to animal charities or an event that supports an animal charity? Let us know by filling out our charitable request form and we may announce it on our forum, blog, web site, or possibly even our radio show! </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;">DRIVE- <br />
Next week we will be discussing grooming and traveling tip for your pets! We will have Adrian &amp; Boett from the </span></span><span style="font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">musical group Sahara Rain as our special guests! </span></span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sahararain.com/tmp/sahararain-songs.zip">http://www.sahararain.com/tmp/<wbr></wbr>sahararain-songs.zip</a><br />

February is a few days away and the first Creative Animal Relief radio show will be airing this coming Wednesday at 7pm EST!&nbsp; The website http://www.creativeanimalrelief.org is up and running, and our membership is beginning to grow. We invite you to join us in utilizing our creative talents to provide donations for nonprofit animal charities all around the world!<br />
<br />
The C.A.R. radio show will still be hosted by Gena and myself (Tammy), but the format will be driving off in a new direction. We will feature a main topic each show, relevant to the artistic and/or animal realms.&nbsp; In addition, we will be featuring a few regular segments each show. There will be furry facts in the "Driving school" segments, charity highlights in our "Paw it forward" segments, alternative therapy news on the "No Speed Limit" highway, and news of bad people doing bad things will be reported in our "In the Dog House" segment. <br />
<br />
Each week we will also feature loyal animal lovers in a segment named the "Barking out Loud". These people will have their websites, blogs, or shops mentioned on air when they&nbsp;&nbsp; donate to CAR (these donations will be used to help obtain our own non-profit status and/or be donated to another nonprofit animal charity). We offer different donation levels,&nbsp; but all are very reasonable for the amount of exposure. So for a little dough, you can be on the go and help animals at the same time! Please check out our website for more detailed information!<br />
<br />
Now that you know a bit about what's to come, please join us each Wednesday evening at 7pm EST as we drive off into the world of pets. This coming week we will be discussing alternative therapies for pets, are these new and innovative or just something to get your money? <br />
Please plan to call us and weigh in with your opinion and/or experiences. We are especially interested to hear from those of you that have utilized a form of "alternative" therapy for your pet, such as an animal psychotherapists or pet masseur.&nbsp; Good or bad, on the side of yea or nea, we want to hear about these different methods and how your pet responded, so plan to call in or at least type it into the chat room!<br />
<br />
Looking forward to pawing it forward with you!<br />

Dec 22,2008</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/creativeanimalrelief/blog/2008/12/20/Its-a-Life-not-a-toy</link><description><![CDATA[As Christmas draws near we would like to remind you that pets do not remain small little fur balls forever. They require love, care and attention all year, not just Christmas morning. Please do not give a pet as a gift, they deserve more consideration. You need to know and understand ALL the requirements of any pet you may consider bringing into your home. <br />
A puppy may be a pound or two now, but in six months how large will that animal be? In a year, how large will it have grown? Is the breed that you are looking at extremely active? Is it a one person dog or more family oriented? You really should check into all these issues and more before you take an animal home. Know as much as you can about the animal type before you agree to add it as a member of your family, and know that that is exactly what you are doing, you are adding a member to your family! <br />
That being said, if you can provide a loving home for a needy animal, please adopt one! There are way too many animals that need forever homes!

Nov 25,2008</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/creativeanimalrelief/blog/2008/11/25/A-Circle-of-Giving-A-Way-to-Paw-it-Forward</link><description><![CDATA[<span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"> 11/25/08<br />

It is almost Christmas and giving is on the mind of most people. We, as artists and crafters, want you to consider the handmade movement when making your holiday purchases. Gifts that are handmade are special, unique, and high quality. You KNOW where they come from and there is almost always an interesting story behind a hand-crafted item. So please check out the handmade sites such as Etsy, Artfire, TrendyShoppes, TheArtisansShop, and Handmade. These are all dot com sites that host a variety of artists and types of crafts. Additionally, please check out Dog-OnWear.com and UniqueGardenEssences.com for unique dog related items and natural bath and body items from the hosts of this show! Shop handmade and stay out of the malls. Know that your gifts are proudly made in the USA!<br />
<br />
Wow, we had a very interesting show last night! Dr. Kim Bloomer, one of the hosts of the Animal Talk Naturally radio show called in to fill us all in on their upcoming Holiday Special. They are hosting a two hour show in December to raise funds for two very unique, very needy, and very worthy animal charities! Both non-profit groups utilize abused, rescued horses to provide therapy to in need youths. We were totally blown away by what these groups do, and especially by who they help. Animals helping people, helping animals, to help people. WOW, it is very cool to see how the circle goes!<br />
The way that they are planning to raise the funds for these two charities is very unique in itself! They are asking for people to donate money, in turn, they will receive a donated item from a business. The businesses that donate will recieve something (think cool advertising) in return for their donation. SOOOOOO, everyone will get something for giving something! They are calling this "a Season of Giving", I am calling it a "Circle of Giving"! No matter what you call it, it is a win/win situation!<br />
Horses cost a lot to care for and they offer a lot in the way of love of devotion. If one horse can help one child it is WORTH your effort!<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px;">The seasons have changed and there are changes on the way for us too! The EFA (Etsy for Animals) group is undergoing a few important changes. Mainly, the group will no longer be seeking 501c status. Therefore, there is no longer a need for the team store. The Etsyforanimals.etsy.com shop will be closing as of December 31, 2008. <br />
This means SALE to you, so go check it out! There are many items still available and they are all handmade, additionally, all the money recieved will be still be donated to the animal charity of the month! It is another win/win situation! You get a great item and an animal group gets funds they desperately need to feed and save animals! <br />
Don't worry, the EFA group will still be an Etsy team, they will still be helping animals, it is just that their donations will be made from the indivdual shops and artists.<br />
<br />
Now for the BIG news......(hear a big drum roll!)..........Beginning January 2, 2009 there will be a new group in town to help the animals! CAR is coming soon! Creative Animal Releif will be helping various animal charities. It will NOT be a group limited to Etsy and will NOT have an Etsy store front. Think saved fees! It will have its own website and Artists will still donate items to be sold and the funds will still go to animal charities, but there will be some major differences in how that is accomplished! CAR will be obtaining 501c status and will check out other non-profit animal groups to assist. CAR will also be saving back a protion of the websites donations to provide funds when natural disasters strike. Sooner or later one always does, and when they occur, many animal shelters and organizations suffer. These funds will be errmarked for only such occasions! <br />
There will be many oporational things to be ironed out during the next month and a half, so I am not going to list more details now, but keep an eye out because our CAR will be pulling in the driveway soon!!!!!!!! <br />
PS. This radio progam will also change its name to CAR to represent the new group.<br />

It is almost Christmas and giving is on the mind of most people. We, as artists and crafters, want you to consider the handmade movement when making your holiday purchases. Gifts that are handmade are special, unique, and high quality. You KNOW where they come from and there is almost always an interesting story behind a hand-crafted item. So please check out the handmade sites such as Etsy, Artfire, TrendyShoppes, TheArtisansShop, and Handmade. These are all dot com sites that host a variety of artists and types of crafts. Additionally, please check out Dog-OnWear.com and UniqueGardenEssences.com for unique dog related items and natural bath and body items from the hosts of this show! Shop handmade and stay out of the malls. Know that your gifts are proudly made in the USA!<br />
<br />
Wow, we had a very interesting show last night! Dr. Kim Bloomer, one of the hosts of the Animal Talk Naturally radio show called in to fill us all in on their upcoming Holiday Special. They are hosting a two hour show in December to raise funds for two very unique, very needy, and very worthy animal charities! Both non-profit groups utilize abused, rescued horses to provide therapy to in need youths. We were totally blown away by what these groups do, and especially by who they help. Animals helping people, helping animals, to help people. WOW, it is very cool to see how the circle goes!<br />
The way that they are planning to raise the funds for these two charities is very unique in itself! They are asking for people to donate money, in turn, they will receive a donated item from a business. The businesses that donate will recieve something (think cool advertising) in return for their donation. SOOOOOO, everyone will get something for giving something! They are calling this "a Season of Giving", I am calling it a "Circle of Giving"! No matter what you call it, it is a win/win situation!<br />
Horses cost a lot to care for and they offer a lot in the way of love of devotion. If one horse can help one child it is WORTH your effort!<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px;">The seasons have changed and there are changes on the way for us too! The EFA (Etsy for Animals) group is undergoing a few important changes. Mainly, the group will no longer be seeking 501c status. Therefore, there is no longer a need for the team store. The Etsyforanimals.etsy.com shop will be closing as of December 31, 2008. <br />
This means SALE to you, so go check it out! There are many items still available and they are all handmade, additionally, all the money recieved will be still be donated to the animal charity of the month! It is another win/win situation! You get a great item and an animal group gets funds they desperately need to feed and save animals! <br />
Don't worry, the EFA group will still be an Etsy team, they will still be helping animals, it is just that their donations will be made from the indivdual shops and artists.<br />
<br />
Now for the BIG news......(hear a big drum roll!)..........Beginning January 2, 2009 there will be a new group in town to help the animals! CAR is coming soon! Creative Animal Releif will be helping various animal charities. It will NOT be a group limited to Etsy and will NOT have an Etsy store front. Think saved fees! It will have its own website and Artists will still donate items to be sold and the funds will still go to animal charities, but there will be some major differences in how that is accomplished! CAR will be obtaining 501c status and will check out other non-profit animal groups to assist. CAR will also be saving back a protion of the websites donations to provide funds when natural disasters strike. Sooner or later one always does, and when they occur, many animal shelters and organizations suffer. These funds will be errmarked for only such occasions! <br />
There will be many oporational things to be ironed out during the next month and a half, so I am not going to list more details now, but keep an eye out because our CAR will be pulling in the driveway soon!!!!!!!! <br />
PS. This radio progam will also change its name to CAR to represent the new group.<br />

Our highlighted EFA member was KoboH (which means a crafters' or artists'&nbsp; atelier or studio in Japanese. Hiromi, the shops owner and artist does felted work and other creations from recycled fabrics and yarns, as well as alpaca and sheep fibers which she buys from local farms. She uses sustainable materials as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Hiromi moved to North Bend, Washington, a beautiful little town in the Snoqualmie Valley, in 1999, but she was born and raised in Japan, in the Mt. Fugii area. Before coming to the states, Hiromi learned about crafting from her Mother and Grandmother. Although she has been sewing and creating in various medians all of her life, she began felting just a few years ago. Her bowls and other items are so lovely, you would never know that she just taught herself this art form! You can check out her beautiful handiwork at <a class="linkification-ext" href="http://koboh.etsy.com" title="Linkification: http://koboh.etsy.com">http://koboh.etsy.com</a><br />
<br />
Certainly the products in the KoboH shop are awesome, but one of the things we like the best is the fact that She donates a portion of her shop sales to the Snow Leopard Trust in Seattle, Washington, which protects the endangered Snow Leopard,&nbsp; and the community where the cats lives. She also donates to the Rolling Dog Ranch Animal Sanctuary in Montana, which rescues and shelters disabled animals. Additionally, she donates to Kiva, the world's first micro-lending platform which helps entrepreneurs in the developing world.<br />

Our highlighted EFA member was KoboH (which means a crafters' or artists'&nbsp; atelier or studio in Japanese. Hiromi, the shops owner and artist does felted work and other creations from recycled fabrics and yarns, as well as alpaca and sheep fibers which she buys from local farms. She uses sustainable materials as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Hiromi moved to North Bend, Washington, a beautiful little town in the Snoqualmie Valley, in 1999, but she was born and raised in Japan, in the Mt. Fugii area. Before coming to the states, Hiromi learned about crafting from her Mother and Grandmother. Although she has been sewing and creating in various medians all of her life, she began felting just a few years ago. Her bowls and other items are so lovely, you would never know that she just taught herself this art form! You can check out her beautiful handiwork at <a class="linkification-ext" href="http://koboh.etsy.com" title="Linkification: http://koboh.etsy.com">http://koboh.etsy.com</a><br />
<br />
Certainly the products in the KoboH shop are awesome, but one of the things we like the best is the fact that She donates a portion of her shop sales to the Snow Leopard Trust in Seattle, Washington, which protects the endangered Snow Leopard,&nbsp; and the community where the cats lives. She also donates to the Rolling Dog Ranch Animal Sanctuary in Montana, which rescues and shelters disabled animals. Additionally, she donates to Kiva, the world's first micro-lending platform which helps entrepreneurs in the developing world.<br />

A
very SPECIAL perk of being an EFA member is the newly instigated
Highlighted shop segment. Each week Gena and I will be seeking out a
store and owner to highlight. We will not take any submissions for this
feature spot, it will be an EFA member that we pick at random and
discuss on the air in depth. It will be a surprise each week! The shop
owner will be invited to call into the show and promote his/her shop
and animal interests themselves, but they can just answer our questions
and have Gena and I do all the talking if that is what they choose! In
other words, if ya are a big chicken it is okay! Lord knows that Gena
and I talk enough for all of us! lol. This is just our way of giving
back to the EFA group cuz we love all those that love the animals!<br />

02,2008</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/creativeanimalrelief/blog/2008/10/02/EFA-Artists-Helping-Animals-blogtalk-radio-is-underway</link><description><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: 18px;">So it is already October, can you believe it? The Highland County Humane Society Animal Shelter, <a title="Linkification: http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/OH566.html" href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/OH566.html" class="linkification-ext">http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/OH566.html</a> , is no longer the charity of the month, but they are still one of the double whammy projects,&nbsp; so please continue to send cage cozies and blankets to them and to Pittie Love Rescue, <a title="Linkification: http://pittieloverescue.com/" href="http://pittieloverescue.com/" class="linkification-ext">http://pittieloverescue.com/</a> , the other wham in the double whammy project! For more on the double whammy projects you can look on the EFA web site at <a title="Linkification: http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org/index.php/other-projects/117-fall-2008/318-efa-fall-2008-project" href="http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org/index.php/other-projects/117-fall-2008/318-efa-fall-2008-project" class="linkification-ext">http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org/index.php/other-projects/117-fall-2008/318-efa-fall-2008-project</a> .&nbsp; <br />
Meanwhile, our EFA&nbsp; charity of the month donations will now be going to the Whiskerville Animal&nbsp; Shelter. For more about this wonderful charity please see&nbsp; <a title="Linkification: http://www.whiskerville.org" href="http://www.whiskerville.org" class="linkification-ext">http://www.whiskerville.org</a>.<br />
<br />
The EFA has over 600 members and just gained 15 more! If you are not an EFA, Etsy for Animals member, please think about joining our team! You can read more about the EFA team on the Etsy team page, or you can visit our web site at <a title="Linkification: http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org" href="http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org" class="linkification-ext">http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org</a> ! The EFA team has applied for charity status and is well on it's way to becoming a non-profit organization!! Yea EFA members!!!! If you want to be a part of this great team, just send a convo to MVegan5 with your information and she will get you signed up!<br />
<br />
A very SPECIAL perk of being an EFA member is the newly instigated Highlighted shop segment. Each week Gena and I will be seeking out a store and owner to highlight. We will not take any submissions for this feature spot, it will be an EFA member that we pick at random and discuss on the air in depth. It will be a surprise each week! The shop owner will be invited to call into the show and promote his/her shop and animal interests themselves, but they can just answer our questions and have Gena and I do all the talking if that is what they choose! In other words, if ya are a big chicken it is okay! Lord knows that Gena and I talk enough for all of us! lol. This is just our way of giving back to the EFA group cuz we love all those that love the animals!<br />
<br />
Each month the EFA team posts a challenge that members can participate in. The winner of the challenge gets bragging rights and some great prizes donated by other members. Unique Treat Dog Bones, aka me!, won the September challenge, so I am now bragging about my EFA Birthday Munchin Muffin!&nbsp; I received an awesome tote bag with my shops (all 3 of them) banners on them, the EFA banner and some other EFA member banners on them, made and donated by Midnightrabbits !<br />
She is one talented EFA member that donates a ton of items, so THANK YOU seems so little to say!<br />
Anywho, the team challenge this month is Cats. So make something with a cat on it and enter for your chance to win a prize and some bragging rights! Check out <a title="Linkification: http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org/index.php/monthly-challenge" href="http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org/index.php/monthly-challenge" class="linkification-ext">http://efaartistshelpinganimals.org/index.php/monthly-challenge</a> for more info on the challenge!<br />
<br />
Please remember to check out our good friend Rod on the BlockheadRod show M,Tu,Th, and Fridays at 1pm and Wed. nights at 8pm each week. He offers some excellent advise for small business promotion and some fun interviews with featured artists! <a title="Linkification: http://blogtalkradio.com/blockheadrod" href="http://blogtalkradio.com/blockheadrod" class="linkification-ext">http://blogtalkradio.com/blockheadrod</a><br />
